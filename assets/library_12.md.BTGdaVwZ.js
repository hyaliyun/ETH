The small structure is now covered by the much larger structure built during the construction of the double track. railway bridge in Switzerland still in use) and continues for about 2 kilometres to the west along the Aare and then reaches Brugg AG railway station. The line then largely follows the course of the Aare to Aarau station. There are no large engineering structures apart from the Reuss Bridge. In Turgi, a line branches off to Koblenz, running north through the lower Aare valley. In Brugg, the B√∂zberg Railway branches off to the northwest to Basel and the Aargau Southern Railway branches off to the south towards Arth-Goldau, the Gotthard and Italy. In Wildegg, the Seetal Railway formerly branched off to the south towards Lenzburg, but operations on this part of the line were closed in 1984. The line connects with the Heitersberg Railway from Lenzburg in Rupperswil. The Aarau‚ÄìSuhr railway of the former Swiss National Railway branched off shortly before Aarau; this was closed at the end of 2004 and was subsequently dismantled to enable the relocation of the Suhrental Railway.  History The first Swiss railway line, the Z√ºrich‚ÄìBaden railway (known as the Spanisch- Br√∂tli-Bahn) was opened by the Swiss Northern Railway on 9 August 1847. It was planned to continue the line via Turgi, through the lower Aare valley to Koblenz and along the Rhine to Basel. However, this initially failed due to financial difficulties. In 1850, a national council commission with the help of the English railway engineer Robert Stephenson recommended, among other things, that the connection between Zurich and Basel should not run via Koblenz, but instead via Olten. Therefore, the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn) planned the continuation from Baden along the Limmat to Turgi, then along the Aare to Aarau. The Baden‚ÄìBrugg section was opened on 30 September 1856 and the extension to Aarau was opened on 15 May 1858. The line was initially completely single-track, as was the Spanisch- Br√∂tli-Bahn. Doubing of the Z√ºrich‚ÄìTurgi line was completed in 1861 and it was extended to Aarau in 1862. The electrification with the usual Swiss Federal Railway (SBB) system of 15 kV 16 2/3 Hz was completed on 21 January 1925\\\\. Until the nationalisation of the large private railway companies to form the SBB, the Northeastern Railway was responsible for the operation of the line. For more than 100 years‚Äîuntil the opening of the Heitersberg Railway in 1975‚Äîthis was the main east-west transversal of the Swiss railway network. However, the B√∂zberg Railway was opened in 1875, which allowed a shorter connection between Zurich and Basel than the Aarau‚ÄìOlten‚ÄìHauenstein line. The originally planned line between Z√ºrich and Basel via Koblenz was also built: it was opened between Turgi and Koblenz in 1859 and extended via Laufenburg to Basel in 1892.

The building fronts 505 Wilson Street, opposite Shepherds Lane, Eveleigh. It was built in 1887. It is also known as Eveleigh Chief Mechanical Engineers office and movable relics and Sydney Technology Park. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Chief Mechanical Engineers Office was constructed in as part of the expansion of the Eveleigh Workshops. The building was extended to the east in c.1900, almost doubling in size. A small extension was carried out to the southern side .W&P;, 2008, p38 When John Whitton first conceived the idea of the Eveleigh Railway Workshops, they were to undertake the construction of the infrastructure of the railways including the safe working systems and some of the perway systems. However, their main tasks were the maintenance and repair of locomotives and railway stock and the manufacture of rolling stock such as wagons and passenger carriages. At the time there were no other facilities in NSW for the construction of locomotives. The workshops were set up on both the north and the south sides of the main western and southern railway lines, which led to a duplication of some workshop functions, but the really heavy work such as forging and casting of ferrous and non-ferrous metal, was to be carried out on the locomotive side. When the workshops were established most of the rolling stock had a wooden chassis, so the separation of services was not a major impediment to production. The site for the Eveleigh railway yards was chosen in 1875, resumed in 1878 and the compensation price settled in 1880. Approximately A‚Ç§100,000 was paid for of land. Clearance began two years later. Much work went into the design and construction of the buildings because of the sandy nature of the soil. In the meantime, Eveleigh Station had been opened in 1878. In 1906 it was renamed Redfern Station. The former Redfern Station was renamed Sydney Terminal (Central). The Engine Running Shed, now demolished, was the first building completed. Cowdery was criticised for the extravagance of this building. It comprised three segmental arched bays, each covering seven \\"roads\\" without intervening columns. George Fishburn was awarded the contract for bays 1-4 of the Locomotive Workshops in 1884 and work was commenced soon after. They were officially opened in 1887. Workshops 5-15 were opened later in the year. This initial building phase also included the construction of bays 16-25 of the Carriage Sheds, the Paint Shop, a General Store and various smaller buildings and the associated turntables, traversers and rail lines. Development continued into the 1890s. The workshops were open every day of the week until 1892 when union negotiations led to the workshops being closed on Saturdays. The residential development of the area proceeded in the 1870s and 1880s around the railway workshop and was stimulated by the need for housing generated by the workshops. The names of many early settlers are continued in the street names in the area, including Eveleigh, and many of the property boundaries and former watercourses are reflected in street patterns. At the time of the development of the railway workshops, Darlington School was also built, as were other municipal buildings since demolished for the university. For some time Eveleigh had its own gas works which were located near MacDonaldtown Station. However, in 1901 with the establishment of Ultimo Power Station which belonged to the Rail and Tramway Department, electric power was made available to the workshops. Shortly after work commenced on the conversion of the rope-driven cranes to electric motor drives. Work also commenced on the replacement of the steam engines at the south end of the workshops by powerful electric motors. This, however, was not completed until 1914. In 1907 the Commissioners for Railways decided to begin the manufacture of new locomotives at Eveleigh and the New Locomotive Shop was designed and constructed for this purpose. A Public Works Annual Report in 1915 concluded that the Eveleigh Works were too congested and recommended the establishment of a new locomotive and repairing works. Adding to this situation, strained conditions led to eight strikes at Eveleigh between July 1915 and July 1917. In 1916 James Fraser, Acting Chief Commissioner, addressed workers at Eveleigh on the introduction of the Taylor card system. The introduction of this system on 2 August 1917 led to an 82-day general strike. It began when 1100 men struck at Randwick Tramway Depot and 3000 at Eveleigh. Volunteers kept trains running including boys from Newington and Shore independent schools at Eveleigh. This all took place during the World War I which brought worse conditions and declining wages. The rail yards continued to develop. Additional land was resumed to the south-west and 230 houses were demolished to allow for the construction of the Alexandria Goods Yard sometime around 1917. During 1925 the manufacture of new locomotives ceased. As a result of World War II, bays 5-6 were cleared of machinery in 1940 and plans drawn up for the installation of equipment supplied by the Department of Defence for the manufacture of 25lb field gun-shells. A mezzanine floor was added to Bay 5 in 1941 and the machinery for shell manufacture installed by February. Bay 8 was altered for an ammunitions annex. By 1943 Bay 8 had been abandoned by the Department of Defence as it had organised its own factories. Production of the shells ceased in 1945 and the construction of new locomotives was reintroduced. This post-war locomotive manufacturing lasted until 1952 when Eveleigh once again became a repair and maintenance facility. The decision to abandon steam locomotives in 1963 meant that Eveleigh, which was dedicated to steam locomotive maintenance and repair, entered its final phase. The yards continued to grow and expand, and functions were continually changing. In later years workshops at Chullora in 1937 and later Clyde took over aspects of work formerly performed at Eveleigh and functions were rearranged accordingly. Re-organisation and attempts at modernisation in the 1970s came too late. Too much of the machinery was suited only to the steam locomotive era. Buildings containing old equipment, machinery which had become progressively inappropriate to a modern transport era, and a changing work culture, has seen the yards decline gradually in the late 20th century until its closure in 1988. After closure, bays 5-15 were used by Paddy's Markets while other buildings on the site were demolished over an extended period. These included the Pattern Shed, Foundry, Smith's Shops and the Wheelpress Shop. In 1991 the NSW Government announced the creation of a technology park at Eveleigh in association with the University of NSW, the University of Sydney and the University of Technology Sydney. Decontamination works were carried out to cleared areas of the site progressively. In 1994 Paddy's Markets returned to Haymarket. City West Development Corporation took ownership of the Locomotive Workshops, bays 1-15, in addition to the New Locomotive Shed and the Manager's Office. Today the functions formerly carried out at Eveleigh are no longer carried out by government enterprises or no longer carried out in Australia.State Projects 1995:19-22, 27-33, 43-51 Although it has stood empty for a decade, the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office is to undergo specialist heritage restoration as part of a key heritage project, the Central to Eveleigh Urban Transformation and Transport program. Works will see the building be made secure, with external restoration of the balcony, paintwork, windows, latticework and connection to utilities. The project is expected to be completed by mid-2017, in the meantime the site will be enclosed with safety mesh and scaffolding.Mitchell, 2016, 5  Description  Garden Once famous for its extensive and elaborate grounds, these have been neglected and comprise chiefly now of open space, unkept grass and a row of mature, formerly-pollarded London or hybrid plane trees (Platanus x hybrida) lining Wilson Street, Redfern. An interpretive sign adjacent to the main pedestrian stairway entrance to Carriage Works, to the west, has a copy of a photograph of the elaborate Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office gardens at their peak.Stuart Read, pers.comm. Exterior The CME's office is a large two-storey building constructed of brick. Externally, the building is almost unaltered since the 1920s. It includes the original 1887, 1900 and 1920 stages, all of which stylistically harmonise to create one overall composition. There is a central entry portico with a pointed arch pediment with the letters \\"NSWGR\\" above the doorway. The roof is hipped and clad in corrugated iron with brick corbelled chimneys. The eaves feature a dentilled cornice. The two-storey bullnose verandah runs the length of the building with cast iron columns and decorative iron brackets and balustrade. The front door features an arched fanlight. The ground floor features timber double-hung sash windows (mostly boarded up). The first floor features timber French doors. A modern steel picket fence on concrete plinth fronts on to Wilson St. There are two stone posts supporting which appear original and support a modern iron picket gate. A number of mature trees are located in the front garden along Wilson Street. Interior Internally the building has been largely altered with later office partitioning and modern ceilings. However, a number of original features remain including the central timber staircase, marble mantelpieces, decorative plaster cornices and archways, tiled bathrooms, tessellated tiles to entry and bathrooms, timber panelled doors, \\"mini-orb\\" and \\"lath and plaster\\" ceilings. Moveable items Moveable items include a toilet bowl with counterweight seat, (AA24); a wall mirror timber frame, 0.6/1.0, (AM06); and a timber plan cabinet, 6 draws, 1.5/0.9/0.9, (PA08).  Condition  As at 4 September 2013, the exterior was moderate to poor condition; and the interior was poor to very poor condition.  Modifications and dates  *1900-1920 - Additions  Heritage listing  As at 4 September 2013, the building is a very fine late Victorian railways office on a scale above all other such structures in the State. The building reflects the importance of the railway engineers in the development of the State and its closeness to the Eveleigh workshops (mainly under the control of the Mechanical Branch) indicates the confidence in railway construction. The building is in a style not often seen in Sydney and is a rare survivor. More often this form of building is in evidence in the country where the pressure of development is less. It is an important element in the town and streetscape of Wilson St, Redfern, particularly its close proximity to the railway workshops. Eveleigh Chief Mechanical Engineers office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Chief Mechanical Engineers Building, is perhaps the grandest building of the workshops group and provides a fine example of a late Victorian railway office building. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.

He won both of his races as a two-year-old in 2007 and took the Prix de Fontainebleau on his first run of 2008. After running poorly in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains he recorded Group 1 wins Prix Jean Prat and Prix Jacques Le Marois. On his only subsequent start he finished fourth in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He has had some success as a breeding stallion. Background Tamayuz is a chestnut horse with a small white star bred in England by his owner, Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Estate Company. The colt was sent to France where he was trained Freddy Head. He was ridden in all but one of his races by Davy Bonilla. He was one of best horses sired by Hamdan Al Maktoum's stallion Nayef, a top-class middle-distance horse whose wins included the Champion Stakes, Sheema Classic, International Stakes and Prince of Wales's Stakes. Tamayuz's dam Al Ishq showed modest racing ability, winning one race from four starts in France. As a daughter of Allez les Trois she was a half-sister to Anabaa Blue and a granddaughter of the great British broodmare Allegretta, meaning that she was closely related to Urban Sea, King's Best, Galileo and Sea the Stars. Racing career 2007: two-year- old season On 9 September at Longchamp Racecourse Tamayuz was ridden by Thierry Jarnet when he made his racecourse debut in a race for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres. Starting at odds of 6/1 he finished strongly and won by a short neck from Prospect Wells, a horse who went on to win the Prix Greffulhe. In the Prix des Aigles over the same distance at Chantilly Racecourse a month later the colt was ridden for the first time by Bonilla and started favourite against six opponents. He took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths from the Pascal Bary-trained Ransome Hope. 2008: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three-year-old Tamayuz was stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Prix de Fontainebleau over 1600 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp on 13 April. After turning into the straight in fourth place he was switched to the outside, took the lead 100 metres from the finish and won by a head from the 30/1 outsider Murcielago. In the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over the same course and distance on 11 May the colt was restrained at the rear of the field before making steady progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and came home ninth of the nineteen runners behind Falco. On 13 July at Chantilly Tamayuz started a 14/1 outsider for the Prix Jean Prat over 1600 metres. The British-trained Raven's Pass started favourite while the other fourteen runners included Falco, Rio de la Plata (Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re), Winker Watson (July Stakes), Arcadia's Angle (Prix Paul de Moussac), Murcielago, Trincot (Prix de Guiche) and Kandahar Run (Newmarket Stakes). Bonilla positioned the colt behind the pacemakers before sending him into the lead 400 metres from the finish. Tamayuz ran on under pressure to win by one and a half lengths from Raven's Pass with Rio de la Plata half a length back in third. Tamayuz was matched against older horses for the first time in the Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 17 August and was made the 11/8 favourite. The best fancied of his seven opponents were Sageburg (Prix d'Ispahan), Natagora, Major Cadeaux (Sandown Mile) and Racinger (Prix du Muguet). After tracking the leader Racinger, Tamayuz went to the front 400 metres out and won by two and a half lengths from Natagora. Freddy Head said \\"That was great. Everything went to plan. He's a real champion\\". For his final racecourse appearance, Tamayuz was sent to England to contest the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 27 September. Starting the 9/4 second favourite he briefly took the lead in the straight but was soon overtaken and came home fourth of the seven runner behind Raven's Pass, Henrythenavigator and Sabana Perdida. In the 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings Tamayuz was given a rating of 124, making him the thirteenth-best racehorse in the world. Stud career Tamayuz was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. By 2018 he was standing at the Derrinstown Stud in Ireland at a fee of ‚Ç¨12,500. His offspring have included Precieuse (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), G Force (Haydock Sprint Cup), Blond Me (E. P. Taylor Stakes), Mustashry (Joel Stakes, Lockinge Stakes), Desert Skyline (Doncaster Cup) and Sir Prancealot (Flying Childers Stakes).

It is also known as Eveleigh Locomotive Workshops machinery. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Redfern's natural landscape was defined by sand hills and swamps. The Carrahdigang, more widely known as the Cadigal people, valued the area for its abundant supply of food. The name Redfern originates from an early land grant to William Redfern in 1817. It was previously known as Roberts Farm and Boxley's Swamp.Murray, 2009, 5 William Redfern (1774?-1833) was a surgeon's mate in the Royal Navy and was aboard HMS Standard when its crew took part in the revolt in 1797 known as the Mutiny of the Nore. Because he had advised the men to be more united, he was included among leaders who were court-martialled. Although sentenced to death, he was reprieved because of his youth and in 1801 arrived in Sydney as a convict. He served on Norfolk Island as an assistant surgeon. In 1803 he was pardoned, but remained on the island until 1808, when he returned to Sydney and was appointed assistant surgeon after being examined in medicine and surgery by Surgeons Jamison, Harris and Bohan. In 1816 he took charge of the new Sydney Hospital, but maintained a private practice. In 1814 he reported on conditions on convict transport ships and his recommendation that all have a surgeon on board whose duties were to superintend the health of convicts was put into practice. He resigned from Government service in 1819 when not appointed to succeed D'Arcy Wentworth as principal surgeon. Despite his valuable service, many were contemptuous of him as he was an emancipist, although he had the friendship of Governor Macquarie. In 1818 Redfern received a grant of in Airds (in today's Campbelltown area) and later received more land in the area and by his death in 1823 he owned, by grant and purchase, over in NSW. In 1817 he had been granted in the area of the present suburb of Redfern. The boundaries were approximately the present-day Cleveland, Regent, Redfern and Elizabeth Streets. The commodious home Redfern built on his land was considered to be a country house, surrounded by flower and kitchen gardens. His neighbours were John Baptist (at the Darling Nursery in today's Chippendale) and Captain Cleveland, an officer of the 73rd regiment, remembered by today's street of that name, and before its demolition, by Cleveland House, his home.Pollen & Healy, 1988, 219-220 The passing of the Sydney Slaughterhouses Act in 1849 brought other businesses to the district. This act banned abattoirs and noxious trades from the city. Tanners, wool scourers and wool-washers, fellmongers, boiling down works and abattoirs had ten years to move their businesses outside city boundaries. Many of the trades moved to Redfern and Waterloo - attracted by the water. The sand hills still existed but by the late 1850s Redfern was a flourishing suburb housing 6500 people. The Municipalities Act of 1858 gave districts the option of municipal incorporation. Public meetings were held and after a flurry of petitions Redfern Municipality was proclaimed on August 11, 1859, the fourth in Sydney to be formed under the Act. Redfern Town Hall opened in 1870 and the Albert Cricket Ground in 1864. Redfern Post Office came in 1882. The majority of houses in Redfern in the 1850s were of timber. From the 1850s market gardeners congregated in Alexandria south of McEvoy Street, around Shea's Creek and Bourke Road. When Sydney's original railway terminus was built in the Cleveland Paddocks, which extended from Devonshire and Cleveland Streets to Chippendale, the station's name was chosen to honour William Redfern. The station was built of iron and the first stationmaster was a Mr Fielding. In 1874 the station was replaced by a brick and stone structure, covering two platforms. At that time the present Redfern station was known as Eveleigh, after a lovely old home standing on the western side of the railway line. When Central Station was built, on the site of the Devonshire Street cemetery, the name of Eveleigh Station was changed to Redfern. The name Eveleigh was retained for the huge railway workshops, just beyond the station, on the site of the original Hutchinson Estate. All that remains of the Cleveland Paddocks is Prince Alfred Park, where the exhibition building was erected in 1870 for an inter-colonial exhibition opened by Governor Belmore, after whom Belmore Park was named, on 30 August 1870. Redfern was the scene of the maiden trip of the first double-decker tram in 1879. It travelled between the old Redfern station to the corner of Hunter and Elizabeth Streets in the city.Pollen & Healy, 1988, 220 In 1885 the Sands Sydney Directory listed 54 market gardens. While many were worked by European-Australians, by the 1870s Chinese market gardeners had acquired leases in the district and a decade later were dominating the trade. The Eveleigh complex in 1886 became one of the largest employers in the state. Redfern was an industrial working class suburb by the end of the 19th century. Reschs brewery and other factories attracted migrants. The Syrian/Lebanese community began settling around Redfern and Surry Hills by the 1880s. Redfern at the end of the 19th century was characterised by its many gardens, but at the turn of the century industry was taking over the area. At that time, many businessmen in the area were from Syria, such as George Dan, who established his business in 1890; Stanton and Aziz Melick, in 1888; and Anthony & Simon Coorey, in the 1890s. Like other inner-city suburbs, the area still has a high migrant population, including many now from Lebanon, as well as a large Aboriginal population. There is still industry in the area among the high density residential occupation. In the 1940s 73 per cent of all industrial activity in Sydney was concentrated within a radius of from Redfern Station. Many of its services have disappeared or been substantially downgraded over the last couple of decades, even though Redfern is still a densely populated inner city suburb.

Phillips played minor counties cricket for Monmouthshire between the early 1900s and the early 1920s. He also made appearances at first-class level for Marylebone Cricket Club, Free Foresters Cricket Club and South Wales. Phillips served in the militia battalion of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment from 1901, reaching the rank of lieutenant before resigning his commission. He returned to the regiment to resume his commission during the First World War. During the course of the war he received the Military Cross, Distinguished Service Order and a Mention in Dispatches as well as promotion to the acting rank of lieutenant-colonel. Phillips served as High Sheriff of Radnorshire from 1936 to 1939 and as deputy lieutenant of the county from 1943.  Personal life  Born at Newport on 30 July 1883, Phillips was educated at Marlborough College. He was one of three candidates nominated for the position of High Sheriff of Radnorshire on Saint Martin's Day (11 November) 1936 and again on the same day in 1937. He was appointed to the position on 15 March 1938, during this time residing at Greenways in Penybont. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant for the county on 11 January 1943. Phillips died at Colwall in England in August 1961.  Cricket career  Phillips made his debut in minor counties cricket for Monmouthshire against Wiltshire at Rodney Parade in the 1901 Minor Counties Championship. Phillips did not feature for the county in 1902, but played regularly in the 1903 and 1904 seasons, after which a gap of four years followed before he next appeared for Monmouthshire. He made his debut in first-class cricket in 1908, when he played for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Cambridge University at Fenner's, one of two first-class matches he played for the MCC that year, the other coming against Oxford University. After playing for Monmouthshire in 1908, another gap of four years followed before his next appearance in minor counties cricket. He made three further appearances in first-class cricket in 1912, playing twice for the Free Foresters against the two Oxbridge Universities, as well as appearing for South Wales against the touring South Africans at Swansea. With World War I interrupting county cricket, Phillips resumed playing cricket after the war. He appeared in minor counties cricket for Monmouthshire in 1921 and 1924, having made a total of 43 appearances for the county in minor counties cricket by that point. He also appeared once more in first-class cricket, playing for the Free Foresters against Oxford University in 1921. Playing six matches at first-class level, Phillips scored 188 runs at an average of 17.09. He made one half century, a score of 62 against Oxford University in 1912.  Military career  Phillips was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the third (militia) battalion of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment on 24 August 1901. He was promoted to the local rank of lieutenant on 16 March 1902 and this was confirmed as a substantive rank on 8 June 1903. At some point thereafter he resigned from the army. Phillips returned to the battalion (which had since become a Special Reserve unit) after the outbreak of the First World War and resumed his commission as a lieutenant in the third battalion on 8 January 1915. He was promoted to captain on 13 February 1915 and to the temporary rank of major on 3 April 1916. Phillips was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry on the battlefield on 3 June 1916. Phillips was later appointed to command his battalion and was promoted to the acting rank of lieutenant- colonel on 27 September 1916. On 9 April 1917 he was mentioned in despatches by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and on 4 June was appointed a companion of the Distinguished Service Order. The third battalion was transferred to the training reserve on 22 September 1918 with Phillips retaining command and his acting rank until 9 January 1919 after which he reverted to his substantive rank of captain. Phillips relinquished his commission on 1 April 1920 and on doing so was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

Located on the Campus of Loyola University Chicago. Established in 1994, the Women and Leadership Archives (WLA) collects and makes available permanently valuable records of women and women's organizations, which document women's lives, roles, and contributions. Organizationally, the WLA is part of both the Ann Ida Gannon, BVM, Center for Women and Leadership, and part of Loyola University Chicago's Library system.  Piper Hall  Housed in historic Piper Hall, the WLA maintains an archive in the basement and a reading room on the third floor. Piper Hall is one of the last lakefront mansions left in Chicago. Built in 1909 by Cassie and Albert Wheeler, Mundelein College acquired the building in 1934. When Mundelein affiliated with Loyola University Chicago in 1991, the building fell under the control of the University. Meticulously restored in 2005, it is now home to the Gannon Center for Women and Leadership and the Women and Leadership Archives.Chicago Architecture Center. https://openhousechicago.org/sites/site/loyola-university-piper-hall/ History Sister Ann Ida Gannon, BVM, 1959 The Women and Leadership Archives has its roots in Mundelein College, which was founded and operated by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVM), and provided education to women from 1930 to 1991, when it affiliated with Loyola University Chicago. The Gannon Center for Women and Leadership, named after Mundelein College's longest serving president, Sister Ann Ida Gannon was created to carry on Mundelein's heritage of fostering women leaders.Prudence Moylan, \\"A Catholic Women's College Absorbed by a University: The Case of Mundelein College\\", in Challenged by Coeducation: Women's Colleges Since the 1960s (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2006). The WLA grew out of the need to preserve Mundelein College records and expanded to collect papers of women leaders, including several Mundelein graduates. The Women and Leadership Archives serves a wide variety of users including students, scholars, and the general public. Collections Scope Collection strengths include the subject areas of activism and women's issues; authors; education; environmental issues; public service; social justice; women religious; and the fine, performance, band visual arts. Geographically, the WLA prioritizes collecting first within Chicago, Chicago-Land, and Illinois; second within the Great Lakes Midwest region (Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin); and third within the United States.https://www.luc.edu/wla/aboutus  Manuscripts  The Women and Leadership Archives store the records of many different individuals and organizations from the Chicago area. *Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, BVM, the now famous chaplain for the Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team, was a teacher at Mundelein College before being hired by Loyola.

Its typical apparent visual magnitude is 17.6, but increases up to 11.0 magnitude during outbursts. The outbursts occur approximately every 23 days. System Dwarf novae systems are made up by a classical star with a white dwarf companion. By measuring the Doppler shift of spectral lines, it was found to have an orbital period of 3.91 hours. Variability The light emitted by dwarf novae like AR Andromedae comes entirely from the accretion disc and the white dwarf; the luminosity increase during outbursts is typically induced by a variation in the accretion rate of the white dwarf. Spectrum The spectral type of AR Andromedae is classified as peculiar of the U Geminorum type, since the spectrum is not a typical stellar blackbody. It also shows strong emission lines of the first two Balmer series lines as well as HeI ones. In addition, an unusually strong FeII line with other possible weak lines of the same origin were also reported.

Life  Bording was one of the nine recorded children of the Flemish physician Jacob Bording (1511-1560) and his Genoese- born wife, born Franzisca Negroni (1523‚Äì1582). At the time of his birth his father was living and working in Hamburg but in 1549 the family moved to Rostock in connection with his father's work. His father became a professor at the University of Rostock and then rector at the University of Copenhagen and personal physician to the king of Denmark. The younger Jakob Bording embarked on the study of jurisprudence at Rostock in 1561. He continued his studies at Paris, Heidelberg and Louvain, then ending up at Leipzig from where he emerged in 1574 as an extraordinary professor of feudal law, with an appropriate Licentiate (degree). At the same time he was working as an advisor to John Albert I and Ulrich, Dukes of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. In 1682 he received his doctorate of law from the University of Rostock. By this time he was in great favour with Ulrich of Mecklenburg, whom in 1582 he accompanied to the Imperial Diet, held, on this occasion, at Augsburg. The emperor created him a Count palatine. Later he also served as a councillor to Duke Ulrich's son in law, King Frederick III of Denmark, and then to Frederick's successor, King Christian IV of Denmark. In 1686 he achieved a significant promotion when he became Chancellor of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. After he resigned from that post and from his other jobs in Mecklenburg he moved to L√ºbeck where he became a city councillor and, in 1600, was elected mayor. It is a reflection both of his own qualities and contacts and of the role of L√ºbeck as an important power in the region that during his sixteen years as mayor Bording undertook a number of significant international visits, notably to Denmark in 1604 (twice) and 1610. The office of mayor was an unpaid one, but L√ºbeck councillors expressed their own appreciation of Bording's contribution to the city's interests by granting him full use (ususfructus) of the \\"Gut Strecknitz\\" estate as a life-time benefice. Jakob Bording is commended by one source for his sense of fairness, his direct dealing, and for his sheer ability as a teacher, lawyer and statesman. His funeral oration was written by the distinguished academic and rector of the Katharineum, Johann Kirchmann.

Early life  Aves was born on 22 August 1898 in Hertfordshire to social reformer Harry Ernest Aves and Eva Mary Aves (born Maitland). Her mother was a daughter of suffragist and educationalist Emma Maitland. She was educated at Frognal School and then Newnham College, Cambridge, where she graduated with third-class honours in economics. During her time at university, she became president of the Women's University Settlement, which worked to promote the welfare of women and children in deprived areas of London.  Social work  In 1924, Aves became a school care organiser for London County Council, starting as an assistant care organiser. Care organisers were usually expected to hold a diploma in a social science, but Theodora Morton accepted her economics degree as a substitute. She was promoted to Principal Assistant Organiser in 1930. In 1938, she was involved in planning the evacuation of children, a role she held until 1941. She became permanent Chief Welfare Officer in the Ministry of Health in 1946, a role she had held on secondment during the Second World War, from 1941. In this role, which she held until the 1963, she supported post-war reforms of welfare and the establishment of a modern social service system. She worked on secondment for brief periods at both the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, as chief child care consultant in Europe, and the Home Office at the start of this role. Aves held various short-term positions in family and child welfare for the United Nations alongside her role in the Ministry for Health throughout her tenure there. She was a governor of the National Institute for Social Work from 1961‚Äì1971, and served as chair of the National Corporation for the Care of Old People from 1965‚Äì1972. She chaired the Commission on the Role of the Voluntary Worker in the Social Services from its establishment by the National Council of Social Services in 1966. Her 1969 report on the role of volunteers in social service, The Voluntary Worker in the Social Services, led to the establishment of the Volunteer Centre. It encouraged an increase in the number of volunteers involved in health and social services, a proposal which was opposed by trade unions.  The Volunteer Centre  The Volunteer Centre was established in January 1973, with future Labour MP Mike Thomas as director and Aves a founder member of its board of governors. She became vice-president in 1974. The centre \\"took on the role of collecting and distributing information on volunteer recruitment and training\\". Her work, which had been recognised in part due to the advocacy of economist Brian Abel-Smith, with the Volunteer Centre led to her becoming a Dame in 1977. In 1975, Aves chaired an independent commission for the National Association of Voluntary Help Organisers.  Personal life  Aves lived in Highgate for most of her life. She was a member of the Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution, and enjoyed birdwatching. She was baptised at the age of thirty-four, and went on to serve on the Diocese of London's Board for Social Responsibility from 1977. She died on 23 June 1986, with a memorial service held for her on 15 October, officiated by the Bishop of Stepney.  Honours  Aves was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1946 New Year Honours for her contribution to wartime social services, before being made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1963 New Year Honours on her retirement from the Civil Service. She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1977 New Year Honours.

She is Professor of Medicine at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and Clinical Director of Erasmus Hospital‚Äôs Endocrinology Department. Her work is centered on type 2 diabetes, in particular mechanisms of lipotoxicity using human islets of Langerhans and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived Œ≤ Cells. She is an associate member of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium. In 2013 her work was awarded the Oskar Minkowski prize from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.  Early life and education  Miriam Cnop was born in Ixelles in 1970. Her father is the mathematician, Ivan Cnop, who was a professor at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. She attended the Royal Athenaeum of Tervuren for her k-12 education. In 1988, she started studying medicine at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. She graduated summa cum laude and valedictorian in 1995, realizing her graduate thesis on the effects of lipids on pancreatic beta cells under the supervision of Pipeleers.. She earned a PhD degree from the same institution in 2002. She was a post-doctoral fellow at University of Washington, Seattle, under the supervision of Steven Kahn, on a scholarship from the Belgian American Educational Foundation. She is board certified in Internal Medicine and did her sub-specialization in Endocrinology at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles in 2003.  Career and research  Cnop‚Äôs main research interest is pancreatic beta cell failure in type 2 diabetes and monogenic forms of diabetes. She contributed to show that lipotoxicity, the deleterious effect of saturated fatty acids, causes dysfunction and apoptosis of the beta cell. Her team demonstrated that the pancreas reaches its total capital of beta cells at age 20 years after which beta cells age with the body and may succumb to metabolic stress . The monogenic forms of diabetes under study in her group include diseases due to mutations in genes with a role in endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial function and tRNA biology. Her team described the impact of TRMT10A deficiency in mammals, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of microcephaly and early onset diabetes. She was the first to show incretin deficiency in a specific type of diabetes caused by RFX6 gene mutations. These monogenic forms may further our understanding of the complex processes leading to type 2 diabetes. She studied the association between Friedreich‚Äôs ataxia and diabetes in collaboration with other researchers from Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles. While it was hitherto believed that this form of diabetes is due to insulin resistance, they showed that beta cell dysfunction and death are central to the pathogenesis of diabetes for patients presenting with this hereditary condition. Her lab is among the few to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells from diabetic patients into pancreatic islet cells, in collaboration with Timo Otonkoski, Helsinki. This novel technology provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into the pathways leading to beta cell failure in diabetes and to test novel therapies. She participates in two European Union Innovative Medicines Initiatives, INNODIA and Rhapsody, on type 1 and type 2 diabetes. She also coordinates the European Union Horizon 2020 project T2DSystems that aims to develop a systems biomedicine approach for risk identification, prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.

He was the director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft (1945-1958), now known as the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). His classic book, The Fish Gate, published in 1943, paints a picture of the near-collapse of the British fishing industry through overfishing that occurred before both the First and the Second World Wars. Biography Godfrey Michael Graham was born in Manchester on 22 February 1898, the son of the Quaker writer John William Graham (1859‚Äì1932) and Margaret Brockbank. As a boy he loved the Lake District and the wildlife he encountered on his relation‚Äôs Cumberland farm.Graham M.

Here he could combine biological science with his experience and love of the sea, knowing that his research would be both practical and useful.Graham M. (1973) A Natural Ecology, Manchester University Press, 233pp. [cover notes] In 1927-28 Michael Graham was dispatched by the fisheries laboratory and spent a year surveying fish populations in Lake Victoria.Graham M. (1929.) The Victoria Nyanza and Its Fisheries: A Report on the Fish Survey of Lake Victoria 1927‚Äì1928 and Appendices. London: Crown Agents for the Colonies. 256pp. This survey represented the first ever systematic survey of one of Africa‚Äôs great lakes and provides a unique baseline against which all subsequent changes can be compared. Graham married Edith Meek in 1925, who had assisted Ministry staff in their investigation of pollution problems in the River Tyne and who was a daughter of Alexander Meek, one of the founders of the Dove Marine Laboratory, Cullercoats. He designed his own home in Lowestoft, acquiring enough land on which to keep cattle and horses and so in a small way to indulge his lifelong interest in farming. He always had a touch of eccentricity, as witnessed by his habit of writing with quills fashioned from the feathers of his own geese, wearing a flowing cape with a specially made inside pocket big enough for a ministry file and riding his Arab horse around Lowestoft at night with rear-lights fitted to his riding hat and stirrups. In Lowestoft, Graham‚Äôs work led him to be particularly concerned with the problem of overfishing. He was appointed Principal Naturalist in 1944 and Director of Fishery Investigations in 1945. He published several highly influential and thought-provoking books during this time, most notably The Fish Gate in 1943, Human Needs in 1951 and Sea Fisheries: Their Investigation in the United Kingdom in 1956. As Director of Fisheries to HM Government he was made CMG (Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George) in January 1954, he was also responsible for recruiting Ray Beverton and Sidney Holt whose treatise On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations (1957) is dedicated to Graham and is widely regarded as the cornerstone of modern fisheries science.Beverton, R. J. H., and Holt, S. J. 1957. On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations. Fishery Investigations Series II.

(1973) A Natural Ecology, Manchester University Press, 233pp. [cover notes] Fisheries Survey of Lake Victoria Lake Victoria has witnessed many dramatic changes over the past Century as a result of the introduction of Nile Perch, eutrophication and climatic change. These influences have in-turn resulted in major alteration to indigenous fish communities.Witte, Goldschmidt, Goudswaard, Ligtvoet, van Oijen & Wanink (1992). Species extinction and concomitant ecological changes in Lake Victoria. Netherlands Journal of Zoology 42(2-3): 214‚Äì232. doi 10.1163/156854291X00298. In 1927 Michael Graham was sent from the fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft to spend a year surveying fish populations and fisheries in Lake Nyanza (Lake Victoria) on behalf of the Colonial Office. This unique survey represents the first ever characterisation of Lake Victoria fish communities. The original hand-written 'Naturalists Logbooks' from this survey have recently been re-discovered in the archive of the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), these are now being digitized and made available to researchers seeking a 'baseline' against which subsequent changes can be compared. During his survey of Lake Victoria, Michael Graham recorded fifty-eight species of Haplochromis including many new species, and commented that \\"the number of individuals is almost incredible!\\". While Graham regretted that the enormous haplochromine population was not really 'useful', he warned against introduction of a large predator that could convert these little, bony fish ‚Äì which the colonial fisheries officers called trash fish ‚Äì into large fish that could be caught for food. The leading candidate at that time was the Nile perch, which was tasty, grew to over six feet (about 2 metres) and two hundred pounds (a hundred kilograms), and already lived in nearby Lake Albert. At the time Graham wrote \\"The introduction of a large predatory species from another area would be attended with the upmost danger, unless preceded by extensive research into the probable effects of this operation\\". In a footnote he added that his warning had just been strengthened by a recent research report from Lake Albert, which described how rare the tilapia had become. Survey catches included several Haplochromis species that are now thought to be extinct, including: Haplochromis flavipinnis, Haplochromis gowersii, Haplochromis longirostris, Haplochromis macrognathus, Haplochromis michaeli, Haplochromis nigrescens, Haplochromis prognathus. The specific name Haplochromis michaeli honours Michael Graham as the collector of the type specimen. On 13 December 1928, Certificates of recommendation were received by the Linnean Society for election of Michael Graham to Fellowship status. Michael Graham read his paper on ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Natural History of the Victoria Nyanza\\", at the Linnean Society on 24 May 1929.Graham, M. 1930. The natural history of the Victoria Nyanza. Proc. Linn. Soc. Lond.141 :43-44. (Abstract only). The Fish Gate and Graham‚Äôs \\"Great Law of Fishing\\" Michael Graham‚Äôs given task on joining the Lowestoft laboratory was to study the North Sea cod fishery. He continued, with breaks for field studies in Africa and Canada, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, describing the cod‚Äôs life cycle and spawning grounds, and showing the age composition of the fishery through a laborious process of scale-reading. In a 1935 paper Graham conclusively showed that the North Sea stock was overfished.Graham, M. (1953) Modern theory of exploiting a fishery, and application to North Sea trawling. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 10: 264‚Äì274, https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/10.3.264 His classic book, The Fish GateGraham, M. (1943) The Fish Gate. Faber and Faber, London 196pp. reminds us that by 1939 the North Sea was exhausted and many fishermen were unemployed ‚Äì the inevitable result of unrestrained over-fishing. The problem, according to Michael Graham, was that as soon as fishermen began fishing, stocks started to decline. To compensate, fishermen bought bigger nets and engines, but after a certain point, profits would slide. Graham thought the solution was to regulate fishing so that only larger, older fish could be caught. Graham distilled the observations of 20 years at sea into his ‚ÄòGreat Law of Fishing‚Äô, a simple declarative statement such that ‚ÄúFisheries that are unlimited become unprofitable‚Äù. Graham said this was a law demonstrable by experience, not scientific theory (although this was later proven mathematically by Beverton and Holt). As long as the effort is free and urged on by competition, fisheries will eventually fail. The Great Law, he pointed out, was only fruitful in its inverse form ‚Äúthat limiting effort will restore profit to a fishery‚Äù. While some thought that fishermen needed to conserve stocks so their sons could fish, Graham believed fishermen had to change the way they fished so they themselves could continue to make a living. To a later generation, trying to explain why the North Sea and other seas declined and their fishing ports collapsed, Graham is a seminal figure, both for his influence on the ‚Äògolden age‚Äô of fisheries science and for his restless advocacy of ‚Äòrational‚Äô fishing and the conservation of biological systems on which humans depend for food. The Fish Gate is notable for citing Das Kapital (Marx) in the context of the growing industrialisation of the fishing industry. The Michael Graham Prizes The MAFF ‚Äì Directorate of Fisheries (now Cefas) has been an affiliated institute of the University of East Anglia (UEA) since 1965. In 1974, staff at the Lowestoft laboratory created an endowment called The Michael Graham Prize, funded through royalties received from sale of the book Sea Fisheries Research.Harden-Jones, F.R. (ed.) 1974. Sea fisheries research (Papers in honor of Michael Graham). John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York. 510pp. This book had been written by members of the laboratory as a tribute to their esteemed former Director who had died in 1972. Three prizes of ¬£100 each, now collectively known as the Michael Graham Prizes, are awarded annually to students in the Faculty of Science at the University of East Anglia, one for best performance in the Ecology degree, one for best performance in the MSc in Applied Ecology and Conservation and one for the best conservation project by an undergraduate student from either ENV (School of Environmental Sciences) or BIO (School of Biological Sciences).

Her first husband, William of Zardana, died in 1132 or 1133, leaving her in the possession of the fortress of Saone in the Principality of Antioch. She soon married her late husband's close ally, Joscelin II, Count of Edessa. After her husband was captured by troops of Nur ad-Din, the atabeg (or governor) of Aleppo in May 1150, Beatrice entered into negotiations about the sale of the remnants of the County of Edessa to the Byzantine Empire. After the transfer was completed in August 1150, she and her children settled in Saone.  Marriages  Born in a noble family, Beatrice first married William of Zardana, who was a powerful baron in the Principality of Antioch. After William perished in a battle in 1132 or 1133, Beatrice became a wealthy widow because she could retain her dowry possessionsthe castle of Saonetill the end of her life. Joscelin II, Count of Edessa married her most probably because he wanted to strengthen his position in northern Syria. Beatrice's first husband had been Joscelin's close ally. Joscelin preferred to live in Turbessel, west of the river Euphrates, and charged mercenaries with the defence of Edessa. Imad ad-Din Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul and Aleppo, captured Edessa on 23 December 1144. He also conquered almost all Edessan fortresses to the east of the Euphrates.  Regent  Joscelin was captured by troops of Zengi's son, Nur ad-Din, in early May 1150. He was taken to Aleppo where he was blinded. Beatrice sent new troops to the fortresses of the county to strengthen their defence, but both Nur ad-Din and the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, Mesud I, invaded the county. Mesud persuaded the garrisons of Kesoun, Raban, Behesni and Marzban to surrender in return for a safe conduct to Turbessel, but he unsuccessfully besieged Turbessel before returned to Rum in June 1150. The Byzantine Emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, offered to pay an annual income to Beatrice and her children in return for the cession of the last fortresses of the county. Baldwin III of Jerusalem who had led reinforcements from Jerusalem to northern Syria realized that the Franks were unable to defend the territory and authorized Beatrice to sale the county. The transfer was completed in Baldwin III's presence in August 1150. Beatrice cede Turbessel, Aintab, Ravendel, Bira and Samosata to the Byzantines. She provisionally retained Qa'lat ar-Rum, but only to grant it to Grigor III Pahlavuni, the catholicos (or head) of the Armenian Church in Cilicia.  In exile  Baldwin III put Beatrice and her family under her protection. Beatrice and her family settled in Saone. Her husband died in captivity in Aleppo in May 1159.

Created in 1856, with the opening of the Matabiau station (now Toulouse main station), it has six lines, or eight branches, arranged more or less in a star shape.. It is operated and managed by SNCF and serves 27 stations, including 12 inside the city of Toulouse.  History  * 1856 : First train station, Toulouse-Matabiau, is opened. * 1993 : Line C of railway network is opened with line A of Toulouse Metro. * 2003 : Line C is partially doubled and 3 stations are added. *2007 : Saint-Agne station in line D become a transfer station with new line B of metro.Line B opening document, p. 9, Hidezone.free.fr *2009 : Gallieni-Canc√©rop√¥le station is opened. It was originally meant to be part of line C but was not finally included. *2011 - 2013 : Line 1 of TER (to Saint-Sulpice) is doubled.  Network   The ¬´ star shape ¬ª  Toulouse-Matabiau station The Toulouse railway network is roughly star-shapedOfficial map of national rail network (SNCF R√©seau), PDF, Sncf-reseau.fr. The structuring axis is the Bordeaux‚ÄìS√®te line, which crosses the agglomeration in a north-west - south-east orientation, following on a part of the route the Canal du Midi. Near the city center is the most important station of the city, Toulouse-Matabiau. Starting from the latter and going back to Bordeaux, we first reach the station of Toulouse-Raynal, vast former marshalling yard and current SNCF technicentre located not far from the passenger station. Then, a triangular junction allows to join the Brive-la- Gaillarde ‚Äì Toulouse (via Capdenac) line, major axis of communication of the north-east of Midi-Pyrenees since it is from this that all tertiary lines stand out (Montauban‚ÄìLa Cr√©made, Tessonni√®res‚ÄìAlbi, Lexos‚ÄìMontauban) sector, and which serves major cities such as Albi, Rodez, Castres or Mazamet. Continuing always following the valley of the Garonne, it is possible to reach several stations of the north of the city and the nearby agglomeration, as well as to the large railway station of Saint-Jory, where will be the connection from the LGV Bordeaux‚ÄìToulouse. Then, further north is the Montauban-Ville-Bourbon station from where the Orl√©ans‚ÄìMontauban line (or POLT, acronym for \\"Paris - Orl√©ans - Limoges - Toulouse\\"), which is the old fast route that took the TEE Capitole and allows to reach the capital without passing through Bordeaux. South of Toulouse-Matabiau, the various railway tracks of the city form an arc. First of all, for a few kilometers, all the tracks go down to the south, parallel to the Canal du Midi. Then, they separate shortly after the twin tunnels of Guilhemery, half continuing south- east and, after crossing the small Montaudran station and several stations of the agglomeration (Lab√®ge-Innopole, Lab√®ge-Village, Escalquens, Montlaur, Bazi√®ge), continue towards S√®te, Marseille or Spain via Perpignan; the other half goes southwest. After crossing the Saint-Agne station, and its transfer with the line B of the metro, the line Toulouse - Bayonne crosses the Garonne and the Ramier Island, from which separate decommissioned tracks which allowed the origin to serve factories of the SNPE and those of AZF today destroyed following the disaster of the same name. Then a second bifurcation takes place: * On the one hand, in double-track, towards Portet, from where it is possible to reach the west of Spain with the Toulouse‚ÄìBayonne line, or to continue towards the east of the Pyrenees or Andorra with the line from Portet‚ÄìPuigcerda. The two lines then serve in the urban area either the Muret station (Toulouse‚ÄìBayonne), or those of Pinsaguel and Pins-Justaret (Portet‚ÄìPuigcerda); * On the other hand, in single track: this last line, the Saint-Agne - Auch line, after the Gallieni-Canc√©rop√¥le station, full back north to the Ar√®nes. Although it is necessary to make a wide detour to the south of the city, this situation is due to the fact that it was simpler to build the line to follow the existing structure and to go through what was still the periphery of the city than to cross the hypercentre. After the Saint-Cyprien - Ar√®nes station and its connections with the metro line A and the tram, the line crosses the west of the city, with the stations of TOEC, Lardenne (or Capelles), Saint-Martin-du-Touch and Ramassiers. At the exit of the city, the Colomiers station is the western terminus of the line C of the Toulouse public transport network which starts at the Ar√®nes. Then, in the direction of Auch, we find the small stations of Lyc√©e International, Pibrac and Brax-L√©guevin.  Urban lines  Line C Saint-Martin-du-Touch station|alt= This line is a kind of RER that joins the city of Colomiers to the west of Toulouse. It was opened just after the line A. This line is just a section of the TER train line between Toulouse and Auch, going from the station Ar√®nes to Colomiers.

It is approximately long and drains of fertile agricultural land. The Pow dates back to the Middle Ages and was dug on the orders of the canons of the nearby Inchaffray Abbey; it was expanded under permissions granted by Robert the Bruce. A drainage commission became responsible for the Pow in 1696 under an act of the Parliament of Scotland. This body, the only local drainage commission in Scotland, continues to maintain the Pow and collect revenue from local landowners. A modernised act to govern the commission was passed in 2018.  Description  The Pow starts at Methven Moss and runs in a south-westerly direction for until it meets the River Earn near to Innerpeffray, about to the south-east of Crieff. The Pow's drainage basin is which includes 79 residential properties, 21 agricultural properties and 2 commercial properties. It has ten major tributaries which total approximately of watercourse. The Pow's purpose is disputed with some claiming it to be for the drainage of groundwater and others that it is a flood prevention measure.  History  Pow is a Scots language term that dates to the Early Middle Ages and means an artificial ditch. The Pow was first dug on the orders of the canons of the Augustinian Inchaffray Abbey. The abbey, one of the largest in Scotland at the time, was located on an island in marshland and the Pow was intended to help drain the surroundings. Abbot Maurice of Inchaffray was chaplain to Robert the Bruce and prior to the 1314 Battle of Bannockburn claimed to have witnessed a miracle whereby the arm bone of Saint Fillan appeared in a previously empty reliquary. Robert the Bruce credited the miracle with providing his subsequent victory on the battlefield. In thanks to Maurice he granted the abbey permission to extend the Pow. The abbey went into decline after the Scottish Reformation and was gradually abandoned. Despite this the Pow remained in use.  Management  In 1696 the Pow was brought under the formal management of a drainage commission (similar to the internal drainage boards of England and Wales) by the \\"Act in favour of Sir Robert Murray of Abercairney and other heritors upon the Pow of Inchaffray\\" passed by the Parliament of Scotland. The commission was empowered by the act to tax heritors, those landowners that benefited from the Pow, for the maintenance and improvement of the ditch. It noted that \\"the grass and corns of several heritors of the said lands are frequently lost and rendered useless\\". This act was repealed and replaced by an 1846 act (the \\"Pow of Inchaffray Drainage Act 1846\\") of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which included measures for the construction of new flood defences. A private bill, aimed at establishing the commissioners as a body corporate to take into account changes in the size of the drainage basin and to the number of heritors, was submitted to the Scottish Parliament by the drainage commissioners in March 2017 to replace the 1846 act. It received royal assent as the \\"Pow of Inchaffray Drainage Commission (Scotland) Act 2019\\" on 17 January 2019., 2019 asp 1 The Pow drainage commission is the only local drainage commission in Scotland. It is responsible for some of the country's most fertile agricultural land and has also worked to allow residential development to take place on part of the drainage basin. The Pow has a population of non-native beavers and the commissioners have been in discussion with Scottish Natural Heritage to carry out a trial of beaver-proof fencing and water-gates.

Magri is best known for his work surrounding grotesque dance, a style of theatrical dance characterized by comedy, athleticism and acrobatics, whose roots lie in the Italian street tradition of Commedia dell‚Äôarte.Bongiovanni, Salvatore. ‚ÄúGennaro Magri, a Grotesque Dancer on the European Stage.‚Äù The Grotesque Dancer on the Eighteenth-Century Stage: Gennaro Magri and His World, by Rebecca Harris-Warrick and Bruce Alan. Brown, University of Wisconsin Press, 2005, pp. 33‚Äì61, 91-108.  Career  Although very few records exist regarding Gennaro Magri's early life, it is assumed that his early training occurred in his home city of Naples, Italy. The first known record of Magri‚Äôs dance career dates to 1758, where he performed as a principal dancer, or primo ballerino grottesco, at the Teatro Nuovo dell‚ÄôAccademia filarmonica in Verona. Following his time as a dancer in Verona, Magri‚Äôs career expanded to the international stage. From 1759-1760, Magri danced with the K√§rntnertortheater ballet company, a prestigious Viennese company replete with dancers from across Europe, especially Italy. Magri later returned to a second season in Vienna (1763-64), where he danced in court operas, as well as ballets. Many of the choreographic constructs found in the K√§rntnertortheater‚Äôs productions proved formative to Magri‚Äôs later work as a choreographer and pedagogue, such as the powerful relationship between dance and pantomime, and the importance of geographic location in creating a work. Throughout his itinerant career, Magri interacted with a variety of geographically and choreographically diverse influencers of the dance world who shaped his own choreographic style significantly.Brown, Bruce Alan. ‚ÄúMagri in Vienna, The Apprenticeship of a Choreographer.‚Äù The Grotesque Dancer on the Eighteenth-Century Stage: Gennaro Magri and His World, by Rebecca Harris-Warrick and Bruce Alan. Brown, University of Wisconsin Press, 2005, pp. 61‚Äì90. Despite the international scope of his career, Magri spent much of his time as a dancer and choreographer in his homeland of Italy. Following his first and second seasons in Vienna, Magri spent time as a grotesque dancer for Padua's Teatro Nuovo (1760, 1761, 1762, 1764), Venice's Teatro San Angelo (1760-61, 1764), Rome's Teatro Argentina (1761-62), Reggio Emilia's Teatro Publicco (1761-62), Florence's Teatro Pergola (1764), and Turin's Teatro Regio (1762-65, 1767-78). During this time, Magri began to choreograph pieces of his own, most notably during his stay in Venice. After Magri‚Äôs second season dancing in Vienna, he returned to Naples, and choreographed multiple ballets at the Teatro San Carlo (1765-66, 1766-67, 1768-74) that showcased the wide range of virtuosic steps found in the grotesque repertoire. Many of these works were entr‚Äôacte ballets, performed between the acts of an opera with an unrelated plot. Magri then traveled to Milan, where he performed grotesque roles at the prestigious Regio Ducal Teatro (1767). During this time, Magri married the Milanese prima ballerina Teresa Stafani, although the exact date of their marriage is unknown. Magri continued to perform throughout Italy before returning to Naples in 1773. There is no record of Magri performing or choreographing after 1774, although he published a highly influential treatise on grotesque dance, Trattato teorico-prattico di ballo, in 1779.Bongiovanni, Salvatore. ‚ÄúMagri in Naples: Defending the Italian Dance Tradition.‚Äù The Grotesque Dancer on the Eighteenth-Century Stage: Gennaro Magri and His World, by Rebecca Harris- Warrick and Bruce Alan.

His father was Antonio, whiloe his mother was Antonietta Rainone. The Cusani family had already given birth to notable people, namely Biagio Cusani, poet and professor of law in Naples and Gennaro Cusani (uncle of Marcello) who was also professor of law. After receiving the basic education, he went to Naples, where he studied law under the guidance of his uncle Gennaro and Basilio Giannelli. At that time, Marcello was influenced by the ideas of his uncle (who was both against the Jesuits and the Spanish rule) and by the Neapolitan cultural environment of that period. He was influenced by the Congregazione dei padri pii operai and their leader father Torres (an enlightened clergyman), in 1709 he decided to start an ecclesiastical career, animated by the desire to renew the Church, and on 10 June 1713 he became priest.  Teaching in Turin and the period in Vienna  Starting from 1720, his career began to take off. Initially he was entrusted with the task of \\"substitute for the old Digest\\" in the Naples Study. In 1723, he also won the contest for the chairs of civil and canon law, and thus he was appointed professor of both of them. He also accepted the offer to teach civil law at the University of Turin and in 1724 he moved to Turin. He remained there until 1730, when the new king, Carlo Emanuele III imposed restrictions on the freedom of teaching and religion. In 1730, he left Turin and went to Vienna urged by his longtime friend Pietro Giannone, who was in that period was in Vienna. After a few years, however, Cusani decided to return to Naples, where he became a teacher of law and ecclesiastical history at the Naples Study, where he had, among his students, Ferdinando Galiani, Giuseppe Palmieri and Antonio Genovesi.storia-piem-1875, pag. 385, nota 2  The founding of the University of Altamura  In 1746, Cusani was appointed archpriest of Altamura Cathedral and, there he carried out reforms in the spirit of the so-called giannonism (based on the ideas of Pietro Giannone), aimed at affirming the king's privileges over those of the clergy. He developed works of reform of the clergy and, above all, he had the idea of establishing a university of studies in the city, using the revenues of the so-called Monte a Moltiplico. The collection of funds had already begun a century before, in 1640, but for a different purpose, that is to transform the arciprelatura nullius of Altamura into a bishopric, perhaps in order to be stronger against the claims of the nearby bishopric of Gravina.difesa-1867, pag. 6 Cusani's idea was to use the savings of Monte a Moltiplico in order to establish a university and guarantee a public and royal (not led by the church) education. The idea pleased the then king of Naples, Charles III of Spain, who was interested in limiting the dominance of the Church in the education of the youths. Marcello Papiniano Cusani was the founder of the University of Altamura, implementing the incorporation of the two functions of rector and archpriest of Altamura Cathedral in the same person. This feature of dual office remained for the entire life of the university. The first to become both rector of the university and archpriest of the cathedral was Cusani himself, who was also a teacher of law therein; from 1747 to 1752, he directed both the university and the cathedral but, following disagreements with the local clergy, he decided to leave the city asking Galiani to allow him to \\"leave\\". #raucci-2003 |raucci-2003, p. 353}} The university he founded remained open until the beginning of the XIX century.  Archbishop in Otranto and Palermo  On March 3, 1753, Cusani was consecrated bishop in Rome and later became archbishop of Otranto. The office of archbishop of Otranto lasted only a few months, since on 27 February 1754 Charles III of Spain chose him for the position of archbishop of Palermo. According to some sources, he left Otranto on 11 February 1754.notizie-anno-1762, pag. 204 In Palermo, unlike Altamura, Cusani enjoyed greater power, by virtue of his office as archbishop, and this made the reforms he adopted more incisive, aimed at asserting the supremacy of the sovereign over feudal local power. Moreover, from a purely cultural point of view, he reformed juridical and philosophical studies in order to reduce the dominance of the Jesuits and, in addition, he contributed to spread the ideas of John Locke.  Last years and death  Elderly and affected by blindness, on July 16, 1762 Cusani resigned from the archdiocese of Palermo and returned to Naples. There, he was welcomed by his friend Ignazio Della Croce, general of the Augustinians. Cusani joined the order of the Augustinians and remained there until 1766, the year of his death. The exact date of his death is unknown. His remains were buried in the Church of S. Maria della Verit√†.  Notable relatives  Marcello Papiniano Cusani had two notable relatives, his granduncle, Biagio Cusano, poet and professor of Canoni della mattina. He apparently died of apoplexy in 1683. He wrote many works, published and unpublished.< #istoria-studio-napoli- vol2-1754|istoria-studio-napoli-vol2-1754, pagg. 98-99}} His uncle, Gennaro Cusano, was a lawyer and professot of canon law. On 18 July 1703, he was assigned the chair of professor of Sacri canoni matutina. He also taught many notable people of theat period, among which Giacomo Castelli.

Fine was born in the Russian Empire, but moved to London in his youth. He began working in the clothing industry, and developed an interest in trade unionism, working as an organiser for the United Ladies Tailors' Trade Union from 1912. In 1918, he was elected as the union's general secretary. Like most of the union's members, Fine was Jewish, and he found that his fluency in Yiddish helped him in the post. Fine tried to strengthen the union by organising mergers with as many smaller ladies' tailors unions as possible. On the urging of the Trades Union Congress, he discussed a possible merger with the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses and the Tailors and Garment Workers Trade Union, but decided against joining either union. However, in 1939, he led it into an amalgamation with the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers (NUTGW). The union became the London ladies' tailoring branch of the NUTGW, with Fine as full-time branch secretary. Fine was a supporter of the Labour Party, for which he served on Stepney Borough Council. He also served as a magistrate. In 1948, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

The building process took place between 1970 and 1973. The construction was temporarily halted by the City Council in April 1971 on behalf of the Ministry of Housing, on the basis of the complaints filed by the neighbours, who wanted the building to be tore down. The building was then acrimoniously derided in the pages of ABC. The works resumed in June. A 26-floor concrete tower, reaching a 94-metre height, it became the highest residential building in the Spanish capital when it was finally opened in 1973. It is located in the Retiro District, in front of the Retiro Park, in the junction of Men√©ndez Pelayo Avenue and O'Donnell Street. It has been noted as \\"an elaborated product of (Carvajal's) organicism\\". A controversial work, it has been heavily criticised, particularly in terms of the visual impact it creates in the sight of the puerta de Alcal√° from the plaza de Cibeles.

Patterson took Closs to a house away in rural Gordon, Wisconsin and held her in captivity for 88 days until she escaped on January 10, 2019. Patterson was taken into custody shortly thereafter and told police he kidnapped Closs and killed her parents. He pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree intentional homicide and one count of kidnapping. On May 24, 2019, Patterson was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in prison without the possibility of parole plus an additional 40 years.  Kidnapping  Jayme Lynn Closs (b. July 13, 2005) was the only child of James and Denise Closs of Barron, Wisconsin.https://www.com/crime/jayme-closs-wisconsin- teen-14-birthday/%3f=true On October 5, 2018, Jake Patterson drove to the Closs home to kidnap Jayme Closs, but was deterred by activity in the home and afraid he would leave witnesses. He made a second attempt two days later, but was again afraid to leave witnesses. On October 15, he made a third visit, this time armed with a shotgun. Shortly before 12:53 a.m. Central Time (05:53 UTC), Patterson parked his car at the end of the driveway. Wearing a black coat and ski mask, he approached the front door of the home, carrying the shotgun. James Closs, 56, shone a light on Patterson through a glass portion of the front door and asked him to show him his badge. Patterson said, \\"Open the fucking door.\\" Patterson fired once, fatally shooting Closs. Forcing his way into the house, Patterson checked every room in the house because he wanted \\"no witnesses left behind.\\" He found the bathroom door locked and began shooting it down. Inside the bathroom were Denise Closs, 46, and Jayme. Denise was comforting Jayme, who was crying loudly. At 12:53 a.m., Denise Closs made a 911 call. While Denise Closs did not speak, the operator heard a disturbance and yelling before the phone call was disconnected. When the dispatcher called the number back, they reached the voicemail of Denise Closs. Patterson bound Jayme's wrists and ankles using duct tape, then fatally shot Denise Closs. He dragged Jayme outside, almost slipping on blood, placed her in the trunk of his car and drove away. The police arrived four minutes after the 911 call. Patterson later told investigators that he pulled over 20 seconds down the road from the house while deputies sped by with emergency lights and sirens on. Neighbors said they heard two gunshots, but dismissed them since hunting was common around their homes. After arriving at his cabin, Patterson made Closs change into a different pair of pajamas, then forced her under his mattress and sealed off all exits before going to sleep. Search operations Volunteers searched on the sides of US Route 8 near the home and spent October 23 searching for Closs. By October 26, a USD $50,000 reward had been announced for information leading to her recovery. Investigators received more than 2,000 tips and reviewed most of them. The police had no suspects during the time Closs was held captive for 88 days at a house owned by Patterson‚Äôs father on South Eau Claire Acres Circle in Gordon, Wisconsin. Closs later told police that Patterson would force her to hide under his bed to conceal her presence when his family members came to visit him. When Patterson left from time to time, he barricaded Closs under the bed with tote bags, laundry bins and weights stacked around it and told her that he would know if she tried to move them while he was gone. On Saturdays, she was forced under Patterson's twin bed when his family visited. Patterson beat Closs on one occasion because he thought she had moved out from under the bed. During the Christmas celebration Patterson held, Patterson threatened to kill Closs if she moved. Patterson also had sexual fantasies about Jayme, but claimed to have never acted on them because of guilt of killing Jayme‚Äôs parents. Escape Patterson believed that Closs was too afraid of him to make any escape attempts, stating that he ‚Äúnever put special locks on doors because she wouldn‚Äôt escape.‚Äù They also slept on the same bed. Patterson would rarely let Closs out of the cabin, only for brief walks on the lawn after checking for bystanders. On the afternoon of January 10, 2019, Patterson told Closs he was leaving for a couple of hours and put her under his bed before boxing her inside with his belongings, per his usual routine. After he departed, Closs pushed out the objects around the bed far enough for her to escape and ran from the house wearing a light shirt, leggings and a pair of Patterson's sneakers. Closs came across a local woman, Jeanne Nutter, walking her dog. Nutter recognized Closs from news reports and immediately took her to a neighbor's house. After police were called, Closs told them \\"Jake Patterson\\" had killed her parents, taken her and kept her prisoner just a few houses away from her current location in the neighborhood. The neighbors described Closs as calm, quiet, dazed and surprised that they recognized her from news coverage. The police arrived around 4:45 p.m. and decided to remove Closs from the area for her safety. The description Closs provided of Patterson and his vehicle enabled deputies to spot his car just minutes afterward when Patterson drove by the house. After a deputy stopped him, Patterson exited his vehicle and said, \\"I did it.\\" Closs was admitted to a hospital under guard. The next morning, she was released to the custody of her aunt, Jennifer Smith. Hormel, the parent company of the Jennie-O store where Closs's parents had been employed, announced on January 24 that $25,000 of the reward money would be given to Closs for rescuing herself. Perpetrator Patterson confessed to police that he had kidnapped Closs and killed her parents. He had no previous criminal history in Wisconsin. He was charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of kidnapping and one count of armed burglary on January 14, with bail set at $5 million cash. On March 27, he pleaded guilty to two counts of intentional first-degree homicide and one count of kidnapping. The judge agreed to dismiss the armed burglary count. On May 24, Patterson was sentenced to the maximum of two consecutive life sentences in prison without the possibility of parole for the murders plus an additional 40 years for the kidnapping. Douglas County authorities did not pursue charges against Patterson related to Closs's 88 days in captivity because they did not want to bring Closs in for questioning and believed there was sufficient evidence to pursue a life sentence without parole without needing additional charges. Police did not believe Patterson had any social media contact with Closs or her family and relatives of Closs did not recognize Patterson's name. Patterson told authorities he saw Closs getting off a school bus outside the family residence in September while he was driving home from work and that he \\"knew that she was the girl he wanted to take\\". While in jail in March, Patterson wrote a letter in response to questions sent to him by a reporter from a television station in Minneapolis. He apologized for his crimes and stated they were committed \\"mostly on impulse\\", contrasting with reports from the police that he had taken various measures in preparation for the crime. He added that his intention from the beginning was to plead guilty in order to spare Closs and her family the trauma of the case going to trial. Later that month, a television reporter in Minneapolis received a cell phone call from Patterson in which he briefly answered questions sent to him in a letter. Regarding the time Closs spent in captivity, Patterson said, \\"We were just like watching TV, playing board games, talking about stuff. We cooked a lot, everything we made was homemade, you know\\". At Patterson's arraignment, his father told a reporter he had a note of apology he was trying to get to Closs. Patterson's grandfather stated, \\"Something went terribly wrong, nobody had any clues ... We are absolutely heartbroken. It's wrenching to deal with. He was shy and quiet, he backed off from crowds, but a nice boy, polite. Computer games were more of a priority than social interaction.\\" Patterson's parents divorced in 2007. He graduated from Northwood High School in nearby Minong, Wisconsin in 2015. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, but was discharged after one month at MCRD San Diego. On June 20, he was registered officially as a sex offender. In July, he was transferred from the Dodge Correctional Institution to an out-of-state prison in New Mexico and got in a fight with another inmate in August 2019.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/ncna1083811 Aftermath Jayme Closs is now living with an aunt and an uncle.https://www.eonline.com/news/1110242/how- jayme-closs-is-doing-1-year-after-her-incredible-escape-from-the-kidnapper- who-killed-her-parents See also *Child abduction *List of kidnappings *List of solved missing persons cases References External links State of Wisconsin ‚ÄìVS- Jake Patterson, Criminal Complaint (12 pages), filed January 14, 2019 Category:2010s missing person cases Category:2018 in Wisconsin Category:2018 murders in the United States Category:Barron County, Wisconsin Category:Child abduction in the United States Category:Crimes in Wisconsin Category:Deaths by firearm in Wisconsin Category:Douglas County, Wisconsin Category:Formerly missing people Category:Kidnapped American children Category:Living people Category:Missing person cases in Wisconsin Category:Murder in Wisconsin Category:October 2018 crimes in the United States Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kidnapping of Jayme Closs"},{"id":"58869023","text":"Cover of the first edition The Everlasting Mercy is a poem by John Masefield, the UK's second longest-serving poet laureate.

It grows on bark, on branches and twigs, and is often unattached to a branch and merely draped over it. It grows up to in length. Description The thallus (vegetative tissue) of this fruticose (bush-like) lichen is densely branched, and forms tangled masses of stems which are prostrate or pendulous. The branches are smooth and somewhat knobbly or spiny, and a greenish-grey colour. The larger stems become articulated, dividing into inflated, sausage-like segments. The lichen is not blackish at the base and sometimes becomes detached, continuing to grow while draped over its support. Distribution and habitat This lichen is very sensitive to air pollution, especially from sulphur dioxide; it has a widespread but sparse distribution in mainland Europe, but has become extinct in many areas, surviving best in Brittany. It occurs on various Mediterranean and Atlantic islands and is present in Saudi Arabia, and the mountainous regions of East Africa and North Africa. In the British Isles, it used to be widespread but disappeared from many areas during the Industrial Revolution. It is reasonably common in southwestern England, from the New Forest westwards, and is known from scattered locations in Wales, particularly Pembrokeshire. It is rare in southern and western Ireland. Sometimes this lichen grows on the ground, in the slacks among sand dunes growing over rough vegetation. More often it is arboreal, often high in the canopy or in hedgerows, and not attached to anything, but draped over twigs and branches. Here it is difficult to spot from below and it may become apparent when fragments fall to the ground during storms or after snowfall. Ecology Like all lichens, this species involves a mutual relationship between an alga and a fungus; in this instance the alga is a green alga, but not Trentepohlia. Reproduction in this species is mainly by fragmentation of the thallus, with an apparent absence of spore production limiting its ability to recolonise parts of its range where it has been extirpated.

Known for her writing and artistic work related to topics ranging from folklore and fantasy to liturgical design and Indigenous art, she was responsible for the founding of the Department of Fine Arts at the University of Waterloo. Early life and education Patterson was born September 5, 1929 in Worcester, Massachusetts. Her parents, originally from Seattle, Washington, were academics and the family lived in various parts of the northern United States, with Patterson spending much of her childhood in Illinois. The family returned to Seattle at the start of World War II where she attended high school and graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1951. Career Following graduation from the University of Washington, Patterson spent two years teaching at the University of Kansas and as a scientific illustrative for the Smithsonian before returning to Seattle to work as a lecturer at the Seattle University. In 1962 Patterson moved to Waterloo, Ontario with her husband E Palmer Patterson II, of New Orleans, where he had accepted a position at the University of Waterloo. Following the move, Patterson began teaching fine art and art history courses at Renison College prior to accepting a position as Director of Art and Curator at the University of Waterloo Art Gallery in 1964. Her involvement in art initiatives on campus led to the founding of the Fine Arts Group in 1968. The group evolved into the Department of Fine Arts, for which she served as Department Chair twice (1968‚Äì1974, 1979‚Äì1982). Initially offering general and honour degrees in studio art, art history and film studies, the department grew to introduce a Master of Fine Arts program in 1993. Patterson retired from the University of Waterloo in 1992. Within a year she was named Distinguished Professor Emerita and received an honorary doctor of letters from Wilfrid Laurier University. An active supporter of local art initiatives Patterson served as folk artist-in-residence at Schneider Haus in 1999. Artistic themes and writing During the 1950s, prior to arriving in Waterloo, Patterson found inspiration in liturgical themes situating her artistic practice within a belief that the worship of God is both a physical and spiritual endeavor. Over the course of her career she produced a number of notable works informed by an understanding of art as a vehicle for aiding spiritual worship. In addition to a mural created for an Anglican Church in Kansas, Patterson was commissioned to produce a number of liturgical pieces. She designed a series of stained glass windows at a variety of institutions within the Region of Waterloo including those at University of Waterloo's Conrad Grebel Chapel (1964), the Beth Jacob Synagogue and the Pioneer Park branch of the Kitchener Public Library. She also created 27-foot wall hanging for use by Kitchener's St. Peter's Lutheran Church. Beyond her commissions, Patterson created and later donated a wealth of decorative art ranging from quilted banners to metalwork for use at the Church of St. Columba in Waterloo, where she herself worshiped. Patterson developed an interest in folk art shortly after the family relocated to Waterloo due to what she characterized as \\"a rich heritage of Pennsylvania Dutch and Mennonite handicrafts in the area.\\" On the weekends the family would frequent community auctions where she acquired quilts, embroidered samplers and stoneware. She was equally interested in mythopoeic art and literature writing extensively about of authors representative of the genre including C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, George MacDonald and Dorothy L. Sayers. Another of Patterson's areas of interest was Indigenous art, which she both published and taught about over the course of her career. Former student and art educator Linda Carson remembered Patterson's courses as the first to highlight Indigenous artists, using and referring to First Nations communities by name, rather than strictly focusing on European artists. In addition to a number of scholarly publications, Patterson authored several young adult novels including a series of books focused on the Salisbury family. Death and legacy Patterson died in Kitchener on October 15, 2018. The final years of her life were spent in a long-term care facility following a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the early 2000s. Her impact on the local art community was widely recognized through a variety of honours and awards. She was named Oktoberfest's first Woman of the Year in 1985, was given a K-W Arts Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998 and was inducted into the Waterloo Region Hall of Fame in 2004.

The chapel is dedicated to Saint Lazarus and Saint Roch. The chapel was established as a hermitage to treat people with leprosy; it was later used as a quarantine station for enslaved people arriving from Africa. Worship at the chapel is syncretic in character, with its two annual festivals combining Roman Catholic and Candombl√© elements. The chapel is located on a hill high in the Federa√ß√£o neighborhood and consists of a single nave, altar, gallery, and sacristy. It is listed as a historic structure by the Instituto do Patrim√≥nio Art√≠stico e Cultural da Bahia. History Image of Saint Lazarus, high altar of the Chapel of Saint Lazarus A deed dated October 12, 1734, lists the chapel as the property of Jorge Fernandes da Rocha and his wife Francisca Xavier, dedicated to Saint Lazarus. A royal decree of 1755 states that \\"long ago some devotees founded a charity, hermitage to St. Lazarus.\\" Rodrigo Jos√© Ant√≥nio de Meneses (1750-1807), governor of Minas Gerais and Bahia, granted permission to build a small hospital next to the chapel on March 27, 1762. The hospital was used as a quarantine station for enslaved people arriving from Africa. Ownership of the hospital was transferred to the Quinta do Tanque, a former Jesuit hospital, on August 27, 1787; it now belongs to the Federal University of Bahia. Location The Chapel of Saint Lazarus is located on a high point in the Federa√ß√£o neighborhood on a hill known as Colina de S√£o L√°zaro (). It has a view of the Atlantic Ocean and the entrance to the Bay of All Saints. The chapel once sat in a rural area, but is now surrounded by urban sprawl. Structure The Chapel of Saint Lazarus consists of a single nave with an asymmetrical floor plan. A single gallery was added to the nave after the construction of the nave. The chapel has a small sacristy that opens to the chancel; it has a high altar, chancel arch, and two lateral altars. A single, simple bell gable was added to the left of the fa√ßade. The chapel has a simple, triangular pediment with an oculus, a feature of Jesuit churches of the early colonial period in Brazil. The chapel has a single stone portal which opens to a stone forecourt surrounded by stairs. Two windows are located at the choir level. Festivals Festa de S√£o L√°zaro The Festival of Saint Lazarus (Festa de S√£o L√°zaro) is celebrated on the last Sunday of January.

Introduced in 2017, the car pays homage to the company's first and only production model to date, the ATS 2500 GT.  History and development  Rear view In 1961, Ferrari dominated the competition in Formula One racing but a few of its executives and employees were not satisfied with how the company was being run, especially the influence exerted on the company by Enzo Ferrari's wife Laura Dominica Garello Ferrari. Ferrari did not agree with the aggrieved employees and fired them all citing that \\"over evaluation of relevance to marginal facts that have nothing to do with the normal operation of a company.\\" The group of eight technicians and engineers which were laid off decided to start their own company. Thus led by Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini, they formed Automobile Turismo e Sport (ATS) and set about developing an F1 car for the 1962 season in order to stack up competition with Ferrari. But the venture was not successful. After running two cars in five races and facing retirement in majority of the races, the best result the company achieved was an 11th place. The program soon folded up in early 1963 due to repeated failures. The company also focused on manufacturing a road car with the objective of creating a successful automobile business. In lieu of that, the ATS 2500 GT was developed and introduced at the 1963 Geneva Motor Show. Featuring a 2.5-litre V8 engine, the 2500 GT was the first mid-engine road car to reach the production stage. The 2500 GT was to be followed by a more powerful GTS variant but hard times hit the company. Due to their failure in F1, the company soon faced its demise and folded up in 1964 after having produced just 12 cars. The ATS marque was bought by two investors in 2014 namely Emanuele Bomboi and Daniele Maritan. The newly resurrected marque set out to develop the GT, a car that captured the spirit of the original 2500 GT.  Specifications Interior The front design of the car easily mimics the shape of the 2500 GT with a chin spoiler and triangular headlamps. Based on a McLaren 12C/650S, the car borrows many elements from its donor car, including the airbrake, wing mirrors and dihedral doors along with mechanical components such as the engine and transmission. The rear of the car features an opaque engine cover made from carbon fibre along with rounded tail lamps and a wide mesh grille with a sweeping rear diffuser making it different than the original 2500 GT in terms of design language. An interesting design element to note is a shape running from the rear of the car and ending on the rear quarter window. The shape mimics the aerodynamic profile of the original 2500 GT. Sensors hidden in flanks of the car open the doors thus doing away with conventional door handles. Ergonomics have been kept into focus on the interior. A TFT instrument cluster contains options for configuring the powertrain, suspension and aerodynamic components. The car's infotainment system makes use of Google maps. Other notable features include wireless charging and a premium Prima Orchestra hi-fi system that has 3 mm speakers at strategic points in the interior to provide good sound quality. The interior is finished in Nubuck leather and can be tailored to the customer's specifications. The GT is powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged M838T V8 engine borrowed from the donor car. The engine is tuned to generate and of torque in standard configuration but can be further tuned to generate and of torque.  Performance  The GT can accelerate from in 3.0 seconds, in 9.9 seconds and can attain a theoretical top speed of .  Production  ATS has announced a production run of 12 cars. Each car will be built exactly to the customer specifications and no two cars will be similar to one another.

Pihu was premiered at the 2018 International Film Festival of India in the Panorama section and was screened at the Fajr International Film Festival. It won the Grand Prize for Best Feature Film in the International Competition category and the People's Choice award for Best Film at the 14th Trans-Saharan International Film Festival. The film's official trailer was released on 24 October 2018, and was released theatrically on 16 November 2018. The film was shot in the Gandharav society of Greater Noida. Plot The movie starts on the day after Pihu's (Myra Vishwakarma) second birthday party. She wakes up and finds that her mother, Puja, (Prerna Sharma) is not waking up. Her father, Gaurav (Rahul Bagga, voice only) has left for Kolkata for a conference. She feels hungry and tries to wake her mother up, but she does not wake up. It is then revealed that Puja has committed suicide after a fight with Gaurav, and her face and hands are bruised indicating domestic violence, leaving a suicide note on the bedroom mirror, saying that she would've killed Pihu too, but couldn't bring herself to do it. Pooja was upset because Gaurav had come late for Pihu's birthday party; Moreover, she suspected him of having an affair with her friend, Meera. Gaurav continuously attempts to call Pooja, but to no response. Pihu manages to pick up the phone but her father is not able to understand her, asking to speak to Pooja. Gaurav says that he has erroneously left the iron switched on and asks her to turn it off because Pihu might touch it. Shortly after, Pihu burns her fingers. She also almost electrocutes herself with exposed wires and burns two rotis in the microwave and on the stove, trying to make food for herself. She turns on the geyser (water heater), which after a few hours explodes, causing a large bang that concerns the other tenants of the apartment block and she hangs on the balcony railing trying to get her fallen doll. Luckily, a lady sees Pihu hanging dangerously and persuades her to get down. The electricity also fluctuates multiple times. The tap water overflows and comes out of the main door. Neighbors see the water, but think the owners are on holiday. Gaurav calls multiple times throughout the movie from Kolkata, even trying to apologise on phone to Pooja for the fight, through Pihu. He realises that something is wrong when Pihu tells him that Pooja has been sleeping all day, and leaves Kolkata immediately for home. Pihu eats the leftovers from the party, along with few of her mother's sleeping pills lying near her, causing her to fall asleep. During the night, it is shown that the neighbors are trying to break in the house, seeing smoke emanating from within. Gaurav returns and finds the entire apartment messy and burned, with his wife dead and Pihu playing with her blocks, below the cot. The movie ends with Gaurav mourning, with Pihu unaware of the happenings.

He decided to have minimal dialogues in the film, wanted the story to depend on \\"how the girl behaves\\", and felt that \\"every shooting schedule [was] unpredictable.\\" According to him, the film explores issues faced by married couples, and compulsions about the concepts of family and children. Kapri spent four months with the child, getting to know her and familiarise her with the other crew members. Though the girl had never acted before, Kapri is close friends with her parents, so they agreed for her to act on this project. The film was shot for two hours a day with three cameras placed on the set since Kapri felt \\"you can‚Äôt ask a two-year-old to give another take.\\" Kapri made some changes in the script based on Myra's behavioral patterns. For two months, Myra moved to the flat that was rented for shoot. Kapri had to wait for six months after he had finalised Myra for the film due to production issues. Later, his friend Kishen Kumar came on board as a producer. With a budget of , they started shooting the film, but Kumar suffered a cardiac arrest and Kapri had to again seek help for the film's post-production budget.

After Venus and Adonis (1555-1560) and Penitent Magdalene (1555-1561), it was the third Titian work to enter the Getty collection. Titian produced the work in Bologna. It was inherited by the subject's son marquis Francesco Ferdinando d'Avalos (c. 1530‚Äì1571) and probably remained in the family for a time after this. It moved to Poland at an unknown date and was owned by Jan Sobieski and Stanislaus II. August Poniatowski. It was probably then donated to the Potocki family, who retained it until 1921, when Alfred Potocki sold it to countess Martine-Marie-Pol de B√©hague (1870 ‚Äì 1939). She left it and the rest of her collection to her nephew Hubert de Ganay. In 1989 de Ganay's heirs auctioned off much of the collection at Sothebys in Monte Carlo and the following year the insurance company Axa acquired the Titian for 65 million francs. Axa lent the painting to the Louvre for twelve years, with the option to buy it for 65 million francs plus inflation, a preferential price. The deal was arranged by the Louvre's director Pierre Rosenberg, but his successor Henri Loyrette let the twelve years expire, leaving the Getty to buy the work for $70 million. Since the painting was in private hands and the R√©union des Mus√©es Nationaux had decided against purchasing it, the French state could not veto its sale outside of France.

It reportedly took eight minutes for the ship to sink, with the loss of 106 lives including ten medical staff. McNicholas was forced to jump from the ship as it capsized. Unable to swim, she 'fell ill' and was assisted in the water by the ship's captain.

History The railroad was chartered on April 6th, 1910. The initial capital was $150,000 and the first board of directors consisted of Julian M. Bassett, Roger M. Bassett, William D. Petzel, and Joseph C. Johnson, of Crosbyton, Texas; Avery Coonley of Riverside, Illinois; and John S. Coonley and Prentiss L. Coonley, of Chicago, Illinois with the principal office located in Crosbyton. The intent was to construct two lines, totaling 120 miles. The first line was to run Crosbyton to Lubbock, Texas and the second from Crosbyton to Plainview, Texas. The Crosbyton to Lubbock line was completed in early 1911 and consisted of 38.4 miles of main line track and 5.2 miles of yard track and sidings. Construction never began on the second line from Crosbyton to Plainview. The Crosbyton- South Plains' first run occurred on April 10th, 1911, departing from Crosbyton with service to Lubbock. The nearly 39 mile long line ran through the towns of Ralls, Texas, Lorenzo, Texas and Idalou, Texas before reaching Lubbock. At its peak, the Crosbyton-South Plains operated one steam locomotive, 2 passenger cars and 2 freight cars. In 1912, the railroad was ordered to construct a depot in Ralls by the Railroad Commission. On August 1, 1915, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad purchased Crosbyton-South Plains, later renaming it to the South Plains and Santa Fe Railroad on August 17th, 1916. At this point in time, the principal office was moved to Lubbock, with the board of directors including Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway President E. P. Ripley. On July 1st, 1917, the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railroad leased the original C-SP line, along with all of Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe's other holdings. Operations continued until 1948 when the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railroad merged with the parent company, the Santa Fe Railway. The former South Plains and Santa Fe holdings were disposed by Santa Fe, bringing about the end of the original Crosbyton-South Plains Railroad. In January 1990, the original Crosbyton-South Plains line was sold to the Crosbyton Railroad. Operations ceased in under one year due to a lack of business. Today, remnants of the original Crosbyton-South Plains Railroad can still be found in and around Lubbock, Texas. Pieces of the main line to the West, once running to Crosbyton, can still be seen along East Municipal Drive in Lubbock. Main line track still exists, connecting to the Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway lines running through Lubbock. Not much else is left of the original Crosbyton-South Plains Railroad.

The poem describes a peasant's love towards his land and was the inspiration for the story Rickshawala, on which the Hindi film Do Bigha Zamin, directed by Bimal Roy, was based.  Synopsis  The poem is written in the first-person narrative, from the perspective of a peasant called \\"Upen\\". He was a poor man with nothing other than \\"Dui Bigha Jomi\\", two bighas of ancestral land. The rich landlord (zamindar) of his village conspired against Upen, filed a false lawsuit against him and evicted him from his land. Being unable to prevail against the powerful zamindar, Upen left his village, became a disciple of a holyman (sannyasi), and began traveling to different places as a homeless person. Several years passed and Upen ultimately returned to his homeland. On entering the village, he experienced strong emotions. He sat beside a mango tree and recalled how he use to play around the tree during his childhood. Suddenly two mangoes fell from the tree. Upen considered this as a gift to him from the tree, but just then, the zamindar's gardener came on the scene, and without recognizing Upen, the real owner of the land, accused him of stealing fruits and took him to the zamindar. The zamindar also failed to identify Upen, and with his friends insulted him and called him a thief.  Influence  The title of Tagore's poem and the story (Rickshawala) by self- proclaimed Marxist Salil Chowdhury, inspired Do Bigha Zamin (1953), a Hindi- language film directed by Bimal Roy; it was noted as one of the \\"most memorable films of post-colonial India\\".

She organized meetings for the adoption of the Freedom Charter in 1955. Early life Resha was born in 1923 in Matatiele in the Eastern Cape of South Africa as the second of nine children. ‚ÄòMatabello‚Äô is a Sesotho name which means ‚ÄòHope‚Äô. Her second name, ‚ÄòMagdeline,‚Äô was a name she received during her christening. She was named after her grandfather's eldest brother's wife. Maggie Resha was the daughter of Tsekiso Tsiu and Moselantja Mokhele. Resha's father Tsekiso Tsiu was the son of Moselantja Mokhele. Moselantja Mokhele, Matabello's grandmother, was the daughter of a prestigious farmer in the Eastern Cape and was married to an Anglican missionary. The father of Matabello's grandmother, her great- grandfather, Tsekiso Tsiu, was related to the royal Lesotho family. Soon after Resha turned one, she was given to her mother's unmarried sister, Maylia, to be raised on her father's farm ‚ÄòLa Grange‚Äô in Pontseng, which was approximately seven miles from St James. Maylia, a domestic worker, raised Maggie for most of her early life. Later, she moved back with her entire family to a farming community called Klein Jonas.Pamela E. Brooks. Boycotts, Buses, and Passes: Black Women's Resistance in the U.S. South and South Africa. Univ of Massachusetts Press, 2008 Royal lineage At an early age, she learned through stories passed down by her Bafokeng ancestors for generations. She had a direct link with Moshoeshoe I, through her great-great grandfather RaTsiu and his father King Ntsukunyane. Her family believed that RaTsiu had succeeded his father Ntsukunyane as king. However, Ntsukunyane's nephew, Moshoeshoe, had also proved himself worthy of the throne according to various traditional rituals. RaTsiu then decided to overstep his son Tsiu, and gave the position to Moshoeshoe in order to lead the Basotho nation. Nonetheless, RaTsiu remained within the royal family and functioned as the young King Moshoeshoe's counselor. The Basotho people were, from then onwards, led by descendants of Moshoeshoe rather than RaTsui's direct lineage. Resha's great grandfather, Rantsiuoa, only had one daughter named Ntsiuoa, whose two sons became direct heirs. One of these sons, Malitse was Maggie's grandfather. Malitse became the first family member to convert to Christianity. He converted to Christianity while both he and his brother Mosoue worked as diamond miners in Kimberley. Malitse fathered Maggie's father, Tsekiso Tsiu. Education Maggie Resha started her schooling at the age of seven in Pontseng. The primary school she attended only had two classrooms shared simultaneously by five different classes. Here, she was taught reading, writing, dictation, basic arithmetic, poetry and music as well as needlework, sewing, weaving traditional mats and baskets. At the age of 10, she returned to her parents to attend the local school, Ramohlakoana Primary School, which was considered superior to the school in Pontseng. She started to study for her junior certificate in 1939 at the Welsh High School in East London. Maggie was one of the few girls to study the junior certificate during this time, as most girls were made to stay home and do domestic chores. Her parents used to jokingly call it a ‚Äòboys certificate‚Äô. She then studied to be a nurse at Holy Cross Hospital. In 1946, she wrote her final exam at the King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban which she successfully passed and received her Hospital Certificate and a First Class pass. She then went to work at the Pretoria Hospital in 1947. Political career Resha first found out about the African National Congress in a copy of an African political newspaper ‚ÄòBantu World‚Äô in 1944 during her nursing training in Holy Cross. She joined the ANC in 1948 while she was living in Sophiatown, South Africa. Here, she served as the secretary and chairperson of the African National Congress. She became a member of the national executive committee of the Federation of South African Women in 1954. Then from 1955 to 1959 she worked as an ANC militant during the forced removals of Sophiatown. She also organized the meetings for the adoption of the Freedom Charter in Kliptown in 1955. During the ‚ÄòState of Emergency‚Äô in the 1960s, Maggie was recruited into the ANC's underground cell as she was often questioned by the police. In 1962 the ANC smuggled her and her children to join her husband, Robert, in exile. She stayed in Tanzania for six months in 1960 then they moved to Algeria where her husband opened an ANC office in 1963. During this time the couple printed pamphlets and distributed them in order to gain political support. She also attended international conferences representing the ANC's women's section visiting countries such as Russia and China. She became the deputy representative of the ANC in northern Africa in 1966. Then from 1968 to 1974, she was the ANC representative in the International Pan African Women's secretariat. She also attended several other conferences in order to bring awareness to the political climate in South Africa. These conferences were the Women's International Federation, Organization of African Union as well as Afro-Asian solidarity conferences. She moved to London in 1975 and worked as the deputy chairperson of both the ANC's London branch as well as the ANC's Women's section. She returned to South Africa in 1999 after her husband died in London.Women Marching Into the 21st Century: Wathint' Abafazi, Wathint' Imbokodo. HSRC Press, 2000 Page 40-41 That same year she wrote an autobiography \\"My Life in the Struggle: Mangoana tsoara thipa ka bohaleng\\".

The c.1510 date, based on the similarity of its figure of Saint Joseph to that of St. Mark Enthroned, is now more widely accepted. It shows Titian still under the influences of Giorgione and Giovanni Bellini, which also favours the c.1510 dating. The work is first recorded in the collection of the Palazzo Borghese in Rome in 1693 and remained there throughout the 19th century. It was probably seen there by Antony van Dyck, who produced a drawing copying it. After passing through other private collections, it was bequeathed to the National Gallery by William Holwell Carr in 1831.

Henderson (born January 8, 1978) is a senior environmental health scientist at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control and a public health professor at the University of British Columbia. Early life and education  Henderson was born in Toronto, Ontario, and excelled in math and science classes which led to pursue scientific fields later in life. Henderson earned a bachelor of applied science (BASc) from the University of British Columbia in 2000, focusing on environmental engineering. She worked in the field of pollution control and reduction. She also worked in Uganda developing gravity fed water systems before earning her Ph.D. Henderson then switched her focus from environmental engineering to environmental epidemiology and earned a PhD from University of British Columbia in 2009.  Research and career  As the senior environmental health scientist at the BC Centre for Disease Control, Henderson leads in research focused on environmental health and safety, including air pollution from wildfires, and extreme weather events that is then applied for policy within British Columbia. Her most recognized research has projected the health impacts, including respiratory and cardiovascular health, and global mortality impacts, as a result of smoke exposure from wildfires. The research on global mortality impacts was the culmination of her post doctorate work and brought wildfire smoke into perspective on the global scale. Some of her more current research has focused on improving the methods to predict the minimum height of forest fire smoke within the atmosphere, including using machine learning and data from the CALIPSO satellite to better assess population exposure to forest fire smoke. She has also researched the comparative health impacts of smoke from wild versus prescribed fires, in order to better understand the health impacts of varying smoke regimes.  Public engagement  Henderson has spoken on a variety of news outlets, including City News Vancouver and CBC News Network, informing viewers about the health precautions they should take because of poor air quality from wildfires. She has advised those with pre-existing conditions (including asthma, and COPD), pregnant women, young children, and the elderly to take extra care because they will have a harder time breathing the smokier air. Henderson has suggested precautions such as spending time in clean air shelters, such as community centers, shopping malls, and libraries, or investing in an air cleaner for your house.

Portrait was one of these works, costing 300 piastres, showing it was already considered to be an autograph work. It was exhibited in the Tribuna in 1677 and attributed to Giorgione in 1709, as shown on a label on the back of the painting. It was then moved to the villa di Poggio a Caiano. After several subsequent moves, in 1798 it finally arrived back Uffizi. Oxidisation in the paint in the 19th century made attribution difficult. Joseph Archer Crowe, Cavalcaselle and Giovanni Morelli could not decide on the work's artist, Otto M√ºndler (1869) argued it was by Pietro della Vecchia and Roberto Longhi that it was by Paris Bordone - other critics shifted between Giorgione and Titian as the artist. Stefano Scarpelli restored it in 1998, enabling it to be identified as an early Titian still with heavy influences from Giorgione.

It is an aspect of the Xinjiang conflict, the ongoing struggle by the Communist Party and the Chinese government to effectively manage the ethnically diverse and tumultuous province. China has used the global \\"war on terror\\" of the 2000s to frame separatist and ethnic unrest as acts of Islamist terrorism to legitimize its counter-insurgency policies in Xinjiang. A notable element of the campaign is the imprisonment of nearly one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang's re-education camps. Chinese officials have maintained that the campaign is essential for national security purposes.  Background  In April 2010, after the July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots, Zhang Chunxian replaced the former Communist Party chief Wang Lequan, who has been behind religious policies in Xinjiang for 14 years. Zhang Chunxian continued Wang's policy and even strengthened them. In 2011, Zhang proposed \\"modern culture leads the development in Xinjiang\\" as his policy statement. In 2012, he first mentioned the phrase \\"de-extremification\\" (Chinese: ÂéªÊûÅÁ´ØÂåñ) campaigns. Under Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, the Chinese government began scaling up its military presence in the region and introducing more stringent restrictions on Uyghur civil liberties.  Campaign  In response to growing tensions between Han Chinese and the Uighur population of Xinjiang itself, the recruitment of Uighurs to fight in the Syrian Civil War, and several terrorist attacks orchestrated by Uighur separatists, in early 2014, Chinese authorities in Xinjiang launched the renewed \\"strike hard\\" campaign around New Year. It included measures targeting cell phones, computers, and religious materials belonging to Uyghurs. The government simultaneously announced a \\"people's war on terror\\" and local government introduced new restrictions that included the banning of long beards and the wearing of veils in public places. Scholars have stated that the most pervasive of the repressive measures in Xinjiang may be the government's use of digital mass surveillance systems. Authorities have collected the DNA, iris scans, and voice samples of the Uighur population, regularly scans the contents of their digital devices, uses digitally coded ID cards to track their movements, and trains CCTV cameras on their homes, streets, and marketplaces.  Criticism  China has received sharp criticism for its mass detention of members of the Muslim Uighur community from hundreds of other countries as well as human rights observers. James A Millward, a scholar who has researched Xinjiang for three decades, declared that the ‚Äústate repression in Xinjiang has never been as severe as it has become since early 2017‚Äù. The US State Department has said it is deeply concerned over China's ‚Äúworsening crackdown‚Äù on minority Muslims in Xinjiang and the Trump administration has reportedly considered sanctions against senior Chinese officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses. Canadian officials have also raised concern about the internment camps in Beijing and at the United Nations: ‚ÄúWe are gravely concerned about the lack of transparency and due process in the cases of the many thousands of Uyghurs detained in so-called ‚Äòre-education camps,‚Äô which continues to call into question China's commitment to the rule of law and which violate its international human rights obligations.‚Äù  Chinese government response  Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, stated in May 2014 that \\"practice has proved that our party‚Äôs ruling strategy in Xinjiang is correct and must be maintained in the long run\\". In November 2018, a UN panel condemned China's \\"deteriorating\\" human rights record in Tibet and Xinjiang. However, the country pushed back, saying that such international condemnation was politically motivated. Foreign minister Le Yucheng responded: ‚ÄúWe will not accept the politically driven accusations from a few countries that are fraught with biases, with total disregard for facts. No country shall dictate the definition of democracy and human rights.\\" China has defended the strike-hard campaign as lawful, asserting that the country is a victim of terror, and Uighur men are pulled by global jihadi ideology rather than driven by grievances at home. The Chinese government denies the internment camps are for the purposes of re-education.

He was a co- designer of the RDS-220, the largest-ever nuclear weapon. Early life He was born in Moscow. His family was evacuated during the battles of the Eastern Front (World War II), first to Chelyabinsk then to Leninabad (now Khujand). He did well at school despite the hardships. He graduated with honours from the faculty of Physics of Moscow State University in 1950. He entered the Soviet weapons programme as one of its youngest scientists, a senior laboratory assistant in Andrei Sakharov's group at Arzamas-16 (also known as KB-11), now known as All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEF), in Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region. In 1953, he received the Stalin Prize for his part in the work to develop the Soviet union's first thermonuclear weapon, the RDS-6 which was detonated in 1953; this was the first of several state awards for his work advancing nuclear weapons. With fellow physicist Yuri Trutnev, he proposed a new design in 1955 for a two- stage thermonuclear device with much-improved features, followed by theoretical development and finally completion in 1958. He frequently took part in testing weapons he had helped to develop. He received his Ph.D. in nuclear engineering in 1960. In 1962, he became a doctor of technical sciences and senior research worker. In 1964 he was promoted to head of his department and deputy head of VNIIEF. His work also encompassed development of low- radiation-yield nuclear charges for civilian purposes ‚Äì for example to make reservoirs ‚Äì and nuclear-pumped lasers.

The report documented an attempted cover up of the girls' allegations of rape, which was partly blamed on Meyler's intimate relationship with the rapist, Macintosh Johnson. The rapist later was discovered to have HIV/AIDS, and a number of the girls raped by Johnson at the school became HIV-positive. The report strongly indicated that Meyler was involved in an attempted coverup of rape allegations, hiring a PR specialist to issue a press release which deleted or edited blog posts documenting Johnson's role in founding the organization. The report indicates Meyler was derelict in her role as CEO, and her inaction resulted in the continued rape of adolescent girls attending the More Than Me Academy. When, in a 2016 interview with one of Liberia's most popular radio hosts, the host brought up the issue of the charities 'nightmare' and 'misfortune', Meyler explained how, in the first year of the school, \\"one of our students had come forward....She shared, uh, that she had been in this relationship with one of our staff members. ‚Ä¶‚Äù. This was in fact, according to the report, a girl who had told authorities her rape by Johnson began at 11 years old. In May 2019, More Than Me released a report by law firm McLane Middleton that identifies significant deficits in the charity‚Äôs policies, governance and administration, and strongly criticizes the actions of Meyler - noting that \\"The leader of an organization entrusted with the care of children must understand the fundamental steps to be taken when abuse of a child is suspected\\", and that \\"Meyler‚Äôs good intentions do not excuse the devastating impact of her inadequate actions on the vulnerable girls in her care\\". In April 2019, Meyler permanently resigned from her post using her personal Facebook profile to announce her decision to step down as CEO of MTM, in the wake of the conclusions of an independent panel, which concluded that the charity missed opportunities to prevent the rape of its students. The charity and Meyler were said to be more focused on PR aspects of the scandal rather than protecting their students from sexual assault. The panel, which conducted its work pro bono, called the board‚Äôs conduct an ‚Äúastonishing failure of oversight and/or refusal to accept responsibility and be accountable.‚Äù ProPublica and Time Magazine noted at the end of their report that Meyler's charity \\"did not identify any inaccuracies\\" in their report.

He added 180 appearances and 12 goals in Segunda Divisi√≥n, in a 14-year professional career. In 2011, Lago started working as a manager. Playing career Lago was born in Vegadeo, Asturias, and played amateur football well into his 20s. In 1997, after scoring a career-best 15 goals with CD Lugo, he joined Segunda Divisi√≥n side Atl√©tico Madrid B. Lago made his professional debut on 31 August 1997, starting in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against UD Las Palmas. He scored his first goal in the second level the following 15 February, netting his team's second in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Elche CF. In 1998, Lago moved to La Liga club RCD Mallorca, being immediately loaned to division two's Rayo Vallecano. He achieved promotion at the end of the season during his spell at the latter, being a regular starter and being sent off for the first time (of only two) in his career. Lago subsequently enjoyed a two-season loan deal at Las Palmas, before signing permanently for them in 2001. His maiden appearance in the top tier took place on 10 September 2000 when he started in a 0‚Äì3 home defeat to Deportivo Alav√©s, and scored his first goal in the competition seven days later in a 2‚Äì2 away draw against Real Oviedo. Lago agreed to a four-year contract at Racing de Santander in late July 2002 after Las Palmas' relegation, but featured sparingly during his two-year stint. He then signed a deal with second division side Sporting de Gij√≥n, being mainly used as a substitute. After one second-tier season with CD Numancia, Lago moved to the lower leagues with Marino de Luanco in 2007, retiring two years later at the age of 34. Coaching career Lago began working as a manager immediately after retiring, being in charge of Astur CF's youth teams before being appointed at the helm of Luarca CF in 2011. He remained at the latter club for two seasons, before being named UP Langreo coach on 4 June 2013. On 26 June 2014, four days after achieving promotion to the third division with Langreo, Lago signed with Caudal Deportivo. He left the following 2 June as his contract was due to expire, and joined Real Avil√©s on 6 July. Lago was sacked by Avil√©s on 25 April 2017, and took over Gimn√°stica de Torrelavega on 16 October.

The temple within the sanctuary was dedicated to the goddess Fortuna _Primigenia_ , or Fortune of the First Born. Hornblower, S., Spawforth, A., The Oxford Classical Dictionary, Oxford, New York, 606. Parents brought their newly-born first child to the temple in order to improve its likelihood of surviving infancy and perpetuating the gens. The remains of the sanctuary still standing today were built sometime around 120 BCCoarelli, Filippo, I Santuari del Lazio in et√† repubblicana. NIS, Rome, 1987. Pages 35-84. as a spectacular series of terraces, exedras and porticos on four levels down the hillside, linked by monumental stairs and ramps. The inspiration for this feat of integrated urbanistic design lay not in republican Rome but in the Hellenistic monarchies of the eastern Mediterranean. Praeneste foreshadowed the grandiose Imperial style of the following generation. Reconstruction of the temple of the Fortuna Primigenia by Palladio. The sanctuary of Fortune occupies a series of five vast terraces, which, resting on gigantic masonry substructures and connected with each other by grand staircases, rise one above the other on the hill in the form of the side of a pyramid, crowned on the highest terrace by the round temple of Fortune, today incorporated into the Palazzo Colonna Barberini. This immense edifice, probably by far the largest sanctuary in Italy, must have presented a most imposing aspect, visible as it was from a great part of Latium, from Rome, and even from the sea. The goddess Fortuna here went by the epithet of Primigenia (\\"Original\\"), she was represented suckling two babes, as in the Christian representation of Charity, said to be Jupiter and Juno, and she was especially worshipped by matrons.Described by Cicero, De divinatione 2.85; R. Joy Littlewood, \\"Fortune,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), vol. 1, p. 212. The oracle continued to be consulted down to Christian times, until Constantine the Great, and again later Theodosius I, forbade the practice and closed the temple. Features of the temple influenced Roman garden design on steeply sloped sites through Antiquity and once again in Italian villa gardens from the 15th century. The monument to Victor Emmanuel II in Rome owes a lot to the Praeneste sanctuary complex.

April 10, 1822 ‚Äì April 23, 1871) was an African- American poet, abolitionist, and political activist. He was a notable writer and activist in abolitionism and African emigration during the antebellum era. He published the book \\"America and other poems\\" in 1853, which is still in print.  Early life  Whitfield was born April 10 or 12, 1822, in Exeter, New Hampshire, to Nancy (Paul) of Exeter and Joseph Whitfield, who escaped enslavement in Virginia. His mother Nancy was the daughter of Caesar Nero Paul, a boy of African descent who was enslaved at the age of fourteen as a house-boy in the Maj. John Gilman House, and later became free in 1771 after capture in the French and Indian Wars. Through his mother, James was the nephew of Rev. Thomas Paul of the African Meeting House in Boston, and Jude Hall, veteran of the Revolutionary War.Thorenz, Matt, \\"African Americans at New Windsor: Private Jude Hall, 2nd New Hampshire Regiment\\", Teaching the Hudson Valley, February 24, 2013. The small family home was on Whitfield's Lane, renamed Elliot Street in 1845. The house on the idyllic tree-lined lane is described in the memoirs of Elizabeth Dow Leonard: \\"Near the bridge, lived our friend Whitfield in a pretty cottage surrounded by hollyhocks, bachelor's buttons, poppies, saffron, and caraway, and the leafy orchards of their more wealthy neighbors.\\" James Whitfield attended Exeter schools until the age of nine, when his father died suddenly.Dixon, David T., \\"Freedom Earned, Equality Denied: Evolving Race Relations in Exeter and Vicinity, 1776‚Äì1876\\", Bridge over Troubled Waters. His mother Nancy had died when James was seven, so James and his siblings were moved out of town, possibly by his sister. The next records find him in 1839 living in Buffalo, New York, as a barber, at 30 East Seneca St. He owned the shop as well as his home on South Division St. Besides running the barber shop, Whitfield would write in his free time, publishing his own papers by the age of 16. Whitfield married Frances ((Lewey) b. CT in 1822) on July 12,1843 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. They had three sons: James Lewey Jr. (b. 1844 in Cleveland), Charles Henry (b. 1846 in Buffalo), and Walter B. (b. 1849 in Buffalo). His grand-niece was Boston writer and playwright Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins. In her fiction novel of 1900, Contending Forces, she describes a scene at James' home in Exeter with his mother. A 2008 book by Lois Brown goes into detail.Brown, Lois, \\"Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins: Black Daughter of the Revolution\\", Questia.  Poetry and writing  Whitfield published a small volume of poetry in 1853 entitled \\"America and other poems\\" (publisher James S. Leavitt of Bufffalo) which was dedicated to his friend Martin Delany. Half of the poems are about slavery, the other half about art, nature or people such as John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, or Joseph Cinque. Whitfield found success publishing poems related to abolitionism elsewhere as well, many being printed in The Liberator and The North Star. Whitfield's poems often expressed the oppression affecting African Americans, and moral corruption in politics and religion. One of Whitfield's most famous poems was America, published in 1853 in his poetry book. The poem embodies many of Whitfield's ideas about the hypocrisy of American freedom and democracy, and the difficult lives for both freed and enslaved Africans in the US. J M Whitfield and excerpt of \\"America\\" Another of his famous poems, written in 1867 after the Civil War, deals with the topic of the two ships that sailed to the New World in 1620, marking the dual beginnings of America and slavery. It was read before a crowd of two thousand people in San Francisco at a celebration commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Excerpt: More than two centuries have passed Since, holding on their stormy way, Before the furious wintry blast, Upon a dark December day, Two sails, with different intent, Approached the Western Continent. One vessel bore as rich a freight As ever yet has crossed the wave; The living germs to form a State That knows no master, owns no slave. She bore the pilgrims to that strand Which since is rendered classic soil, Where all the honors of the land May reach the hardy sons of toil. The other bore the baleful seeds Of future fratricidal strife, The germ of dark and bloody deeds, Which prey upon a nation's life. The trafficker in human souls Had gathered up and chained his prey, And stood prepared to call the rolls, When, anchored in Virginia's Bay--  Abolition and emigration movements  In 1850, Frederick Douglass visited Whitfield's barber shop. From their discussion, Douglass became deeply impressed by Whitfield's poetic abilities, calling him in the 1850 Anti- Slavery Bugle a \\"sable son of genius.\\" Douglass was also impressed by his passion for abolition, commenting that his job as a barber was \\"painfully disheartening.\\" Although Levine & Ivy, contemporary scholars, contend that the shop was a perfect place to network and exchange ideas. Beyond abolitionism, Whitfield originally became a prominent member of the Colonization Movement, a popular movement focused on African Americans returning to Africa and indigenous parts of the South or Central Americas. Whitfield broke with Douglass, who was not in favor of emigration and joined with Martin Delany, who favored Haiti or Central America as a location. In August 1853 Delaney, Whitfield and others issued a call for a national convention to address the topic to be held in August 1854 in Cleveland Ohio, which was published in Douglass' North Star. A heated debate between Douglass and Whitfield was published in several issues after that, which helped frame the issue. Whitfield became involved in a proposal by Missouri Senator Frank P. Blair to establish a colony for black colonization in Central America. Later, in 1859, Whitfield was possibly sent out to look for land for the project. After the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, Whitfield dropped the emigration issue and moved to California, where he believed there was still opportunity for blacks to flourish without oppressive laws.  Later life  In 1861/62 Whitfield, possibly after his wife died, moved to San Francisco where he was considered by most African-Americans of the Northwest as \\"the\\" great African- American poet. His home was at 918 and then 1006 Washington St., and his barber shop at 916 Kearney St., all of which he owned. Whitfield joined the Prince Hall Freemason Hannibal Lodge #1 and later served as a Worshipful Master for their California Grand Lodge 1864-69. On April 23, 1871, he died of heart disease in San Francisco at the age of 49. Whitfield was interred at the now defunct Masonic Cemetery.  Legacy & Honors  \\"America and other Poems\\" published in 1853 is held in the Library of Congress. Whitfield's birth town, Exeter, New Hampshire reads aloud a Whitfield poem at their annual literary festival.

Early life Plumer was the eldest surviving son of John Plumer, a wealthy London merchant of Blakesware, Hertfordshire, and his wife Mary Hale, daughter of William Hale of King's Walden, Hertfordshire. He had brothers Richard and William Plumer who were also in Parliament. He was educated at Eton College in 1698 and was admitted at Peterhouse, Cambridge on 26 April 1699, aged 16. In 1702, he was admitted at Gray's Inn. He married Elizabeth Hanbury, daughter of Thomas Hanbury of Kelmarsh, Northamptonshire. He succeeded to his father's estates in Berkshire, Essex and Middlesex in 1719. In 1722 he acquired the estate of Chediston Hall in Suffolk. Career Plumer was elected with government support as Member of Parliament for Aldeburgh on 3 December 1719, after spending money liberally against the opposing interest of Lord Strafford. Soon after taking his seat he spoke in support of the Peerage Bill, and continued to support the Government for the rest of that Parliament. He was returned unopposed at the 1722 general election but subsequently spoke against the Government on the army estimates. In 1725 he was appointed to a committee drawing up the articles for the impeachment of Lord Macclesfield, and became one of the managers of the case. Plumer lost the government interest for Aldeburgh and did not stand at the 1727 general election. Sackville Tufton, 7th Earl of Thanet brought him in as MP for Appleby at a by- election on 24 January 1730. He became one of the leading spokesmen of the opposition Whigs, and was actively engaged in securing the repeal of the salt duty in 1730 and in opposing its re-imposition in 1732. He was one of the more moderate members of his party and rather than insisting on the formal rejection of the excise bill, he felt their end had been met by the dropping of the bill, and thought Walpole had incurred mortification enough. In the ballot for a committee on frauds in the customs, he obtained more votes than any other opposition Member. He was returned again for Appleby at the 1734 general election. He supported the nonconformists and moved for the repeal of the Test Act in 1736 and made his last recorded speech on the subject in 1739. He retired from Parliament at the 1741 general election. Death and legacy Plumer died without issue on 2 March 1746 and was buried at Eastwick, Hertfordshire. His estates passed to his brother William. References .

By 2015, Stor-Age controlled 40 properties with a total value of two billion ZAR. On 16 November, 2015, Stor-Age became South Africa's first self storage property fund to be listed on the JSE's main board. Between September 2015 and September 2017, the company's market capitalisation tripled to reached approximately 3.5 billion ZAR, its annual revenue increased by 43% to 124 million ZAR and its annual operating profits increased by 50% to 84.5 million ZAR. However, as Business Day noted, South Africa's macroeconomic conditions are at least partially responsible for these rapid gains as self- storage conditions usually thrive in poor economic conditions since many people have to downsize or keep goods in storage before selling them. In 2018, Stor-Age owned 50 properties in South Africa and the United Kingdom with a total value of 3.9 Billion ZAR (R2.5 Billion in South Africa and R1.4 Billion in the United Kingdom). In early 2018, Stor-Age also performed unusually well amongst real-estate stocks on the JSE having 4% growth in the first few months of 2018, while the overall returns from real-estate sector declined by 18.56%. Acquisitions In September 2016, Stor-Age acquired Storage RSA, which owned seven properties at the time of its acquisition (four in Cape Town and three in Gauteng). This was part of Stor-Age's strategy in order to seek a consolidation of the South African storage industry in order to potentially enhance their portfolio over time through digital marketing and revenue management initiatives. In September 2017, it acquired Storage King, a U.K.-based self-storage company, to gain a foothold in the British market. In November, Stor-Age then acquired StorTown, the largest self-storage facility in KwaZulu-Natal, from the DanCor Properties Group for 1.45 billion ZAR. This sale included four properties located in Brackenhill, Durban CBD and Durban North and increased the company's Gross Lettable Area (GLA) by over nine percent. Stor-Age further expanded its operations in Cape Town by purchasing All-Store Self Storage for 52 million ZAR. This acquisition included properties in Belville, Kuils River, and Brackenfell, which are suburbs north of Cape Town. Lucas approached All-Storage Self Storage and expressed an interest in buying them out since 2011. Corporate Social Responsibility activities As part of CSR Stor-Age's campaigns have been involved in: *During the Cape Town water crisis, Stor-Age ran a water saving campaign where it volunteered its storage facilities for conserving water. Capetonians were invited to donate store-bought, five-liter bottles of water to Stor-Age's facilities. *The company also sponsored the 40th Annual Pirates 10K race on 2 August. In addition to providing the funds for this event, Stor-Age also managed both the water stations during the race. *Stor-Age's English subsidiary, Storage King, participated in a \\"Wave of Gratitude\\" campaign in 2018 which involved acknowledging the women who contributed to their communities in World War I, as well as being a part of the Royal Legion's \\"Thank You\\" campaign to celebrate the centenary of World War I.

Due to the dismissal of Roger de Leybourne from the service of Lord Edward in 1262, he joined with several other nobles of the Baronial opposition under Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. In June 1263, he was one of the nobles who arrested Peter of Aigueblanche, Bishop of Hereford. Vaux returned to royal service to King Henry III of England and Lord Edward, by October 1263. John was one of the sealers of the agreement between King Henry III and King Louis IX of France in December 1263.

She established the Women‚Äôs Bureau in the Cleveland Police Department. As a New Deal lawyer, Wing guided legislators in creating new bureaus and agencies, and advised the Social Security Board in their earliest compliance hearings.  Early life and education  Marie Remington Wing was born in Cleveland, Ohio to parents Francis Joseph Wing and Mary Brackett Remington. She had an older sister, Virginia, and a younger sister, Stephanie. Her father was a judge in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas and eventually a federal judge serving in the United States District Court for Northern Ohio. Her sister, Virginia, was employed as the executive secretary of both the Cleveland Anti-Tuberculosis League and the Cleveland Health Council‚Äôs Health Education Department. Wing attended Miss Mittleberg‚Äôs School for Young Ladies in Cleveland in order to prepare for college. She attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania until her family‚Äôs financial struggles caused her to seek employment back in Cleveland.  Career   YWCA (1907‚Äì1922)  Wing found paid employment at the Young Women‚Äôs Christian Association (YWCA) in Cleveland. She started work with the YWCA as a receptionist in 1907. After a short period of time, she attained the positions of industrial secretary and financial secretary. As industrial secretary, Wing worked with factory girls to improve their education, aiming to guide them towards safe, healthy, moral recreation. After just over a decade at the Cleveland chapter, Wing moved to New York where she became general secretary and held a spot on the board of trustees. She returned to Cleveland in 1918 to take a spot as general secretary back at the Cleveland Metropolitan YWCA. She used this position as general secretary to push for proportional representation in Cleveland city government, and sat on the charter review which resulted in increased proportional representation.  Cleveland City Council bids (1923‚Äì1927)  After leaving the YWCA to attend Cleveland Law School, Wing found herself encouraged by her peers to run for a new city council seat. She ran as an Independent in the 1923 election and won. This made her the first woman, alongside Helen H. Green who also won a seat in 1923, to sit on the Cleveland City Council. Wing ran and won again in 1925 for her city council seat. While on the council, her most documented accomplishment was the establishment of the Women‚Äôs Bureau in the police department. In 1927, Wing ran again for reelection, but lost, allegedly as the result of vote tampering.  Legal career (1927‚Äì1956)  In 1926, while serving on the city council and working at the Consumers‚Äô League of Ohio, Wing passed the Ohio bar, allowing her to practice law within the state. After her stint in electoral politics, she applied her new legal credentials to gain the position of executive secretary at the Consumers‚Äô League of Ohio. From this position, she advocated for increased protections for women and children in the workforce. Under Wing's leadership, in 1933 Ohio passed a state minimum wage for women and ratified the federal child-labor amendment, though the amendment‚Äôs status is still pending. In 1937, Wing was hired as the first regional attorney for the Ohio, Kentucky, and Michigan region of the Social Security Administration. As regional attorney, she served as counsel to regional Social Security offices. She worked with legislators and lobbyists to tailor their current programs and create new offices, administrative bodies, and programs where necessary in order to fit the new demands of the New Deal. One responsibility which she held during her time as regional attorney was advising the central Social Security office on how to best pressure state and local officials into compliance. Among the non-compliant officials was Ohio governor Martin Davey, whose misappropriation of new Social Security-created positions to political allies and friends caused one of the Administration‚Äôs first compliance hearings. Wing was lauded as instrumental in advising this case, and was known as a ‚Äúhell-raiser‚Äù by Jack Tate, then the highest ranking attorney for the Administration, for her aggressive approach to non-compliant cases.  Retirement and death  In 1956, Wing retired from her legal practice, choosing to focus her energies more casually towards the founding and maintenance of community organizations such as the Community Action Program of Lake County, the Fine Arts Association, the Lake County Committee on Aging, and the Legal Services Association of Lake County. Her partner was Dorothy Smith, a lifetime social worker and fellow employee at the Cleveland Metropolitan YWCA in the 1920s. Smith died in 1976 at 84 years of age, while Wing died in 1982 at 97 years of age. They lived in Mentor, OH and had no children.

Koestner is an American activist against sexual assault. She came forward publicly after an alleged rape in 1990 that took place on William and Mary campus which involved her and her date. Koestner started speaking out about her experience in 1991 by lecturing at other college campuses to raise awareness. She also volunteered in rape crisis centers. She was featured in the media, including an HBO special, No Visible Bruises: The Katie Koestner Story (1993). Koestner's work and activism has helped the term \\"date rape\\" become part of the larger discussion around rape and sexual assault. Koestner founded several campus sexual assault prevention groups after graduating from the College of William & Mary in 1994. Koester is the current director of the Take Back the Night Foundation, president of Campus Outreach Services and serves as an adivisor for other organizations to help prevent rape and other forms of sexual violence .  Early life and assault  Koestner is from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In the fall of 1990, she enrolled in William and Mary (W&M;) where she planned to study chemical engineering and Japanese. Koestner was allegedly raped by a student she had been dating for just over a week. She had invited the student back to her dorm room after a date. and They had gone on a date to a French restaurant and Koestner wanted to spend time alone with him afterwards. After inviting him in, she says he began to pressure her to have sex with him, continuing to pressure until nearly dawn. She ended up being pinned against the wall by her date. Koestner said that she felt tired and weak after hours of arguing about sex and said, \\"He just wore me down all night. I couldn't do anything.\\" She said her date \\"climbed on top of her and had sex despite her protests.\\" She said she felt \\"paralyzed\\" and that \\"he had a ginormous ego, and had always had what he wanted in life\\". Koestner did not receive any kind of medical examination until 24 hours had passed. Her former date left her notes and friends tried to arrange a meeting between them, hoping things could be patched up between them. She met him in his dorm lounge where she confronted him and asked if he'd heard her say \\"no.\\" He countered by saying that he heard that Koestner's father was angry with her for no longer being a virgin and that they needed more practice together because she was a \\"little stiff the first time round.\\" Koestner also felt that her rape was not \\"taken seriously\\" by the school nurse who advised her to take sleeping pills and \\"rest the events off\\" instead of getting a rape kit. Instead of filing a police report, she was asked to pursue an administrative hearing at W&M.; The dean of students told her it was easier to pursue her complaint through the judicial process at the college. During the hearing, the alleged rapist said he heard Koestner say \\"no\\" at least 12 times that night. It was decided at the hearing that there should not be a severe punishment for the rape and the perpetrator was allowed to stay \\"on campus on the condition that he not enter anyone's living quarters.\\" There were \\"mitigating circumstances\\" according to administrators that allowed the alleged rapist to stay on campus. Publicity Because she felt a lack of support from her roommate and other women in her all-female dorm, within a couple of months after she was assaulted, Koestner moved to new quarters on campus. and Her parents were also unsupportive of her. Nevertheless, in 1991, Koestner came forward publicly and stated that she was the unnamed victim in the campus hearing of the rape. and The letter that she sent to her local paper trended nationwide. Koestner appeared on the cover of TIME magazine. She appeared on Larry King Live, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Jane Whitney Show, CNBC Talk Live, and was featured in the Washington Post. The publicity caused Governor Doug Wilder to ask officials involved in education in Virginia to study campus rape. and A few years after Koestner came forward publicly, W&M; changed their policies so that students found guilty of sexual assault are required to be suspended. Koestner faced backlash for her public story about the rape: she received prank phone calls and social stigma from other classmates. Koestner chose to come forward to give a human face to the issue of date rape and also because she felt like the academic hearing was a \\"second victimization.\\" and Koestner wanted justice. It was pointed out that while having a C average and being on academic probation could lead to expulsion, a decision that a rape occurred in the hearing did not lead to a similar punishment. The alleged rapist came forward anonymously in the press to state that he felt the situation was exaggerated: he had been convicted by the hearing of \\"emotionally pressuring, not physically forcing Koestner to have intercourse.\\" He also said that he believed that Koestner was falsely accusing him of rape because she \\"began to express regrets\\" about having intercourse. In 1991, Koestner transferred to Cornell University, but came back to W&M; after a year after the student who allegedly raped her had been expelled. Controversy over her paid role in a planned HBO dramatization about her experience led to the creation of a petition that asked for the \\"man's point of view\\" to be considered in the story. The leader of the petition campaign was the current girlfriend of Koestner's alleged rapist. and The petition signers said that the name of the alleged rapist was known on the small campus and that he would be \\"ruined.\\" The school paper received letters to the editor criticizing Koestner for not reporting the rape sooner. Koestner appeared in the HBO dramatization, No Visible Bruises: The Katie Koestner Story in 1993. No Visible Bruises was a 1/2 hour special that was part of HBO's series, Life Stories: Families in Crisis. Koestner started giving workshops about preventing sexual assault and also on sexual assault policies on college campuses. Her appearances were considered \\"divisive\\" by some students at the time. Koestner graduated from W&M; in 1994, majoring in public policy and women's studies. Groups Koestner founded the educational organization, Campus Outreach Services in 1994. She also founded Students Helping Others to Understand Trauma (SHOUT) at Cornell University and at W&M; started the Sexual Assault Companions Program. She also volunteered at a rape crisis center and became a certified peer-educator ad sexual assault counselor in Virginia. She became the executive director of the Take Back the Night Foundation. She has been published online and in print. It was Koestner's efforts that brought the concept and term \\"date rape\\" to public attention. Koestner was the first victim of date rape to publicly come forward about her experience.

It is part of Parque Warner Madrid. The attraction is inspired by the Chateau Marmont and takes place at the fictional Hotel Embrujado in Hollywood, California. The attraction takes riders into a seemingly ordinary banquet hall, and presents the riders with a fictional backstory of a bride left at the altar many years before, who then went towards the supernatural. Preshow Guests enter the abandoned hotel ride building through the derelict lobby. The lobby is covered in dust and draped with cobwebs. Walking past old paintings and statues, guests are ushered into the library, which houses the hotel's collection of books, and antiques. When they arrive the lights dim and two busts on either side of a massive mirror, above a fire, come to life and start discussing the disappearance of Eduardo the groom who vanished on his wedding night from the hotel. :\\"That night, Eduardo took refuge once again here ... among all these books. No wonder, a hotel library is a lonely place, that's why he liked to come here.\\" :\\"Something has changed in this place, I see the fire but I feel cold, I feel as if Isabel's soul possesses me and is melted with her shadows ... \\" As the statues tell the story of Eduardo and his fianc√© Isabel, the mirror begins to reflect the past and show the guests what happened. While Eduardo is going on about his reservations about marrying Isabel, guests see the fire from the mirror leap forwards and absorb Eduardo. The guests are then led into the banquet hall where Eduardo and Isabel were meant to wed. Decaying food, and rats liter the table. At the end, the corpse of Isabel still sits in her wedding dress waiting for Eduardo. :\\"It's a very special banquet that has not yet started. On a day that will never end. That's why I'm still here, waiting for my beloved. Waiting for Eduardo, for years... decades. With all of my love rotting in my heart.\\" The corpse of Isabel pulls herself off the table, and recounts her time waiting for Eduardo. While she does, the room starts spinning, guests are turned upside-down. In the end the ghost of Eduardo shows up, but quickly vanishes again. Angry Isabel curses everyone and banishes them from her wedding. Technical details The ride system for the Hotel Embrujado employs the haunter swing illusion, which uses optical and physical illusions to give riders a sense that they are repeatedly being turned upside down. Incidents On August 13, 2005, 23-year old Francisco Javier Infante, a Spanish man was hit in the head by a ride vehicle after allegedly forcing his way off the attraction. Park emergency personnel applied first aid procedures; the man was in critical condition. He was helicoptered to the hospital, where he later died due to his injuries. Infante's family went on to sue the park claiming they were negligent and that the lap bar was loose allowing him to slip out of the ride. When the case went to trial, to was ruled that the death was the parks fault, and charged the maintenance manager a fine of ‚Ç¨12,000, along with the supervisor of the security camera's a fine of ‚Ç¨3,600.

It covers three local government communities and elects a councillor to Powys County Council. Description The Yscir ward covers the sparsely populated communities of Merthyr Cynog, Trallong and Yscir, including the valleys of the Nant Br√¢n and Afon Ysgir. The River Usk partly borders the ward to the south. The Llanwrtyd Wells ward borders to the north, Maescar/Llywel to the west and Talybont-on-Usk to the south. The town of Brecon borders the southeast corner of the ward. According to the 2011 UK Census the population of the ward was 1,038. In early 2018 county councillor Iain McIntosh visited every house in the ward to sign a petition demanding high speed broadband. Yscir had some of the poorest internet connectivity in Wales. County elections Since the May 1995 local government election, it has been represented by one county councillor on Powys County Council. Councillor Dorothy Thomas, an Independent, represented the ward until 2017. She retired before the May 2017 elections. In May 2017 the ward made news by being the only ward in Wales not to hold an election, because no candidates had come forward for the vacant seat. This led to a second call for nominations and a by-election arranged to elect a new councillor. Six candidates came forward and, on 22 June 2017, Conservative Party candidate Iain McIntosh won the contest. McIntosh had stood unsuccessfully in Brecon's St John ward in May. Former Conservative, Steve Davies, stood as an Independent in the by-election and, with only 2 votes received possibly the lowest vote in any Powys Council election.

Ford Douglas (often spelled \\"Douglass\\" on government documents and in newspapers), was an abolitionist who promoted African-American emigration. He was a traveling speaker, political organizer, and newspaper proprietor. He later became the only black officer to command his own unit during the Civil War.Ripley, C. Peter, ed., \\"Exchange between H. Ford Douglas and William Howard Day\\" in The Black Abolitionist Papers (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1991), 4:80  Biography   Early life  H. Ford Douglas was born into slavery in Virginia, likely to a white father and black mother. He escaped at age 15 to Cleveland, Ohio, making a career as a barber. While he never received any formal education, Douglas was self-educated in classical studies.  1850s: Abolitionism and emigrationism  The Fugitive Slave Act passed in 1850, encouraging Douglas to join the growing ranks of black abolitionists who demanded immediate emancipation and complete equality in every sphere of life. He became heavily involved in black state conventions and gained fame as an abolitionist speaker. His positive view of black emigration developed from his increasing conviction that white Americans would never be persuaded to end slavery, let alone recognize blacks as their equals. In 1856, he became a proprietor of The Provincial Freeman, a newspaper published in Canada that served the substantial black community there, including many fugitive slaves who had escaped the U.S. via the Underground Railroad. Although Douglas stayed in Canada for brief periods between 1854 and 1858, he spent most of his time traveling across the U.S lecturing on the anti-slavery circuit. In 1857, he married Sattira \\"Sattie\\" Douglas (n√©e Steele) in Racine, Wisconsin, and the couple made their home in Chicago for the next several years.  Civil War and death  In 1862, Douglas defied racial restrictions by enrolling in Company G of the 95th Regiment of Illinois Infantry Volunteers before blacks were permitted to serve. After the Emancipation Proclamation allowed blacks to join the regular army, he left his regiment and went to Louisiana to await his new assignment. He devoted his time to lecturing and recruiting black soldiers during a long delay. Finally, in 1865, he was promoted to Captain and placed in charge of the Independent Battery, U.S. Colored Light Artillery, at Fort Leavenworth, becoming the only African American to command his own unit during the Civil War. He died from complications of malaria on November 11, 1865.  Political views  Douglas was a prominent supporter of the emigration movement, which encouraged blacks to move out of the United States to places like West Africa, Canada, and Central America. He was also a critic of the U.S. Constitution, believing support for slavery had been written into it from the beginning. He was a critic of Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party's inactivity on the issue of slavery.  References  Further reading *  External links  * H.

It was once thought to be a population of the West African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus) but was elevated to a species after two detailed studies, one in 2014 and the other in 2018. The species was described in 1835 on the basis of a specimen that had died at the London Zoo and had been claimed to have been collected in the Fernando Po. Studies of specimens and their molecular sequences established that there were two different species which occurred in distinct hydrological zones. M. leptorhynchus is easily differentiated morphologically from M. cataphractus by the absence of a round tubercle or boss on the squamosal scale at the back of the head in the former and present in the latter. Skin of a specimen from Gabon Etymology The generic name Mecistops is most probably derived from the Ancient Greek words ŒºŒÆŒ∫ŒπœÉœÑ (mƒìkist ) meaning \\"longest\\" and ·ΩÑœàŒπœÇ (√≥psis) meaning \\"aspect\\" or \\"appearance\\". The specific name leptorhynchus is derived from the Ancient Greek words ŒªŒµœÄœÑœåœÇ (lept√≥s) meaning \\"slender\\" and ·ø•œçŒ≥œáŒøœÇ (rh√Ωnchos) meaning \\"snout\\". Bennett (1835) may have named the species so because he found it had a longer head width:head length ratio than M. cataphractus, 3:1 versus 2.5:1. Although an analysis of 93 skulls, mainly belonging to mature individuals, by Shirley et al. (2018) found a head width:head length ratio of 2.25:1 for M. cataphractus and 2.37:1 for M. leptorhynchus. Taxonomy Gray (1844) listed Mecistops leptorhynchus as a synonym of M. bennettii even though the former has temporal priority. M. bennettii was subsumed as a junior synonym of M. leptorhynchus in Gray's Synopsis of the Species of Recent Crocodilians as he found that the type specimen of M. bennettii (NHMUK 1977.444) is actually an adult M. leptorhynchus. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) does not allow the specific epithet (species name) to be changed upon removal to a new genus unless it already exists in the new genus. Since Mecistops was a new genus at the time of its description, M. bennettii is a nomen novum (replacement name). Shirley et al. (2018) found that the type specimen of M. bennettii is morphologically and geographically readily assignable to M. cataphractus so they synonymized M. bennettii with M. cataphractus. Shirley et al. (2018) also designated M. cataphractus as the type species of Mecistops in accordance with Articles 69 and 70 of the ICZN. Article 67.9 of the ICZN states \\"If a validly fixed type species is later found to have been misidentified, the provisions of Article 70.3 apply.\\" Article 70.3 in turn states \\"If an author discovers that a type species was misidentified, the author may select, and thereby fix as type species, the species that will, in his or her judgment, best serve stability and universality, either.\\" M. cataphractus best serves stability because it is the most well-studied species of Mecistops with the most readily recognizable and assignable type material. It also has the widest use in the scientific literature. Distribution Central African slender-snouted crocodile occurs widely in Central Africa (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, northern Angola, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo) and extends into South Sudan in East Africa.

Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the \\"Three Pillars of Misery\\": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact. At the start of the episode, each contestant relates a story of his/her own whose rating is not immediately revealed. Round 1: Misery Lane Two hypothetical situations are presented to the teams, and the contestant whose story has earned the higher Misery Index rating from the panel plays first. Each team must decide whether its contestant's story falls above, below, or between the two situations; a correct choice wins $500. Round 2: More or Less Miserable The trailing contestant (or the one who did not start Round 1 in case of a tie) plays first. Each team is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess. Round 3: Master of Misery One miserable story is presented to both teams, and the contestants separately and secretly lock in their guesses at its Index rating. The one whose guess is closer to the actual rating wins $2,000 and advances to the bonus round with his/her teammates. An exact guess doubles the value to $4,000. However, if the two guesses are identical or equally distant from the actual rating, another story is played as a tiebreaker with the same $2,000/$4,000 at stake. Bonus Round: Margin of Misery The winning contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows. *First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points *Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points *Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story. He/she may choose one Tenderloin teammate for assistance. Before the third story is revealed, the other three Tenderloins join the contestant onstage to provide moral support. The maximum potential winnings total is $35,500, obtained by guessing correctly in each of the first two rounds, winning $4,000 for an exact guess in the third, and successfully covering the actual Index rating of all three stories in the bonus round.

A learner's motivation towards knowledge as an object influences their knowledge acquisition. In interpersonal relations, epistemic motivation is the desire to process information thoroughly, and thus grasp the meaning behind other people's emotions. In group settings, epistemic motivation can be defined as participants' willingness to expend effort to achieve a thorough, rich, and accurate understanding of the world, including the group task, or decision problem at hand, and the degree to which group members tend to systematically process and disseminate information.  Lay Epistemic Theory  Epistemic motivation derives from the broader theory of lay epistemics, which addresses the processes in which individuals form their knowledge in regards to varied topics, such as all possible contents of knowledge, including attitudes, beliefs, causal attributions, impressions, opinions, statistical inferences, and stereotypes. The theory assumes that much of social conduce, affect, or cognition is related to what people know, or feel they know, about various matters. Under the umbrella of Lay Epistemic Theory (LET), research on factors involved in a general knowledge formation process have been conducted for over thirty years. LET inspired three separate, but interrelated, research programs: the need for cognitive closure, the unimodel of social judgment, and epistemic authority. Since the 1980's, one of the most prominent researchers in epistemics has been social psychologist Arie W. Kruglanski, who has authored numerous publications over the years, with particular contributions to cognitive closure.  Need for cognitive closure  A main assumption of LET is that knowledge, or conclusions, comes from evidence. This conclusion can also be thought of as a hypothesis that is supported by evidence. In theory, a person can continue testing hypotheses indefinitely, without ever solidifying knowledge. Therefore, people may form judgments quickly, based on available evidence. This occurs through the mechanism of cognitive closure. The need for cognitive closure is an epistemic motivation that advances knowledge formation and has widely ramifying consequences for individual, interpersonal, and group phenomena.  Nonspecific vs. specific closure  This need for cognitive closure has been categorized into two sub-types, referred to as the needs for nonspecific, and specific, closure. * Nonspecific closure refers to a desire for a firm answer to a question, as opposed to confusion or ambiguity. * Specific closure refers to a desire to acquire a specific, personally desirable, answer to a question. Both needs may vary in degree, and lie on a continuum. Therefore, a person may want closure strongly, moderately, or not at all.  Seizing and Freezing  An elevated need for closure prompts the tendency to \\"seize\\" on initial evidence and then \\"freeze\\" on the judgments it suggests. Time pressure has been found to increase participants' tendency to seize on \\"anchors\\" provided before a task, while fear of invalidity reduced this behavior.  The unimodel of social judgement  The unimodel investigates the process of new knowledge formation from the information given, and focuses on the evidential basis of all knowledge. It includes both cognitive and motivational factors, which affect informational impact.  Resource availability  If the resources to process information are limited, then the information that is easier to process will have a higher likelihood to be utilized, and to affect judgements to a higher degree, than the information that is difficult to process. Conversely, when processing resources are plentiful, then the difficult to process information will be utilized more to the extent that it is seen to be of greater relevance than the easily processable information.  Epistemic authority  Epistemic authority refers to a source that an individual may depend on for knowledge acquisition. The work on epistemic authority highlights the centrality, and special role of social source effects, including the self as a source, in the knowledge formation process.  Multi-disciplinary impact  Epistemic motivation has been utilized by researchers and professionals across multiple areas of study, from cognitive science, to emotions and organizational behavior, to creativity & innovation, and politics and public policy, to highlight only a few.  Information processing  Information can be processed in a quick and effortless, heuristic way, or, in an effortful, deliberate, and systematic way. Which style of information processing an individual will engage in, depends on their epistemic motivation. Heightened epistemic motivation has been shown to decrease the selective use of information, discourage the use of stereotypes and heuristics, focus information search on diagnostic information, reduce the tendency to reject divergent opinions, and increase the tendency to engage in systematic information processing. An experiment in the Netherlands showed that groups under process accountability experienced a greater need for more information, repeated unshared information more frequently, and more often chose the correct decision alternative. Further analyses showed that epistemic motivation produced high quality decisions due to the fact that it stimulated systematic information processing. Higher levels of epistemic motivation led groups to initially doubt the sufficiency of information available to them, and for groups with higher levels of epistemic motivation, their group discussions resulted in better decision quality, as compared to groups that had lower levels of epistemic motivation.  Emotions  Epistemic motivation may influence the processing of information conveyed by emotional displays. Researchers demonstrated, both in the lab and in the field, that negotiators only used the task-relevant information, provided by their opponents‚Äô emotions, to inform their negotiation strategies when they were sufficiently epistemically motivated. Additional research found that a leader's emotional displays influence their team‚Äôs performance. In particular, their team's performance is influenced by the extent to which happiness versus anger is conveyed by the leader. Members' use of their own emotions, as guides for their own behavior, is also determined by the team‚Äôs level of epistemic motivation. Hence, members' using their own emotions, as guides for their own behavior, are more likely when their epistemic motivation is low, as opposed to instead guiding their behavior according to the emotional displays of their leader, which are more likely when their epistemic motivation is high. The effectiveness of the leader's displays of happiness or anger are also determined by the team‚Äôs epistemic motivation. For example, the tendency for team performance to improve after a leader displays happiness is stronger when teams are low in epistemic motivation, because they are guided by their affective reactions. Conversely, the tendency for teams to perform better following leader displays of anger are stronger when teams are high in epistemic motivation, because they are guided by their performance inferences. When teams have high epistemic motivation, their members will pay attention to the meaning of emotion, and the task-relevant information pathway will be more potent. When teams have low epistemic motivation, their members will passively contract emotions, and the affective reactions pathway will be more powerful. Mental fatigue and time pressure during stressful periods also impact emotional processing, by making team members more likely to simply react to a leader's mood, than to think carefully about his or her message. A 2015 study found that individuals high in epistemic motivation were more sensitive to negative emotional stimuli than individuals with low epistemic motivation, in an interpersonal, decision-making task.  Creativity and innovation  Group creativity and innovation are both considered a function of epistemic motivation. Characteristics that are associated with low levels of epistemic motivation, such as the need for closure, or the fear of invalidity, negatively correlate with individual creativity. Conversely, characteristics that are associated with high epistemic motivation, such as openness to experience, high rather than low need for cognition, and low, rather than high, need for structure and aversion ambiguity, correlate positively with many indicators of creativity. Thus, groups populated by individuals with high openness to experience, high need for cognition, or low ambiguity aversion can be expected to have higher average epistemic motivation and, therefore, to engage in more, rather than less, systematic and deliberate information search and processing, leading to higher creativity and innovation. Similar results have been reported at the group-level. Research has found that group members working on a joint task displayed greater levels of creativity when they had low, rather than high, needs for nonspecific closure, or when time pressure was mild, rather than acute. Focusing on group heterogeneity, researchers found that teams with transformational leaders, and greater educational specialization heterogeneity, displayed greater team creativity. These findings suggest that individual members of groups become more creative when they have high, rather than low, epistemic motivation. To the extent that group-level creativity is the combined output of individual performances, groups can be expected to become more creative, as the group's average epistemic motivation is enhanced. A study in the Netherlands found that participants with high epistemic motivation exhibited greater fluency, originality, and flexibility after receiving angry, rather than neutral, feedback on an idea generation task, whereas those with low epistemic motivation were less creative after receiving angry feedback. These effects were mediated by task engagement and motivation, which anger increased amongst participants with high epistemic motivation. Conversely, anger decreased task engagement and motivation amongst participants with low epistemic motivation. Other research has found that people with high epistemic motivation may be less inclined to disengage from creative, idea-generation tasks, when faced with interfering expressions of anger, than their less epistemically motivated counterparts.  System justification  The epistemic motivation of the need for cognitive closure has been linked with uncertainty motivation and the personal need for structure. Evidence suggests that those who are generally tolerant of ambiguity and uncertainty are less likely to use stereotypes as a manner in which to rationalize inequality and preserve the status quo. Evidence has been presented that connects epistemic motivation to authoritarianism, dogmatism, political conservatism, and social stereotyping. For example, the personal need for structure is associated with the formation of erroneous group stereotypes. Epistemic motives then exacerbate these stereotypes, as a method for rationalizing outcomes and justifying inequality. One study's finding that conservative ideologies promote the justification of economic inequality was also supported by follow up research. There are some findings to suggest that epistemic motivation, specifically the needs for closure and certainty, make good partners with ideologies that are traditional, conservative, or right-wing. However, research also shows that epistemic motivation can lead people to adhere more strongly to their original ideological positions, either politically left or right. Furthermore, counter to much of the research that has linked epistemic motivation to the right, a group of researchers found in their study that the need for closure was most strongly associated with policy conservatism among people who symbolically identified as liberals, or for whom liberal considerations were made salient.  Etymology  Epistemology is the area of philosophy dealing with the theory of knowledge. The term derives from the Ancient Greek word \\"epistƒìmƒì\\", that refers to knowledge, science, or understanding.  References   External links  * Motivated Cognition Lab.

Barstow's A Bit of Catskill Woods was in the collection of American art patron Thomas B. Clarke between 1872 and 1879.\\"Weinberg, Barbara. Thomas B. Clarke: Foremost Patron of American Art from 1872 to 1899,\\" American Art Journal, Vol. 8, No. 1 (May, 1976) At the time, women artists did not have the same opportunities to exhibit their work as male artists did, so her work remained relatively little known until art historians began to reassess women artists of the Hudson River School. Her work was included in the 2010 survey exhibition \\"Remember the Ladies: Women of the Hudson River School\\" at the Thomas Cole National Historic Site in Catskill, New York and the 2019 exhibition \\"The Color of the Moon: Lunar Painting in American Art\\" at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, New York, where Barstow was a featured artist alongside works by Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, and George Inness, among others. Barstow, an early member of the Appalachian Mountain Club, was an avid hiker who climbed hundreds of mountains in New York and New England ‚Äî including all the principal peaks of the Catskills, White Mountains, and Adirondacks ‚Äî as well as in Europe (the Alps and the Black Forest). She often went on expeditions along the Hudson River and in the mountains that combined hiking with sketching and painting. Finding women's dress of the era cumbersome and impractical, Barstow developed a hiking costume that included sturdy boots and shortened skirts paired with trousers (a combination advocated by the rational dress movement). Barstow never married. Her niece Susie B. Skelding also became an artist and illustrator, and the two went on sketching expeditions together.

The specific epithet majus means \\"larger\\". The plant has a diploid number of 16. Taxonomy Hypericum majus is a more northern relative of Hypericum pauciflorum. H. majus differs from its relative in its annual habit, thinner leaves, smaller flowers, and doubly branching inflorescence. In the past the species was the western part of a vicariant species including the more eastern Hypericum canadense. The two species became sympatric when north-eastern North America became glaciated and the two now hybridize, most notably in Wisconsin. Hybrids of the two species are shorter than H. majus and have leaves of intermediate length, width, and vein number. H. majus also hybridizes with Hypericum mutilum subsp. mutilum in Maine and with Hypericum mutilum subsp. boreale in Wisconsin and Michigan. The hybrid of latter can be distinguished by its intermediate seed capsule shape, similar to H. √ó dissimulatum though with more broad leaves. Description Hypericum majus is a perennial bearing short leafy shoots with solitary or tufted stems. The erect and stout herb grows tall and has a taproot. The roots are fibrous and lack rhizomes or runners but can grow short offshoots in autumn. The four- angled, squarish, green stems can become ancipitous. The stems tend to branch more in the upper half of the plant but branches can grow from the lower half when the terminal meristem is damaged. The internodes are , the upper of which can exceed the leaves. The simple or opposite, lanceolate leaves are long and wide. Leaves are erect or spreading, planar, and chartaceous. The leaves have acute to rounded apices, cuneate bases, and an entire margin. The upper leaves have five to seven veins arising from their rounded, sessile or clasping base. The basal leaves are more purplish and crowded, and measure long and wide. The tertiary reticulation is dense as are the laminar glands that create the punctiform pattern. The terminal inflorescence is three to thirty flowered. The branching of the inflorescence is mostly dichasial, with ascending pairs of flowering branches rising five nodes below. The entire inflorescence is corymbiform to cylindric, though in smaller plants the inflorescence is a simple, nearly naked cyme. The cymes are subtended by slender bracts measuring long. Pedicels are long and the star-shaped flowers are wide, with the central flower being the largest. The sepals are lance-attenuate, measuring long and wide. Two sepals are typically longer and wider than the other three. Sepals have three to five veins, with a visible midvein, and lack the punctiform glands. The golden yellow, occasionally tinged pink petals are long and wide, equal or shorter than the sepals. The twelve to twenty-one stamens are obscurely five-fascicled, the longest measuring . The sessile pistil is about long, ovoid in shape. The ovoid to ellipsoid ovary is long and wide. The three carpels are at first distinct and become indistinct. The three styles are long. The capsule is conic-ellipsoid, measuring long and wide. The seeds are long. H. majus can be distinguished from other small-flowered Hypericum species by its leaves with five to seven veins. The herb flowers from June to September. Habitat and distribution Hypericum majus grows in wet or dry open soil in bogs, marshes, ditches, meadows, woodlands, and other damp habitats. It prefers elevations between . The herb occurs in New Brunswick and Quebec to southern British Columbia. To the south it is distributed from Maine to Washington and as far south as Colorado, Kansas, and Ohio. It was introduced into France by 1955, into Germany by 1948, and into Japan by 1974, though the method of introduction is unknown.

In 2000 Smoke Signals' coverage of recovering Native American remains was quoted. In 2002 editor Brent Merrill was highlighted in an Oregonian article for his walk to commemorate the Trail of Tears. A 2005 Oregonian story quoted Smoke Signals' editor on the propriety of using Indian-related terms and slurs in naming sports teams. A 2018 newspaper article published in Texas noted Smoke Signals' name as an example of creative naming to tie a newspaper to its local community.

The caves are notable for their past fossil finds, particularly of hominins. They were explored in 1829 by Philippe-Charles Schmerling, who discovered, in the lower cave, the remains of two individuals, one of which, now known as Engis 2, was a fossil of the first Neanderthal ever found; the other was a Neolithic homo sapiens. Also known as Tr√¥ Cwaheur or Trou Caheur, this lower cave has since collapsed. A third cave was destroyed because of work on the adjacent quarry, the Ancienne Carri√®re des Awirs. The caves have been classified on the list of sites since 1978, as well as since 2013, because of the Neanderthal fossil.  Name, location, and finds  View of the Awirs quarry, with overhanging Plateau des Fagnes in the valley of Awirs, on the right bank of the stream, coming from the confluence with the Meuse. The caves are to the right of the quarry. Schmerling named the caves for Engis because he accessed them from the Plateau des Fagnes, which is in the Engis commune. He was able to reach them by lowering himself with a rope and sliding down the slope of the rock face. The caves themselves are actually within the boundaries of the commune of Awirs.Biens class√©s et Zones de protection, R√©gion wallonne, La biodiversit√© en Wallonie: Ancienne Carri√®re des Awirs In 1951, a local group \\"corrected\\" the error by placing a plaque at the lower cave, identifying it as the Schmerling Cave. Schmerling thought he had found the remains of three people in the caves. In the vicinity, he also found tools fashioned by humans. The tools and the carvings made with silex led him to argue that \\"antediluvian\\" man's hands must have been responsible even if human remains hadn't been found; Schmerling was thus one of the first to accept the existence of a prehistoric human. The child's skull was not identified as Neanderthal until 1936. A monument for Schmerling, consisting of a bust on a base made of stone, was erected at the foot of the hill in 1989; it was moved to the town square of Awirs in 2001.

After the death of Patr. Peter of Jerusalem in 544, a group of Origenist monks in Jerusalem elected Marcarius II, an Origenist, the Patriarch of Jerusalem. However, emperor Justinian, who was staunchly Orthodox, favored Eustochius, who was Oeconomus of the Church of Alexandria although he lived in Constantinople. In 552, Justinian ordered Macarius dethroned and appointed Eustochius to replace him. At the Fifth Ecumenical Council of 553 in Constantinople, Eustochius did not attend but was represented by three legates: Bishops Stephanus of Raphia, Georgius of Tiberias, and Damasus of Sozusa or Sozytana [1]. At the council, not only were the \\"Three Chapters\\" associated with Monophysitism condemned, but also Origenism. Eustochius then called later in 553 a local council in Jerusalem during which all the bishops of Palestine, except for Alexander of Abila, confirmed the Fifth Council's verdicts. Yet, despite these efforts by Eustochius, opposition rose against the verdicts of the Constantinople Council among the monasteries, opposition led by the monks of the New Lavra, one of the monasteries founded by St. Sabbas. In 555, Eustochius, in a forceful effort, that was aided by dux Anastasius, assaulted the Lavra, drove some sixty monks from the monastery, and replaced them with monks from other Orthodox monasteries of the desert. While he may have thought he had ended the opposition by the monastics, Eustochius' action did not end the Monophysite and Origenist resistance. In 564, Eustochius was deposed and Macarius II again became patriarch. The date of his repose is not known.

She was born in Salzburg, Austria, but spent the better part of her childhood in Italy where she was introduced to art. She moved to the United States, first to Washington, D.C. in 1971 and then to New Mexico in 1992. By the late 1990s, she had settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and her paintings are a part of many public collections, including in Minnesota at the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Weisman Art Museum.  Early life  Blondell was born in Salzburg, Austria in 1953 to an American father and an Austrian mother. In 1957, she moved to Italy, where she lived until she was 18. In Italy, her father taught her how to draw, and she explored European art while traveling with her parents. Her interest and education in art was heavily influenced by seventeenth and nineteenth century artists such as Artemisia Gentileschi, Caravaggio, and Francisco Goya.  Art  Blondell's works reflect a narrative style inspired by early art. Although her art is generally considered contemporary, she often quotes images from art history. She combines references to the past with a newer genre. Examples of her historical quoting include Urban American Gothic] (2008), which references Grant Wood's American Gothic from 1930. She also references historical and biblical stories such as Judith beheading Holofernes in her 1999 watercolor painting I'll Make You Shorter By a Head. Many of the subjects in Blondell's paintings are inspired by her friends and acquaintances. Blondell's contemporary paintings often contain themes related to feminism and activism. In her painting Urban American Gothic (2008), she hints at the same-sex couple in the painting with a human rights logo on the cap. She represents women's empowerment through paintings like These Boots Are Made For Walking (2007). Many of these paintings celebrate women and womanhood.  Collections and Exhibitions  Aside from private collections, Blondell's work can be found in the permanent collections at the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Weisman Art Museum. She also has public paintings in Hennepin County. These include Helping Hands at the Hennepin County Commissioners Office (2000) and the Hennepin County History Mural at the Hennepin County Government Center (2000).

Its nearest higher peak is Cirque Peak, to the northwest. Dolomite Peak can be seen from the Icefields Parkway with its distinctive crags and colorful towers that are a mixture of dolomite and limestone. Dolomite is rare in the Rockies and is stronger than limestone.  History Dolomite Peak was named in 1897 by Charles E. Fay, Norman Collie, and Charles Thompson for its resemblance to the Dolomites of the Italian Alps. The mountain's name became official in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of Dolomite Peak was made in 1930 by J. Monroe Thorington, with Peter Kaufmann (as guide). Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Dolomite Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Dolomite Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Dolomite Peak drains into the Bow River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing this peak.

He formerly served as CEO and Chairman of the company, and currently serves on the company's board of directors.  Early life and education  Wang was born in Beijing, China, in 1972. His father, Wang Hua (Ê±™Âçé), was a diplomat, investment banker and businessman in France. His grandfather, Wang Dezhao, was a prominent physicist and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Wang graduated from Affiliated High School of Peking University in Beijing. He attended Panth√©on-Assas University (University of Paris II) in Paris where he later got his law degree.  Career  As a law student in Paris in 1996, Wang, along with two high school classmates, created a web portal called SRSNet. This became the prototype for Sina.com, which was put online in 1998 after a merger of SRSNet and SinaNet, a Chinese language web site in the US. As the General Manager of China Operations, Wang was involved in taking Sina public in April 2000, where it was the first ever Mainland Chinese Internet company to be listed on Nasdaq. He served as Sina's president in 2001, and as CEO in May 2003. During Wang's tenure as CEO and President, Sina had become a dominant Internet portal with the largest online advertisement market share in China according to IResearch Consulting Group while pursuing aggressive mergers & acquisitions. In 2003, it emerged as the first profitable public-listing internet group in China by changing into a series of new business opportunities besides online advertising, such as mobile content service of which annual revenue significantly improved in 2004. Under Wang's leadership, Sina started to tap into social media amid fierce competition from rivals. In 2005, Sina Blog was launched which eventually paved the way for the birth of Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like micro-blogging platform that would later reach 431 million monthly active users in June 2018. In 2005, Wang's refusal and resistance to the hostile takeover by Shanda attracted world-wide attention The takeover was considered as \\"the first hostile takeover by a leading China-based company of a local rival\\". After Wang's strong opposition to the deal and Sina's Board's issuance of \\"poison pill\\", Shanda backed off.. Wang stepped down from CEO in May 2006. Sina's rapid expansion left a number of failed attempts, especially in trying to develop online gaming, e-commerce, and search technologies. These were believed to have led to Wang's stepping down as the Chief Executive. In an interview, he admitted some of the mistakes he had made. Afterwards, he stayed on the company's board where he has served in various positions including Acting Chairman and Chairman., succeeded by Charles Chao in October 2012. He remains on the company's board of directors. Political and social ventures Wang serves as a member of the Central Committee and the head of the IT industry commission of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), one of China's eight non-communist democratic political parties. In 2006, the IT industry commission of CNDCA submitted the \\"Personal Information and Data Protection Bill\\", Wang animated its congressional debate in order to push for its enactment. With the coverage of the nation-wide network of CNDCA, Wang founded in 2007 the Yangfan Charity Program (became in 2012 Sina Yangfan Charity Foundation), a non-profit, charitable organization dedicated to provide educational resources for under-privileged children in rural areas of China. By 2016, the foundation has donated more than 2 million books. In 2004, Wang was one of the 10 founding members of the Society Entrepreneur Ecology (SEE) Foundation, a non-governmental organization initiated by Chinese entrepreneurs committed to ecological environmental protection in China.

He assumed the titles General Fuhan (\\"assisting Han\\") and Governor of Shu Commandery and of Yi Province (which included most of modern Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, and Yunnan). The following year, he declared himself the King of Shu under the Han empire, with Chengdu as his capital. In the fourth month (May or June in Western calendar) of 25 AD, Gongsun Shu declared himself emperor in defiance of Gengshi, whose throne was being threatened by the forces of Liu Xiu. He named his self-declared empire as Chengjia and adopted the era name Longxing (ÈæçËàà, \\"Dragon Rising\\"). A few months later, Liu Xiu proclaimed himself Emperor Guangwu of the restored Han dynasty (Eastern Han).  Expansion and consolidation  Chengjia initially only had direct control of the Sichuan basin. Soon Ren Gui () took control of Yuesui Commandery (modern southern Sichuan and northern Yunnan) and submitted to Chengjia. Gongsun Shu sent general Hou Dan () to take over Hanzhong in the north and Ren Man () to Jiangzhou (modern Chongqing) to the east, and took control of the entire Yi Province of the Han dynasty. Other rebel forces who were defeated by Emperor Guangwu, most importantly Yan Cen () and Tian Rong (), also submitted to Chengjia. The warlord Wei Ao (or Wei Xiao), who controlled eastern Gansu and was under constant pressure from the Eastern Han, submitted to Chengjia. Gongsun Shu bestowed on Wei Ao the title King of Shuoning, and sent a force to support him. At the time, Emperor Guangwu was embroiled in the civil war engulfing much of China, and Gongsun Shu's advisor proposed attacking Han while it was still weak. However, despite Chengjia's vast territory, its population comprised only 7% of China's total at the time, and Gongsun Shu rejected the proposal. Still, Chengjia remained Han's most dangerous rival, and Guangwu took care not to antagonize Gongsun Shu, even addressing him as \\"emperor\\" in his letters.  Demise  Chengjia remained independent for more than ten years, owing to the natural defenses enjoyed by the Sichuan basin, and the unsettled conditions in the newly established Eastern Han. In 34, Emperor Guangwu conquered Gansu, held by Wei Chun, the son and successor of Wei Ao. Chengjia sent general Li Yu () with a force of more than 10,000 to assist Wei Chun, to no avail. After Guangwu conquered the rest of China, he dispatched a force led by Cen Peng () to conquer Chengjia. Below the Three Gorges on the Yangtze, Chengjia's eastern frontier, Chengjia forces built a floating bridge across the river mounted with war towers, linking fortifications on both banks. In April or May of 35, aided by favourable easterly wind, Han naval forces sailed upstream to the bridge and attacked it with torches. The wooden bridge caught fire and burned down, removing the obstacle to Han invasions by water. Despite the initial success, the Han campaign was slow and difficult because of natural obstacles. Moreover, Chengjia sent assassins who managed to kill general Lai Xi () and then Cen Peng, chief commander of the Han forces, which were subsequently led by Wu Han and Zang Gong (). The Han forces reached Chengdu in December of 36, with only a week's supplies left. They were on the verge of accepting failure and withdrawing, when Gongsun Shu decided to personally lead an attack on the Han forces on 24 December. Wounded in the battle, he died in the night, and the defenders of Chengdu under Marshal Yan Cen surrendered the following day, marking the end of Chengjia. Two days later, Wu Han granted his soldiers permission to loot Chengdu and burn down the imperial palace. He massacred Gongsun's extended family including his wife and children, as well as Yan Cen and his family. Many other people were also killed. The court musicians of Chengjia were later sent to the Han capital Luoyang.  Government  Gongsun Shu modelled his government after that of the Han dynasty, and appointed his advisor Li Xiong and his younger brothers, Guang and Hui, as the Three Excellencies. Gongsun Guang was the Grand Marshal (sima), Gongsun Hui the Minister of Works (sikong), and Li Xiong the Minister of the Masses (situ). After Yan Cen and Tian Rong submitted to Chengjia, Yan was appointed Grand Marshal and enfeoffed as King of Runing (), and Tian was enfeoffed as King of Yijiang ().  Coinage  An iron Wu Zhu coin of Chengjia, inscribed with the words Wu Zhu Gongsun Shu abolished Han dynasty copper coins and issued his own Wu Zhu coins for Chengjia, which resemble the Han Wu Zhu coins but are made of iron, possibly because Sichuan was then China's dominant producer of the metal. However, the change of currency proved unpopular with the people.

Although he was a prominent military commander and held important offices, most details of his life are unknown. He received his first estates in the southern regions of Antioch in the 1110s. He made the strong fortress of Margat the center of his domains. He regularly witnessed the Antiochene rulers' diplomas from the 1120s. He was most probably still the actual ruler of the principality when he died.  Early career  Rainald's origins and family are unknown, but he was most probably born in France. He may have received the fortress of Baniyas (near Jabala) shortly after it was captured by Antiochene troops in May 1109, according to historian Thomas Asbridge. Rainald persuaded the commander of Margat to surrender the fortress to him, along with the nearby forts Maniqa, Qulay'ah and Hadid in 1118 or 1119. Their possession secured the Franks' control of the mainland routes between Antioch and the County of Tripoli. Marqat developed into the center of Rainald's domains. The Artuqid emir, Ilghazi, and the atabeg (or governor) of Damascus, Toghtekin, invaded Antioch in the spring of 1119. Roger of Salerno, who had ruled the principality since 1112, sent envoys to Baldwin II of Jerusalem, seeking his assistance. Urged by the Antiochene marcher lords, Roger decided not to wait until the arrival of the Jerusalemite troops and led his troops to meet the enemy near the borders. He ordered Rainald to lead \\"three divisions of troops\\" to Sarmada, most probably because he wanted to encircle the invaders' camp. Ilghazi and his allies almost annihilated the Antiochene army in the Battle of the \\"Field of Blood\\" on 28 June. Rainald was seriously wounded in the battlefield and withdrew to Sarmada together with his few retainers who survived the massacre. Ilghazi approached Sarmada and promised to release Rainald a month later if Rainald did not resist. After Ilghazi gave his ring to Rainald as a guarantee, Rainald surrendered the fortress without resistance.  Great officer  Baldwin II reached Antioch weeks after the battle. He was elected baillif (or regent) for the absent and minor prince, Bohemond II. Baldwin II's charter of grant to the Abbey of Our Lady of Josaphat which was issued in 1122 is the first extant document which was witnessed by Rainald. He was listed as the last among the witnesses. Bohemond II assumed the government of the principality in October 1126. He confirmed the privileges of the Genoese in 1127. Bohemond's diploma refers to Rainald as constable, showing that Rainald had already been appointed to that office. Rainald signed the document as the first among the lay witnesses. He is the only lay landholder who was elevated to a great office in the principality in the 12th century. The Assassins stirred up a riot at Bikisrail in 1131. He hurried to the region to mediate a settlement, but the Assassins could not be pacified for long. They seized Qadmus in the mountains two years later. Bohemond II's widow, Alice of Jerusalem, claimed the regency for her minor daughter, Constance of Antioch, against her brother-in-law, Fulk, King of Jerusalem in 1132. Pons, Count of Tripoli, Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, and the powerful Antiochene barons, William of Zardana and Garenton of Saone supported her, but Fulk came to Antioch and defeated her supporters near Chastel Rouge. Before leaving the principality, Fulk made Rainald his baillif. Rainald's activities cannot be documented after around 1135. His son, Rainald II Masoir, married Pons of Tripoli's daughter, Agnes. His descendants were the most influential barons of the principality for decades. Their domains included most of the southern region of the principality.

It is an epiphytic orchid with two leaves joined at the base and that grows in clumps. Greenish white or yellowish flowers are borne on an often hanging spike. It grows on trees and cliff faces usually on ranges near the coast of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. Description Liparis coelogynoides is an epiphytic herb with oval to almost spherical pseudobulbs and wide. There are usually two linear to narrow egg-shaped, pale green, stalkless leaves, , wide and folded lengthwise. Between eight and twenty greenish white or yellowish flowers, long and wide are borne on an often hanging flowering stem long. The sepals are all free from each other, long, about wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are long and about wide. The labellum is wedge-shaped, bends downwards, long and wide with irregular teeth on the edge. Flowering occurs between November and March. Taxonomy and naming The fairy sphinx orchid was first formally described in 1860 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Sturmia coelogynoides and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The description was based on a collection made by Ludwig Becker near the headwaters of the Clarence River. In 1873, George Bentham changed the name to Liparis coelogynoides and published the change in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (coelogynoides) refers to the similarity of this species to orchids in the genus Coelogyne - the ending -oides is a Latin suffix meaning \\"like\\", \\"resembling\\" or \\"having the form of\\". Distribution and habitat Liparis coelogynoides is widespread and common, growing on trees and rocky escarpments in rainforest between the Bunya Mountains in Queensland and the Hunter River in New South Wales.

The Honourable Richard Tracey and Ms Lynelle Briggs were appointed as Royal Commissioners. The Commissioners are required to provide an interim report by 31 October 2019, and a final report by 30 April 2020. Tracey died of cancer in October 2019 and was replaced by Tony Pagone. Background In February 2016, a male patient of the South Australian government-run Oakden Older Persons Mental Health Service, located in , South Australia, was referred to the Royal Adelaide Hospital after it was discovered that he had very significant bruising to his hip for which there was no satisfactory explanation. The man's family made increasingly levels of complaints about the level of treatment provided to government authorities; with increasing levels of frustration. At a 2018 Senate inquiry it was revealed that several incidents at the home were referred to police, and coronial inquiries into the deaths of residents were initiated. The Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (ICAC) in 2018 reported damning findings of maladministration against five individuals and Oakden. Former South Australian mental health minister Leesa Vlahos was severely criticised by the ICAC Commissioner. His report painted a picture of life for some of the most vulnerable members of society who were ‚Äúpoorly cared for, forgotten and ignored‚Äù. Oakden closed in 2017 after it was revealed that a patient with Parkinson‚Äôs disease was beaten by another resident at the Oakden nursing home at least thirteen times between December 2016 and March 2017 and did not receive recorded medical care, despite that the matter had been reported to the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency. On 25 July 2016, ABC News 7.30 television current affairs program broadcast hidden video camera evidence of a September 2015 incident. The video revealed that it appeared that a staff member at the Mitcham Residential Care Facility, also in Adelaide, attempted to suffocate an 89-year-old man, prompting calls to legalise the installation of cameras in the private rooms of aged care facilities. On the eve of the September 2018 broadcast of the Who cares? series by ABC News Four Corners television current affairs program, a special investigation into the aged care sector and the abuse and neglect of the elderly in nursing homes, the Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison announced that his government would make a recommendation to the Governor-General that a Royal Commission into aged care be established. Terms of reference On 6 December 2018, the Administrator of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, Paul de Jersey issued Commonwealth letters patent appointing The Hon. Richard Ross Sinclair Tracey and Ms Lynelle Jann Briggs as Commissioners and detailing the Commission's terms of reference. The Commissioners were appointed to be a Commission of inquiry, and required and authorised to inquire into the following matters: :(a) the quality of aged care services provided to Australians, the extent to which those services meet the needs of the people accessing them, the extent of substandard care being provided, including mistreatment and all forms of abuse, the causes of any systemic failures, and any actions that should be taken in response; :(b) how best to deliver aged care services to: ::i. people with disabilities residing in aged care facilities, including younger people; and ::ii. the increasing number of Australians living with dementia, having regard to the importance of dementia care for the future of aged care services; :(c) the future challenges and opportunities for delivering accessible, affordable and high quality aged care services in Australia, including: ::i. in the context of changing demographics and preferences, in particular people's desire to remain living at home as they age; and ::ii. in remote, rural and regional Australia; :(d) what the Australian Government, aged care industry, Australian families and the wider community can do to strengthen the system of aged care services to ensure that the services provided are of high quality and safe; :(e) how to ensure that aged care services are person‚Äëcentred, including through allowing people to exercise greater choice, control and independence in relation to their care, and improving engagement with families and carers on care‚Äërelated matters; :(f) how best to deliver aged care services in a sustainable way, including through innovative models of care, increased use of technology, and investment in the aged care workforce and capital infrastructure; :(g) any matter reasonably incidental to a matter referred to in paragraphs (a) to (f) or that [the Commissioners] believe is reasonably relevant to the inquiry. Commissioners and executive The Honourable Justice Joseph McGrath and Ms Lynelle Briggs were appointed as Royal Commissioners with effect from 8 October 2018. However, Justice McGrath stood aside for family reasons and, on 11 December 2018, the Australian Government announced that former Federal Court judge, The Honourable Richard Tracey , would replace McGrath. Justice Tracey died in California on 11 October 2019, while undergoing treatment for cancer he had been diagnosed with seven weeks earlier. Tony Pagone replaced Tracey as chair of the commission. The Official Secretary to the Royal Commission is Dr James Popple. Counsel assisting the Commissioners are Mr Peter Gray , Dr Timothy McEvoy , Ms Eliza Bergin, Mr Paul Bolster, Ms Erin Hill and Ms Brooke Hutchins. The Australian Government Solicitor are Solicitors Assisting. Powers The powers of Royal Commissions in Australia are set out in the enabling legislation, the . The Royal Commissions Amendment Act 2013 (Cth) was approved by Parliament to give the Child Abuse Royal Commission additional powers to fulfil its Terms of Reference. Notable changes were: # Enabling the Chair to authorise one or more members to hold a public or private hearing # Authorise members of the Royal Commission to hold private sessions Royal Commissions, appointed pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act or otherwise, have powers to issue a summons to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing to give evidence or to produce documents specified in the summons; require witnesses to take an oath or give an affirmation; and require a person to deliver documents to the Commission at a specified place and time. A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is a fine of or six months imprisonment. A Royal Commission may authorise the Australian Federal Police to execute search warrants.

He is often noted as G. N. Barnard. Early life Barnard was born into a farming family in Coventry, Connecticut on December 23, 1819. His father died in 1826 and he grew up with relatives in a nearby town, apprenticing at various jobs in the family owned businesses. He married in 1843 and moved to Oswego, New York, where he briefly got into the hotel business before turning to photography. Career Starting his business in New York State in 1843, Barnard was one of the first to use daguerreotype, the first commercially available form of photography, in the United States. A fire in 1853 destroyed the grain elevators in Oswego, New York, an event Barnard photographed. Historians consider these some of the first \\"news\\" photographs. Barnard also photographed Abraham Lincoln's 1861 inauguration. Civil War Barnard is best known for American Civil War era photos. He was the official army photographer for the Military Division of the Mississippi, which mostly involved photographing and documenting fortifications, bridges, and documents. His 1866 book, Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign, showed the devastation of the war. The book includes 61 albumen prints in Nashville, the Chattanooga Valley, Atlanta, and Savannah. He took the photos while operating under General Sherman's command. The book also includes a studio portrait of Sherman and his generals. Post-war After the war, Barnard ran photography studios in Ohio, Charleston, South Carolina and Chicago. His Chicago studio burned down in the 1871 city fire. In Rochester, New York, he briefly worked with George Eastman, the founder of the Eastman Kodak Company. Collections Barnard's work is included in the American Memory collection, Selected Civil War Photographs from the Library of Congress, 1861‚Äì1865. The J. Paul Getty Museum has one of his works and the MoMA also has his work in their collection.

It has been used as a test case for the Langlands program. Definition Consani and Scholten define their hypersurface from the (projectivized) set of solutions to the equation :P(x,y)=P(z,w) in four complex variables, where :P(x,y)=x^5+y^5-(5xy-5)(x^2+y^2-x-y).

Prather, who came to Oregon from Kansas in 1857, became the first groom in Hood River when he married in 1883, and was appointed postmaster of the city in 1886, founded the paper in 1889. Samuel F. Blythe bought the paper in 1894. After enlarging the paper, Blythe sold to Arthur D. Moe in 1904. In 1921, the Glacier was named the best newspaper in Oregon, with its rival Hood River News taking second place, in a contest conducted by the Oregon Agricultural College. (The Enterprise Record Chieftain took third place.) Walter H. Walton, an editor of the Glacier, also edited the rival Hood River News and the Better Fruit publication. A. D. Moe, who by coincidence was married (in Wisconsin) on the same day the Glacier was launched, later served as its publisher for 27 years; he was succeeded by his sons, Roger W. and Mark E. Moe. The Moe brothers purchased the Dufur Dispatch, founded 1894, in 1933. Joe D. Thompson was editor in 1933, and may have also served as publisher. Pioneers of Hood River formally requested in 1934 that the archives of the Glacier, which had ceased publication a year prior, be placed in the county library as a public reference; the Hood River News, which had acquired the Glacier's property, had already taken steps to do so. In 1936 the Dam Chronicle moved into the offices in the First National Bank building formerly occupied by the Glacier. Author Doris J.

Background Mariottini was reportedly born and lived in Cisterna di Latina in the region of Lazio. The San Lorenzo district is a historic neighborhood still scarred from World War II bombings, and is known for its left-wing political leanings. Murder and investigation On 17 October 2018, Mariottini reportedly missed the last bus and did not return to her home. Mariottini was drugged and sexually assaulted in a \\"drug den\\" in the San Lorenzo district in Rome. While unconscious, Mariottini was assaulted multiple times by an unknown number of assailants. An autopsy showed she had taken drugs as early as the afternoon of October 18, and died later on the night of 19 October. It also showed that Mariottini was likely raped as she was dying. On 25 October, two people were arrested for the murder: Mamadou Gara 26 and Brian Minteh 43. Both are accused, along other suspects, of gang rape, drug possession and voluntary homicide. The police are looking for at least two other men involved in the murder. The criminals were identified after a series of testimonies and findings made in the building where the body was found. Around October 26th, two more arrests were made in the case; Alinno Chima, age 40, and Yusif Salia, whose age was not specified.  Trial  The trial of the four accused began in October 2019. Aftermath Mariottini was buried on Sunday 30 October in Cisterna di Latina in a ceremony attended by hundreds and Mayor of Rome Virginia Raggi declared a day of mourning. Visit by Minister Matteo Salvini at the scene of the crime On October 24, 2018 interior minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-migration Northern League party, went to the abandoned building where the girl's body was found. Residents of the San Lorenzo district prevented Salvini from placing a rose outside the building where the victim was found, feeling Salvini was exploiting the young woman's death. He returned later in the day unannounced and placed the flowers in front of the gate. Pronouncements by the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani The tragedy of Desir√©e \\"must be the last that happens in Italy and in Rome, an abandoned city, the degradation is evident, moral and social, more checks are needed in the city, more men and women of the police are needed, especially at night\\". The decision of the mayor of Rome The Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi decided to proclaim a day of mourning for the city in conjunction with the funeral of Desir√©e Mariottini. She also declared the intention of city authorities to have the building demolished. In a social media post, she stated that as a mayor, as a woman and the mayor of the city she could not tolerate the thought of this crime and called it an \\"atrocious crime\\". On the evening of 25 October 2018, a spontaneous torch-light procession by the people of Rome San Lorenzo was organized to ask for \\"justice for Desir√©e\\".

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1979. Background Sakado Castle is located on Mount Sakado, a 634 meter peak on a ridge to the east of central Minamiounuma. The area is a long and narrow river basin along the Uono River, a major tributary of the Shinano River, near the border of Echigo Province with the Kant≈ç region. The Mikuni kaid≈ç was an important road connecting Echigo with the Kant≈ç area, and the modern Kan-Etsu Expressway and the J≈çetsu Shinkansen still utilise this route. During the early Muromachi period, Sh≈çgun Ashikaga Takauji appointed the Uesugi clan as shugo of Echigo Province. However, the Uesugi preferred to remain new the centre of political power and assigned the province to the Nagao clan to rule as deputy governors. However, the Nagao clan was split into three houses: The Fuch≈´-Nagao clan based at what is now J≈çetsu, the Koshi- Nagao clan based at what is now Nagaoka and the Ueda-Nagao clan based in what is now Uonuma. As J≈çetsu was the site of the ancient provincial capital of the province, the Fuch≈´-Nagao clan has the highest position, and the other branches were its retainers. A castle was built at Sakado by the Ueda-Nagano clan sometime in the late 14th century. Structure Sakado Castle, as was common with mountain-top fortifications of the time, consisted of many narrow terraces (kuruwa) spread across several levels on the side of the mountain. A circular inner bailey with a diameter of approximately 20 meters was created near the highest point of the mountain. The area was later fortified with stone walls. The ridge of Mount Sakado has a second peak towards the southeast with a height almost as high as the inner bailey. This peak was also flatted off to form a bailey with a large watchtower. The two bailies were connected by a narrow pathway approximately 100 meters long on the top of the ridge. As the slopes of Mount Sakado are very steep, and with sheer cliffs in place, the area formed a natural notification without need of ramparts. The castle town and the residence of the ruler were located on the western hillside, and were protected by a water moat. History Under the Muromachi shogunate, the Uesugi clan was appointed to the post of Kant≈ç Kanrei, but through continuous warfare was greatly weakened. In 1507, Nagao Tamekage of the Fuch≈´-Nagao overthrew his Uesugi overlords. On his death in 1543, his son Nagao Harukage was unable to hold the clan together, and turned authority over to his brother, Kagetora, better known as Uesugi Kenshin. However, the Ueda-Nagao under Nagao Masakage initially opposed Kenshin and raised an army. He was defeated, but was allowed to pledge fealty to Kenshin, and was married to Kenshin's younger sister, Sento-in, after which the Ueda-Nagao clan contributed to Kenshin's campaigns against the Takeda clan and the Odawara H≈çj≈ç clan. In 1564, Masakage died in what may have been an accident, and his son, Akikage was adopted by Kenshin, becoming Uesugi Kagekatsu. Kenshin's sudden death in 1578 without having named an heir set the stage for another major conflict, the Siege of Otate, as Kenshin's other adopted son, Uesugi Kagetora also claimed the position of heir. Kagekatsu was supported by Kenshin's closest guards and quickly captured Kasugayama Castle and the Ueda- Nagao rallied to his banner. However, Kagetora had the support of the most important retainers as well as backing by the Takeda and H≈çj≈ç clans, and isolated Kasugayama Castle from the Uonuma basin. In the summer of 1578, the H≈çj≈ç invaded Echigo in support of Kagetora while the Takeda invaded from Shinano Province. Unable to fight a war on two fronts, Kagekatsu quickly made a separate peace with the Takeda; however, the Hojo were able to lay siege to many of the border castles in the Uonuma region, including Sakado. The defenders were fortunate in that the H≈çj≈ç laid siege after the rice harvest had been competed. Furthermore, as the Uonuma area is a region of Japan with the heaviest snowfalls, the H≈çj≈ç armies suffered greatly once winter began, and as the snow began to disrupt their supply lines, they were forced to retreat. Kagekatsu was thus able to counterattack and reestablish the link between Kasugayama Castle and his main power base at Sakado. The following spring, in March 1579, Kagekatsu made a major offensive against Kagetora, taking his headquarters at ≈åtate Castle. Kagetora fled to Samegao Castle, where he was betrayed and committed suicide. Uesugi Kagekatsu was thus master of Echigo and undisputed head of the Uesugi clan, but the conflict had left the Uesugi clan greatly weakened, and he was forced to submit fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Sakado Castle continued to used as a border fortification for Echigo . In 1598, the clan was transferred to Aizu on the orders of Hideyoshi and the province was given to Hori Hideharu. Hideharu placed Hori Naoyori as castellan of Sakado Castle. Naoyori made many modifications to the castle and the hillside residence. In 1608, he was transfer to become daimy≈ç of Iida Domain in Shinano Province by the Tokugawa shogunate and Sakado Castle was abandoned. Current The castle is now only ruins, with some terraces on the hilltop areas remaining. The area is now a park with hiking courses and a Shinto shrine on the site of the former inner bailey.

It is in the Market Place, in the centre of the town. It is a Grade II* listed building, listed on 2 October 1951. History Viewed from the south-east The first town hall in the town, completed in 1761, was a rectangular two-storey building with open arches on the ground floor, a meeting hall on the first floor and a clock tower with a cupola on top. It was demolished to make way for the second town hall which was built on the same site. The second town hall, now referred to as the \\"Old Town Hall\\", which was designed by G. T. Robinson of Wolverhampton in the Baroque style, was built between 1854 and 1857. It was designed with paired Corinthian pilasters for the height of the upper storey, above which a cornice surmounted by acroteria was placed. At the west end a projecting portico with arched entrances, was erected above which Corinthian columns were placed; above these, caryatids supported an octagonal clock turret and a gilded angel finial. The town hall became the headquarters of the new borough of Burslem in 1878 but it ceased to be the local seat of government when the Federation of Stoke-on-Trent was formed in March 1910. The old town hall was used as a public library for much of the 20th century. It was used for scenes in the film The Card starring Alec Guinness in 1952, and although there were proposals to demolish it in the 1960s, it survived and had become a recreation centre by the 1990s. The gilded angel was restored and re- guilded by Bailey International Steeplejacks in Macclesfield in December 2000. From 2003 the building housed Ceramica, a visitor centre showing the artistic and industrial heritage of the Potteries. The project was funded by the Millennium Commission. Part of the budget had to be spent in dealing with dry rot found in the building. The exhibition attracted fewer visitors than anticipated, and after Stoke-on-Trent City Council withdrew funding for day- to-day running, it closed in March 2011. The building remained empty until 2015, when the modern extension built as part of the Ceramica exhibition was demolished and the Old Town Hall was converted into a sixth form college of Haywood Academy, a project sponsored by Steelite International.

Myanmar gained its granted independence from British Empire in 1948 under Burmese Independence Army, as a democratic nation. The first military rule began in 1958 and direct military rule started when Ne Win captured power through a coup d'√©tat in 1962, it became a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party lasted for 26 years, in the claim to save the country from disintegration. During this period there was some democratic landscape in the form of election, giving rights to the citizen to elect and to stand for election. For most of its independent years, the sovereign state has been engrossed in rampant ethnic strife and its myriad ethnic groups have been involved in one of the world's longest-running ongoing civil wars. During this time, the United Nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systematic human rights violations in the country. In 2011, the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and a nominally civilian government was installed. Introduction Myanmar, the largest country in Mainland Southeast Asia is located at the meeting point of South and Southeast Asia. It is bordered with five nations, China, Laos, Thailand, India and Bangladesh. Myanmar gained its Independent on January 4, 1948 from British Empire under the leadership of General Aung San under Burma National Army. In July 1947, Aung San was assassinated by rivals under the leadership of U Saw, but achieved independence in January 1948 under U Nu. Since its struggle for Independent, the armed forces known as the ‚ÄòTatmadaw‚Äô played an important role in gaining Independent and it was under the Burmese Independence Army that Myanmar got its independent. The Army in Myanmar had gained respect in independent Myanmar at the initial stage and perceived as protector of the country. The military claims itself as the founder of the Union of Burma, and the main force that held the country together during the civil war and also claimed that it has prevented the country from disintegrating. After the independent, a constitutional government was formed and U Nu was nominated as the first Prime Minister of Independent Myanmar. However the newly formed civilian government under U Nu, failed to maintain the unity of the country facing with domestic problems, ethnic issues, insurgency, corruption, mismanagement, and the ethnic insurgencies which took up arms against each other. And in 1958 a split within the AFPFL threatened to provoke a coup from field officers. In order to settle the situation U Nu invited the military to form caretaker government. In 1958-60, the caretaker government under General Ne Win was formed. The caretaker government initially appeared to be interested in building state capacity. It reduced corruption, improved bureaucratic efficiency, and managed to deal with the pocket armies. Military junta announced to held election in 1960. After the election in 1960, U Nu party formed a civilian government. But the civilian government under U Nu could not solve and improve the situation rather threat the national integration of the country leading to the coup on March 2, 1962 under General Ne Win. The main reasons for the coup were a mix of political infighting, policy gridlock, multiple insurgencies on a massive scale, and a declining economy. After the coup, the military government arrest members of the government, suspended the constitution and appoint a Union Revolutionary Council (RC) to Govern Myanmar by decree. The coup on 2 March 1962 led to the end of democratic form of government and the beginning of direct military rule in Myanmar up to 1974. During the period of military rule under General Ne Win, the country was shaped into one-party socialist state under the army led party called as Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) till 1988. And the year from 1962 to 1988, can be marked as the era of Ne Win. The period from 1962-1988 can be divided into two phase. The first phase is the period of direct military rule from 1962-1974 and Constitutional Dictatorship phase from 1974 to 1988.

This was at odds with traditional Chinese culture, which the Kuomintang had largely upheld. After 1949, the CPC outlawed concubinage, and allowed women's right to divorce.  Early days  Most of the initial leadership was male, including everyone who attended the founding congress. They were also already supporters of more rights for women, which was general among Chinese radicals. Xiang Jingyu was a prominent female leader in the early Chinese Communist Party. Gilmartin, Christina (2008). \\"Xiang Jingyu\\". The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History. She was executed in 1928 by the Nationalist government. This was part of a general crack-down on the underground Communist Party, but the Nationalist government viewed the feminist movement as part of a larger threat that could cause anarchy. Kang Keqing was the leader of a local guerilla force that joined up with the main Red Army. She was one of the few women who took part in the Long March, and became a prominent leader within it. The May Fourth era had been more open and accommodating to feminism than the eras that followed it. in the early 1900s organized marriages were arranged by the parents of the bride. The only way that women could initiate a divorce was by suicide. Where as the men could divorce for numerous reasons if they felt like it. Chairman Mao Zedong in the beginning of his leadership was sympathetic to these women who took their lives because of forced marriage.  In power  On coming to power, rights for women were implemented as part of what Mao called New Democracy. In Marxist terms, this was understood as implementing things that the middle class had done in Western countries, but which had not happened in China. An All-China Women's Federation pushed for female rights. Divorce was allowed for women, and many of them took advantage of it. Concubinage was ended, but when an existing concubine wanted to stay part of the family, this was allowed. Marriage was an individual choice. Both sexes chose freely, but as the system developed, permission was needed from the work unit. This had always been the rule for Party members. In the 1950s and 1960s women were depicted as strong capable warriors who fought in the name of Communism and China in propaganda posters. In many cases during the introduction of the Red Guard, women felt the need to be a leading force. This resulted in numerous women at schools being beaten and humiliated by their peers if they did not live up to Communist standards. Despite being depicted as strong and proud, unequal treatment for women was still relevant in the 60s. Many women who completed their educational requirements were still assigned poorer jobs next to their male counterparts who would receive better quality jobs. After the elimination of the assigned work units and the ability to migrate from the countryside to urban areas became available, many girls started doing so and living outside of the traditional sense that was still practiced in the rural areas. These girls would eventually become known as the factory girls due to their work in poor conditioned factories. Some outside observers have complained that after the fall of the Gang of Four, older attitudes to women revived.China Changes Face: The Road from Revolution, 1949-89, by John Gittings.

History The foundation for the original indoor rink was likely poured in 1909 by local Ann Arbor contractor Fred Weinberg. Initially the ice was cooled only by the chill winter air but after the University of Michigan purchased the facility in 1925 an artificial ice system was installed and gave the ice hockey team a home with consistent ice. While the facility served as the home for the team for over fifty years the building was prohibitively small, even after a 1949 remodeling, and was eventually replaced by the Yost Ice Arena in 1973. During its lifetime as an ice rink, the Weinberg Coliseum was home to seven National Championship teams. After the ice was removed for the final time the Coliseum was recycled for use as a gymnasium and used by various university programs over the years but mostly by the men's and women's gymnastics teams.

He had military ability and was sent to Cambodia to fight against Vietnamese by Taksin. In 1780, the Cambodian regent Talaha (Mu) turned to pro- Vietnamese. Taksin decided to annex Cambodia. A Thai army of 20,000 under Chao Phraya Chakri (later king Rama I) and Chao Phraya Surasi moved into Cambodia, to crown Inthraphithak the new king of Cambodia.

So Chakri and Surasi made friends with these two Vietnamese generals. Four generals swore to help with each other in need. In 1782, Taksin was usurped and imprisoned by Phraya San. Having made sure Vietnamese army would not attack Siamese with this chance, Chakri quickly returned to Thonburi, put down the rebellion, and had Taksin executed. After Taksin's execution, Inthraphithak headed to Siam, aiming to seize the throne. However, few people supported him. In the mid-way, many of his soldiers change sides, Inthraphithak had to surrender. He was captured by Chaophraya Surasi, and was sentenced to death in Thonburi.

In 1943, he became head of the Antitrust Department in the same ministry. Berge strongly supported the view that any monopoly would harm the free economy. In 1944, he published the book Cartels: Challenge to a Free World, which made Berge, along with Joseph Borkin, Charles Welsh, and Corwin D. Edwards, one of the spokesmen in the new campaign against international cartels. This corresponded to the radical, anti-monopolist position of the Roosevelt Progressivists, which had begun developing in 1937 and dominated American politics between 1943 and 1946. However, this notion of international cartels was rejected by both the conservative and Marxist sides on the premise that it was unrealistic or imperialist.Jacob Anton De Haas: International cartels in the postwar world.

History Prankerd was born in Bristol, a son of John Prankerd, solicitor, and his wife Mary (died 22 June 1866). In 1839 he emigrated to Australia, and operated for a time as a stock agent at Kangaroo Point, Queensland. By 1847 he was in Adelaide, and soon was in partnership with George Rolfe, dissolved May 1851. Prankerd left for England some time around 1849; returned in March 1850 aboard Samuel Boddington From 1853 he regularly attended Government land sales, purchasing newly released country land to be leased by prospective farmers. Some he subdivided, and several townships in South Australia are the product of his enterprise. In association with Robert Stuckey, Prankerd laid out a township in the Adelaide Hills which he named Stirling, in honor of his friend Edward Stirling, MLC. It was for a time called Stirling East to distinguish it from Stirling North in the Mid-North. He made a gift of land for a local school. In 1856 Prankerd, Stuckey and John Bentham Neales formed a partnership to develop \\"New Melrose\\" (now simply Melrose) near Mount Remarkable. In 1861 Prankerd purchased sections 372, 373 and 374, Hundred of MacDonnell, 8km north of Port MacDonnell, and the following year laid out the township of \\"Allendale\\", later known as Allendale East. He donated land nearby on Section 247 for a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, named Kingsley Chapel. In April 1864 he was elected a governor of St. Peter's College, where at least one of his sons was a student. As a director and trustee of Moonta Mines, he was involved in the business side of the copper mining and smelting operations at Moonta and Wallaroo. A major facility at the mine, the Prankerd Engine, used for crushing and winding, was named for him. This article has much detail on the Moonta mines. Its boiler exploded spectacularly in 1875. He visited England aboard SS Rangatirain September 1870, returning January 1872 aboard SS Gothenburg, one of her last voyages before the tragic shipwreck. Mentions of his involvement with the Cape Yorke Eclipse Expedition may have mistaken him for someone of a similar name. The Prankerds left for England aboard SS South Australian on 27 December 1872, after making a gift to the people of Moonta of Block 259 in that town, adjacent the Baptist chapel, and another block to the residents of Langport, his subdivision on Moonta Bay. He later made gifts of ¬£300 to the Deaf and Dumb Asylum. and ¬£500 towards the proposed University of Adelaide. He bought a large house \\"The Knoll\\" in Sneyd Park, Bristol. His interest in South Australian real estate continued, through his agent Frederick Wright. Named for Prankerd There is a Prankerd Street in Moonta Bay township, and nearby are Percy, Herbert, Lucy and Edith streets. He founded the Prankerd Scholarship at St. Peter's College. Family Prankerd married Lucy Amelia Wright (c. 1821 ‚Äì 16 August 1893) on 8 March 1856. She was the eldest daughter of Stephen Amand Wright and sister of architect Edmund Wright. Their family included: *Percy John Prankerd (30 August 1859 ‚Äì 24 November 1908), a solicitor, died in Tunbridge Wells *Herbert Peter Prankerd (21 September 1861 ‚Äì ) *Edith Lucy Mary Prankerd (4 March 1864 ‚Äì ) They had a residence \\"Athelney\\", Hackney Road, Hackney, built 1858, later owned by Herbert Bristow Hughes then incorporated into St. Peter's College.

His scientific research, mainly focused agronomy, botany and meteorology, were not just theoretical and aimed at the mere research of natural phenomena, but their goal was to develop and improve agriculture in the Kingdom of Naples; this was a common feature of the scientific works of the earliest scientists of the Kingdom of Naples.

Giovene studied there until the age of 12. In 1766, he went to Rome where he was admitted to the Jesuit novitiate, although he wasn't old enough, but after only eight months the Jesuit order was suppressed and the Jesuits expelled from the Kingdom of Naples. Giovene wanted to follow the Jesuits abroad but he couldn't because of an illness.elogio-storico, pagg. 3-4 During his childhood, he showed he did not love \\"juvenile amusements\\" and he preferred to adiscuss with learned men. When he returned to Molfetta after recovering from his illness, he studied philosophy and mathematics in the seminary of Molfetta under the direction of bishop Celestino Orlandi. Among other things he also studied law, and, as a boy, he began to show a predisposition for the natural sciences. He went to Naples, when he was only a cleric, and was recommended to Ciro Saverio Minervininecrologio-giovene, pag. 36 and there he met learned and famous naturalists, such as Vincenzo Petagna. He also loved to discuss with his fellow citizens and naturalists, Giuseppe Saverio Poli and Ciro Saverio Minervini.  Return to Molfetta  In 1773, he returned to Molfetta,necrologio-giovene, pag. 37 and the bishop of Molfetta who had instructed him, Celestino Orlandi, wanted him to become a priest of the parish of the Church of Saint Stephen, in Molfetta. Despite Giovene's resistance, the bishop eventually forced him to participate in the parish priest's selection contest, which Giovene won. At that moment, however, Celestino Orlandi, his childhood tutor, died, and at that time he wrote the funeral praise Orazione pei solenni funerali di D. Celestino Orlandi (1775).orazione-orlandielogio- storico, pagg. 4-5 In the meantime, Gennaro Antonucci was appointed as new bishop of Molfetta, who wanted him to be his apostolic vicar, probably because of his fame or his experience. Meanwhile, Giovene did not despise to help the poor, orphans, offering them free legal advice to protect against the abuses of the powerful. At that time, he was also in charge of teaching law at the Molfetta seminary. In order to become a vicar, he had to be a graduate, and thus he went to Naples to fulfill his duties. Once there, he took the chance to discuss with the scholars about art and natural history. Despite his many commitments, he always found time to devote himself to natural history. He was also appointed archpriest of the former Molfetta Cathedral.  The year 1799  During the Parthenopean Republic (1799), Giovene's friend Giuseppe Saverio Poli followed king Ferdinand IV of Naples to Sicily, and he entrusted to Giovene his house, his library, his tools and everything he owned. Giovene could not prevent the depredation made by force by some pro-French officers of the short-lived Parthenopean Republic. Many rare samples of natural history, such as \\"the wax tablets of the testaceous\\", ended up in the Paris Academy of Sciences.necrologio-giovene, pag. 45  The vicariate in Lecce and his return to Molfetta  His fame reached as far as pope Pius VII, who chose him for the diocese of Lecce. Giovene did not want to accept that further burden, but his refusal was not considered, thus he was appointed apostolic vicar of Lecce from about 1806 to 1816.elogio-storico, pagg. 21-22 In this period, he was also appointed capitular vicar of Otranto and Oria and he turned out to rule over most of the churches in the Province of Lecce.necrologio-giovene, p. 46 In 1817, he returned to Molfetta, wishing to be able to enjoy a quiet, peaceful life, but he was immediately assigned new tasks. He was also apostolic vicar of the bishop of Molfetta Gennaro Antonucci, successor to the bishop Celestino Orlandi.elogio-giovene, pag. 18 Alongside the study of science, he also cultivated numismatics, collecting coins and medallions of all kinds, and he also collected ancient Italo-Greek vases (called \\"Etruscan\\"), apparently not for vanity, but for historical purposes. He also wrote poetry and wrote in Latin.elogio-giovene, pagg. 12-13 He also taught experimental physics, law and sacred liturgy in the seminary of Molfetta. In particular, Giovene could use, during the teachings of experimental physics, the many tools provided by his friend Giuseppe Saverio Poli. His students also held a demonstration in the large courtyard of the bishop's palace and seminary of Molfetta, during which experiments were conducted relating to electricity, air, gas, during which the use of pneumatic and electric tools aroused the curiosity of people of any kind. The experiments conducted by the students of Giovene were not even conducted by the local university at that time. This helped to increase the prestige of the seminary.elogio-giovene, pagg. 18-19  Last years  In 1820, he was also appointed member of the newly born constitutional parliament of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies for a few months.memorie-storiche-1844, pag. 151necrologio-giovene-2, pag. 160 Even in the last decade of his life he kept on being updated and reading books and newspapers. During this time, he became deaf, which made it difficult for him to communicate with others; moreover he began to suffer from paralysis to the bladder and the cataract came him to his left eye.necrologio-giovene, pag. 50 For this reason he had to be helped to know the progress of the sciences and letters.elogio-giovene, pag. 25 He also wrote a few books about religion and in addition, in the last part of his life, he was asked by the bishop of Molfetta Caracciolo to write a hagiography on Saint Conrad of Bavaria, protector of his hometown Molfetta. In order to write the book, he had to consult medieval sources and, in order to do so, he went to northern Italy and Germany.elogio-storico, pagg. 28 Pope Gregory XVI read his book and liked it, and thanks to this, Molfetta was granted the official recognition of the cult of Saint Conrad of Bavaria, which had already started in the XII century\\". His book on the saint also became famous in Germany.elogio-giovene, pagg. 13-14 He died in Molfetta on January 2, 1837.

Paolo Rotondo, found after his death, forbade any funeral or funeral praises of any kind after his death,elogio-giovene, pag. 3, note 1 and he asked to be buried in Church of Saint Conrad of Bavaria. The funeral praise, however, was eventually read in the Church of Saint Conrad of Bavaria and it was printed in Naples by his grandnephew Luigi Marinelli Gioveneelogio-storico, pagg. 32-33 (who also reprinted most of his works in a collection of several volumes entitled Raccolta di tutte le opere del cav. Giuseppe Maria Giovene 1839‚Äì1841). In addition, Giovene himself wrote the epigraph of his own tomb before his death.elogio-storico, pag. 33, note 35  Scientific research   The \\"natural nitrary\\" of Pulo di Molfetta  Pulo di Molfetta The name of Giuseppe Maria Giovene is inextricably linked to the discovery of the so- called \\"natural nitrary\\" (, which means a natural deposit of saltpetre) of Pulo di Molfetta. In 1783, abbot Alberto Fortis visited Apulia in order to study the region, and Ciro Saverio Minervini appointed Giovene as Fortis' guide. On this occasion, Fortis and Giovene met,elogio-storico, pag. 8 and Giovene later told Alberto Fortis about a doline of that region called Pulo di Molfetta, in which Giovene believed that there was saltpetre. After an inspection, Fortis noted that Giovene had been right and that there was saltpetre in that doline.necrologio-giovene, pag. 39 According to other sources, however, Fortis and Giovene together discovered the \\"natural nitrary\\".elogio-storico, pag. 35 According to Zimmermann, the discovery was made by Alberto Fortis, and Giovene just told Fortis about Pulo di Molfetta and accompanied him. The discovery also generated issues; in particular, the discovery was initially challenged by some scholars. Subsequently, chemist Giuseppe Vairo and his assistant Antonio Pitaro confirmed the discovery. This undoubtedly damaged producers of artificial saltpetre, and some scholars, most likely supported by the producers, tried to dismiss the discovery. Following the discovery, a large number of naturalists sent by academies from all Europe came to visit Pulo di Molfetta, since the saltpeter was a fundamental ingredient in the production of gunpowder and that these deposits were of considerable strategic interest.elogio-storico, pagg. 8-10 In particular, in a letter to Alberto Fortis dated 7 August 1784, Giovene refuted the idea of those who believed that the saltpetre of Pulo di Molfetta was due to some animals that once inhabited the doline. He also proved to be a talented chemist, and to be even more competent than the salt pans themselves, teaching them to correct the acidity of the ground (containing excessive amounts of \\"azotic acid\\") by adding plant ash.elogio-storico, pagg. 10 During a trip with his brother over Apulia, Giovene noted that saltpetre was abundant in other areas of Apulia. The trip, together with Giovene's observations were reported in the aforementioned letter of 7 August 1784.elogio-storico, pagg. 9-10  Agronomy and meteorology  In some of his writings, Giovene also studied a disease of olive trees caused by Pseudomonas savastanoi (in Italian, the disease is called rogna dell'ulivo). The disease can be recognized by the characteristic tumour. In particular, Giovene recognized that the disease was not caused by insects, although the insects formed. He also distinguished the tumours caused by frost from those generated by hail or blunt bodies. He also carried out some experiments where he boiled branches attacked by the disease, and he came to the conclusion that the tumours which weren't caused by frost were \\"germs of new twigs or branches suffocated in their birth\\". He came to this conclusion by cutting the tumours and observing the center.elogio- storico, pagg. 11-12 He also studied the worms and insects that \\"corrode and ravage the orchard.\\"elogio-storico, pag. 12 During his life he also carried out research in meteorology. After the discovery of the \\"natural nitrary\\", scholars from many European academies came to Molfetta, and Giovene took the opportunity to meet and discuss with many of them. One of these was Giuseppe Toaldo, who made him interested in meteorology, as a science useful to regulate agriculture.necrologio-giovene, pag. 40 During his life, Giovene collected atmospheric, rainfall and barometric data, and studied their development. From 1788 to 1797, he wrote, for every year and starting from his observations, a memory of rainfall and their consequences on agriculture.elogio-storico, pag. 13 Giovene was also praised by the most illustrious Italian meteorologist of that period, Giuseppe Toaldo. In particular, if Giuseppe Toaldo can well be considered the founder of Italian meteorology, Giovene may well consider himself the founder of Italian rural meteorology, so much so that he managed to make some eminent scholars of that period more interested in meteorology, including Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi.elogio-storico, pag. 13, note 16elogio-storico, pag. 14 In his study Prospetto comparato della pioggia della Puglia (1805), Giovene asked his illustrious colleagues to obtain rainfall data for the nearby Apulian cities Altamura, Ariano, Teramo, in addition to data from Molfetta provided by Giovene himself. Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi provided data for his city Altamura, Giovanni Zerella provided data for Ariano, while Orazio Delfico provided data for Teramo.prospetto-comparato, pagg. 113-114 With his study, Giovene wanted to prove that the amount of rainfall which fell on Apulia wasn't that different from other European regions (such as some regions of France, which didn't have the same reputation of Apulia as a dry region). Although there are clear differences with other European regions more heavily watered by rain or with the South American city of Santo Domingo, the biggest difference, according to Giovene, is due to the irregularity of rainfall events.prospetto- comparato, pagg. 117 One of the most innovative aspects of his meteorological studies is certainly that of comparing data that previously were not generally studied together, i.e. atmospheric electricity and atmospheric pressure. For these studies, culminating in his publication Osservazioni elettro- atmosferiche e barometriche insieme paragonate (1798), Carlo Amoretti stated that Giovene \\"had provided an invaluable service to meteorology and physics\\".necrologio-giovene, p. 43 Moreover, in the Discorso meteorologico- campestre per l'anno 1797 (1798), Giovene had the brilliant and innovative idea that the exceptional event that occurred in 1797, i.e. drought continuing beyond the first days of August (in contrast with the observations of the previous years), could be caused by the decrease in sunspots, which was observed by astronomers.  Electricity  Giovene also contributed to what was then called elettricismo; in particular, he studied atmospheric electricity. He studied the electricity and pressure variation of the atmosphere and he wrote Osservazione elettro-atmosferiche e barometriche insieme paragonate (1798). Moreover, after reading Jan Hendrik van Swinden's work Dissertation on the Irregular Motions of the Magnetic Needle, he also wrote an annex to the above essay, in which he explained how his observations confirmed Van Swinden's conclusions on the correlation between atmospheric pressure, atmospheric electricity, Aurora and oscillations of the Earth's magnetic field.elogio-storico, pagg. 16-17}  Rain dust  Giuseppe Maria Giovene also correctly explained the phenomenon of the so-called red rain dust (), fallen on Apulia on 7 March 1803. It was believed at that time that the rain was caused by the explosion of Italy's volcanoes Mount Vesuvius or Etna, or that it was due to the transport of matter coming from the sea floor and raised by vapor. Giuseppe Maria Giovene brilliantly related the phenomenon to the wind occurred prior to the rain event, and he came to the conclusion that the sand came from Africa and that it had been pushed by the wind coming from south-east.elogio-storico, pag. 20pioggia-rossa  Entomology  In a paper entitled Descrizione e storia della cocciniglia dell'ulivo (1807),#cocciniglia Giovene also dealt with the insect \\"Coccus oleae\\" (also \\"Saissetia oleae\\"), answering Giovanni Presta, who denied the existence of the insect in the provinces of Bari and Otranto. Giovene showed that the insect was widespread in those regions, albeit rarer. Moreover, Giovene also discovered the male of the cochineal, which wasn't known in much of Europe. In the \\"Dictionary of natural history\\" of Paris (1816) () it was written: \\"the male is not known\\" ().necrologio-giovene, pag. 44, note 3https://www.archive.org/download/nouveaudictionna07metc/nouveaudictionna07metc_djvu.txt He also wrote the work Avviso per la distruzione dei vermi che attaccano la polpa delle olive (1792), in which he provided some suggestions for the peasants in order to effectively destroy the worms musca oleae, which infested the pulp of the olive trees. Giovene intended to collect his writings Sulla rogna degli ulivi (1789), Avviso per la distruzione dei vermi che attaccano la polpa delle olive (1792), Descrizione e storia della cocciniglia dell'ulivo (1807) into a single treaty on the diseases of olive trees, but he didn't accomplish his initial commitment. In 1813, he also wrote the work Delle cavallette pugliesi (\\"On Apulian grasshoppers\\").  Ichthyology  Giovene also carried out some research on ichthyology by studying marine life. He used to ask fishermen to bring him the most uncommon marine species they could find, and he paid for them. He also wrote the works Notizie sull'Argonauta Argo del Linneo and Di alcuni pesci del mare di Puglia (1827). In this last work, he showed that some marine species that were considered rare and exotic in reality populated the Mediterranean Sea.  Dating the Earth  Giuseppe Maria Giovene never hid his profound religiousness, as well as the contempt for atheism, which he considered to be true \\"dementia.\\"elogio-storico, pagg. 29-30 He also based his assumptions on what was written in the Bible. In this regard, he criticized the new scientific theories according to which the Earth was actually much older than what was written in the Bible. In some unpublished speeches held at the Academy of Catholic Religion in Rome (Accademia di Religione Cattolica in Roma) ‚Äì Della pretesa antichit√† del tempo and Delle lave dell'Etna e degli argomenti che si pretende tirare per la molta antichit√† della Terra ‚Äì he tried to refute those that Giovene considered distorted interpretations of natural history. His work Di alcuni pesci del mare di Puglia (1827) also contains explicit references to what he considered unnatural interpretations which, through the analysis of the fossils, dated the Earth too far back (\\"to imagine centuries without number\\").dialcunipesci, pag. 42  Theology  In his life, Giovene also wrote a few works on theology, including a hagiography in Latin entitled Vita Beati Corradi Bavari (1836), about the life of Saint Conrad of Bavaria, and for this purpose he had to travel to North Italy and Germany in order to consult medieval sources about the saint. His work was appreciated by Pope Gregory XVI, and it granted the city of Molfetta the official recognition of the cult of Saint Conrad of Bavaria, which had started in Molfetta as early as the XII century.elogio- storico, pagg. 13-14 He also wrote a letter to Saverio Mattei, in which he answered the question Mattei had asked Giuseppe Vairo on the type of matter Jesus Christ referred to in the passage from the gospel where he said to the apostles vos estis sal terrae (which means \\"you are the salt of the earth\\") Giovene, with reasoning in which he showed his erudition and his knowledge of physics and chemistry, came to the conclusion that Jesus Christ referred to saltpetre (potassium nitrate).elogio-storico, pagg. 16lettera-mattei  Charity  Giuseppe Maria Giovene was also known for his altruism, especially towards the poor, orphans, widows and the oppressed. Even though he was busy in his numerous commitments and ecclesiastical assignments as well as in his studies, he managed to find time to offer legal counsel to the poor, especially to those who were oppressed and persecuted by the powerful. Moreover, he often provided them with financial aid. In particular, after the death of his brother, baron Graziano Giovene, he had become rich, and he decided to share it with the poor.elogio-storico, pagg. 31  The Societ√† italiana delle scienze di Verona  Due to the death of Lazzaro Spallanzani (1799), he was appointed as his successor in the Societ√† italiana delle scienze di Verona, thus becoming one of its 40 members and publishing articles in almost every volume of the learned society's proceedings.  Works and scientific publications      elogio-storico, pag. 16   * Ten publications related to each of the years studied by Giovene. Nine of them were published in journal Opuscoli scelti sulle scienze e sulle arti of Milan, while the last one (related to year 1797) was published in volume C of journal Giornale letterario di Napoli, necrologio-giovene, pag. 40, note 3    necrologio-giovene-2, pag. 152  necrologio-giovene-2, pag. 153  * (continuazione delle precedenti Notizie geologiche)   * (after 1807)   biografia-univ-1841, pag. 152 * , dopo la morte di Giovene √® stato anche tradotto in italiano: * (pubblicata dopo la morte)col-puloalt-1917, pagg. 4-5, note 2 e 3  Other works (some of which unpublished, unfinished or never written)  * necrologio-giovene, pag. 51     * biografia-ital-1838, pag. 280   Bibliography       *  References   External links  * Enciclopedia Treccani ‚Äì Giuseppe Maria Giovene * Jesuitscience Category:Italian scientists Category:Italian agronomists Category:Italian geologists Category:Italian naturalists Category:Italian meteorologists Category:Italian entomologists Category:Italian ichthyologists Category:Catholic clergy scientists Category:People from Molfetta Category:1753 births Category:1837 deaths ","title":"Giuseppe Maria Giovene"},{"id":"58874565","text":"The 1961 New Year Honours in New Zealand were appointments by Elizabeth II on the advice of the New Zealand government to various orders and honours to reward and highlight good works by New Zealanders.

He taught at the Leipzig Graduate School of Management (HHL) and at the University of Leipzig between 1940 and 1947, then moving on to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he taught till a few months before he died. Through his research work between 1949 and 1968 he exercised a great influence on the understanding of economic history in West Germany. Together with Wilhelm Abel and G√ºnther Franz he contributed decisively to research into agrarian history in Germany. He was instrumental in ensuring that social and economic history emerged as an alternative strand to the prism of historical materialism that was mainstream in many German universities during this period. From this followed an insistence in his economic research that the subject needs to be studied not simply from a theoretical quasi-mathematical standpoint, but also empirically and in the context of broader historical considerations.J√∂rg Rode: Die Gesellschaft f√ºr Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte (1961‚Äì1998). Stuttgart 1998, p. 28  Life and works   Provenance and early years  Friedrich Karl L√ºtge was born into a Protestant family at the start of the twentieth century at Wernigerode, a midsized town located in the Harz Mountains between Hanover and Halle. He was the older of twin brothers. There were also two younger siblings. His father was a captain in the German merchant navy who was much involved with Kamerun trade, but died in 1905. As a child Friedrich L√ºtge suffered from a spinal disease which confined him to bed for three years.Wilhelm Abel, Knut Borchardt, Hermann Kellenbenz, Wolfgang Zorn (Hrsg.): Wirtschaft, Geschichte und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. Festschrift zum 65. Geburtstag von Friedrich L√ºtge. Fischer, Stuttgart 1966, pp. 1‚Äì7 On 23 September 1918, while still at school he found himself recruited into an infantry regiment as a junior officer (Fahnenjunker), but by this time the First World War was nearly over and he was never sent into the fighting of it. However, in February 1919 he found himself taken into the Freikorps (\\"volunteer corps\\") of Adolf von Oven in Berlin, and he was involved in the putting down of the Spartacus uprising.Andreas Dornheim: Die deutsche Agrargeschichte in der NS-Zeit und die Lehrstuhl-Berufungen nach 1945 in Westdeutschland. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr Agrargeschichte und Agrarsoziologie 53 (2005), p. 49. It was only in 1921 that he passed his Abitur (school leaving exams) which opened the way to university-level education. In 1921 L√ºtge enrolled at the University of Freiburg where he studied economics (Volkswirtschaft) and history on a course directed by Georg von Below. That was followed by a term at the University of Marburg where he was taught by Albert Brackmann and Wilhelm Busch. He concluded his student studies at the University of Jena where he was supervised for his doctorate by Franz Gutmann. Importantly for L√ºtge 's subsequent academic career, it was Gutmann who awakened his interest in agrarian history. His doctoral dissertation concerned \\"The Liberation of the Peasantry in the County of Wernigerode\\" (Die Bauernbefreiung in der Grafschaft Wernigerode). He was obliged to work his way through his university years in order to support himself and his widowed mother. Briefly, between 15 October and 16 November 1923, he belonged to the so-called Black Reichswehr. Unusually, on 1 December 1928 Friedrich L√ºtge was awarded a second doctorate. This time his dissertation concerned the history of the book trade in Jena, including the impact of the invention of printing. The work was supervised by Georg Menz. While working on this doctorate he was also employed in Jena as a private researcher by the economist-statistician Ludwig Elster. Projects on which he worked with Elster included the fourth edition of the W√∂rterbuch der Volkswirtschaftslehre (\\"Lexicon of Applied Economics\\") and the Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik (\\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Statistics\\").Erich Maschke: Friedrich L√ºtge [Nachruf]. In: Historische Zeitschrift. vol. 208 (1969), section 3, pp. 772‚Äì774 He also authored a celebratory booklet in respect of the fiftieth anniversary of the Gustav Fischer Verlag (publishing house): research for this commission supported and influenced the doctorate on which he was working at the same time. In 1929 he obtained a permanent position with Fischer as a literary editor and academic researcher. At Fischer he was entrusted with producing a number of works, mostly concerned with Applied economics (Volkswirtschaft) and Economic History It was also in 1929 that Friedrich L√ºtge married Eva Buchfink, a daughter of General Ernst Buchfinck. The marriage produced one recorded son and two daughters.  Jena in the 1930s  During the early 1930s he pursued his career with the publisher in parallel with his academic researches, publishing several essays on social policy and agricultural history. In 1934 he published a significant piece of work in which he pointed out that in central Germany as early as the early modern period a form of landlordship and tenancy existed which was based not on service obligation, but simply the handing over of produce. That contrasted with he versions of manorialism that was normal in the northern and southern parts of Germany. He followed this up in 1937 with a broadened study of the German agrarian economy, taking his research back to the middle ages and, in particular, to the Carolingian era. This meant that there had been fundamental regional variations in land tenure arrangements in Germany far earlier than had hitherto been believed. That same year he saw to the posthumous publication of the \\"Outline of the History of the German Rural Economy in the Middle Ages\\" (Geschichte der deutschen Landwirtschaft des Mittelalters in ihren Grundz√ºgen) by his former tutor, Georg von Below, using manuscripts that von Below had left behind when he died ten years earlier.Georg von Below: \\"Geschichte der deutschen Landwirtschaft des Mittelalters in ihren Grundz√ºgen\\". Aus den hinterlassenen Manuskripten herausgegeben von Friedrich L√ºtge [produced posthumously from von Below's manuscripts by Friedrich L√ºtge]. Fischer, Jena 1937. 1933 was the year of the National Socialist take-over. It was also the year in which L√ºtge joined the German National People's Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei, DNVP), though this party had dissolved itself by the end of that year. He also had close connections with the anti- government Confessing Church. He would later insist that his various longstanding memberships of associations connected with the army, notably Der Stahlhelm, afforded him a measure of independence in his interactions with the National Socialist state. When Der Stahlhelm was forcibly merged into the party's own Sturmabteilung (SA) paramilitary organisation, L√ºtge was one of many who responded by resigning from Der Stahlhelm. Unlike many of the scholars who preserved their university careers through the Hitler years, L√ºtge never found it necessary to join The Party itself. Nevertheless, he did join the party's \\"People's Welfare\\" (Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt, NSV) organisation in 1934. In 1937 he joined the party's \\"Teachers' League\\" (Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund, NSDDB). And in 1944 he added the Altherrenbund (\\"Old Men's League\\"), a party organisation for university academics, to his portfolio of memberships.Andreas Dornheim: Die deutsche Agrargeschichte in der NS-Zeit und die Lehrstuhl-Berufungen nach 1945 in Westdeutschland. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr Agrargeschichte und Agrarsoziologie 53 (2005), pp. 39‚Äì55 In January 1936 he received his habilitation degree from the University of Jena, which opened the way to a university teaching career in respect of Applied economics (Volkswirtschaft) and Economic history. Because of the amount of relevant research work that he had already undertaken he was awarded the habilitation without any requirement to write a habilitation- dissertation. The faculty deemed the two dissertations he had already completed in respect of his doctorates sufficient. Receipt of his teaching permit (venia legendi) was delayed till the next year due to differences with government authorities. There is speculation that he only received it at all because of his longstanding personal friendship with the nationally respected economist Jens Jessen who at this stage was still a committed party member (though he would later be executed by hanging). In 1937 L√ºtge began working as a teacher in his disciplines at the Jena University Law and Economics faculties.  Leipzig in the 1940s  In 1940 L√ºtge was offered and accepted a junior professorship in economics (Volkswirtschaft), with a particular focus on settlement and housing at the Handelshochschule Leipzig (HHL; \\"Commercial Academy\\") ‚Äì as it was known at that time, in Leipzig. He had already been taking a quasi-scientific approach to the housing issues which was at the time innovative. His specialities included housing-market pricing and statistics. In 1940, the year of his appointment, he was in a position to publish a systematic introduction to settlement and housing, which was republished in 1949. it can be seen as the first comprehensive academic monograph on the subject. Karl Bosl: Friedrich L√ºtge 21.10.1901‚Äì25.8.1968. In: Jahrbuch der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. 1964, pp. 202‚Äì205, He was conscripted into the army in August 1941, but was released on health grounds in May 1943 after being assessed as unsuitable for service on account of a spinal condition. He returned to the Leipzig and was promoted to a full professorship. Jointly with Erich Preiser he took on responsibility for the annual production of the Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik (\\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Statistics\\"). The compendium was banned in 1944 but returned, still produced by L√ºtge and Preise, in 1949. War ended in May 1945 and the western two thirds of what had been Germany was divided into four military occupation zones. Leipzig had been liberated from National Socialism in April 1945 by the US army, but a different division of Germany had already been agreed between the leaders of the victorious powers whereby Leipzig should be administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. The American military commanders agreed that Friedrich L√ºtge, as a \\"non-party comrade\\" and a member of the anti-Nazi Confessing church should be appointed post-war rector of the Handelshochschule Leipzig. There were additional curatorial responsibilities. When the American troops withdrew from Leipzig in July 1945 the Soviet commanders who moved in were content to confirm his appointment. In 1946 the academy was merged into the University Faculty for Economics and Social Sciences and L√ºtge, now on the Leipzig university payroll, was appointed dean. L√ºtge was no fan of Communism. He characterised the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party as \\"warring brothers from the same root\\" (\\"feindliche Br√ºder des gleichen Stammes\\")Markus Wustmann: Die Gesellschaftswissenschaftliche Fakult√§t in Leipzig 1947‚Äì1951. In: Ulrich von Hehl (editor-compiler): Sachsens Landesuniversit√§t in Monarchie, Republik und Diktatur. Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Universit√§t Leipzig vom Kaiserreich bis zur Aufl√∂sung des Landes Sachsen 1952, Leipzig 2005, , pp. 289‚Äì306 He therefore did what he could to resist state mandated appointments of party- line goal oriented Marxist professors to his faculty. That led to accusations that he was trying to block denazification and to protect Nazis. The university nominated him to take over as dean of their new social sciences faculty but the Soviet Zone administration for popular education (Deutsche Verwaltung f√ºr Volksbildung) then rejected the appointment because of his political stance. Before his position could become any more difficult, in September 1946 L√ºtge accepted a chair in political economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and relocated to the US occupation zone (after May 1949 part of West Germany) to take up his new position. The Munich job also came with directorship of the Economic History Seminar that had been created at the university by Jakob Strieder back in the 1920s.  Postwar Munich  Friedrich L√ºtge took up his teaching chair at Munich in 1946 or 1947.. The next year his colleague Hans Proesler, Munich's Professor of Economic History, left to take up a new position in Nuremberg and L√ºtge took on his former colleague's discipline, now in charge of both the Applied economics (Volkswirtschaft) Institute and that of the university Institute for Economic History. Meanwhile, in the Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic / East Germany)) L√ºtge's 1940 book Kriegsprobleme der Wohnungswirtschaft (\\"War Problems of Settlement and Housing\\") was consigned to the official list of books to be weeded out (Liste der auszusondernden Literatur). Alongside his duties at the university he also taught at the Technical University of Munich and at the city's then separate University for Politics Munich (Hochschule f√ºr Politik M√ºnchen). That was the context in which his 1948 book Einf√ºhrung in die Lehre vom Gelde (\\"Introduction to the Doctrine of Money\\") appeared. He had already, while still at Leipzig, highlighted the unique nature of historical landlord and tenant relationships in Bavaria, and in 1949 he published the resulting study under the title Die bayerische Grundherrschaft ‚Äì Untersuchungen √ºber die Agrarverfassung Altbayerns im 16.‚Äì18. Jahrhundert (\\"Bavarian Manorialism ‚Äì Investigations into the agrarian constitutional structures in old Bavaria from sixteenth to eighteenth centuries\\"). In addition to these agrarian historical themes, L√ºtge's postwar research scope covered trade and commerce, notably in protestant Nuremberg. He also re- evaluated conventional definitions of western historical periods through the prisms of economic and agrarian history, both in writing and in lectures, which gave rise to lively discussions between experts.Knut Borchardt: Friedrich L√ºtge. In: Wilhelm Abel, Knut Borchardt, Hermann Kellenbenz, Wolfgang Zorn (editor-compilers): Wirtschaft, Geschichte und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. Festschrift zum 65. Geburtstag von Friedrich L√ºtge. Fischer, Stuttgart 1966, pp. 1‚Äì7 In 1949 German Historians' Day took place at Munich and L√ºtge took the opportunity to set out his thesis that the Black Death which reached Europe between 1346 and 1350, and the ensuing changes in economic and political power balances that ensued as a result of depopulation, made 1350 a much more plausible starting point for \\"Modern history\\" than 1500 which then (as now) was widely ‚Äì often unquestioningly ‚Äì identified as the starting point for the modern era in European history. The next year he set out the contention in greater detail in the newly redesigned and relaunched Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik (\\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Statistics\\").Friedrich L√ºtge: Das 14./15. Jahrhundert in der Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. In: Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Geschichte. vol. 162, 1950, pp. 161‚Äì213. He challenged another historians' shibboleth in 1958 when he argued that the decades directly preceding the Thirty Years' War had not been a period of slow decline, marked by a succession of poor harvests in Europe, as widely believed, but that it was only the outbreak of hostilities in 1618 that put an end to several decades of dynamic economic development.Friedrich L√ºtge: Die wirtschaftliche Lage Deutschlands vor Ausbruch des Drei√üigj√§hrigen Krieges. In: Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik. vol 170, 1958, pp. 43‚Äì99. Wohnungswirtschaft (\\"settlement and housing\\") was a topic that continued to interest him during his Munich years. L√ºtge was a member of an \\"Expert Advisory Committee\\" to the West German Ministry for Housing Development, and in 1949 published a new edition of his introduction to settlement and housing. Then in 1957 he authored a further contribution titled Die Wohnungs- und Siedlungswirtschaft in der Konjunktur (\\"Housing and urban development and the economic cycle\\").Friedrich L√ºtge: Die Wohnungs- und Siedlungswirtschaft in der Konjunktur. R. M√ºller, K√∂ln- Braunsfeld 1957. In 1960 he received an invitation, which in the end he turned down, to take a professorship in Economic History at the University of Cologne. This triggered a negotiation with his own university in Munich which led to a re-assignment of teaching responsibilities that corresponded more closely with the reality of what was already happening. At the same time his \\"Seminar for Economic History\\" was extended in scope and elevated in status, becoming the university \\"Institute for Social and Economic History\\". In 1967 he published in a single volume a synthesis from his various regional studies concerning German agrarian societal structures from the early middle ages till the Bauernbefreiung (liberation of the peasantry) in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This appeared as Volume 3 of the Deutsche Agrargeschichte (\\"German Agrarian History\\") series produced by G√ºnther Franz (which would eventually extend to 40 volumes). Back in 1952 he had already published Deutsche Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte (\\"German Social and Economic History\\") which provides a multi-faceted overview of his entire research scope, and a widely used textbook which in some ways represents his most important contribution to historiography. New reworked editions appeared in 1960 and 1966. In 1967/68 Friedrich L√ºtge succeeded in obtaining funding for a second teaching chair in Economic and Social History at Munich. Wolfgang Zorn was invited to fill it. Friedrich L√ºtge himself was by this point seriously ill. He died on 25 August 1968. He was succeeded at Munich by Knut Borchardt.  Memberships and celebration  From 1955 Friedrich L√ºtge was a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Munich. In addition, in 1966 he became a corresponding member of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium. At the Munich academy he initiated the establishment of a commission for social and economic history, the committee of which he then chaired. On 18 February 1961 the Gesellschaft f√ºr Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte (GSWG; \\"Society for Social and Economic History\\") was founded. L√ºtge was key to its creation. Till his death he served as its first chairman. Since 2005 the GSWG has awarded a Friedrich L√ºtge Prize every two years \\"for outstanding dissertations on Social and Economic History\\". L√ºtge also headed up the Economic History committee of the German Economic Association (Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik) between 1958 and 1962.  Producer- editor / Publisher  In 1943 L√ºtge teamed up with G√ºnther Franz to launch the Quellen und Forschungen zur Agrargeschichte (\\"Sources and Research in Agrarian History\\") series at Gustav Fischer Verlag. The times were not propitious, but after the war, joined by Wilhelm Abel, they made a success of the initiative. At the same publishing house L√ºtge launched another series, Forschungen zur Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte \\"Researches into Social and Economic History\\") in 1959. Additionally, from the last part of 1943, together with Erich Preiser he became co-producer of the annual Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik (\\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Statistics\\"), on which he had previously worked under the direction of Ludwig Elster, securing the publication's future through a difficult period. After Preiser died in August 1967, L√ºtge became sole producer of it, but his illness forced him out in May 1968. He seriously considered renaming the Jahrb√ºcher as Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Wirtschaftsgeschichte (\\"Yearbooks of National Economy and Economic History\\") in order more accurately to reflect the interdisciplinary approach taken under his stewardship, but that name change never happened. In 1953 he also became one of the co-producers of the Zeitschrift f√ºr Agrargeschichte und Agrarsoziologie (\\"Journal for Agrarian History and Sociology\\").

Published by The Australian newspaper, the podcast was hosted by journalist Hedley Thomas and produced by Slade Gibson. It has been downloaded 28 million times and reached number one in podcast charts in Australia, the UK, Canada and New Zealand.  Description  Lynette Dawson was an Australian homemaker and mother. She disappeared without a trace in 1982 and her whereabouts, dead or alive, have never been determined. The Teachers Pet podcast investigated details of her marriage to rugby league player and teacher Chris Dawson, her disappearance, an extramarital affair between her husband and a sixteen-year-old school girl, claims of sexual misconduct between teachers and students at Cromer High and other Northern Beaches public high schools, flaws in the police investigation, effects on the families involved and the unwillingness of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to charge Chris Dawson despite two coronial inquests concluding that Dawson was dead and most likely killed by her husband. Thomas created the podcast and the series was produced by Slade Gibson, former guitarist for the rock band Savage Garden. The series commenced in May 2018 and the core podcast concluded in August 2018 after 14 episodes. When announcing the final episode, Thomas stated that, \\"The investigating and reporting job has largely been done in examining and bringing to light the new evidence that‚Äôs out there,\\" and added that more episodes would be produced when new leads are fully explored. Two further episodes were added in late 2018 as the case evolved; the first covered a new dig for evidence at the Dawsons's former Bayview home, and the second detailed the arrest of Dawson on 5 December 2018 by detectives from the Queensland Homicide squad. On advice from the Office of the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, and in the interests of a fair trial, The Australian removed The Teachers Pet from download in Australia in April 2019, prior to the upcoming court case.

Both Thomas and Gibson won Gold Walkley Awards for The Teacher's Pet. Despite Walkley Award judges declaring the podcast to be a \\"a masterclass in investigative journalism\\", in an article for Inside story Melbourne Law School professor Jeremy Gans stated that \\"As admissible evidence goes, the podcast‚Äôs case is even less compelling\\" and attributed any new leads to the popularity and publicity generated by The Teacher's Pet, rather than any investigation done by the podcast. The Sydney Morning Herald reported a police source as stating \\"that \\"100 per cent\\" of the reason for the new dig was public pressure that had come about following the podcast and subsequent media and public interest in the case\\", but \\"Witnesses have told police and the podcast two different versions of events\\" and that \\"some of the information used in the podcast came from a clairvoyant.\\" The ABC also reported police sources as denying that The Teacher's Pet investigation led to Chris Dawson's arrest. In July 2018, NSW Police began Strike Force Southwood to look into claims of sexual assaults and student-teacher relationships at high schools mentioned in the podcast,and it has been credited with encouraging more women to come forward to give evidence. While crediting The Teachers Pet with inspiring investigations into the possible abuse, The Sydney Morning Herald commented after Dawson's arrest that the popularity and biased nature of the podcast would jeopardise any conviction, as the defence had a \\"compelling argument that their client has little chance of receiving a fair trial\\".

As a senior editor at the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes, he was present at all the exhibitions where he defended painters confronted with mockery and insults. His collection was huge. It was dispersed after his death in 1899. Many of the paintings are currently in American museums.  Life  Chocquet was born in Lille in a wealthy family of silk millers. At a very young age, he devoted all his resources to the purchase of works of art: paintings (including those of Eug√®ne Delacroix, Gustave Courbet, Honor√© Daumier) porcelain, and furniture. In 1875, when he attended the 1875 Impressionist sale at the H√¥tel Drouot, he fell in love with the paintings hooted by the audience. He asked Auguste Renoir to paint a portrait of his wife and their little daughter Marie-Sophie who died at the age of five, based on a photograph. During this first sale of the \\"Soci√©t√© anonyme des artistes\\" at the H√¥tel Drouot on 24 March 1875, the painters' receipts did not cover their expenses, the average price of a painting amounting to 100 fr. That day he was one of the first supports of the artists with Ernest Hosched√© and . Particularly enthusiastic about Paul C√©zanne whose paintings he saw at P√®re Tanguy's home, he spent a lot of energy verbally defending the painters at the 1876 and 1877 exhibitions to which he lent works from his collection. Despite the quolibets that welcomed C√©zanne's presentation of his own portrait and despite violent criticism from the press, he was not discouraged, even when his resources diminished when he took early retirement (1877). From 1882, his mother-in-law's inheritance allowed him to resume his purchases and he acquired a property in Hattenville (Normandy) where a large number of works, including Ferme √† Hattenville, by C√©zanne, were painted. His collection rivaled those of the greatest collectors: he was often quoted at the same time as Georges de Bellio and Eug√®ne Murer in the press. He owned about 32 paintings by C√©zanne. In Paris, Victor Chocquet first lived in an apartment rue de Rivoli that overlooked the Tuileries Garden. It is from there that Monet painted several paintings, including Vue sur le jardin des Tuileries (1876). huile sur toile de 53.97 x 73.2 At the end of his life, he moved to a small 18th-century mansion house, rue Monsigny. Chocquet died in Paris on 7 April 1891 at age 69.

A row-polymorphic type system and proof of type inference was introduced by Mitchell Wand.  Records and record types  A record value is written as \\\\\\\\{\\\\ell_1 = e_1, \\\\dots, \\\\ell_n = e_n\\\\\\\\}, where the record contains n fields (columns), \\\\ell_i are the record fields, and e_i are field values. For example, a record containing a three-dimensional cartesian point could be written as Point3d = \\\\\\\\{x = 1, y = 2, z = 3\\\\\\\\}. The row-polymorphic record type is written as \\\\\\\\{\\\\ell_1 : T_1, \\\\dots, \\\\ell_n : T_n, \\\\text{absent}(f_1), \\\\dots, \\\\text{absent}(f_m), \\\\rho\\\\\\\\}, where possibly n = 0 or m = 0. A record r has the row-polymorphic record type whenever the field of the record \\\\ell_i has the type T_i (for i = 1 \\\\dots n) and does not have any of the fields f_j (for j = 1 \\\\dots m). The row-polymorphic variable \\\\rho expresses the fact the record may contain other fields than \\\\ell_i. The row-polymorphic record types allow us to write programs that operate only on a section of a record. For example, \\\\text{transform2d} : \\\\\\\\{x : \\\\text{Float}, y : \\\\text{Float}, \\\\rho\\\\\\\\} \\\\to \\\\\\\\{x : \\\\text{Float}, y : \\\\text{Float}, \\\\rho\\\\\\\\} is a function that performs some two- dimensional transformation. Because of row polymorphism, the function may perform two-dimensional transformation on a three-dimensional (in fact, n-dimensional) point, leaving the z coordinate intact. What is more, the function can perform on any record that contains the fields x and y with type \\\\text{Float}. Note that there was no loss of information: the type ensures that all the fields represented by the variable \\\\rho are present in the return type. The row polymorphisms may be constrained. The type \\\\\\\\{x : \\\\text{Float}, y : \\\\text{Float}, \\\\mathbf{empty}\\\\\\\\} expresses the fact that a record of that type has exactly the x and y fields and nothing else. Thus, a classic record type is obtained.  Typing operations on records  The record operations of selecting a field r.\\\\ell, adding a field, r[\\\\ell:=e] and removing a field r \\\\backslash \\\\ell can be given row-polymorphic types. \\\\mathrm{select_\\\\ell} = \\\\lambda r.

The objects found are either aesthetically pleasing or informationally fulfilling to a seeker. This mostly includes the deep web and the darknet, partially IoT devices, deprecated or developing web protocols. Although irrational, the activity develops web searching skills and mindful work with information. The term of \\"netstalking\\" was most likely created in 2009 in Russian part of the Net, and refers to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  Methods of netstalking  In netstalking, there are two general methods for finding unusual information: a deli-search and a net-random. Deli-search, or \\"deliberated search\\" is a targeted search for objects of interest whose characteristics are already known.This method usually uses the language of search queries and web archives, with which you can view old or deleted versions of these pages. Net-random searches for hidden and unknown information through the process of ‚Äútrial and error‚Äù. For netstalkers, the second method is considered to be the most popular way to search for information, as it allows network researchers to find undefined hidden resources. Net-randoming is done by either scanning IP address ranges or by using content randomizers, such as PetitTube. Special programs are used for scanning include Advanced IP scanner, Nmap / Zenmap, NESCA, and RouterScan by Stas‚Äôm.  Search areas  Netstalkers analyze the entire Internet, which is traditionally divided into several conditional segments.  Surface web  The surface web is the public Internet. In this part, you can find everything that is used by the average user of the network: social networks, blogs, encyclopaedias, news sites and others. In other words, the surface web is all that can be found using ordinary search engines (Google, Yahoo and others). The surface web accounts for about 15-20% of all information on the Internet.  Deep web  The deep web is made of non-indexable resources that cannot be found with the help of search engines. This happens for several reasons. The main one is that only the owner knows about the site or server, and he has never published a link to his page anywhere. Deep web is of greatest interest to network researchers because of its vastness and non- knowledge. Netstalkers use programs to scan ranges of IP addresses to study this segment.  Darknet or Dark web  The darknet is closed Internet space which cannot be accessed using network programs. These are government, corporate or military networks. The most famous and popular representative of Darknet is Tor. Its popularity is due to the possibility of distributing prohibited materials under conditions of some anonymity. To view it, special software is needed, namely Tor, I2P, Freenet, or other services that allow the user to bypass the blocking of many sites. This gives access to restricted resources that are inaccessible to ordinary Internet users. Such resources cannot be accessed from standard browsers even if there is a standard internet connection. Darknet can be dangerous for inexperienced users, children, and ordinary users. Yet there are also informative or leisure web pages.  Major findings of netstalkers  Usually in the hidden segments of the Internet, netstalkers find non-indexed web pages. Occasionally those are the objects of net-art. Jon Rafman's ‚ÄúNine Eyes of Google Street View‚Äù project is one of the largest highlights of net-art. A distinctive feature of net-art is the fact that it is the surface Internet that can be its primary environment for its creation and distribution. By a similar method, one can discover \\"unexisting\\" streets on Google Maps, which are unknown to common people. Also, netstalkers find recordings from surveillance cameras and view them in search of strange or interesting events. Another direction is network archeology‚Äîthat is, the search for once popular, but now forgotten resources, including outdated protocols. An interesting fact is that netstalkers have found unprotected servers of NPPs and state structures, however, such findings usually don't pick much interest, as they're seen as a more generic finding.  Criticism  Because of the aura of mystery around the activities of the netstalkers and their legends, they first attracted the attention of the administrators of the ‚Äúdeath groups‚Äù, and then law enforcement agencies became interested in their activities. Net-art, images and legends were actively used by administrators of the forbidden \\"death groups\\" for their own promotion. For example, the legend of the ‚ÄúSilent House‚Äù, recognised by the creators as fiction, has acquired a cult and suicidal meaning. This led to a temporary crisis of netstalking as a cultural phenomenon because an unusual amount of new participants came into it, not to research the web but to experience some kind of mystery. Although netstalking is occasionally accused of propagating the violent or neurotic content and faux information, such as deep web legends, yet in reality their activities are of revealing and deconstructing those. Netstalking participants criticised themselves claiming that not many people are engaged in a detailed analysis of what was found, even with advanced search skills. In addition, according to some, netstalking was harmed by the artificially created mysticism. It is opposed by them as the \\"natural thirst for the unknown\\", the driving force of netstalking.

(2007). What is Scandinavian law? Social private law. Stockholm: Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law, Law Faculty, Stockholm University. is the law of the five Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. It is generally regarded as a subgroup of civil law or as an individual legal body in itself. Prior to the 19th century, the European countries were independent in their administering and legality. However, in 1872, the Nordic countries organised legislative cooperation. Especially in areas of contracts and commerce, as well as those concerned with family, nationality and extradition, the five states have obtained uniform legislation.Swift, H. (2017). LibGuides: Nordic countries: IALS Library Guides. [online] Libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk. Available at: https://libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk/nordic [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. Historial development Prior to the establishment of Scandinavian states in the 19th century, the numerous regions were independent in their administration and legal matters. Initially, the legal system had no written laws; rather, it consisted of customary law that was developed and reformed by the citizens themselves at meetings known as \\"things\\". Customary laws were recorded in writing between the 11th and 13th centuries. These include, the Gulathing's law (11th century, Norwegian); the law of Jutland (1241, Danish); and the laws of Uppland (1296, Swedish) and G√∂taland (13th century, Swedish).Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. The early laws were not formatted as they are in modern-day legal systems, rather they used codes. These included private law, namely criminal law, family law, succession, property law, contract law, constitutional and administrative law. Laws relating to the Church were usually treated separate to laws of the states and people. The codes represented customary laws and usually, foreign influences were neglected. Mutual with Germanic laws, the provincial laws abided by externalities and thus, were more advanced. King Magnus' Swedish code (1350) abolished the concepts of vengeance, stating that the king's officials should be the necessary authorities in administering criminal proceedings and hold punishment for those who went against the law. Further, presumably by influence of the Christian religion, the legal system was introduced for the benefit of peasants and the helpless class. Although in 1380 Norway and Denmark were ruled by a common king ‚Äì Olav IV, the two states maintained laws separate to one another. Before the acquisition by Frederick III in 1660, supplementary laws were introduced. During the rule of Christian V, a thorough process of codification took place, with the earlier laws being replaced by Christian V's Danish Law (1683) and Norwegian Law (1687). These new laws were predominantly based on the existing laws of the two countries with influences of Germanic and Roman laws being fairly minor. Similar to the earlier laws, these new laws consisted of both public and private law. At the time of their drafting, these codes read well and reflected individual human rights and the ideologies of equality. Further, in comparison to the laws of other European countries, the criminal law provisions were fair, humane and reflected individual rights. In Sweden, the laws issued by King Christopher in 1442 were affirmed by Charles IX in 1608. However, following the Danish-Norwegian reforms, a royal commission was assembled to draft a modern new code. The result being, \\"the Law of 1734\\", declared by Frederick I. Held by Sweden in the 13th century, Finland followed the Swedish law of 1734, which was translated in Finnish as \\"Law of the Realm of Finland\\". Modern Scandinavian law In most of the five Nordic States, the old codes have developed by parliamentary statutes. However, in Sweden, the law of 1734 is still regarded as a formal framework. In the other countries, codes are no longer of importance, rather, comprehensive codification of public and private law holds importance. While the historic codes still hold significance in Scandinavia today, the developments in modern Scandinavia has led to growth in Scandinavian civil law by way of statutes. Although the five Nordic countries follow similar legal theories, they have developed their own legal standards. Nonetheless, the countries follow an agreement to cooperate on legislative matters.Cagan, D. and Simonyi, A. (n.d.). Nordic Ways. Since 1872 when the agreement was entered into, the organised legislative cooperation in Scandinavian law has progressively increased in significance. As such, the Nordic states have achieved uniform legislation, in fields of contracts, commerce, family, nation and extradition.Husa, J., Nuotio, K. and Pihlajam√§ki, H. (2007). Nordic law. Antwerp: Intersentia. Scandinavian legal systems adopted their civil law conceptions through the influence of law schools and commercial and corporations law are similar to European laws. Further, modern social welfare and human rights legislation has strong connections with the international laws. Scandinavian law, with a foundation of its customary laws, is pliable and less authoritarian than other European legal systems as it is relatively less restrictive. The laws focus greatly on rules, principles and precedents that have developed in practice, especially in courts. Further, most laws are judge-made, and as the principle of stare decisis does not apply, the courts are open to reflect ever-changing social conditions.Rheinstein, M. (2018). The Growth of Scandinavian Law. 21st ed. [ebook] Chicago: University of Chicago Law Review. Available at: https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=13373&context;=journal_articles [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. Sources of Law Although each Nordic state follows either a common or civil law system, it is proclaimed that these Scandinavian countries have adopted jurisprudence that falls neither in the civil law system nor the common law system. All five of the Nordic states have their own respective Constitutions upon which their legislative framework is based. Whilst these Constitutions are all separate in nature, due to the legal cooperation between the Scandinavian states, the Constitutions are similar in their aims and contribute to the laws holistically.Swift, H. (2017). LibGuides: Nordic countries: IALS Library Guides. [online] Libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk. Available at: https://libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk/nordic [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. Norwegian law Norway's legal system is a civil law system. Therefore, legislation is the predominant source of law, however not the sole one. According to legal scholar and author Torstein Eckhoff, there are seven sources of Norwegian law, including: # Legislation; # Legislative history; # Case law; # Administrative practice; # Customary law; # Legal literature; and # Equity Due to the Nordic legal cooperation, this list is not exhaustive. Laws are informed and correspond to the other Scandinavian states. The three distinctive sections of Norwegian law are the Constitution, then ordinary statutes and followed by the regulations derived from statutes Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. Norway adopted its Constitution in 1814 and holds the position of the second oldest hand-written Constitution in the world which is still in use. The Constitution consists of a set of Norwegian laws based upon the legal principles of sovereignty, the separation and division of powers and universal human rights.Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The- Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. The Constitution forms three distinctive branches of government, including: # Legislative power vested in the Storting; # Executive power vested in the King in Council, Regjeringen; and # Judicial power vested in the Supreme Court, the subsidiary courts and in the Court of Impeachment. Article 49 and 75 of the Constitution highlight the principles of sovereignty whereby it states that the people of Norway issue laws, make decisions regarding the states' funds, impose taxes and supervise authorities, including the Government, by way of the Storting. Stated within Article 3 of the Constitution, the executive power is held by the King, or the Queen. However, according to Article 27, Royal laws are adopted by the King in Council. Such laws are validated by the Prime Minister, the political leadership upon which the constitutional and senatorial responsibility is bestowed. Published by the Faculty of Law in Oslo and Fagbokforlaget, Norges Lover Norway's most comprehensive code of law. It consists of one volume published annually and used by law students, legal professional and officers of the court. The code contains the Constitution, legislation in force, adopted legislation yet to take effect and also pre-1814 legislation which is still valid and in force.NORGES LOVER. (2018). [S.l.]: VIGMOSTAD & BJORKE. As the Storting only passes entirely new Acts and abolishes the old Acts, amendments to legislation are integrated in the existing statutes. The Norges Lover follows a chronological order by date of enactment, excluding the Constitution, which is placed at the front of the code. Swedish law Swedish law is a civil law system manifested on statutory laws. Sweden's Constitution consists of the four \\"fundamental laws\\", consisting of: # The Instrument of Government (1974); # The Act of Succession (1810); # The Freedom of the Press Act (1949); and # The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991)The Constitution of Sweden. (2016). [ebook] Stockholm: Sveriges Riksdag, pp.9-22. Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument-- lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. Further to the above, there is also the Riksdag Act which translates to the Parliament Act (1974), however this is not classified as a law fundamental to the state. The fundamental laws take precedence over all other laws. The written Constitution regulates the Riksdag ‚Äì the Swedish Parliament, the appointing of Government officials and it sets out the key ways in which Sweden's authorities shall function. The Swedish Code of Statutes is Sweden's official compilation of all laws enacted by the Riksdag and regulations issued by the Government.Riksdagen.se. (2018). Documents and laws. [online] Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/en/documents-and-laws/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. This Code is enacted into statutory law, however it forms its own unified legal code containing all of the laws passed by the Government, including civil and criminal law, procedure, regulations, legal information and all other legal articles pertinent to Sweden. Although Sweden follows a civil law system, this Code of Statutes combines both statutory and civil law. The Code is amended frequently and amendments are integrated to the existing statutes. Similar to Norway, Sweden's Constitution is placed at the front of its Code of Statutes. Finnish law Finnish laws and legal traditions are influenced by Swedish law and holistically also the Scandinavian and German legal families. Based on civil law tradition, the law of Finland consists mostly of statutory law enacted by the Parliament of Finland. Finland's Constitution takes supreme authority and sets out the procedures and guidelines for the application of legislation. Similar to other civil law systems, judicial decisions are generally not authoritative in nature and there is often not many judge-made laws. Further, Supreme Court decisions may be cited, however they are not actually binding. Being a member of the European Union, Finland enacts many European Union laws and implements the European Union directives in its national laws.Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. Finland's Constitution came into force in 2000 and aims to regulate legislation and the manner in which government power is exercised. It specifies the primary rules, values and principles of the Finnish government and democracy. Furthermore, it details the significance of the relationship between the citizen and the government. In relation to the government, the Constitution governs the use of government power, the government organisation and the authorities and organs of the government. Danish law The Danish legal system is a combination of public and civil law. This mix of law suggests that Danish law focuses on societal interests and also that the states organs are vested with greater authority than the courts in applying legal frameworks. The legal system primarily consists of statutory regulation, principles and laws. Similar to the other Nordic states, although the courts have authority to create laws, the statutory law is supplemented by customary law and case law. Alike all other Scandinavian countries, the Constitution of Denmark is at the top of the legal hierarchy.Eurojuris Espa√±a. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion- eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. Adopted in 1849, the principle aim of Denmark's Constitution was to abolish the absolute monarchy by limiting the King's power and introduce a system of democracy. It establishes the framework for governance by way of structure, procedure, power and the duties bestowed on the Danish Parliament. The Danish Parliament known is not permitted to make laws which may invalidate or contradict the Constitutional Act. Although Denmark does not have a court to try constitutional matters, laws can be declared unconstitutional and void by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Denmark. Icelandic law Iceland has a civil law system and therefore its main sources of law include the Constitution, statutory legislation and regulatory statutes. Complementing sources include precedent and customary laws followed by Scandinavia. The most recent Constitution of Iceland is of 1999. It is regarded as the supreme law of Iceland and highlights the leadership structures of the country and preserves the human rights of its citizens.Sff.is. (2018). The legal system in Iceland sff.is. [online] Available at: https://sff.is/en/legislation/legal- system-iceland [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018]. Apart from the Constitution from which it is influenced and regulated, legislation in Iceland takes primacy as a source of law. The increasing propensity of social, economic and political trends has resulted in a greater significance of laws by way of new general acts targeting niche sectors such as customs, respect of children, banking, communication and corporations' laws. Academic views on Scandinavian law The Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law (SISL) proclaims that as all of the Nordic states follow the civil law system, Scandinavian law as a whole should be classified as civil law as opposed to common law. Due to the fact that common law has taken little precedence in the development of law in the Nordic countries and additionally that all legal concepts presently adopted in Scandinavian law have been derived from the civil Germanic law, the SISL views Scandinavian law as a civil law system.

As a two-year-old in 2009 he was undefeated in three races including the Group 3 Prix des Ch√™nes. In the following spring he lost his unbeaten record in the Prix Omnium II but then took the Prix de Guiche. He rebounded from a disappointing effort in the Prix du Jockey Club to win the Grand Prix de Paris and then returned in autumn to win the Prix Niel. Later that year he finished fourth when favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and ran third in the Breeders' Cup Turf. After finishing second on his only race as a four-year-old he was retired from racing and exported to become a breeding stallion in Japan. Background Behkabad is a dark bay or brown horse bred in France by his owner Aga Khan IV. The colt was sent into training with Jean-Claude Rouget and was ridden in all but three of his races by Christophe Lemaire. He was sired by Cape Cross a leading miler who won the Lockinge Stakes in 1998 and the Queen Anne Stakes in the following year. As a breeding stallion Cape Cross, who stands at the Kildangan Stud in County Kildare has had considerable success, being the sire of Ouija Board, Sea the Stars, Golden Horn and Able One. Behkabad's dam Behkara was a top-class staying mare who won the Prix Chaudenay and finished second in the Prix Royal-Oak. She was in turn a daughter of Behera an even better racemare who won the Prix Saint-Alary and ran second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Behera was descended from the French broodmare Astana (foaled 1956) who was the ancestor of many major winners including Laurens, Daylami and Dalakhani. Racing career 2009: two-year-old season Behkabad made his racecourse debut in a race over 1200 metres at La Teste-de-Buch Racecourse near Bordeaux on 7 July in which he was ridden by Ioritz Mendizabal and won by a short neck from Speedy Chop. Four weeks later he was partnered by Christophe Soumillon in the 1500 metre Prix d'Etreham at Deauville Racecourse and came home first, a short neck in front of Arasin (later renamed Helene Spirit). On 19 September the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Prix des Ch√™nes over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was ridden for the first time by Lemaire and started the 1.4/1 favourite against four opponents. After racing towards the rear he produced a strong late run, took the lead in the final strides and won by three quarters of a length from Arasin. 2010: three-year-old season On his three-year-old debut on 1 April Behkabad started odds-on favourite for the Listed Prix Omnium II over 1600 metres on heavy ground at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and finished third behind No Risk At All and Tiptoe after being given a gentle ride by Lemaire. Behkabad faced No Risk At All and Tiptoe again in the Prix de Guiche over 1800 metres at Chantilly on 10 May. He took the lead from the start, accelerated clear of the field in the straight, and held off the late charge of No Risk At All to win by a neck. In the Prix du Jockey Club over 2100 metres at Chantilly on 6 June Behkabad started the 8/1 fourth favourite a field of 22 runners. After racing in mid-division he was hampered 600 metres out before being switched to the outside in the straight and staying on well to finish fourth behind Lope de Vega, Planteur and Pain Perdu. On 14 July, with G√©rald Moss√© deputising for the injured Lemaire, Behkabad was stepped up in distance for the Grand Prix de Paris over 2400 metres on very soft ground at Longchamp. In a nine-runner field he was made the 5/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Planteur, Jan Vermeer (Crit√©rium International) and Goldwaki (Prix du Lys). After settling in third place Behkabad took the lead 500 metres from the finish and kept on strongly in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length from Planteur with a gap of five lengths back to Jan Vermeer in third. After the race Behkabad's odds for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe were cut from 20/1 to 10/1. After a break of almost two months Behkabad returned in the Group 3 Prix Niel, a race which often serves as an important trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He started favourite ahead of Planteur with the best of the other five runners appearing to be the Japanese challenger Victoire Pisa. After tracking Planteur throughout the race he overtook his rival in the final strides and won by a head, with the pair finishing four lengths clear of the rest. Jean-Claude Rouget commented \\"He's a brave and good horse and everything went according to plan and he won well enough in the end. But this was only the comeback race and he'll be spot-on for the Arc\\". On 3 October Behkabad headed the betting for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp after Lemaire opted to ride himin preference to the Aga Khan's Prix de Diane winner Sarafina. He finished fourth behind Workforce, Nakayama Festa and Sarafina, but looked somewhat unlucky, enduring a \\"terrible trip\\" which saw him repeatedly blocked when attempting to obtain a clear run in the straight. For his last run of the year the colt was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs on 6 November. He was made a strong favourite for the race but was outpaced in the straight and came home third behind Dangerous Midge and Champ Pegasus. In the 2010 World Thoroughbred Rankings Behkabad was assessed at 122, making him the twenty-third best horse in the world, and the tenth best three- year-old. 2011: four-year-old season Behkabad made his only appearance as a four-year-old in the Grand Prix de Chantilly on 5 June in which he was beaten a head by Silver Pond, to whom he was conceding seven pounds in weight. Stud career At the end of his racing career Behkabad was exported to become a breeding stallion in Japan. By 2018 he had sired over a hundred winners but no top-class performers.

His notable credits include writing for Late Night with Conan O'Brien for seven years, and serving as co-creator, writer, and executive producer for Nathan for You, which aired for four seasons.  Early life  Koman grew up in San Diego and developed a strong interest in comedy from a young age. His early outlets for this interest included the sketch comedy show SCTV, which he watched enthusiastically; the collection of classic vinyl comedy albums held at UCSD's library, to which he listened extensively; and The Comedy Store club near his home in La Jolla, where he secured an after-school job while he was still in high school. This job led to Koman performing his own short stand-up sets. Koman's screenwriting career began with a job submitting sketches for MADtv. This opportunity materialized in 1999 after Koman, who was attending college in Los Angeles and occasionally performing at The Improv there, wrote and produced with his friend and fellow comic Todd Glass a sketch show called \\"Todd's Coma\\". Veteran comic actor Fred Willard appeared in the show, staged at the HBO Workspace (now the National Comedy Theatre), and Willard's manager later sent a tape on Koman's behalf to MADtv, whose producers were seeking to hire young writing talent.  Career   Late Night with Conan O'Brien  While at MADtv, Koman worked closely with Greg Cohen, who had written previously for Late Night with Conan O'Brien. On Cohen's recommendation, Koman was hired to write for O'Brien's show. Between 2001 and 2008, Koman collaborated with fellow Late Night writers including Brian Stack and Andrew Weinberg, helping to create recurring characters and bits such as \\"The Interrupter\\" and \\"Hannigan the Traveling Salesman\\". He also developed the concept behind the frequently reprised \\"Walker, Texas Ranger Lever\\" and spearheaded a parody of Aaron Sorkin's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip called \\"Studio 6A\\" (in reference to Conan's television studio in 30 Rockefeller Plaza), thus satirizing a program that was itself dramatizing a fictional version of the often satirical show Saturday Night Live. When the show filmed a special episode in Finland following the discovery of O'Brien's rabid fan base there, Koman and Weinberg, together with head writer Mike Sweeney, accompanied the host and helped generate the material. During his tenure at Late Night, Koman also occasionally appeared in on-air sketches. In one sketch, he played an accountant for the show who proposed a nonsensical solution to the gay marriage debate, which made headlines in American media in 2004. In another sketch, on May 16, 2007, O'Brien confronted Koman at home after the latter had called in sick to work. Koman was ultimately dragged into the studio for the live taping and publicly humiliated (with his obviously willing participation). This segment also precipitated a rekindling of the ongoing romance between Koman and his future wife, Ellie Kemper, who had been both a writers' staff intern at the show and a regular performer in its sketches. Around the time of the release of the first-generation of Apple's iPhone in 2007, Late Night ran a fake advertisement purporting to show how multifunctional the new device was, with Koman and Kemper appearing together in this sketch.  Post-Late Night In 2008, Koman left Late Night with the approaching transition in NBC's late- night programming that would in the following year launch the short-lived and tumultuous Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. Koman, reluctant to relocate with the rest of the Late Night staff from New York City to Los Angeles, accepted the role of head writer for Important Things with Demetri Martin. Martin was another alumnus of the Late Night writing staff, and Koman viewed the new role as an opportunity to challenge himself with greater responsibility and outside the familiar confines of Rockefeller Center. After a brief stint writing for The Colbert Report in August 2008, Koman began work on Martin's show. Among the writers soon hired there was Nathan Fielder, with whom Koman quickly formed another writing partnership. Koman's next original TV series had him reviving his former writing partnership with Weinberg and teaming up with director Jason Woliner. Eagleheart, starring Chris Elliott as an outlandish US Marshal modeled in part on the titular hero of Walker, Texas Ranger, ran on Adult Swim for three seasons (2011‚Äì2014) and was backed by O'Brien's production company Conaco. Toward the end of his direct involvement with Eagleheart, which concluded with his co-writing of its third and final season, Koman turned his attention to work on Nathan for You. Fielder had been solicited by Comedy Central to develop a pilot and had invited Koman to resume their working relationship. The concept for the show eventually coalesced around the pitching of business strategies to small companies; citing Fielder's education in business management, the show would invest heavily in unique and elaborate schemes to improve the popularity or profitability of its star's clients and would document all the consequences of such intervention. Although the show's ideas and the approaches Fielder (or his persona) took in each episode were planned by a team of writers led by Fielder and Koman (and later Carrie Kemper, Koman's sister-in-law), scripted jokes were mostly eschewed (outside of Fielder's intermittent voiceover narration). Fielder called an end to the show after its fourth season, which was broadcast in 2017. During the run of Nathan for You, Koman helped create and write for The Jack and Triumph Show, starring Jack McBrayer and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, a puppet voiced and operated by Robert Smigel. The multi-camera sitcom was inspired by a remote segment filmed at Chicago's The Wieners Circle for the TBS instantiation of O'Brien's late night talk show (called simply Conan). The show comprised seven episodes that all aired in 2015. Koman was also involved in Triumph's Election Watch 2016, produced by Funny or Die. Following the end of Nathan for You, Koman returned to New York, where he began writing for Saturday Night Live during the summer of 2017. In so doing, he earned his ninth Emmy Award nomination for his contributions to variety show writing ensembles. He previously won the award once, as a member of the Late Night writing team in 2007. He has also won six Writers Guild of America awards throughout his career.  Personal life  Koman married actress and comedian Ellie Kemper on July 7, 2012. The two had met backstage at Late Night with Conan O'Brien and had even appeared together in at least one sketch. Kemper shared the story of their engagement on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early 2012. While Koman is Jewish, the couple have two sons, James and Matthew, born in 2016 and 2019 respectively, who they are raising according to Kemper's Roman Catholic faith.

Each issue focuses on a select few destinations, with stories and interviews on design, art and style. Cereal was founded by Rosa Park (editor-in-chief) and Rich Stapleton (creative director) in 2012 as a quarterly publication. With Volume 9 (2015), Cereal changed to a biannual release schedule, publishing in March and September every year. Alongside the magazine, Cereal publishes regular digital stories on their website, update online city guides, publish physical city guide books, and publish a number of other books.  The magazine  Cereal is a travel and style magazine aimed primarily at a global audience of design conscious professionals. Each destination the magazine features is visited and personally vetted by the founders Rosa and Rich. All photography and writing is commissioned exclusively by them from a pool of freelance writers and photographers. Alongside destination features, interviews and conversations with designers, architects, artists, and chefs are printed, as well as original essays, short stories and poems. Volume 10 introduced a series of essays, short stories and poems as a pull-out literary supplement called Weekend, which published writing around a theme, such as Ego or Taste. Since Volume 13, the essays and poems were incorporated into the magazine itself. Volume 15 (Spring Summer 2018) introduced the format of presenting a unifying theme for the issue as a whole, which, in this instance, was sustainability. This angle ran through many of the interviews, as well as the choice of features and essays. For Volume 16, the theme was collecting. Designers were interviewed on their personal collections, and essays discussed collecting stones, memories and stories. There have been numerous alterations to the design and layout of the magazine volume to volume, the most conspicuous perhaps being the adoption of the grey front cover from Volume 13 onward. The most recent change was a full redesign of the layout of the magazine by Vancouver-based Studio Faculty for Volume 16.  Digital  Cereal creates and publishes regular stories specifically for their online site, with exclusive commissioned writing and photography.  Other editions  Cereal is also published in a Mandarin edition.  Cereal City Guides  In 2016 Cereal launched their City Guide series, with physical guide book editions for London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, and Copenhagen. Each guide features a selection of places to stay, eat, drink and visit within the city, illustrated by original photography. In October 2018, new editions for London, Paris and New York were published by Abrams with an expanded 200 page format and new design. An extended selection of recommendations, essays, interviews with notable locals of the city, a weekend itinerary, and souvenir suggestions were also included. Digital city guides are also available on their website.  Other publications   These Islands  In 2017 Cereal released their first hardcover, coffee table book titled These Islands: A Portrait of the British Isles. The book focuses on a selection of destinations around the British Isles, exploring each place with photo essays, poems, stories, and writing. Rather than recommending to readers where to stay or what to do, it describes the places in visual, poetic language, as an ode to the destination. These Islands was edited by Rosa Park, and was written by Richard Aslan, Charlie Lee-Potter, and Lucy Brook. Photography was created by Rich Stapleton, Finn Beales, Jonathan Gregson, and Kate Holstein, while the layout was designed by Studio Faculty. The book was created over a process of three years.  Palm  Palm is a visual study of Palm Springs, California by Rich Stapleton. It was captured on 35mm black and white film, and focuses on the desert landscapes, mid century modernist architecture, and palm trees of the area as its subject. It was published in September 2017.  A Balloon Away  A Balloon Away is an illustrated children's novel by Rosa Park, which follows a girl called Sona, a silver balloon, and her new friend Grey the bear, as they travel to destinations around the world.

Corley was one of a number of commercial house photographers who worked in Brisbane from the late 1950s onwards, selling photographs of suburban homes to their owners, often in the form of calendars. Corley's business was called the Pan American Home Photographic Co., and comprised a team of employees involved in photography, sales and printing. The company's slogan was 'From Our Home to Your Home. It has been noted that because each product that was offered for sale was effectively 'unique', the business circumvented the need for a hawkers licence. Corley was married to Eunice Reid Corley (1913-1988), who worked closely with him in the enterprise. Corley was known to take the photographs from the driver's seat of his Cadillac, while Eunice followed in a 'darkroom van' where she developed the photographs. It is estimated that Corley took more than half a million photographs of Queensland houses. While produced for commercial purposes, today, Corley's photographs represent an important and unparalleled survey of suburban Brisbane during postwar decades, capturing the city during an important moment of transition and expansion.  Frank and Eunice Corley House Photographs Collection  In 1995 a large collection of Corley's photographs were acquired by the John Oxley Library, at the State Library of Queensland. The library holds more that 60,000 of Corley's black and white photographs of single detached houses. There are also a small number of photographs of suburban shops. The collection comprises unsold photographs, which were retained, largely, for taxation purposes. The collection is one of the most substantial photographic collections of housing and the suburbs in the country. As of August 2018, more that 50,000 of these have been digitised. Since 2014 the Annerley-Stephens History Group has been working to identify the houses in the collection. The project has been co-ordinated by historian Dennis Peel, and more than 200 volunteers have been involved.  'Home: A Suburban Obsession' Exhibition  The work of Frank and Eunice Corley was featured in an exhibition titled 'Home: A Suburban Obsession' at the State Library of Queensland that was on display from December 6, 2018 until July 15, 2019. The exhibition was curated by staff from the State Library and researchers from the ATCH (Architecture Theory Criticism History) Research Centre, at the University of Queensland's School of Architecture. The exhibition showcased around 500 house photographs taken by Corley that have been organised into ten thematic sets. A number of original artworks and installations, inspired by the Corley Collection, were commissioned by the Library. These included work by Ian Strange, Jennifer Marchant, [fFlat] and Seth Ellis. In December 2018 the State Library of Queensland launched an interactive online tool, known as the Corley Explorer, to facilitate public engagement with the collection and crowdsource information about the houses represented in the extant photographs. Within four months of its launch, the public had contributed more than 1000 stories related to the collection to the website. By mid-June 2019, the public had helped to geo-locate nearly forty per cent of the photographs through the Corley Explorer. The Corley Explorer was developed by Mitchell Whitelaw and Geoff Hinchcliffe, from the Data Design Lab at the ANU School of Art and Design. In October 2019 the National Trust Queensland recognised the exhibition with the Gold award for Heritage Interpretation and Promotion, and the John Herbert Award.

It is also known as Metro Light Rail. The property is owned by RailCorp (State Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Leichhardt area was originally inhabited by the Wangal clan of Aborigines. After 1788 diseases such as smallpox and the loss of their hunting grounds caused huge reductions in their numbers and they moved further inland. Since European settlement the foreshores of Blackwattle Bay and Rozelle Bay have developed a unique maritime, industrial and residential character - a character which continues to evolve as areas which were originally residential estates, then industrial areas, are redeveloped for residential units and parklands. The first formal grant in the Glebe area was a grant to Rev. Richard Johnson, the colony's first chaplain, in 1789. The Glebe (land allocated for the maintenance of a church minister) comprised rolling shale hills covering sandstone, with several sandstone cliff faces. The ridges were drained by several creeks including Blackwattle Creek, Orphan School Creek and Johnston Creek. Extensive swampland surrounded the creeks. On the shale ridges, heavily timbered woodlands contained several varieties of eucalypts while the swamplands and tidal mudflats had mangroves, swamp oaks (Casuarina glauca) and black wattles (Callicoma serratifolia) after which the bay is named. Blackwattle Swamp was first mentioned by surveyors in the 1790s and Blackwattle Swamp Bay in 1807. By 1840 it was called Blackwattle Bay. Boat parties collected wattles and reeds for the building of huts, and kangaroos and emus were hunted by the early settlers who called the area the Kangaroo Ground. Rozelle Bay is thought to have been named after a schooner which once moored in its waters. Johnson's land remained largely undeveloped until 1828, when the Church and School Corporation subdivided it into 28 lots, three of which they retained for church use.City Plan Heritage, 2005, quoting Max Solling & Peter Reynolds \\"Leichhardt: On the Margins of the City\\", 1997, 14 The Church sold 27 allotments in 1828 - north on the point and south around Broadway. The Church kept the middle section where the Glebe Estate is now. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Up until the 1970s the Glebe Estate was in the possession of the Church. On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas. The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Smaller working-class houses were built around these industries. Abattoirs were built there from the 1860s. When Glebe was made a municipality in 1859 there were pro and anti-municipal clashes in the streets. From 1850 Glebe was dominated by wealthier interests. Reclaiming the swamp, Wentworth Park opened in 1882 as a cricket ground and lawn bowls club. Rugby union football was played there in the late 19th century. The dog racing started in 1932. In the early 20th century modest villas were broken up into boarding houses as they were elsewhere in the inner city areas. The wealthier moved into the suburbs which were opening up through the railways. Up until the 1950s Sydney was the location for working class employment - it was a port and industrial city. By the 1960s central Sydney was becoming a corporate city with service-based industries - capital intensive not labour intensive. A shift in demographics occurred, with younger professionals and technical and administrative people servicing the corporate city wanting to live close by. Housing was coming under threat and the heritage conservation movement was starting. The Fish Markets moved in in the 1970s. An influx of students came to Glebe in the 1960s and 1970s.  Description  The heritage-listed structure includes a double-lined tunnel, completed in 1922 and cuttings and track formation. Pyrmont railway cuttings and tunnel The railway cutting through Pyrmont is a two-track- wide, straight-sided excavation through the ridge of the peninsula from the commencement of Jones Bay Road, where the line deviated from the wharf sidings (now removed), until it enters a tunnel near John Street opposite Mount Street. This tunnel is bored through the escarpment and is brick-lined. It exits near Jones Street at Saunders Lane and the line continues in a cutting which progressively opens out on the western side before falling ground levels bring the line on to a brick viaduct near the intersection of Jones and Allen Streets. This heritage-listed viaduct continues across Wentworth Park towards Glebe. The railway cutting is through Pyrmont sandstone. Glebe railway tunnel The Glebe railway tunnel runs approximately from Lower Avon Street, Glebe (adjacent to the metro light rail Glebe stop) to Jubilee Park. Tunnel openings at the east and west end are built of brick in an English bond pattern, with the arch formed by bricks laid in soldier course, and featuring a sandstone keystone. The tunnel supports a double track currently used by the metro light rail system. The tunnel is approximately wide and high.  Heritage listing  The brick tunnel and cuttings are a major feature of the landscape and layout of the Pyrmont area. They are important relics of the inner city freight system that operated to the wharves, including Darling Harbour, and connected through to the southern suburbs. The tunnel and its portals are an important brick structure that reflects the industrial nature of the area. The tunnel is a fairly long double-track brick-lined structure opened in 1922. As the line has not been electrified the structure remains virtually intact. Pyrmont and Glebe Railway Tunnels was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare.

The Forgan Smith Bridge crosses from central Mackay over the Pioneer River and through Cremorne to North Mackay. The Pioneer River forms the southern boundary of the locality and Barnes Creek forms the northern boundary. Most of the western part of the locality is parkland (largely undeveloped); there is a small number of industrial buildings around the Forgan Smith Bridge.  History  Remains of the Cremorne Hotel North Mackay following the 1918 cyclone Arriving in 1863, John Greenwood Barnes was the first settler on the northern band of the Pioneer River. He experimented with growing edible tropical plants such as breadfruit, mango, guava, pineapples etc. on behalf of botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, the curator of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens. However his greatest success was with coconut palms which he first planted in 1868 and then expanded to a plantation of 1200 trees. In 1884, Barnes erected a two-storey hotel with a promenade roof. Working with his father-in-law William Seaward, he developed pleasure gardens called Cremorne Gardens thought to be modelled on the Cremorne Gardens in Melbourne (Barnes had lived in Victoria before moving to Queensland). In January 1898 the hotel was damaged by Cyclone Eline and then demolished by the January 1918 cyclone.

Rock outcrop at Betau Ata Geologic History, Stratigraphy and Tectonics Archean rocks of the Zerenda Group, including schist, diamond-bearing gneiss, eclogite and marble are found in the Kokchetav Massif in the Kazakh Uplands. However, geologists have disagreed on dating with some indicating dates in the Middle Cambrian or Archean through Paleoproterozoic. Early Proterozoic rocks are better defined and include phyllite, schist, quartzite, porphyroids, porphyritoids, marble and jaspellite, intruded by 1.8 billion year old granite gneiss and 1.7 billion year old granosyenite. The Paleoproterozoic sequence is 14 kilometers thick. In the Jeltau Mountains, the basement is made up gneiss, schist, marble, amphibolite and eclogite. Migmatized gneiss, amphibolite and quartzite are found in the Mugodzhar area. Precambrian rocks are not found in the Kazakh Altai mountains, although they are present where the range extends into Russia and China. Much of Eastern Europe and Central Asia has Riphean rocks from the Proterozoic. Terrigenous volcanic rocks which may have originated from rifting are located in the South Urals, metamorphosed to greenschist grade, with amphibolites in linear folds. Dolomite limestones with stromatalite fossils and quartzites are found in the Kazakh Uplands. Low-grade metamorphism and granitization took place from 1.2 billion to one billion years ago. All the Precambrian massifs hold Upper Riphean quartzite and quartz sandstone, dated with detritral zircon to 850 million years ago. Riphean and Vendian deposits occupy the western and southwest parts of the Kazakh Uplands. In Ulutau, alkaline granitoids intruded volcanic rocks 650 million years ago. Lower Vendian rocks are up to 1.5 kilometers thick, including gray clastic rocks, acid tuff and alkali basalt flows. Paleozoic Cambrian through Ordovician rocks from the Paleozoic are found in all Kazakhstan's orogenic belts. A thin sequence, 200 to 400 meters thick overlies Vendian rocks in the Kazakh Upland, including coal shale, deepwater chert, limestone, phosphate and barite deposits. The Early Ordovician gives way to 200 meters of shale and chert, followed by flysch up to 3.5 kilometers thick and another thick sequence of andesite, basalt and coarse clastics. Silurian rocks are absent in the uplands. In Chu-Kungey, Tengiz, Zharma-Saur and other districts, island arc volcanic rocks such as tuff, clastics and reef limestone are up to seven kilometers thick. In the North Caspian Depression, only Late Paleozoic rocks outcrop at the surface. Deepwater chert and carbonates are common, with deposits up to 25 kilometers thick. Permian up to five kilometers thick has formed domes, which intrude upward into Mesozoic and Paleogene rocks. Carboniferous deepwater limestone forms a four kilometer flysch in the Cis- Urals Foredeep Basin in the South Urals region, which also includes olistrosomes and a Permian salt-bearing marine molasse. Middle Cambrian rocks in the Kazakh Uplands have an angular unconformity with older rocks because they were thrust onto a magmatic arc in the Devonian to the northwest of the Karaganda Foredeep Basin. Within the foredeep basin, limestone deposition shifted to coal-bearing molasse. Small synclines in the Karaganda Foredeep Basin show deepwater limestone and shale 450 meters thick from the Carboniferous and Permian, as well as 4.5 kilometer thick coal-bearing molasse. Within the Tengiz Basin, deposits are never more than two kilometers thick and grow thicker to the south. The Chu Basin is filled with undeformed Middle Devonian through Permian red molasse and carbonate deposits. Calc- alkaline magmatism was extensive in the southeast Kazakh Uplands and the Tien Shan Mountains. Geologists have recognized these rocks through magnetic anomalies, drillholes and occasional outcrops. The volcanic rocks include tuff, cooled lava and trachyandesite and rhyolite ignimbrite up to five kilometers thick. Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago-present) Intraplate rifting began in the Triassic, forming massive sedimentary basins between Paleozoic uplands. The North Caspian Depression filled with terrigenous rocks and shallow water carbonates at the edge of the Tethys Ocean, similar to the West Siberian Basin which becomes thicker near the center. The Chu, Turgay, Turan and Kizilkum basins contain sand, clay and coal-bearing shallow water terrigenous sediments and salt deposits two kilometers thick from the Middle Jurassic, up to three kilometers thick from the Cretaceous and one kilometer thick from the Cenozoic. The Triassic was a period of erosion in the Kazakh Uplands and the Zaysan, Alakol, Balkhash and Tengiz basins are all small and filled with Late Triassic through Jurassic lacustrine deposits. Cretaceous and Paleogene deposits are largely missing, followed by a 100-meter thick sequence of Neogene and Quaternary gypsum- bearing alluvial fan sediments. Geological Research Geological research in Kazakhstan began in the 18th century due to growing Russian influence along the Ob River, Orenburg to Mugodzar and Petropavlovsk to the Kazakh Steppe. The Russian Academy of Sciences sent some early expeditions, such as Pallas' Asian Expedition in 1771. In the 1800s Russian mining groups explored the Kirgiz Steppe north of the Tien Shan mountains and the construction of the Trans- Siberian Railway prompted further study. The Russian Geological Committee launched regional mapping efforts in 1925, after foreign sources on Central Asian geology disappeared in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. As recently as the early 1990s, geologists in Kazakhstan were split between plate tectonics and a different set of mobilist theories more similar to the old geosynclinal model. Natural resource geology The North Caspian Depression contains oil and natural gas, together with the Chu Basin, where they are associated with salt diapirs, typically in Cretaceous, Paleogene, Jurassic and Triassic sandstone and clay strata. Kazakhstan has rich coal deposits with 300 major deposits and 170.2 billion tons of reserves. Coking coal is primarily extracted from the Karaganda Basin. The Turgay, Balkhash and Maikuben depressions all hold small deposits of Mesozoic coal. The country has about eight billion tons of iron, nickel, cobalt and up to 300 tungsten deposits. Other base metals include aluminum from bauxite in the Turgay Depression and Mugodzhar Mountains, vanadium, titanium-bearing pegmatite or ilmenite-zircon placers, chromium in ophiolites in the South Urals, gold in shale and magmatic arcs, as well as rare earths, lead, zinc, copper and molybdenum.
