The Series victory for the Red Sox was their fifth in five tries, going back to . The Red Sox scored only nine runs in the entire Series, the fewest runs by the winning team in World Series history. Along with the and 1907 World Series (both of which the Cubs also played in), the 1918 World Series is one of only three Fall Classics where neither team hit a home run. The 1918 Series was played under several metaphorical dark clouds. The Series was held early in September because of the World War I \\"Work or Fight\\" order that forced the premature end of the regular season on September 2, and remains the only World Series to be played entirely in September. The Series was marred by players threatening to strike due to low gate receipts. The Chicago home games in the series were played at Comiskey Park, which had a greater seating capacity than Weeghman Park, the prior home of the Federal League Chicago Whales that the Cubs were then using and which would be rechristened Wrigley Field in 1925. The Red Sox had played their home games in the and 1916 World Series in the more expansive Braves Field, but they returned to Fenway Park for the 1918 series. During the seventh-inning stretch of Game 1, the band began playing \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" because the country was involved in World War I. The song would be named the national anthem of the United States in 1931, and during World War II its playing would become a regular pre-game feature of baseball games and other sporting events. The winning pitcher of Game 1 was Babe Ruth, who pitched a shutout. The 1918 championship would be the last Red Sox win until . The drought of 86 years was often attributed to the Curse of the Bambino. The alleged curse came to be when Red Sox owner Harry Frazee traded the superbly talented but troublesome Babe Ruth (who was instrumental in their 1918 victory) to the New York Yankees for cash after the 1919 season. The Cubs would not win their next World Series until 2016. The Cubs, who last won in , won the National League but lost the Series in 1918, , , , , and , allegedly stymied by the infamous Curse of the Billy Goat imposed during that latter Series. The Red Sox, who had won the American League but lost the Series in , , , and , finally won the World Series in and then won again in , 2013 and 2018. When the Red Sox won in 2018 (against the Los Angeles Dodgers), they became the first team to win the Fall Classic exactly one century apart. After Game 6, it would be some 87 years until the Cubs and Red Sox would play again. A three-game interleague match-up at Wrigley Field began June 10, 2005, and was Boston's first visit to the park. The Cubs would not return to Fenway Park for nearly 94 years until a three-game interleague match-up beginning May 20, 2011. To date, Red Sox manager Ed Barrow is the only manager to win a World Series without previously playing in organized baseball, whether in the minors or majors. Summary Matchups Game 1 Game 1 went to the Red Sox, 1‚Äì0, with Babe Ruth pitching the shutout before 19,274 fans. Stuffy McInnis knocked in the game's only run, driving in Dave Shean with a fourth-inning single off Hippo Vaughn. During the seventh-inning stretch, the U.S. Navy band began to play the Star- Spangled Banner, Red Sox infielder Fred Thomas‚Äîwho was in the Navy and had been granted furlough to play in the World Series‚Äîimmediately turned toward the American flag and gave it a military salute, according to the Chicago Tribune.http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/ct-wrigley-field- national-anthem-20170703-story.html Other players turned to the flag with hands over hearts, and the already-standing crowd began to sing. At the song's conclusion, the previously quiet fans erupted in thunderous applause. At the time, the New York Times reported that it \\"marked the highest point of the day's enthusiasm.\\" https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/09/06/97025138.pdf The song would be played at each of the Series' remaining games, to increasingly rapturous response. Other baseball parks began to play the song on holidays and special occasions, and Red Sox owner Harry Frazee made it a regular part of Boston home games. The Star-Spangled Banner officially became the U.S. national anthem in 1931, and by the end of World War II, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden ordered that it be played at every football game. The tradition quickly spread to other sports, aided by the introduction of large sound systems and post-war patriotism.http://www.history.com/news/why-the-star- spangled-banner-is-played-at-sporting-events Game 2 The Cubs rebounded to tie the Series with a 3‚Äì1 victory in Game 2 the next day, behind Lefty Tyler's six-hit pitching. Tyler himself hit a two-run single in the second inning to make it 3‚Äì0 and carried a shutout into the ninth inning, when the Red Sox scored their only run. Game 3 The series remained in Chicago for Game 3 due to wartime restrictions on travel. The Red Sox won 2‚Äì1 to take a 2‚Äì1 series lead as Carl Mays scattered seven hits. Wally Schang and Everett Scott's back-to-back RBI singles in the fourth inning were all Boston needed for the win. Vaughn lost his second game of the Series, which ended when Cub baserunner Charlie Pick was caught in a rundown between third and home while trying to score on a passed ball. Game 4 Babe Ruth in 1918 Sunday the 8th was a travel day. The teams didn't arrive in Boston until the next day, shortly before the start of Game 4 that same day. The Cubs tied it in the eighth, ending Ruth's World Series scoreless inning streakGoing back to at 29‚Öî, which stood until Whitey Ford surpassed it in 1962 on hits by Charlie Hollocher and Les Mann; but the Red Sox won it in the home half of the inning on a passed ball by Killefer and a wild throw by relief pitcher Phil Douglas, scoring Schang for a 3‚Äì2 victory and a 3‚Äì1 series lead. Starting pitcher Babe Ruth batted sixth for the Red Sox in Game 4. He remains the only starting pitcher in World Series history to bat other than ninth in the batting order. Game 5 Vaughn finally earned a Series victory in Game 5 with a five-hit shutout, as the Cubs rallied back for a 3‚Äì0 victory. Dode Paskert's two-run double in the top of the eighth sealed the deal for the Chicagoans after Mann had knocked in the first run in the top of the third. Game 6 Attendance for Game 6 at Fenway on Wednesday, September 11, was down from over 24,000 on Tuesday to a mere 15,238, but the Red Sox went home happy. Max Flack's third- inning error allowed two Sox runs to score, which were all they needed for a 2‚Äì1 victory and the World's Championship of 1918 behind Carl Mays' second win of the Series, a complete game three-hitter. This was the last Red Sox World Series win for 86 years, and the last time they won the deciding game at home until 2013. The Red Sox won the series despite a team batting average of .186, lowest for a winning club in World Series history.

Composite box 1918 World Series (4‚Äì2): Boston Red Sox (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.) Allegations of a Series fix and game tampering As with the 1917 World Series, there were concerns about whether the 1918 World Series was being played honestly, a rumor revived in 2005 and explored further in the 2009 book The Original Curse by Sean Deveney (McGraw-Hill). Some of the Cubs were later suspected of being \\"crooked\\". Pitcher Phil Douglas, accused of conspiring to fix a regular- season game in 1922, was suspended for life. Pitcher Claude Hendrix, who didn't play much in the 1918 Series, was suspected of fixing a game in 1920 but retired after that season and was never officially suspended. There was no solid evidence that the 1918 World Series itself was \\"fixed\\", and with the war dominating the news nothing came of the rumors. It was another season before baseball's relationship with gambling erupted in a major scandal. Star pitcher \\"Ol' Pete\\" Alexander of the Cubs saw almost no action in the 1918 regular season due to military service and none in the Series. This left the Cubs pitching corps thin compared to the strong Red Sox staff, which included Babe Ruth and Carl Mays. Hippo Vaughn was the strongest Cubs pitcher, having won the pitching triple crown in 1918, but had the misfortune of starting against the best arms the Red Sox had and taking two of the four Cub losses. In 2011, a document discovered by the Chicago History Museum cited the court testimony of Chisox pitcher Eddie Cicotte during the investigation of the 1919 Black Sox Scandal a year after the 1918 World Series. According to the trial transcript, Cicotte made vague references and allegations that the Cubs had purposely lost the 1918 World Series to the Red Sox, and justified their \\"fixing\\" the games they had lost (all four by one run) by alleging that the owners of both teams had short-changed their players with insufficient shares of the gate receipts.

It was founded in 1949 in Chicago. It took over the National Debate Tournament from the United States Military Academy in 1966 and runs the American Forensic Association National Individual Events Tournament. It is a national organization designed to promote excellence in public speaking, individual events, and debate. History In December 1949, the Association of Directors of Speech Activities, a group of instructors attending the annual meeting of the Speech Association of America, met in Chicago. These people became the Founders of the American Forensic Association. Their purpose was to have an organization to promote the interests of Directors of forensics programs and to encourage the development of forensics participation. Perhaps the best illustration of the early efforts was the annual meeting of 1950. The North Central Accrediting Association had proposed that extra-curricular speech activities be eliminated from high schools. The association successfully countered this effort. Another characteristic of forensic educators was illustrated in 1953. Selected for debate during that year was the topic: \\"Resolved: that the United States should recognize Communist China.\\" Directors of forensic programs were summoned to testify before Congressional Committees and students at the service academies were prohibited from debating the topic, but debate went on. In 1964, the Association founded The Journal of the American Forensic Association, renamed Argumentation and Advocacy: The Journal of the American Forensic Association in 1988. This journal marked an increasing emphasis on the encouragement of research by the Association. Many outstanding scholars have been editors of this journal. In 1966, the National Debate Tournament was established. The Tournament continued the tradition of an end of the year championship tournament begun by the United States Military Academy in 1947. In 1977, the NDT was joined by the National Individual Events Tournament. In 1979, the Association joined the Speech Communication Association in establishing the Summer Conference on Argumentation. The Conference has been an important element in encouraging the development of research in argumentation and advocacy. Today, the Association conducts many activities in support of forensics directors and their students.

SIEV stands for Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel and is the acronym used by the surveillance authority for any boat that has entered Australian waters without prior authorisation. The X is a designation used where a tracking number has not yet been assigned, in accordance with Australian Government orders. The dilapidated Indonesian fishing boat was en route from Sumatra to Christmas Island carrying over 400 asylum seekers. It sank just south of the Indonesian island of Java, killing 353 people mainly women and children. The tragedy was politically controversial in Australia, as it occurred during an election campaign at a time when asylum seekers and border protection were major issues. Background The SIEV-X incident occurred during the 2001 Australian Federal election campaign. The Tampa affair had focused national media's attention on the issue of asylum seekers. Prime Minister John Howard said his policy would prevent people smuggling and stop the boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Australia. The Howard Government had issued instructions to the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to prevent any refugees from reaching Australia via boat. The AFP set about a campaign of disrupting organised people smugglers who operated with overcrowded and dangerous boats. The Royal Australian Navy began intercepting boats that entered Australian waters and transferring all people to Christmas Island. Sinking On 18 October 2001, a small, unnamed 19.5 metre by 4 metre Indonesian fishing boat departed Bandar Lampung, Indonesia, with 421 passengers on board. On the 19th, the boat sank during a storm in Indonesian waters about 70 km south of Java. The area was legally in international waters but within both Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and Indonesia's internationally designated zone of search and rescue responsibility. It also fell inside a temporary Australian border protection surveillance area around the Australian external territory of Christmas Island (which is some 1700 km from mainland Australia). This latter designation was an internal planning and operational tool used by the Australian authorities to deter people smuggling. It had no legal validity and conferred no responsibility in international law. Approximately 146 children, 142 women and 65 men died. On 20 October, 44 survivors were rescued by an Indonesian fishing boat, the Indah Jaya Makmur. A 45th survivor was rescued about twelve hours later by another boat, the Surya Terang.Hutton, Marg (14 June 2005) \\"The 45th Survivor\\" sievx.com. Retrieved 6 June 2013 The International Organization for Migration stated that it had expected such an event to occur due to \\"the way the people smugglers pack these boats\\". Senate Select Committee On 20 February 2002, the Australian Senate Select Committee inquiring into 'A Certain Maritime Incident' met for the first time. Its primary task was to investigate the children overboard affair, however its terms of reference also included investigating \\"operational procedures observed by the Royal Australian Navy and by relevant Commonwealth agencies to ensure the safety of asylum seekers on vessels entering or attempting to enter Australian waters\\". The committee investigated the SIEV-X sinking, and concluded that \\"... it [is] extraordinary that a major human disaster could occur in the vicinity of a theatre of intensive Australian operations and remain undetected until three days after the event, without any concern being raised within intelligence and decision making circles.\\" While no government department was found to be to blame for the tragedy, the committee was surprised that there had been no internal investigations into any systemic problems which could have allowed the Australian government to prevent it from occurring.\\" SIEV X Memorial Part of the SIEV X Memorial Detail from one of the 353 memorial poles, by Tamkin Noorzad, Ebru Agim, Ashley Banach and Amie Lozenkovski of Keira High School, Wollongong Since 2003, Steve Biddulph worked with the Uniting Church in Australia to build a suitable memorial for victims and survivors of the SIEV X sinking. On Sunday, 15 September 2006, a 'temporary' memorial was erected at Weston Park in Canberra. The memorial, designed by Mitchell Donaldson of Queensland's Hillbrook Anglican School, consisted of 353 white poles, all decorated by schools, churches and community groups across Australia. While the ACT Government was supportive of the memorial, with Chief Minister Jon Stanhope opening the memorial, the then Howard Government tried to stop the memorial being constructed. The National Capital Authority claimed that it was not an approved structure. The permanent memorial, involving over a thousand student and community artists, was dedicated in October 2007.

He was honoured with Padma Bhushan in 1966 and the Padma Vibhushan (posthumously) in 1972. He is internationally regarded as the Father of the Indian Space Program. Personal life 263x263px Son of Ambalal Sarabhai, he came from the famous Sarabhai family of India who were major industrialists committed to the Indian independence movement. Vikram Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini in 1942. The couple had two children. His daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist, and his son Kartikeya too became an active person in science. During his lifetime, he practiced Jainism. He attended Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the University of Cambridge, England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge to pursue a doctorate and wrote a thesis, ‚ÄúCosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes,‚Äù in 1947. Professional life 257x257px Known as the cradle of space sciences in India, the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) was founded in 1947 by Vikram Sarabhai. PRL had a modest beginning at his residence, the \\"RETREAT\\", with research on cosmic rays. The institute was formally established at the M.G. Science Institute, Ahmedabad, on 11 November 1947 with support from the Karmkshetra Educational Foundation and the Ahmedabad Education Society. Prof. Kalpathi Ramakrishna Ramanathan was the first Director of the institute. The initial focus was research on cosmic rays and the properties of the upper atmosphere. Research areas were expanded to include theoretical physics and radio physics later with grants from the Atomic Energy Commission. He led the Sarabhai family-owned business conglomerate. His interests varied from science to sports to statistics. He set up the Operations Research Group (ORG), the first market research organization in the country. Most notable among the many institutes he helped set up are the Nehru Foundation for Development in Ahmedabad, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA), the Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association (ATIRA) and the (CEPT). Along with his wife Mrinalini Sarabhai, he founded the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts. Other projects and institutions initiated or established by him include the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) in Kalpakkam, Variable Energy Cyclotron Project in Calcutta, Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) in Hyderabad and Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) in Jaduguda, Jharkhand. Sarabhai started a project for the fabrication and launch of an Indian satellite. As a result, the first Indian satellite, Aryabhata, was put in orbit in 1975 from a Russian cosmodrome. He was the founder of Indian Space Research Organisation.

King County, 138 P.3d 963 (Wash. 2006), formerly Andersen v. Sims, is a Washington Supreme Court case in which eight lesbian and gay couples sued King County and the state of Washington for denying them marriage licenses under the state's 1998 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. The court ruled that banning same-sex marriage is constitutional since the legislature could reasonably believe it furthers the government interest in promoting procreation. The state enacted same-sex marriage in 2012. Opponents forced a referendum on the issue, and voters approved the legislation on November 6. Lower court decisions In the case, King County Superior Court Judge William L. Downing ruled that the state law prohibiting same-sex marriages, or DOMA, was unconstitutional, finding for the plaintiffs on August 4, 2004. The judge ruled that restricting the institution of marriage to opposite sex couples \\"is not rationally related to any legitimate or compelling state interest.\\" The ruling was appealed to the state Supreme Court. Appeal In 2005, the Andersen v. Sims case was consolidated with Castle v. State, another case that was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court from a lower court in Thurston County. The combined cases were filed under Andersen v. King County and Washington Supreme Court heard oral argument on March 8, 2005. On July 26, 2006, the court's ruled in a 5-4 decision that the state Defense of Marriage Act was constitutional. The majority ruled that the state DOMA does not violate the state's constitution. Decision In the plurality opinion signed by Justices Gerry L. Alexander and Charles W. Johnson, Justice Barbara Madsen wrote that \\"Under this standard, DOMA is constitutional because the legislature was entitled to believe that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples furthers procreation, essential to the survival of the human race, and furthers the well-being of children by encouraging families where children are reared in homes headed by the children's biological parents.\\" Justice Gerry L. Alexander issued a separate concurring opinion, emphasizing the possibility that the legislature or people could expand the definition of marriage in the state. Justice James M. Johnson also issued a separate opinion, co-signed by Justice Richard B. Sanders, which concurred in the judgment only and suggested that the lower court rulings that held DOMA unconstitutional were result-oriented and disregarded the law. The reasoning in Madsen's plurality opinion is similar to that of New York's highest court in Hernandez v. Robles, which was decided on July 6, 2006. The four justices that dissented accused the majority of relying upon \\"circular reasoning\\" in formulating their opinion. In the principal dissenting opinion, signed by Justices Tom Chambers, Susan Owens, and Bobbe J. Bridge, Justice Mary Fairhurst asked: \\"Would giving same-sex couples the same right that opposite-sex couples enjoy injure the state's interest in procreation and healthy child rearing?\\" Justice Tom Chambers issued a separate dissenting opinion signed by Justice Susan Owens, while Justice Bobbe J. Bridge issued another dissenting opinion. Aftermath Same-sex marriage supporters disagreed with the procreation argument and proposed Initiative 957 to challenge the court's assertion. It would have required that all marriages recognized by the state to produce offspring within three years of their solemnization. The initiative was created by the Washington Defense of Marriage Alliance, an LGBT rights group. The Washington Defense of Marriage Alliance hoped to use this to create a test case in order to have a court strike down the measure and highlight what they perceived as the weakness of the Andersen decision's logic. The initiative was filed on January 10, 2007, and withdrawn on July 3, 2007, after sponsors collected about 40,000 signatures, which was too few to qualify the measure for the November ballot. A bill to legalize same-sex marriage passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Christine Gregoire on February 13, 2012, but opponents gathered enough signatures to force a voter referendum on the legislation. Voters approved the proposed legislation in November 2012, making same-sex marriage legal as of December 6 of that year.

FREng F.R.S. (21 December 1904 at Ramsden Hall, Billericay, Essex, England ‚Äì 24 May 1992) was an English engineer who developed the first practical hydrogen‚Äìoxygen fuel cell.  Life and works  In 1932, Francis Thomas Bacon developed the fuel cell which was used as part of the Apollo moon project in the 1960s. Fuel cells were first demonstrated by Sir William Robert Grove in 1839, but his invention laid largely dormant for over 100 years until it was revived by Bacon. The alkaline fuel cell (AFC), also known as the Bacon fuel cell after its inventor, has been used in NASA space programs since the mid-1960s to generate power for satellites and space capsules. American President Richard Nixon welcomed Bacon to the White House, and told him; \\"Without you Tom, we wouldn't have gotten to the moon.‚Äù After the successful lunar landing of Apollo 11 in July 1969, Tom and his wife Barbara met astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins at a reception at 10 Downing Street. Bacon was a descendant of the family of the philosopher Sir Francis Bacon (who had no children), and he was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After Cambridge he became an apprentice with the Newcastle engineering firm owned by Sir Charles Parsons, and was strongly influenced by him. The principle of the fuel cell had been demonstrated by Sir William Grove in 1839 and other investigators had experimented with various forms of fuel cell. However unlike previous workers in the field, Bacon was an engineer and he was comfortable working with machinery operating at high temperatures and pressures. He initially experimented with Grove's use of activated platinum gauze with a sulphuric acid electrolyte, but quickly moved on to use activated nickel electrodes with an aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte. In January 1940, he moved to a laboratory at King's College London and there developed a double cell, with one unit for generating the hydrogen and oxygen gases and the other for the fuel cell proper. This could be reversed so that it acted as both an electrolyser and a fuel cell. Problems were encountered due to the high operating temperatures and pressures and the corrosive nature of the chemicals. In 1946, under new funding arrangements, the work moved to the Department of Colloid Science at Cambridge University. There Bacon's team were shown a sample of porous nickel sheet whose origins were so obscure they were protected by the Official Secrets Act. They used this sheet to develop electrodes with large pores on the gas side and finer ones on the electrolyte side, which created a much more stable interface than had existed previously. As funding levels increased the apparatus was moved again to what was then the Department of Chemical Engineering. There the team overcame problems of corrosion of the oxygen electrode by soaking the new nickel electrodes in lithium hydroxide solution followed by drying and heating. In 1959, with support from Marshall of Cambridge Ltd. (later Marshall Aerospace) a 5 kW forty-cell battery, with an operating efficiency of 60%, was demonstrated publicly. The patents for the fuel cell were licensed by Pratt and Whitney as part of a successful bid to provide electrical power for Project Apollo. The fuel cells were ideal in this regard because they have rising efficiency with decreasing load, unlike heat engines. Hydrogen and oxygen gases were already on board the ship for propulsion and life support, and the by-product water could be used for drinking and humidifying the atmosphere of the capsule. Towards the later part of his life, Bacon was a consultant for the engineering firm Energy Conversion Limited and Johnson Matthey. He was a Founder Fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering and the first Honorary Member of the European Fuel Cell Group.

Those ingredients are: milk, whey, milk protein concentrate, milkfat, sodium citrate, contains less than 2% of calcium phosphate, whey protein concentrate, salt, lactic acid, sorbic acid as a preservative, cheese culture, annatto and paprika extract (color), enzymes, vitamin d3. Contains: milk. In the US, Kraft Singles is manufactured in regular, 2% Milk, and Fat Free. In Australia, a short-lived product called Vegemite Singles combined Kraft Singles and Vegemite. Kraft singles do not qualify for the US FDA Pasteurized Processed Cheese labeling. For this reason Kraft labels them Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product to avoid FDA sanctions. They were calling Kraft Singles Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Food until the FDA gave them a warning in December 2002 that the product could not be legally labeled as \\"Pasteurized Processed Cheese Food\\" due to the inclusion of milk protein concentrates. Kraft complied with the FDA order by changing the label to the current Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product. One of the more famous ad campaigns involved the claim that each ¬æ ounce slice contained \\"five ounces of milk\\", which makes them taste better than imitation cheese slices made mostly with vegetable oil and water and hardly any milk. The campaign was lambasted for its implications that each slice contained the same amount of calcium as a five-ounce glass of milk and also more calcium than imitation cheese slices, which eventually led to a ruling by the Federal Trade Commission in 1992 that ordered Kraft to stop making false claims in its advertising. In Australia, the Kraft branding was retired in 2017. Kraft's successor company in Australia, Mondelez, sold their cheese products line to Bega Cheese, but retained rights to the Kraft name. Bega switched the name of their sliced cheese product from \\"Kraft Singles\\" to \\"Dairylea Slices\\", as Bega acquired the rights to the Dairylea brand in Australia in the deal. The \\"Kraft Singles\\" name could return in the future, as Kraft Heinz will assume the trademark from Mondelez at the beginning of 2018.

Career He was born in Friedberg, Hesse, Germany, the son of Edward Oppenheimer, a cigar merchant. Oppenheimer began his working life at 17, when he entered Dunkelsbuhler & Company, a diamond brokerage in London. His efforts impressed his employer and in 1902, at the age of 22, he was sent to South Africa to represent the company as a buyer in Kimberley, where he eventually rose to the position of mayor from 1912 to 1915. In this role, he helped raise the manpower for the Kimberley Regiment for service during World War One. He became great friends with William Lincoln Honnold, an American engineer and chairman of Transvaal Coal Trust, Brakpan Mines, Springs Mines and The New Era Company.William L.

P. Morgan. The initial capital was ¬£1 million. Half of the capital was subscribed in America and half in England and South Africa.H. F. Oppenheimer, R. B. Hagart, W. D. Wilson, Francis Whitmore, H. MacConachie, Dr. J. E. Holloway, Optima, September 1967 Volume seventeen number three, Commemorates the Fiftieth Anniversary of Anglo American Corporation September 25th 1967, p.97. He would remain as a permanent director and its chairman until 1953. In 1919, two years after its launch, Anglo American purchased diamond mines in South West Africa which would pose a challenge to the De Beers diamond business monopoly. He took part in the 1924 South African general election and was elected to the House of Assembly as the Member for Kimberley. He held the seat until 1938. In 1927, Ernest Oppenheimer managed to wrest control of Cecil Rhodes's De Beers empire and built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the world's diamond industry until his retirement. He gained the chairmanship of De Beers in 1929. He was involved in a number of controversies, including price fixing, antitrust behaviour and an allegation of not releasing industrial diamonds for the US war effort during World War II. Marriages He married Mary Lena Pollak in 1906 and had two sons. She died in 1934. In 1935, he married Caroline Magdalen Oppenheimer (nee Harvey) widow of Michael Oppenheimer. Death He died in Johannesburg in 1957. He was born into a Jewish family, but, as an adult, he converted to Anglicanism and was buried at St George's Church, Parktown. He was succeeded in the business by his son, Harry Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's brother, Sir Bernard Oppenheimer, was also heavily involved in the diamond industry. Legacy In 1964, the Oppenheimer Diamond was named in his honour by its owner, Harry Winston, who donated the stone (not a gem, as it remains uncut and unpolished) to the Smithsonian Institution as a memorial.

Led by retired High Court Judge M. S. Liberhan, it was formed on 16 December 1992 by an order of the Indian Home Union Ministry after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on 6 December and the subsequent riots there. The Commission was originally mandated to submit its report within three months. Extensions were given 48 times, and after a delay of 17 years, the one-man commission submitted the report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 30 June 2009. In November 2009, a day after a newspaper published the allegedly leaked contents of the report, the report was tabled in Parliament by the Home Minister P. Chidambaram.

Babur's commander-in-chief, Mir Baqi, allegedly destroyed an existing temple at the site which commemorated the birthplace of Rama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and ruler of Ayodhya. The Babri Mosque was one of the largest mosques in Uttar Pradesh, a state in India with some 31 million Muslims.Indian Census Although there were several older mosques in the city of Ayodhya, an area with a substantial Muslim population, including the Hazrat Bal Mosque constructed by the Shariqi kings, the Babri Mosque became the largest, because of the importance of the disputed site. The political, historical and socio-religious debate over the history and location of the Babri Mosque and whether a previous temple was demolished or modified to create it, is known as the Ayodhya Debate. Terms and reference of the commission To make an inquiry with respect to the following matters: # The sequence of events leading to, and all the facts and circumstances relating to, the occurrences in the Ram Janma Bhoomi-Babri Masjid complex at Ayodhya on 6 December 1992 involving the destruction of the Ram Janma Bhoomi-Babri Masjid structure; # The role played by the Chief Minister, Members of the Council of Ministers, officials of the Government of Uttar Pradesh and by the individuals, concerned organisations and agencies in, or in connection with, the destruction of the Ram Janma Bhoomi-Babri Masjid structure; # The deficiencies in security measures and other arrangements as prescribed or operated in practice by Government of Uttar Pradesh which might have contributed to the events that took place in the Ram Janma Bhoomi-Babri Masjid complex, Ayodhya town and Faizabad on 6 December 1992; # The sequence of events leading to, and all the facts and circumstances relating to, the assault on media persons at Ayodhya on 6 December 1992; and # Any other matters related to the subject of Inquiry. Duration and expenses The one-man panel, one of the country's longest running inquiry commissions, cost the government , and wrote the report on the sequence of events leading to the destruction of the Babri mosque by Hindu mobs on 6 December 1992 and the other issues mentioned in the terms of reference. Appointed by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao two weeks after the demolition on 6 December 1992, to ward off criticism against his government for having failed to protect the mosque, the commission in August 2005 finished hearing its last witness Kalyan Singh ‚Äì who was Uttar Pradesh chief minister at the time of the demolition and resigned soon after. In 16 years of its proceedings, the commission recorded statements of several politicians, bureaucrats and police officials including Kalyan Singh, late Narasimha Rao, former deputy prime minister L.K. Advani and his colleagues Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharati as well as Mulayam Singh Yadav. Top bureaucrats and police officials of Uttar Pradesh, the then district magistrate R.N. Srivastava and Senior Superintendent of Police D.B. Roy of Ayodhya also recorded their statements on the demolition. In all, the Commission examined one hundred witnesses including #Mark Tully, BBC Journalist #PR Kumaramangalam, Union Minister #SB Chavan, Union Home Minister #Uma Bharti, BJP leader #KS Sudarshan, RSS leader #Jyoti Basu, CPI(M) leader, member of the National Integration Council #Murli Manohar Joshi, President, Bharatiya Janta Party, member of the Rajya Sabha #LK Advani, Leader, Bharatiya Janta Party #Vinay Katyar, Member of Parliament, Bharatiya Janta Party #Vishnu Hari Dalmia, President, Vishwa Hindu Parishad #VP Singh, Former Prime Minister, leader of Janta Dal #Kalyan Singh, the then Chief Minister, Uttar Pradesh #P.

Advani, Joshi, Bharti and Kalyan Singh, who was the BJP Chief Minister at the time of demolition, appeared before the Commission as witnesses. Kalyan Singh appeared only after the Delhi High Court lifted a stay order on his deposition. Other former officials against whom criminal cases are pending in the demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya include Bajrang Dal's Vinay Katiyar. Even before the findings of the Commission were out, Congress and BJP leaders clashed over the issue. The contents of the report On 23 November 2009, the media began reporting on the contents of the report, which had been leaked before being made available to the legislature. It indicted top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders as being actively involved in the meticulous planning of the demolition of the mosque. It was a day of angry exchanges in parliament, and cries of \\"Shame, shame!\\" in the Lok Sabha as the opposition accused the Home Ministry of deliberately leaking the report. The Parliament session had to be adjourned for the day. Parliament delayed discussion of the report and the accompanying Action Taken Report (ATR), which contained mostly recommendations, until 22 December 2009. The report was finally discussed and debated in the Parliament after a delay caused by demands from some members of the Parliament for the Hindi translated version of the report. The Lok Sabha debated the report on 8 November 2009 and the Rajya Sabha followed on 10 and 11 November. The report holds 68 people culpable, including L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and more critically, Kalyan Singh, the then-Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. The report accused the RSS of being the chief architect of the demolition and names it as the core of the Sangh Parivar. The Commission has identified the Kalyan Singh-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh as the key to the execution of the conspiracy to demolish Babri Masjid. Justice M S Liberhan termed Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi as pseudo-moderates, pretending to keep a distance from the Ram Janmabhoomi campaign when they were actually aware of the whole conspiracy. The report said, \\"They have violated the trust of the people.... There can be no greater betrayal or crime in a democracy and this Commission has no hesitation in condemning these pseudo-moderates for their sins of omission\\". Findings Kalyan Singh, who was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the mosque's demolition, was harshly criticized in the report. He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the mosque's demolition in Ayodhya. Indicting the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, the one-man commission said in its report: \\"Kalyan Singh's government was the essential component needed by the Sangh Parivar for its purposes. Kalyan Singh lived up to the expectations of the Parivar\\". The commission's report said that Singh and his Cabinet allowed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to directly run his government. It also stated that the government had \\"systematically and in a pre-planned manner removed inconvenient bureaucrats from positions of power, dismantled and diluted the security apparatus and infrastructure, lied consistently to the high court and the Supreme Court of India and to the people of India to evade constitutional governance and thus betrayed the confidence of the electorate\\". The Liberhan Commission stated about the demolition: :\\"The preparation was accomplished with phenomenal secrecy, was technically flawless with consistency and assured results.... The theme was power. It attracted clusters of young men to support the hidden agenda. Leaders know how passions are aroused and how to prevent the same; they however always see what would be beneficial to them rather than what would be good for the nation. This is what happened in Ayodhya.\\" To the commission's observation that the demolition was planned, Chapter 1: page no 15, para 7.4 of the report wherein it admits: \\"No evidence, lead or information was provided to the commission with respect to the conspiracy or pre-planning or the joint common enterprise by any of these counsels... (of the Muslim organisations)\\". Moreover, the commission noted (at page 782, para 130.24) that, \\"...Home Secretary Godbole stated that there was no information of planning and as such it could not be inferred that there was a conspiracy of the Congress and BJP for demolition.\\" \\"The chief minister and his cabinet were the proverbial insiders who caused the collapse of the entire system.\\" Singh allegedly maintained a \\"studied silence\\" even at the height of the crisis in December 1992 and \\"refused to allow even a single measure which might impede the Ayodhya campaign or prevent the assault on the disputed structures, the journalists or the innocent people.\\" He allegedly did not direct the police \\"to use force or resort to firing to chase away the miscreants or to save the lives of those wretched innocents...\\" even though he was alerted that the mosque had been demolished and rioters were attacking Muslims in Ayodhya. \\"The wanton violence against human life and property continued unabated and even at that late stage, the chief minister did not use the central forces which could have been swiftly deployed\\", the report further states. Uma Bharti, Govindacharya, Kalyan Singh and Shanker Singh Vaghela, all of whom were members of the BJP then, are held primarily responsible for the destruction of the mosque and the report says that they could have prevented the assault. Senior BJP leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi are called \\"pseudo-moderates\\". The report holds them intellectually and ideologically responsible for the mosque's destruction. The report says that they gave false assurances to court, people and the nation. Vajpayee, Prime Minister in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, was not present on 6 December 1992 when the mosque was brought down, but the report says it cannot be assumed that Vajpayee, Advani and others did not know of the designs of the Sangh Parivar. The Report, headed by Justice Liberhan, contained no criticism of the 1992 Indian government and then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao. and supports Rao's stand that legally and constitutionally, the central government could not impose President's Rule in the state of Uttar Pradesh in December 1992. The report submitted by Justice Liberhan has come under severe criticism for being biased and rhetorical in nature. It has been pointed out that, the report also noted (in para 18.3 on page 63) that \\"although, there was no order restraining the Muslims from going to the disputed structure or from offering namaz therein either by the judiciary or from the administration, yet namaz was not offered at the disputed structure since 1934. No processions were taken out inside the disputed structure nor any grave dug there about.\\" Justice Liberhan has agreed that \\"Ayodhya is accepted in popular Hindu tradition as the birthplace of Lord Rama and is therefore regarded as a holy and historical city\\" and \\"ancient Ayodhya was traditionally the epitome of Hindu life, culture and a paradigm of coexistence of a multi-religious society. It was a peaceful place with a regular influx of visitors, pilgrims, sadhus and sants, monks, travellers, tourists.\\" BJP president Rajnath Singh will open the debate on the Liberhan Commission report in the Lok Sabha while Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley is expected to lead the party charge in the Rajya Sabha. The Lok Sabha debated the report on 1 December 2009 and the Rajya Sabha on 7 December 2009. The BJP had initially decided to field Sushma Swaraj as the lead speaker in the Lower House, but she will now be the second speaker on the issue. The performance of its star speakers in both Houses will be keenly watched by the RSS, say party sources. While the initial plan would have seen the quartet of Delhi BJP leaders ‚Äî Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, in addition to Venkaiah Naidu, and Ananth Kumar ‚Äî holding forth on the Ayodhya debate, sources say that Rajnath, whose term as party president technically ends on 26 November 2009, \\"didn't want to be left out of the debate\\". Speaking in the Parliament, Jaitley led the charge against the report and against Justice Liberhan personally. Jaitley suggested that Justice Liberhan may not have actually authored the report and, reiterating what Sushma Swaraj had read out in the Lok Sabha, citing from page 999 of the report, commented that Justice Liberhan had credited Commission's Counsel Harpreet Singh Giani with helping with the analysis, conclusions, editing and language and therefore called it the \\"Liberhan-Giani\\" report. He charged the report with \\"factual hallucinations\\". He cited the incorrect date of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination as well as the inclusion of the names of some historians in the report as evidence. BJP opinion BJP claimed \\"selective leaks\\" of the Liberhan Commission report to the media were planned and motivated, saying they had come at a time when the whole opposition was united against the government. Claiming that the UPA government did not intend to table the full report as it indicts the then Congress government of P V Narasimha Rao, Deputy Leader of BJP in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said the Home Ministry leaked the report to divert attention from the issues being raised by a united opposition. Recently the BJP has been raising the issue of rising prices of essential commodities. \\"This is a planned leak. It is a motivated leak. The first motivation for leaking the report is the unity in opposition on the sugarcane price issue which the government wanted to break. This unity would have continued on price rise and other issues,\\" Swaraj said. The senior BJP leader further alleged that the government wanted to divert attention from the opposition from its plan of raising Madhu Koda and 2G Spectrum allocation scams in Parliament. BJP President Rajnath Singh accused the government of \\"selectively leaking\\" the Liberhan Commission report on Babri Masjid demolition to the media with the aim of \\"polarising\\" voters ahead of the assembly elections in Jharkhand. \\"The selective leakage was intentional. A report of any commission is traditionally placed on the first day of the Parliament session. The government could have placed it in the House in July as the Liberhan Commission report was given to the government on 30 June,\\" he told reporters. The \\"other\\" opinion The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also stated that millions of Hindus in the country want the Ram temple. Addressing media-persons at the party headquarters in New Delhi, BJP spokesperson Ravishankar Prasad said, \\"We want a Ram temple. There should be a constructive solution.\\" Prasad also claimed that BJP leaders had tried to save the structure and that the party has evidence of that. Earlier, reacting to the report, former BJP leader Uma Bharti, who was in Ayodhya on the day of the demolition, said that the party should come clean over the issue. \\"Babri report should be published and BJP should come clean over it. I am not apologetic at all, I am willing to be hanged for my role. I want Ram Temple, but I didn't want the mosque to be destroyed that way\\". She also said that it was difficult to pinpoint people responsible for mosque demolition. The BJP termed the Justice M S Liberhan Commission as politically motivated and charged the Congress with providing the \\"cushion\\" for demolition of the controversial structure at Ayodhya. Continuing the tirade against Justice Liberhan Commission and the ATR tabled in Parliament recently, state BJP President and a member of parliament Radha Mohan Singh alleged that the findings of the Commission were \\"perverse and ill-founded\\". In fact, the Congress should be blamed for the demolition as the Congress-led government had opened the locks of the Ram Mandir, organised the shilanayas of the temple at the controversial site thereby providing a \\"cushion to Ram sevaks\\" to demolish the controversial structure, Singh claimed. RSS, VHP factor The Liberhan report has been very critical of mass Hindu organizations,especially the RSS. It says that demolition of Babri in Ayodhya has been a longtime objective of the RSS. It accuses RSS of utilizing its large volunteer base to accomplish this task. The RSS has always maintained that the demolition was spontaneous. The report suggests otherwise. The Sangh Parivar is a \\"highly successful and corporatised model of a political party\\" and as the Ayodhya campaign demonstrated, has developed a highly efficient organisational structure, the Liberhan Commission said in its report. It said the BJP \\"was and remains an appendage of the RSS, which had the purpose only of providing an acceptable veneer to the less popular decisions and a facade for the brash members of the Sangh Parivar\\". The Commission,observed, \\"The blame or the credit for the entire temple construction movement at Ayodhya must necessarily be attributed to the Sangh Parivar\\". It noted that the Sangh Parivar is an \\"extensive and widespread organic body\\", which encompasses organisations, which address and assimilate just about every type of social, professional and other demographic grouping of individuals. \\"Each time, a new demographic group has emerged, the Sangh Parivar has hived off some of its RSS inner-core leadership to harness that group and bring it within the fold, enhancing the voter base of the Parivar.\\" Open secrets A book authored by a former senior Indian intelligence officer revealed that demolition of the historic Babri Mosque at Ayodhya was planned 10 months in advance by Hindu extremist leaders of Rashtriya Sevak Sang (RSS), Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The author, a former Intelligence Bureau Joint Director, Maloy Krishna Dhar in his book \\"Open Secrets-India's intelligence unveiled\\" pointed out that the blue print for demolition of the mosque was drawn in a meeting held in February 1992 attended by leaders of the extremist Hindu groups. The leaders agreed to work together.They always maintained that demolition was unprecedented and top leaders had tried to hold back the Karsevaks. He goes on to say that in a meeting on the previous day,the RSS, VHP, BJP and Shiv Sena leaders there was \\"silent resoluteness and agreement that Ayodhya offered a unique opportunity to take the Hindutva wave to the peak for deriving political benefit. The iron was hot and this was the time to hit.\\" Dhar merged with the huge crowd as a journalist and found Shiv Sena activists engaged in vandalism and RSS members inflaming everyone.\\" L.K. Advani had spat fire from the pulpit but he failed to control the flames. Taped videos substantiated that he was progenitor of the tsunami effect that he failed to control at the vital moment of destiny,\\" says Dhar claiming to have made a videotape and 70 still photos. RSS defence Seeking to distance Hindu organisations from the Babri Mosque demolition, RSS chief K C Sudershan said that the Babri Mosque was demolished by government men and not by the Karsevaks. \\"The mosque was demolished by the government men and not by the Karsevaks,\\" he said while addressing a gathering of RSS cadre and public at a meeting. Without mentioning whether he was referring to the Kalyan Singh- led-BJP government in power in Uttar Pradesh or the Congress regime at Centre then, he said he was present at Ayodhya and wanted to construct the Ram Temple at an undisputed place but they could not do so as the government men demolished Babri Mosque on 6 December 1992. Sudershan, who spoke in a three- day function of RSS Madhya Bharat Pranth, said that under a conspiracy, the names of the Hindu Organisations like Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal (BD) were dragged in bringing down the structure. He contested Liberhan Commission's claim that demolition of the Babri Mosque was planned and charged \\"dilly-dally\\" by the then government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao was responsible for the incident. \\"It was not a planned incident. Because of the dilly-dallying attitude by the then Prime Minister and delay in court judgements, things went out of control as lakhs of people gathered at Ayodhya for kar seva,\\" Sudarshan told a press conference. He claimed when the people, who had climbed the canopy of the disputed structure, were unable to break it with heavy hammers and 'saabal' (long iron rod), the armed forces personnel present there caused the damage to its walls by triggering an explosive. Once the walls collapsed, the entire canopy of the Babri mosque caved in, he said. He claimed a powerful Congress leader of Maharashtra, whose name he did not disclose, had told him at senior BJP leader late K R Malkani's house in Delhi that the party had a plan to dislodge the government headed by Narasimha Rao \\"in the name of temple movement so that he could replace him\\" While K C Sudarshan said this, again after two days, RSS, the mother organization of Bharatiya Janata Party, on Tuesday owned the Ayodhya movement but refused to apologise about what happened in Ayodhya in 1992 which led to demolition of the Babri mosque. Ram Madhav,a RSS leader and former spokesperson of the Sangh said on a private channel,\\"We fully own up the movement. We mobilized people. People should respect the sentiment of crores of people. We are not going to apologise. Our agitation echoed the sentiment of the people at the time. It was a spontaneous act of anger by people,\\" Madhav added. VHP The VHP said the demolition of Babri mosque was the proudest moment for Hindus and asserted it was committed to building a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya. \\"Reports like that of the Liberhan Commission come and go. But, the Hindu culture, which takes pride in its heritage and protects its places of worship, has been in place for ages and will remain so for ever,\\" VHP leader Praveen Togadia said.\\"Any symbolic structure left by an invader in Akhand Bharat is a national shame. And the demolition of Babri mosque was the proudest moment for Hindus,\\" he said in a statement.Togadia asserted the VHP was committed to building a great Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and was ready to make any sacrifice for achieving this. \\"A magnificent temple will be built at the site. It is a socio-religious, cultural and legal right of the Hindus,\\" the VHP secretary general said. The VHP pointed out that in para 158.3, the commission says it(Ayodhya debate) \\"...never became a movement...\\" whereas in para 158.9 & 159.10, it contradicted itself with the contention as to \\"entire process of the movement\\" and \\"...leaders of the movement\\". The VHP says the commission failed to make any adverse comment on certain individuals despite observing in para 26.2 on page 88 that \\"... It is noteworthy that no member of the Muslim community from Ayodhya was a member of the Babri Masjid Action Committee or other committee protesting the opening of locks at the disputed structure. Sultan Shahabuddin Owaisi, a Member of Parliament from Hyderabad, challenged the opening of locks along with some others became a forerunner for taking on the Hindu organisation\\" The VHP said that after more than 40 extensions \\"during seventeen long years and wasting taxpayers‚Äô money the commission had prepared a useless report.\\" The commission declared many prominent personalities as culpable without giving them a chance of hearing.\\"It is shameful that in its long list of culprits one had already been died before the date of incident and seventeen thereafter before the submission of its report. The adverse comments made towards the apex court of the country, media, head of the State (Governor) and other respectable segments of the society are highly unacceptable,\\" it said.

Wall Street Journal. As the companies' chairman, Dolan oversees all operations within the company and also supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams, the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, and New York Liberty, as well as their regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. Dolan previously served as CEO of Cablevision until its sale in June 2016. Early life Dolan is the son of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and his wife, Helen Ann Dolan. He is of Irish descent. After originally pursuing a career in music, Dolan eventually switched to a major in communications at SUNY New Paltz and began working for Cablevision in various capacities including sales before eventually being dispatched to Cleveland by his father to manage the launching of a sports radio station. In 1995, he was made CEO of Cablevision. Throughout his early adult life, Dolan battled drug and alcohol problems and was reportedly known for having a volatile temper. In 1993, he went to drug rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Center City, Minnesota. Business management Dolan opposed his father's proposed Voom satellite service, which became a polarizing controversy among Cablevision's Board of Directors. While supporters argued Voom could propel Cablevision into the future emerging satellite market and a wider customer base, opponents of the plan, including James Dolan, argued it was too expensive with no expense relief for the foreseeable future. In the end, the younger Dolan prevailed and Voom was shut down. This was an instrumental event in Dolan emerging from his father's shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a viable businessman. His business career has included multiple failures, which include purchasing the failing Wiz electronics and entertainment chain, which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated, and the Clearview Cinemas chain which has failed to generate any significant revenue. Philanthropy Dolan fostered Cablevision's philanthropic partnership with The Lustgarten Foundation, a private supporter of pancreatic cancer research. Together with Charles Dolan and former Cablevision Vice Chairman and Madison Square Garden Chairman Marc Lustgarten. Dolan established the Foundation in 1998. In 2008, Cablevision made a multi-year commitment to underwrite the Foundation's costs, ensuring that 100 percent of every donation goes to researching this disease. With Dolan's backing, Cablevision used its assets to advance the curePC campaign, aimed at increasing public awareness of pancreatic cancer and is responsible for organizing the Holiday Rock & Roll Bash, the Foundation's annual fundraiser. Dolan played a role in organizing the recent \\"12-12-12\\" benefit concert, which raised an initial $50 million for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, with additional money still coming in. Other benefit concerts included \\"The Concert For New York City,\\" which generated more than $35 million in aid for 9/11 victims and heroes, and \\"From The Big Apple to The Big Easy,\\" which raised nearly $9 million for Hurricane Katrina relief. Dolan supports MSG's ongoing commitment to the community, particularly through the Garden of Dreams Foundation, the non-profit charity that partners with MSG to help children facing obstacles throughout the New York metropolitan area. Sports management In 1994, Paramount Communications, the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT sold its share to Cablevision three years later. In 1999, Dolan was given an increased role in managing Cablevision's sports properties and is now the primary manager of these assets. The teams under his domain include most notably the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, the National Hockey League's New York Rangers, the Women's National Basketball Association's New York Liberty, and the American Hockey League's Hartford Wolf Pack. As Chairman of Madison Square Garden, he supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. He also serves as a governor of the Knicks and Rangers to their respective leagues. Controversies New York Knicks Like the Rangers, the Knicks performed abysmally in the early 2000s. Unlike the Rangers, they have yet to fully recover, which fans mostly blame on Dolan's management missteps. Although the Knicks made the NBA Finals in 1999, they have not posted a winning season until the 2012‚Äì13 season. Furthermore, the Knicks had not made the playoffs from the 2003‚Äì04 season to the 2010‚Äì11 season, which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the Knicks. In 2007, NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Dolan's management of the Knicks, saying \\"they're not a model of intelligent management.\\" One widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard Allan Houston a 6-year, $100 million maximum contract in 2001, when no other team had offered Houston more than $75 million. Houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over $40 million remaining on his contract. In 2003, Dolan hired Isiah Thomas as Team President of Basketball Operations and General Manager to replace embattled executive Scott Layden. Thomas made aggressive moves to re- tool and upgrade the Knicks roster through trades, the NBA Draft, and free agency. Despite the talent Thomas imported, the team did not perform up to expectations and Thomas was often the target of the frustration of Knick fans; Dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of Knicks' fans for his commitment to Thomas in spite of Thomas' sometimes questionable decisions. After the 2004‚Äì05 season, the Knicks signed head coach Larry Brown to a 5-year, $50 million contract. After just one (losing) season, Brown was fired and the team bought-out Brown's contract for $18 million. Brown walked away with a total of $28 million for coaching the Knicks for just one year. After firing Larry Brown, Isiah Thomas assumed the duties of head coach of the Knicks. During a staged interview on MSG Network, the last time Dolan answered questions from the media, Dolan gave Thomas an ultimatum to show \\"evident progress\\" or potentially be fired. In the latter half of the 2006‚Äì07 season, with the Knicks within reach of a playoff spot, Dolan signed Thomas to a multi-year contract extension. The team subsequently fell out of contention and Dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of Thomas' contract. The next season, Dolan stripped Thomas of his front office duties because Thomas had taken the Knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure. New team President Donnie Walsh removed Thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season. Other coaches that also had short-lived tenures as head coaches of the Knicks include Don Chaney (2001‚Äì2003) and Lenny Wilkens (2003‚Äì2005). Like Thomas and Brown, they remained on the Knicks' payroll following their departure from the bench due to multi-year contracts signed with the owner (and in Chaney's case, 2 separate contract extensions). In 2007, Dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former Knicks executive, Anucha Browne-Sanders. Browne-Sanders accused Dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from Isiah Thomas. The court ruled in favor of Brown-Sanders and Dolan had to pay $3 million of the $11 million settlement. MSG was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement. In July 2012, Dolan faced criticism for allowing popular Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin to sign with the Houston Rockets without matching their $25.1 million offer. In February 2015, Dolan responded to a letter from Irving Bierman, a 73-year-old, lifelong Knicks fan, that criticized Dolan's ownership of the Knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own, telling the fan to \\"root for the Nets because the Knicks don't want you\\" and that Bierman was \\"a sad person\\" and probably an \\"alcoholic maybe\\". Dolan later addressed the issue with the press, but did not apologize, only saying the letter was a case of \\"tit for tat\\" and declaring the incident \\"over\\". Newly appointed NBA Commissioner Adam Silver did not reprimand or penalize Dolan, but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling Dolan a \\"consummate New Yorker\\" who received \\"an unkind email and responded with an unkind email\\". On February 9, 2017, former Knicks player Charles Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden during a Knicks‚ÄìClippers game following an altercation with MSG security. Oakley contends that Dolan has ignored, if not ostracized, him.Charles Oakley's Arrest In War With MSG's James Dolan Just Adds To Knicks' Never-Ending Circus Forbes FEB 9, 2017 @ 11:21 AMCan you really blame Charles Oakley for being disgusted with dysfunctional Knicks? USA Today SPORT 2:48 a.m. ET Feb. 9, 2017 Oakley later remarked on March 11, 2019 that Dolan tries to bully everyone because he has money and power, stating there was very little reason for reconciliation with him after the incident. A similar incident occurred two days earlier where a fan remarked that Dolan should \\"sell the team,\\" while Dolan threatened a ban on the fan in question. In March 2019, Dolan threatened a ban towards a fan at Madison Square Garden after he yelled \\"sell the team\\" at Dolan. ESPN discussed the situation on TV, questioning the reasoning behind his decision making there and saying Adam Silver needs to let Dolan either apologize to the fan or, ironically enough, actually sell the team. Some fans of the team responded to the outrage by giving away free t-shirts saying \\"St. Patty Says Ban Dolan\\" on their March 17 game against the Los Angeles Lakers, though some of the shirts got confiscated by security before fans entered the arena. New York Rangers After winning the Stanley Cup in 1994, the Rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of Dolan's increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the 1997‚Äì98 season until the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years. This was the longest playoff drought in the franchise's history, in part due to questionable, expensive free-agent signings, such as Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, and Theo Fleury. Despite fan and media calls for the team's general manager Glen Sather to be fired for the organization's shortcomings, Sather was retained. However, since the resolution of the NHL lockout in 2005, Dolan has allowed Sather to rebuild from the ground up, which has led to a revival of the club and the organization, leading to a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2012, their first since 1997, and to the Stanely Cup Finals in 2014. However, when Dolan spoke of the team's Stanley Cup chances in January 2012, Rangers head coach John Tortorella took issue with his remarks. \\"I have my owner up here talking about a Stanley Cup. That's a bunch of bullshit,\\" Tortorella said in response. \\"We need to take it one game at a time.\\" New York Liberty On May 5, 2015, Dolan announced that Isiah Thomas would serve as president of the WNBA's Liberty. Considering Thomas' history being both a failed President/GM of the Knicks and Thomas being implicated in the Anucha Browne-Sanders sexual harassment incident, Dolan's judgment was questioned by many fans and members of the press. Los Angeles Clippers Arena In an ongoing lawsuit between the Madison Square Garden Company and the city of Inglewood, California, Dolan is said to be trying to avoid being deposed in the case. The Los Angeles Clippers want to build a new arena, which would compete directly with The Forum, which is owned by the Madison Square Garden Company. In December 2018, the Madison Square Garden Company was countersued by the Clippers for trying to prevent the construction of a competing arena. In March 2019, leaked emails revealed that Irving Azoff attempted to lure the Los Angeles Lakers back to The Forum after their lease at the Staples Center was up. Despite nothing coming of the proposal, Azoff's proposal to re-purpose The Forum was seen as a way of preventing the Clippers from building their own arena in Inglewood and ensuring that the Madison Square Garden Company got an unfair advantage over rival AEG, which already owns part of the Lakers. In the summer of 2019, details emerged in regard to Dolan's tactics being used to prevent the construction of the competing arena. The Madison Square Garden Company had spent money trying to influence Inglewood's mayoral election as a way of trying to stop the arena from being built. They had also funded community groups to help their opposition to the arena. Media policies Dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with MSG Network. In 2000, Dolan instituted media training for all Garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media. Under Dolan's watch MSG implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players. Some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and Knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an MSG public relations official present, forbidding one-on-one interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization. The policies also forbid the MSG Network from being critical of the Knicks and the Rangers, regardless of their performance. Such measures were not standard practice for other NBA teams. In addition, the Knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press. In 2004, longtime broadcaster Marv Albert's contract was not renewed by MSG Network, allegedly because of his criticism of the Knicks' play. Personal life Dolan lives on Long Island with his wife. He has been married twice and has six sons. He is the son of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and nephew of Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan. On March 28, 2020, it was announced that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Hobbies Dolan performs blues-inspired rock as the singer for JD & The Straight Shot. After a show in New York City in 2017, one reviewer wrote that Dolan \\"sings like he‚Äôs trying not to cough, and it‚Äôs possible he can‚Äôt play the guitar. Worse, his songs belie his status as a cosplaying bluesman; most of his lyrics simply summarize current events or books that he‚Äôs read as if he were presenting a 10th grade English class project.\\" On August 1, 2018 his band released the song titled \\"I Should've Known\\" inspired by sexual harassment from the album The Great Divide. The album was set to be released in October 2018.

Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) is an Australian immigration detention facility located in the suburb of Villawood in Sydney, New South Wales in Australia. It mainly caters for people who have overstayed their visa permit or those who had their visa cancelled because they have failed to comply with their visa conditions, and some adult male and female asylum seekers who have arrived by boat without visas, whom the Australian government refer to as \\"Illegal Maritime Arrivals\\". Though, over the decades since the '50s, various Australian federal legislatures have ratified into law many of the provisions of the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which specifically grants a right for refugees to apply for asylum - with or without identifying documentation). People refused entry into the country at international airports and seaports may also be detained there. The centre has been the focus of much controversy, with accusations of human rights abuses. As of April 2016 it was managed by a private prison company Serco Group. History  Villawood Migrant Hostel  The site of the Detention Centre was previously known as the Villawood Migrant Hostel, built in 1949 to house migrants from post-war Europe to work in local industries. The centre was run by Commonwealth Hostels Ltd, a non-profit company. By 1964 the centre housed 1,425 people, mainly from Britain and Europe. By 1969 it was the largest migrant hostel in Australia, and was at that time housing migrants from Britain, The Netherlands, Denmark, West Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Turkey. In 1968 the centre was divided into two sections, one named the Villawood Migrant Hostel and the other named the Westbridge Migrant Hostel, which operated until 1984.  Conversion to a Detention Centre  In 1976 a small section of the hostel was converted to provide security accommodation for persons awaiting deportation. This new section was named the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre.\\"Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney (NSW)\\", Department of Immigration and Citizenship, retrieved 25 April 2013 In 2001 the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre was the subject of controversy when 40 asylum seekers escaped. A month later, a Four Corners documentary, \\"The Inside Story\\", revealed the plight of six-year-old Iranian refugee Shayan Bedraie, who had been refusing to speak or eat.\\"The Inside Story: An inside view of what is going on in detention centres.\\", ABC, 13 August 2001 Shayan and his family had been detained at Woomera IRPC for 11 months and Villawood IDC for at least 6 months, and had witnessed a number of riots and self-harm incidents. He was periodically taken to hospital to be drip-fed and rehydrated, and then returned to detention. Protesters at the detention centre as of 22 April 2011. As of 20 October 2004, the centre accommodated 551 people. This number comprised 405 adult men, 105 adult women and 41 children. In January 2008, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) said the high-security section of Villawood Detention Centre was the \\"most prison like\\" of all Australia's immigration detention centres, and demanded it be closed immediately. The HREOC described the infrastructure as dilapidated, and conditions inside the detention centre as \\"harsh and inhospitable\\". In December 2010, a 29-year-old British man wanted for a number of criminal offences in the UK, and was due to be deported, was believed to have committed suicide at Villawood IDC. His death was the third suicide at the Villawood centre since September 2010. Early in the morning of Thursday 21 April 2011, the centre was set alight by detainees.

Polypyridines are multidentate ligands that confer characteristic properties to the metal complexes that they form. Some complexes strongly absorb light via a process called metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT).Balzani, V., Juris, A., \\"Photochemistry and photophysics of Ru(II)-polypyridine complexes in the Bologna group. From early studies to recent developments\\", Coord. Chem. Rev. 2001, 211, 97. . The properties of these complexes can be tuned by changes in substituents. For example, electron donation, electron withdrawal, and œÄ-conjugating groups, to the polypyridine moiety. The MLCT absorption band can be shifted, the emission wavelength can be changed, and the emission lifetime can be extended.Hammarstroem, L., Johansson, O., \\"Expanded bite angles in tridentate ligands.

Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) is the preeminent example of a polypyridine complex. A well-known example of a polypyridine complex is the tris(bipyridine) derivative of ruthenium(II), Ru[(bpy)3]2+. This complex exhibits intense luminescence at room temperature in aqueous solution. Another example is a platinum-bipyridine-dithiolate complex, Pt(bpy)(bdt), in which bdt denotes a 1,2-benzenedithiolate anion. This complex also exhibits photoluminescence at room temperature, and its wavelength and lifetime can be tuned by substitution of either bipyridine or dithiolate moieties. Structural control is easier than for ruthenium complexes due to the square planar structure of the platinum complex. Some other areas of investigation involves immobilizing these complexes on electrodes.Zhong, Y.-W., Yao, C.-J., Nie, H.-J., \\"Electropolymerized films of vinyl-substituted polypyridine complexes: Synthesis, characterization, and applications\\", Coord.

Accessed online 27 April 2008.  Career  Returning to Seattle, he became a founder of the Black Student Union on the UW campus and helped to organize nearly a dozen high school and middle school Black Student Unions throughout Seattle. As a student activist, he was instrumental in bringing about the UW's Educational Opportunity Program minority recruitment program. He also played a role in the discrimination of black track athletes from Oregon State University, resulting in their early departure from a track meet. He graduated from the UW in 1970, receiving the university's first-ever degree in African American studies. Before he had even formally received his BA, he became the first supervisor of the Black Student Division in the university's Office of Minority Affairs. The Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project describes him as having been, in the late 1960s, \\"one of Seattle‚Äôs best known young black radicals.\\" A former member of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, he worked as a community organizer in Seattle. While still working for the University of Washington, he was involved in the occupation of a former Seattle public school that ultimately became El Centro de la Raza. His continued involvement in civil disobedience led to a request to \\"cool it\\", from the head of the Office of Minority Affairs, Samuel E. Kelly. Eventually, he left his position at the university. After working on the successful 1977 mayoral campaign of Charles Royer, he served briefly in the Royer administration, but felt that was taking him too far from his work as an activist. From April 1979 to December 1993, he was the executive director of Seattle's Central Area Motivation Program (\\"CAMP\\"). He eventually worked on Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns.

If the peroneal retinaculum is torn, the peroneal tendons are no longer stabilized. This allows the peroneus brevis tendon to move untethered over the lateral malleolus, creating pain. During pitching mechanics, the snapping of the tendon over the bone is painful and distracting to the pitcher. The procedure involves the placement of three sutures through the skin anterior to the path of the peroneus brevis tendon and into the underlying deep connective tissue. These sutures provide a temporary barrier, preventing the tendon from moving anteriorly over the malleolus. This procedure was first tested on a cadaver to establish if the surgery would work or not. The procedure is performed with local anaesthetic, about 24 hours before the player begins to pitch. The stitches must be removed immediately following the cessation of play, and indications are that the stitches may tear during the course of a game. The procedure is named for Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling, who required the surgery to be able to pitch for the Boston Red Sox in Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series and Game 2 of the 2004 World Series.

He continued his studies in Canada earning masters and doctorate degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Ottawa in 1970 and 1974. He has worked in the area of digital integrated microchip design for over four decades. From 1965 to 1968, Elmasry worked for Cairo University and from 1972 to 1974 for Bell-Northern Research in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Since 1974, he has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Ontario where he is a founding Director of the VLSI (Microchip) Research Group. As a spokesperson for Muslim causes through the Canadian Islamic Congress, he has been a regular contributor to The Globe and Mail. His remarks, especially those concerning the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, have drawn significant attention in the Canadian media. He has accused some of his opponents of being anti-Islam. Elmasry has authored and co-authored more than 500 research papers and 16 books on integrated circuit design and design automation, as well as having several patents to his credit. He has edited the following books for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers: Digital MOS Integrated Circuits (1981); Digital VLSI Systems (1985), Digital MOS Integrated Circuits II (1991) and Analysis and Design of BiCMOS Integrated Circuits (1993). Appearance on The Michael Coren Show Asked by Michael Coren in an interview on October 19, 2004 if \\"...everyone in Israel, irrespective of gender, over the age of 18 is a valid [military] target?\\", CIC President Mohamed Elmasry responded, \\"Yes, I would say.\\" Elmasry later apologized for his remarks, calling them his \\"biggest mistake\\" in 30 years of public life and offered his resignation, which was not accepted by the CIC's board. The Elmasry affair led to criticisms that the media focussed entirely on the comments of the CIC president while neglecting controversial comments made on the same program by a B'nai Brith official, Adam Aptowitzer, who stated that \\"When Israel uses terror... to destroy a home and convince people... to be terrified of what the possible consequences are, I'd say that's an acceptable use to terrify somebody.\\" The remarks only received attention several weeks after the broadcast, and after Elmasry's apology and proffered resignation, when a press release by the Canadian Arab Federation highlighted them. Following the CAF press release, Aptowitzer retracted his comments and resigned his position with the B'nai Brith. Toronto Star city editor John Ferri told the Toronto Star's ombud, Don Sellar, \\"we all had egg on our faces...[i]t was embarrassing for every paper in the city not to get the whole story from the outset.\\"Sellar, Don, \\"Arab group got the rest of the story\\", Toronto Star, November 6, 2004 In a letter to the Toronto Star following Sellar's column, Elmasary complained about the affair: > Canadian news media - including the Star - launched a relentless and unfair > attack against the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) and me while covering up > for weeks the outrageous statements made on the same show by Adam > Aptowitzer, then the Ontario chairman of the B'nai Brith Institute of > International Affairs. While never referring to Aptowitzer's statements, the > media used news stories, editorials, op-ed pieces, columns, photos, front- > page coverage, cartoons, and radio and television commentaries to paint a > negative picture of CIC and myself which seriously distorts and falsifies > the truth. It was widely reported, for example, that \\"Elmasry said all > Israelis over 18 were legitimate targets for suicide bombers.\\" This is > totally false. > The media never questioned the completeness or the accuracy of the radio > show transcript that was given to them. Instead, they totally and completely > relied on the heavily selective one provided to them, which was one-sided > and referred only to my remarks, but not to those by Aptowitzer.Elmasry, > Mohamed, \\"Media launched relentless attack\\", (Letter to the editor), Toronto > Star, November 10, 2004 Elmasry also criticized Canadian Jewish groups over this incident. In an article entitled \\"When Jews Target a Canadian Muslim\\", Elmasry accused the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) and Bnai Brith Canada of \\"putting pressure on my university to fire me\\" and that his words were \\"mis-represented to the public exactly as the CJC wished\\". He also stated that \\"a Toronto Jewish businessman had threatened to withdraw his financial support for a chair of Jewish studies.\\" He also criticized the 2004 bombings of hotels in Taba, Egypt on the grounds that some of the victims there were not Israelis. These remarks prompted harshly-worded responses from representatives of the Canadian Jewish Congress and several prominent Canadian Muslims. At first, Elmasry defended his remarks by insisting that he was merely sharing the standard Palestinian point of view. This led to further charges from his critics, who accused him of using the Palestinians as a scapegoat. In a letter to the Toronto Star, he denied having said what he was reported to have said. Relationship with Tarek Fatah Regarding the October 2004 controversy involving Elmasry, Tarek Fatah, a founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress, had stated that \\"...to believe all Israelis are targets is the height of hypocrisy.\\" Fatah also stated that: \\"In refusing to step aside, Elmasry and the CIC have demonstrated the authoritarian and dictatorial nature of their structure.[...] They purport to speak for Canada's 600,000 Muslims, but are not accountable or answerable to them.[...] We demand he [Elmasry] not[...] masquerade as leader of the community.\\" Regarding Elmasry's statements, Fatah wrote that \\"Elmasry accused his Muslim opponents of being traitors to their faith‚Äîan allegation that is read as a charge of apostasy, with all its ugly consequences\\" and that \\"It is especially sad that Mohamed Elmasry and his allies have chosen the holy month of Ramadan to launch their broadside on progressive Muslims.\\" In June 2006, Elmasry, named four public figures ‚Äì Tarek Fatah among them ‚Äì of taking every opportunity to bad-mouth Islam. Specifically, Elmasry stated that Fatah is \\"well known in Canada for smearing Islam and bashing Muslims\\". Fatah blasted Elmasry, stating that \\"[t]his is a classic threat to label anyone as an apostate and then marginalize them,[...] And this is what Mr. Elmasry has done by listing me as the top anti-Islam Muslim.\\" Fatah stated that he views the label from Elmasry as tantamount to a death sentence. However, some Islamic scholars disagreed with Fatah's characterization of Elmastry's comments. Leonard Librande, professor of religion at Carleton University, told CTV News that \\"There's nothing particularly Islamic in this... There are differences of opinion frequently in the community. It doesn't mean somebody is going to kill you.\\" However, Fatah has argued that \\"in the Muslim world[...] allegations of apostasy are used to silence critics and human rights workers\\" and that \\"Some interpretations of Sharia call for apostates to be killed. Such views have forced many Muslims to flee their countries of birth and take refuge in tolerant Western nations such as Canada. To now find ourselves harassed in Canada by some Muslims here is alarming and ironic.\\" Opinions and public statements War against terror Elmasry has asserted that the war against terror is actually being used to oppress Muslims as a whole saying that: > Right wing Canadian politicians and their parties consider the \\"war against > terror\\" to mean the same as \\"war against Muslims.\\" On the Bush Administration's intentions in the Middle East, in particular towards Iran, he has argued that: > Mr. Bush has started a new and ugly cold war and he clearly intends to > transform it into a hot one, sooner rather than later; the media and > political hype will translate into real aggression, bringing death, misery > and destruction to yet another Middle East state. The evil character of > human greed and power-lust is about to raise its ugly specter once again and > subjugate a weaker nation that refuses to toe the American line. Regarding a potential American attack on Iran, Elmasry has written that \\"It is all part of a long-planned Bush and Co. agenda and that is why you won't find a single good word in the American mainstream media about Iran‚Äînone, nil, zero.\\" In addition, Elmasry added that \\"the doctrine of colonization: looting other people's wealth and enslaving them, while killing outright those who resist[...] seems to be the dominant doctrine in Washington today\\" and that \\"Americans are busy preparing to attack yet another country, spreading more looting, more death, more suffering, and more destruction next door in Iran.\\" Elmasry has stated his opposition to Osama bin Laden calling him \\"a lunatic, a fanatic\\"Petricevic, Mirko, \\"A voice for Islam in Canada; When Muslims are unfairly stereotyped, Mohamed Elmasry is quick to respond\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, March 29, 2003 and accusing him and his lieutenants of \\"endangering the well-being, even the lives of many Muslims who are living in the West\\" and whose \\"religious rhetoric will probably feed into anti-Islam sentiments that already existed before Sept. 11 and have been on the rise since Sept. 11\\". Of bin Laden and his associated, Elmasry says \\"They have no religious authority.\\"Saunders, John, \\"Canadian Muslims scorn call to arms\\", Globe and Mail, October 10, 2001 Hezbollah Elmasry has written that Hezbollah \\"is actually a legitimate Lebanese Shi'a Islam political party organized around a variety of roles and functions, just as are many other political parties. And, not unlike some other parties, it developed a national military resistance wing, created solely in response to Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon.\\" During the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation urged the Canadian government to take Hezbollah and Hamas off its list of designated terrorist organizations. Elmasry wrote that the Canadian government should \\"review its 2002 decision to place Hezbollah and Hamas on its list of banned alleged terrorist organizations\\" because doing so \\"is an unconscionable act of hypocrisy and a mockery of justice\\" since Canada has not placed Israel on the same list. Elmasry also stated that the decision to place Hezbollah and Hamas on this list was \\"dictated by special interest groups with agendas that are contrary to peace with justice\\". Islamophobia Elmasry has been outspoken in opposition to Islamophobia stating that \\"Today's Islamophobia and yesterday's anti-Semitism are starkly similar\\" and expressing fear that at the parallels between historic anti-Semitism in Europe and modern anti-Muslim sentiment in the West. \\"Today, Canadian Muslims are collectively judged as guilty by association for every crime committed by Muslim individuals, organizations and states, no matter how obviously atypical, abnormal or extremist they are. They are labelled Islamists, fundamentalists, Jihadists, etc.\\" wrote Elmasry in a letter to the National Post analogizing the current situation to the history of anti-Semitism where \\"European Jews were found guilty-by-association of many crimes, from killing the Son of God to any professional misconduct, beginning with the local Jewish doctor\\". He argued that the modern world should draw lessons from the past and work to halt the spread of anti-Muslim sentiment lest it establish the same groundwork for anti-Muslim violence the way that centuries of anti-Semitism laid the groundwork for violence against Jews.Elmasry, Mohamed, \\"Stop the spread of Islamophobia\\", (letter to the editor) National Post, April 12, 2007 Multiculturalism In 2002, Elmasry denounced an email from the Khalid Bin Al-Walid Mosque that urged followers not to wish anyone a \\"Merry Christmas\\" asserting that this was tantamount to congratulating someone for murder and adultery. \\"It is a ridiculous statement and doesn't follow Islamic teaching. Whoever says this is saying it out of ignorance of his or her own religion\\", said Elmasry to the National Post and argued that extending Christmas greetings was the polite and neighbourly thing to do.Humphreys, Adrian, \\"Muslims aghast at mosque that slurs Christmas: 'These people are out to lunch'\\", December 31, 2002 He also said that Islam allows followers to marry Christians or Jews and that his own family is multi- faith. \\"My kids have uncles and aunts who are Christian and we wish them Happy Christmas and they also wish us Happy Eid.\\" Elmasry says he and the CIC support \\"smart integration where Muslims can practise their religion but can also be involved in advancing the well-being of their home country, which is Canada\\". Sharia tribunals In 2005, the Canadian Islamic Congress supported recommendations by Marion Boyd that the government of Ontario permit sharia tribunals to which Muslims could voluntarily submit civil disputes and whose findings would then have legal weight under the Arbitration Act. The proposal was opposed by the Muslim Canadian Congress, the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, and non-Muslim women's groups.Boase, Sharon, \\"Women's groups fight sharia in Ontario; Two reports submitted by a Muslim women's organization say introducing Islamic law into the province will harm the rights of vulnerable women\\", Hamilton Spectator, September 16, 2004Ogilvie, Megan, \\"Canadian Muslims give mixed reviews on moratorium; Debate urged on Islamic penal code Proposal would halt death penalty Proposal would halt stoning, death penalty Debate urged on Islamic penal code\\", Toronto Star, April 1, 2005. The provincial government ended up rejecting the proposal and scrapping existing religious arbitration tribunals for Jews and Christians in the process.\\"Ontario rejects sharia law: Jews, Christians to lose their religious tribunals as Premier vows 'one law for all'\\", National Post, September 12, 2005 Regarding the opposition of moderate Muslims to the introduction of Sharia tribunals in Canada, Elmasry wrote that Canadian Muslims should not \\"make a cause of publicly deriding their religion, badmouthing the Prophet, ridiculing the Qur'an and mounting uninformed crusades to smear their Islamic Law, the Shariah\\". The Muslim Canadian Congress demanded that the CIC apologize for \\"false\\" accusations that those who criticize sharia are \\"smearing Islam, ridiculing the Koran [and] badmouthing Muhammad\\". The MCC stated that Elmasry accused the group of blasphemy, a crime that carries the death sentence in several Islamic countries. The MCC wrote,Some MCC members also expressed concern they will be arrested if they travel to certain Islamic countries. Elmasry responded by stating that Islam has no punishment for denouncing the religion, its holy book, or Muhammad, and he dismissed as \\"nonsense\\" the notion that his words could be construed as a death sentence. Danish Muhammed cartoons Elmasry urged a moderate response to Danish cartoons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad published in 2005. Anger at the depictions resulted in violent rallies and attacks on Danish institutions in Europe and the Muslim world. Elmasry urged Canadian Muslims to have a \\"controlled and calm\\" response consisting of writing letters to the editor and the Danish government. He also urged Muslims to engage in outreach by inviting non-Muslims into their homes and have open houses in mosques. He discouraged attendance at demonstrations saying, Claim that Old Testament teaches violence Commenting in June 2006 on the decision of United Church, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to reissue a motion to divest in Israeli companies, Elmasry stated: > The move of the Toronto's United Church is a moral one. But is it true to > its Holy Book; the New Testament as much as Israel's campaign of death, > destruction and misery against the Palestinians under its occupation is true > to its Holy Book; the Old Testament? [...] It seems that many political > leaders in the Christian West are not living the teaching of their Holy Book > while Israel is living its own. Elmasry supported this view by citing a 1953 book by French pacifist Jean Lasserre, La Guerre et L'Evangile. Drawing on Lasserre's view that by and large, \\"the Old Testament ignores that respect for human life, that unconditional love, that non-violence, which [is] the general climate of the New Testament.\\" Previously, he had stated that \\"very few people would sanely suggest that the Torah [which is part of the Old Testament] sanctions violence. The reason of course is that these verses and others much like them are subject to various interpretation and contextual assumptions.\\" Criticism An article in the Arab American News criticized Elmasry, stating that: > His next gaffe [the first being the October 2004 controversy] was the > declaration that Israel's cruelty could be explained by the fact that the > Old Testament is full of justification of bloody deeds by the ancient > Hebrews. The inescapable corollary is that all Jews are cruel. Of course, > his remarks have several flaws. Even if, for the moment, we grant the > characterization of the Old Testament, it does not follow that all who claim > to follow it see it that way and act accordingly. Second, a more realistic > evaluation of these scriptures would recognize that they contain the work of > many authors with different views produced over many centuries, with later > works often more sophisticated. Amos, who declares, \\"Let justice flow down > like the waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream,\\" can hardly > be characterized as bloodthirsty. Finally, Elmasry's take on the Old > Testament is un-Islamic. The Quran identifies some of the patriarchs in the > Jewish scriptures as prophets, and it speaks respectfully of Jews and > Christians as \\"people of the book\\". Bnai Brith Canada sharply criticized Elmasry, stating in a press release that Elmasry's \\"thesis that the Old Testament is the root cause of all hatred and violence in the world\\" is an \\"attack on the core of Judaism\\". The Canadian Jewish community In an article written in June 2007, Elmasry criticised Canadian Jewish intellectuals for, in his opinion, moving to the right of the political spectrum. Elmasry wrote that \\"social justice once had staunch friends among Canadian Jews\\", citing in particular David Lewis, but argued that today \\"many Canadian Jewish intellectuals are assaulting Canada's policies regarding multiculturalism, immigration, and what they consider federal 'giving in' to natives' land claims. They are no longer speaking out against the deterioration of civil liberties in this country\\" and that \\"their political agenda has moved closer and closer to that of the far right.\\" In an article written in the National Post, Ezra Levant, the publisher of the now- defunct Western Standard accused Elmasry of hostility towards Jews. Levant cited the Canadian Association of Journalists meeting in Halifax in May 2005 in which he sat on a panel with Elmasry. During the meeting, Levant claims Elmasry engaged in \\"a lengthy rant against the 'zhoos' who control the media, the 'zhoos' who are 'on top' of the world and keep the Muslims on 'the bottom', and about how my own comments were suspect because I, too, was a 'zhoo.'\\" In response to accusations of anti-Semitism, Elmasry has argued that his organization the CIC \\"was the first non-Jewish Canadian NGO to denounce anti-Semitic incidents committed against several Montreal Jewish institutions\\".Elmasry, Mohamed, \\"The CIC replies\\", The Globe and Mail, October 5, 2005 Israel and the Palestinians Elmasry has referred to Israel as \\"Apartheid Israel\\" and has praised Israeli activist Uri Davis because he has \\"worked to expose the real truth behind Israel's so-called 'democracy'\\". Elmasry has also stated Uri Davis work makes it clear \\"to any thinking person that Apartheid Israel and Apartheid South Africa are remarkably similar\\". Elmarsy has also called for Britain to apologize to the Palestinians for its role in the creation of Israel and for its use \\"of military violence, political stratagems and economic influence to inflict generations of injustice, destruction, misery and death on a native people living in the path of their plans\\".It's Time for Britain to Apologize to the Palestinians , Mohammed Elmasry, Canadian Islamic Congress, July 18, 2008, Elmasry has said \\"The pro-Israel lobby continually strive to discredit anyone who dares to speak the truth about Israeli atrocities against native Palestinians.\\" He has also written that: \\"[...]Zionism, as a political ideology, has succeeded only in building an apartheid state for Jews; an elaborate ghetto kept separate from its Palestinian neighbors by concentrated military power, an aesthetically monstrous 'security wall,' economic dependency on Western support, compulsory military conscription and training (including how to kill with weapons), and a hate-based education system for Jewish children that teaches them to despise anyone and anything Palestinian, Arab, or Muslim, in that order.\\" Elmasry has recognized a diversity of opinion among Israelis, saying that \\"Many Israelis‚Äîand the number steadily grows‚Äînow recognize that the occupation and the settlements are twin obstacles to peace.\\"Elmasry, Mohamed, \\"A region burdened by hatred As violence ricochets around the Middle East, Canada is one of the few countries able to defuse it, says Canadian Islamic leader Mohamed Elmasry\\", Globe and Mail, June 20, 2001 Elmasry has called for a two-state solution with Israel withdrawing to its pre-1967 border and praised Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat for making peace with Israel in exchange to its withdrawal from the Sinai Desert. However, in April 2008, Elmasry wrote that \\"Those Palestinians who oppose the one-state solution are those who believe the illusion (promoted by U.S. president George W. Bush, for example) that a two-state solution is just around the corner.\\" Elmasry has also stated that there is nothing wrong with the \\"one-state\\" solution. Elmasry suggested such as state \\"could divide key positions of power among Jews and the Arabs. For example, Jews could be in charge of the army and Arabs look after the police. The positions of President, Prime Minister, and Speaker of the Parliament could be held in alternating terms by Arabs and Jews.\\" However, Elmasry adds that \\"the single state solution will never happen in the foreseeable future, of course, because the U.S. is pledged to maintain not only a secure Jewish state, but an expanding Jewish mini-empire carved out of its illegally occupied Palestinian territories.\\" In an article written in The Canadian Charger in June 2009, Elmasry wrote that \\"Israelis are indoctrinated in Zionism\\" and that \\"violent militarism is not only a Zionist ideal but an economical and a sociological necessity.\\"Zionists Fighting Peace by Mohamed Elmasry, The Canadian Charger, June 28, 2009. In a subsequent article, Elmasry wrote that \\"in the West Zionist Jews create, encourage, support wars in Afghanistan and Iraq... [and] cheer for racist, anti-immigration politicians in Canada and Europe.\\" He also described Zionist Jews as \\"the enemies of freedom of speech in schools, universities and the public at large\\" and alleged that the Western media gives \\"Zionist oppressors a platform that allows them to exploit the Holocaust, and mount disinformation and misinformation campaigns\\".Zionism, it has been wrong for so long by Mohamed Elmasry, The Canadian Charger, March 24, 2010. Joel Kovel In April 2008, Elmasry praised Joel Kovel for his book Overcoming Zionism ‚Äì Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel/Palestine. Elmasry stated that, on the 60th anniversary of Israel's creation, Kovel's book \\"is must-read for this difficult and bitter-sweet occasion\\". Elmasry also stated that \\"hate that drives Zionist attitudes toward Palestinians\\" and that Kovel \\"suggests convincingly that the inner contradictions of Zionism led Israel to develop its 'state-sponsored racism' and that Zionism and democracy are essentially incompatible.\\" Elmasry concluded by stating that the reason Kovel's book has been \\"buried\\" is that \\"our so-called 'free' press and broadcasting networks[...] are free only to those who own them and use their power to express their own views. And that is a sad loss for everyone.\\" Homosexuality In 2004, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty encouraged Muslim parents to allow their children to attend public school classes that include teaching tolerance of gays and lesbians. Elmasry acknowledged that \\"Teaching tolerance at a young age is a must ... but you have to balance that with the appearance that you are not promoting certain values, in this case homosexual families.\\" In February 2005, Elmasry wrote on the website IslamOnline.net that: \\"I believe that the responsibilities of Canadian Muslims are to emphasize education in their own community and also other faith communities that homosexuality is against the natural law of the creator, and that it is harmful to the body, the mind and the soul of the person.\\" Robert Mugabe In July 2008, writing in an op-ed for the Montreal Gazette, Elmasry called Robert Mugabe \\"clumsy\\" but \\"no worse than many leaders in the developing world\\" and questioned: \\"Why so did many Western media outlets, including Canadian ones, send their own correspondents to cover an election in a poor faraway African country of about 13-million black people? The answer is that Mugabe is hated by the British now as he was hated in 1980 when he was elected the first president of free Zimbabwe, after 90 years of British colonization under the name of Rhodesia.\\" Elmasry praised Mugabe for \\"trying to implement a land reform; to redistribute the land of about 5,000 white farmers to his country's poor black people\\" and argued that the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy and the rampant inflation are the result of Western sanctions and not because of Mugabe's land seizures. Elmasy criticized the Western media for not reporting that \\"Mugabe was and still is popular especially in the rural areas; his land reform has won him support among his own people.\\" Father Raymond J. de Souza criticized Elmasry for this op-ed, writing that Mugabe is \\"a man so isolated that even his fellow African dictators have distanced themselves from him\\". De Souza also wrote that \\"If he [Elmasry] did not represent himself as Canada's head professional Muslim, Mr. Elmasry's celebration of Mr. Mugabe would have been too incredible to print.\\" Omar Khadr In July 2008, Elmasry wrote that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is \\"playing politics\\" and remains indifferent to Omar Khadr's incarceration at Guantanamo Bay prisoner because Harper had calculated that refusing to press Washington for Khadr's return would score him \\"political points\\". Elmasry further stated that \\"This is where a leader comes in to say, 'This is really wrong and I have to correct that wrong by bringing this person (back to Canada) even if I lose some political points with Islamophobes.' Mr. Harper is playing politics because of the backdrop of Islamophobia in this country... he has to rise above that.\\" Elmasry contrasted Khadr's case with that of dual Canadian- British citizen William Sampson, who was freed from a death sentence in Saudi Arabia in 2003. Elmasry specifically wrote that: > Why is Stephen Harper so callously indifferent to Omar Khadr's case? It's > painfully obvious: William Sampson is a white Westerner while his fellow > Canadian citizen, Omar Khadr, is brown-skinned and a Muslim. However, Elmasry later stated that he was attempting to explain Harper's stance on the file and was not accusing the prime minister of prejudice against Muslims. Kory Teneycke, Harper's director of communications, responded that if \\"there is a party playing politics with this case, it's certainly not the Conservative party. The Liberal party is reversing a position that it held for a number of years while in government with respect to how the serious charges against Mr. Khadr should be dealt with. We are very late in that process now and it would be inappropriate to make a change.\\" Teneycke did not comment specifically on Elmasry's words. Environment In August 2008, Elmasry suggested St√©phane Dion and his Green Shift plan could sell to Canadians if he used a green surcharge as well. He also suggested that Canada follow the example of Europe rather than the US when it comes to the environment.http://www.canadianislamiccongress.com/fb/friday_bulletin.php?fbdate=2008-08-01#1 Slavery in Islam In an article written in The Canadian Charger in August 2009, Elmasry wrote that: > Islam teaches that slaves, who were then the result of wars, Africans or > not, should be treated well and set free as soon as possible...Islam also > teaches that slaves can buy their freedom in-kind. Thus many of them > excelled to be teachers and even scholars ‚Ä¶ Islam teaches a slave is a > victim of circumstances who should be helped to be free and treated fairly > in the mean time. Trading in slaves is a sin. This is in contrast to the > teachings of the Bible, \\"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and > trembling.\\"What if Europeans hadn't ‚Äòdiscovered' Africa? (Part 2: Slavery) > by Mohamed Elmasry, The Canadian Charger, August 19, 2009. Jonathan Kay, writing in the National Post, sharply criticized Elmasry. Describing Elmasry's statements as an \\"absurd elevation of Islam over Christianity\\", Kay noted that religious Christians led the abolition movement in the West in the 18th and 19th centuries, whereas slavery continued to exist in the Arab world into the 20th century and is still practiced in parts of Islamic Africa such as Sudan. Kay rhetorically asked \\"what the Christian tribespeople from southern Sudan who have been abducted, forcibly converted to Islam, and enslaved by Arab Muslims in recent years would make of Elmasry's historical fantasies\\".Historical fantasies by Jonathan Kay, National Post, August 24, 2009.

Eastwood is located 17 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government areas of the City of Ryde and the City of Parramatta. Eastwood is in the Northern Sydney region. Originally thought to have been inhabited by the Wallumedegal Aboriginal tribe, who lived in the area between the Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers, the area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, from land grants to Royal Marines and NSW Corps, and was named \\"Eastwood\\" by an early Irish free settler, William Rutledge. Today it is a large suburban centre in the north of Sydney of over 14,000 people, with a large shopping area. Eastwood has a large population of Asian descent with immigrants from China transforming the commercial precinct in the past decade. Eastwood is famous for the Granny Smith apple, accidentally first grown in the suburb by Maria Ann Smith. Every October, the oval and cordoned-off streets become the grounds for the annual Granny Smith Festival, a celebration of the icon with fairground rides, market stalls, street theatres, parades, an apple-baking competition and a fireworks spectacular at the Upper Eastwood Oval. In recent years the festival has been influenced by the substantial Asian immigrant communities, with Chinese dragon dancers in the Grand Parade and Chinese stallholders. During the same period, Eastwood's annual Chinese New Year Celebrations have broadened their appeal by incorporating concurrent Korean New Year traditions, and have accordingly been renamed the Lunar New Year Festivities.\\"Mixing it up in Bennelong\\" Accessed 11 August 2011. Geography Eastwood is located at the edge of the Hornsby Plateau with the suburbs of Dundas Valley and Denistone on its western and southern sides, respectively, as the land falls away down to the Cumberland Plain. To the north, Eastwood is bounded by the transport hub of Epping and to its east Marsfield which shares the same postcode of 2122. The suburb is predominantly residential with the main shopping area of Eastwood centred between Rowe Street and Rutledge Street around the railway line. History The Wallumedegal aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River, which was known as Walumetta. The area was originally heavily timbered.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 92 The area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 and was part of the Field of Mars. The area of Eastwood was originally granted between the years of 1790 and 1803 to marines and the NSW Corps. John Love, a private was granted here in 1794, described as North Brush, in the Field of Mars Common. The land was then acquired by William Kent who already held land in what is now Epping. The land was purchased by William Rutledge for 288 pounds in 1835, who built 'Eastwood House' in 1840. This house is now part of Marist College Eastwood. Scottish born John Ross, who was part of the \\"squattocracy\\", owned Eastwood from 1860 until 1863. He reputedly paid ¬£60 000 for it. In 1863 Edward Terry purchased the estate and upon his death in 1905, the estate was sub-divided. In 1886, the Main Northern railway line from Strathfield to Hornsby was opened, with a station here originally called Dundas. This was changed a year later to Eastwood, named after the Eastwood Estate. The commercial centre underwent a major upgrade in the early 1980s. Rowe Street, which originally ran across the railway line through a level crossing was turned into a mall between The Avenue and West Parade, and the 1940s bridge built in First Avenue for crossing traffic was replaced with a six-lane bridge. This bridge was to service the planned County of Cumberland Scheme, Eastwood County Road (linking Eastwood with Macquarie Park), a road project in the local area which has been controversial among locals.\\"Ozroads: Eastwood County Road\\", 2004‚Äì2007.

Transport Eastwood is relatively well served by public transport. Eastwood railway station is located on the Main Northern railway line. The station opened in 1886,Bozier, Rolfe, \\"New South Wales Railways: Eastwood Railway Station\\". Accessed 4 July 2006. and it takes approximately 30‚Äì35 minutes to travel to Central. Intercity services also service Eastwood station between Central, Newcastle and the Central Coast region. Numerous State Transit bus services also operate from the small interchange outside the station. These include the 545/550 route between Parramatta and Chatswood, the 544 route between Auburn and Macquarie University, and the 515/X15 service to the Sydney central business district. Eastwood is also served well by roads, and is located close to the trunk routes of the A6 (Marsden Road), and Victoria Road. In spite of the range of public transport options, the 2016 census found that only 31% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 53% by car (either as driver or as passenger).

It is found in coastal and sub-coastal south-eastern Australia. Taxonomy The little wattlebird was formally described by ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name Merops chrysoptera. The species is now placed in the genus Anthochaera that was introduced by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827. The title page gives the year as 1826 but the issue was published in 1827. The generic name Anthochaera deives from the Ancient Greek anthos 'flower, bloom' and khair≈ç 'enjoy'; the specific epithet chrysoptera derives from Ancient Greek khrysos 'gold' and pteron 'wing'. The International Ornithologists' Union recognise three subspecies: * A. c. chrysoptera (Latham, 1801) ‚Äì eastern and southeastern Australia * A. c. halmaturina (Mathews, 1912) ‚Äì Kangaroo Island (South Australia) * A. c. tasmanica (Mathews, 1912) ‚Äì Tasmania The western wattlebird (A. lunulata) was at one time considered as a subspecies. Victoria, Australia Description The little wattlebird is a medium to large honeyeater, but the smallest wattlebird.Birds in Backyards - Little Wattlebird The appearance is similar to the yellow wattlebird and the red wattlebird. The little wattlebird lacks the wattles, which characterise other members of the genus. Juveniles are duller with less streaking and have a browner eye. Calls include a strident cookay-cok, a raucous fetch the gun, a mellow guttural yekkop, yekkop and many squeaky, musical lilting notes. The alarm call is a kwock or shnairt!. Distribution and habitat The little wattlebird is found in banksia/eucalypt woodlands, heathlands, tea-tree scrub, sandplain-heaths, lantana thickets, wild tobacco, parks and gardens. Behaviour Wattlebird feeding nestlings, September 2002, NSW Breeding Breeding takes place from June to December. The female wattlebird generally constructs the nest, which is a loose, untidy cup of twigs, lined with shredded bark, and placed from 1 to 10 m high in the fork of a banksia, tea-tree or eucalypt sapling. 1-2 eggs are laid and may be spotted red-brown, purplish-red or salmon-pink in colour. The female incubates the eggs alone but both parents care for the young chicks. Feeding Little wattlebirds feed on nectar obtained with a long, brush-tipped tongue, adapted for probing deep into flowers. They also feed on insects, berries, and some seeds. Most feeding is done perched, but some insects are caught in mid- air. Birds may feed alone or in groups.

It was an expression of Manifest Destiny, but it never went into effect. In the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846-48, the United States took by force sparsely settled territory in Mexico's north, but also invaded the densely populated Mexican heartland. After the U.S. Army took Mexico City, there was renewed enthusiasm for incorporating all of Mexico. It was fiercely opposed in the U.S. Congress, especially by U.S. Senator from South Carolina, John C. Calhoun, who strongly objected to incorporating into the U.S. a territory with a dense, nonwhite population. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the aspirations of the movement by acquiring the sparsely settled region in the far north of Mexico. Background Before James Polk took office in 1845, the United States Congress approved the annexation of Texas. Polk wished to gain control of a portion of Texas, which had declared independence from Mexico in 1836, but was still being claimed by Mexico. This paved the way for the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War on April 24, 1846. With American success on the battlefield, by the summer of 1847 there were calls for the annexation of \\"All Mexico\\", particularly among Eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union was the best way to ensure future peace in the region. Controversies The proposal to annex all of Mexico was controversial. Idealistic advocates of Manifest Destiny, such as John L. O'Sullivan, had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed on people against their will. The annexation of \\"All Mexico\\" would be a violation of this principle. The annexation of all Mexico also found controversy in extending U.S. citizenship to millions of Mexicans. This debate brought to the forefront one of the contradictions of Manifest Destiny: on the one hand, while identitarian ideas inherent in Manifest Destiny suggested that Mexicans, as non-whites, would present a threat to white racial integrity and thus were not qualified to become U.S. citizens, the \\"mission\\" component of Manifest Destiny suggested that Mexicans would be improved (or \\"regenerated\\", as it was then described) by bringing them into American democracy. Identitarianism was used to promote Manifest Destiny, but, as in the case of Calhoun and the resistance to the \\"All Mexico\\" movement, identitarianism was also used to oppose manifest destiny. Conversely, proponents of annexation of \\"All Mexico\\" regarded it as an anti-slavery measure. Many U.S. nationals were troubled by the Catholicism of Mexico, the weakness of Republicanism there, and the threat of an upsurge of Mexican nationalism.Pinheiro, John C. \\"'Religion without Restriction\\": Anti-Catholicism, All Mexico, and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,\\" Journal of the Early Republic (2003): 69-96. in JSTOR End of the Call The controversy was eventually ended by the Mexican Cession, which added the territories of Alta California and Nuevo M√©xico to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the All Oregon movement, the All Mexico movement quickly abated. Historian Frederick Merk, in Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation (1963), argued that the failure of the All Oregon and All Mexico movements indicates that manifest destiny had not been as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that, while belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, aggressive \\"continentalism\\" was an aberration supported by only a minority of Americans, mostly Democrats, while it was opposed by Whigs and some Democrats. Thus the Democrats of Louisiana opposed annexation of Mexico,Billy H. Gilley, \\"'Polk's War' and the Louisiana Press.\\" Louisiana History (1979): 5-23 in JSTOR. while those in Mississippi supported it.Robert A.

Founded in 1990 by Brice Lalonde, Environment Minister, upon the suggestion of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, it describes itself as a club with cross-party alliances of green-minded politicians and public servants. It moved away from the \\"presidential majority\\" in 1992, when Brice Lalonde left the cabinet. The party, in alliance with The Greens obtained about 14% of the vote in the 1992 French regional elections; but the 1993 legislative election was disappointing for the Green- GE alliance, as it failed to win any seats and won only 7% (other ecologist parties brought the score up to 11%), when polls had given them up to 16%. No√´l Mam√®re was the movement's vice-president from 1992 to 1994, when he was excluded from the party and founded the Ecology-Solidarity Convergence, which later joined The Greens. Unlike many green parties, which are traditionally associated with the left-wing, G√©n√©ration √©cologie presents itself as a centre-right ecologist party, despite its early allegiance with the Socialist Party. Nicknamed 'The Blues,' after the traditional colour of conservatism, it has been associated with the conservative UMP since 2002, although the links between the two parties grew more tenuous after the 2004 French regional elections. G√©n√©ration √©cologie has cooperated since the 2004 elections with several other movements that share its priorities. It has worked alongside various organisations, most prominently the Federalist Party, the Centre of Handicapped Democrats, and the Vanquish Unemployment Association. France Gamerre replaced Brice Lalonde as leader and she aimed to run in the 2007 French presidential election. Like her predecessor, she failed to win the 500 endorsements. In the 2009 European Parliament election, the party ran as part of the Independent Ecological Movement which won 3.63% of the vote. On 2 May 2018 former minister of Ecology Delphine Batho left the Socialist Party and joined Ecology Generation. She was elected as new party president on 10 September 2018.

Spuds MacKenzie is a fictional dog (bull terrier) character used for an extensive advertising campaign marketing Bud Light beer in the late 1980s. The Spuds MacKenzie mascot and campaign were thought of by a 23-year-old art director, Jon Moore. At the time he was working at Needham, Harper & Steers, a Chicago advertising agency. The dog first showed up in a Bud Light Super Bowl XXI ad in 1987. The dog, portrayed by a female bull terrier named Honey Tree Evil Eye, did have some controversy. Shortly after Spuds' rise to fame it was learned that the dog, who was portrayed as male in the ads, was actually female. The ads were also the subject of attacks and calls for censorship by temperance-oriented groups. Soon after the ads were first aired in 1987, Senator Strom Thurmond began his own media campaign, claiming that the beer maker was using Spuds to appeal to children for the purpose of getting them interested in their product at an early age. By Christmas 1987, more legal action resulted from Budweiser's use of ads featuring Spuds dressed as Santa, which is illegal in states such as Ohio. In 1989, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, along with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, alleged that Anheuser-Busch was pitching the dog to children. Although the Federal Trade Commission found no evidence to support that allegation, Anheuser-Busch decided to retire Spuds in 1989, claiming that the character's image had started to overshadow the product. In 2017, the character appeared in Bud Light's advertisement in Super Bowl LI as a ghost helping a man named Brian reunite with his friends in an homage to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The house number in this advertisement's last segment is 1989, paying homage to the year Spuds was retired. The dog's real name was Honey Tree Evil Eye or Evie for short (October 7, 1983 ‚Äì May 31, 1993). She was from Woodstock, Illinois, and lived in North Riverside, Illinois, with her owner family. She died of kidney failure in North Riverside, Illinois. The company sponsored many dogs from the kennel in Illinois where Evie was from.

They exist in form of molecular crystals or amorphous thin films. In general, they are electrical insulators, but become semiconducting when charges are either injected from appropriate electrodes, upon doping or by photoexcitation. General properties In molecular crystals the energetic separation between the top of the valence band and the bottom conduction band, i.e. the band gap, is typically 2.5‚Äì4 eV, while in inorganic semiconductors the band gaps are typically 1‚Äì2 eV. This implies that they are, in fact, insulators rather than semiconductors in the conventional sense. They become semiconducting only when charge carriers are either injected from the electrodes or generated by intentional or unintentional doping. Charge carriers can also be generated in the course of optical excitation. It is important to realize, however, that the primary optical excitations are neutral excitons with a Coulomb-binding energy of typically 0.5‚Äì1.0 eV. The reason is that in organic semiconductors their dielectric constants are as low as 3‚Äì4. This impedes efficient photogeneration of charge carriers in neat systems in the bulk. Efficient photogeneration can only occur in binary systems due to charge transfer between donor and acceptor moieties. Otherwise neutral excitons decay radiatively to the ground state ‚Äì thereby emitting photoluminescence ‚Äì or non- radiatively. The optical absorption edge of organic semiconductors is typically 1.7‚Äì3 eV, equivalent to a spectral range from 700 to 400 nm (which corresponds to the visible spectrum). History TTF/TCNQ charge-transfer salt, highlighting the segregated stacking In 1862, Henry Letheby obtained a partly conductive material by anodic oxidation of aniline in sulfuric acid. The material was probably polyaniline.The Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2000: Conductive polymers, nobelprize.org. In the 1950s, researchers discovered that polycyclic aromatic compounds formed semi-conducting charge-transfer complex salts with halogens. In particular, high conductivity of 0.12 S/cm was reported in perylene‚Äìiodine complex in 1954.Herbert Naarmann \\"Polymers, Electrically Conducting\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . This finding indicated that organic compounds could carry current. The fact that organic semiconductors are, in principle, insulators but become semiconducting when charge carriers are injected from the electrode(s) was discovered by Kallmann and Pope. They found that a hole current can flow through an anthracene crystal contacted with a positively biased electrolyte containing iodine that can act as a hole injector. This work was stimulated by the earlier discovery by Akamatu et al. that aromatic hydrocarbons become conductive when blended with molecular iodine because a charge-transfer complex is formed. Since it was readily realized that the crucial parameter that controls injection is the work function of the electrode, it was straightforward to replace the electrolyte by a solid metallic or semiconducting contact with an appropriate work function. When both electrons and holes are injected from opposite contacts, they can recombine radiatively and emit light (electroluminescence). It was observed in organic crystals in 1965 by Sano et al. In 1972, researchers found metallic conductivity in the charge-transfer complex TTF-TCNQ. Superconductivity in charge-transfer complexes was first reported in the Bechgaard salt (TMTSF)2PF6 in 1980. In 1973 Dr. John McGinness produced the first device incorporating an organic semiconductor. This occurred roughly eight years before the next such device was created. The \\"melanin (polyacetylenes) bistable switch\\" currently is part of the chips collection of the Smithsonian Institution.An organic polymer voltage-controlled switch from 1974. Now in the Smithsonian Chip collection In 1977, Shirakawa et al. reported high conductivity in oxidized and iodine-doped polyacetylene. They received the 2000 Nobel prize in Chemistry for \\"The discovery and development of conductive polymers\\". Similarly, highly conductive polypyrrole was rediscovered in 1979. Rigid- backbone organic semiconductors are now used as active elements in optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), organic solar cells, organic field-effect transistors (OFET), electrochemical transistors and recently in biosensing applications. Organic semiconductors have many advantages, such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, and low cost. The discovery by Kallman and Pope paved the way for applying organic solids as active elements in semiconducting electronic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) that rely on the recombination of electrons and hole injected from \\"ohmic\\" electrodes, i.e. electrodes with unlimited supply of charge carriers. The next major step towards the technological exploitation of the phenomenon of electron and hole injection into a non-crystalline organic semiconductor was the work by Tang and Van Slyke. They showed that efficient electroluminescence can be generated in a vapor-deposited thin amorphous bilayer of an aromatic diamine (TAPC) and Alq3 sandwiched between an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) anode and an Mg:Ag cathode. Another milestone towards the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) was the recognition that also conjugated polymers can be used as active materials. The efficiency of OLEDs was greatly improved when realizing that phosphorescent states (triplet excitons) may be used for emission when doping an organic semiconductor matrix with a phosphorescent dye, such as complexes of iridium with strong spin‚Äìorbit coupling. Work on conductivity of anthracene crystals contacted with an electrolyte showed that optically excited dye molecules adsorbed at the surface of the crystal inject charge carriers. The underlying phenomenon is called sensitized photoconductivity. It occurs when photo-exciting a dye molecule with appropriate oxidation/reduction potential adsorbed at the surface or incorporated in the bulk. This effect revolutionized electrophotography, which is the technological basis of today's office copying machines. It is also the basis of organic solar cells (OSCs), in which the active element is an electron donor, and an electron acceptor material is combined in a bilayer or a bulk heterojunction. Doping with strong electron donor or acceptors can render organic solids conductive even in the absence of light. Examples are doped polyacetylene and doped light-emitting diodes. Today organic semiconductors are used as active elements in organic light- emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Materials Amorphous molecular films Amorphous molecular films are produced by evaporation or spin-coating. They have been investigated for device applications such as OLEDs, OFETs, and OSCs. Illustrative materials are tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium, C60, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), pentacene, carbazoles, and phthalocyanine. Molecularly doped polymers Molecularly doped polymers are prepared by spreading a film of an electrically inert polymer, e.g. polycarbonate, doped with typically 30% of charge transporting molecules, on a base electrode. Typical materials are the triphenylenes. They have been investigated for use as photoreceptors in electrophotography. This requires films have a thickness of several micrometers that can be prepared using the doctor-blade technique. Molecular crystals In the early days of fundamental research into organic semiconductors the prototypical materials were free-standing single crystals of the acene family, e.g. anthracene and tetracene. The advantage of employing molecular crystals instead of amorphous film is that their charge carrier mobilities are much larger. This is of particular advantage for OFET applications. Examples are thin films of crystalline rubrene prepared by hot wall epitaxy. Neat polymer films They are usually processed from solution employing variable deposition techniques including simple spin-coating, ink-jet deposition or industrial reel-to-reel coating which allows preparing thin films on a flexible substrate. The materials of choice are conjugated polymers such as poly- thiophene, poly-phenylenevinylene, and copolymers of alternating donor and acceptor units such as members of the poly(carbazole-dithiophene- benzothiadiazole (PCDTBT) family. For solar cell applications they can be blended with C60 or PCBM as electron acceptors. Aromatic short peptides self-assemblies Aromatic short peptides self-assemblies are a kind of promising candidate for bioinspired and durable nanoscale semiconductors. The highly ordered and directional intermolecular œÄ-œÄ interactions and hydrogen- bonding network allow the formation of quantum confined structures within the peptide self-assemblies, thus decreasing the band gaps of the superstructures into semiconductor regions. As a result of the diverse architectures and ease of modification of peptide self-assemblies, their semiconductivity can be readily tuned, doped, and functionalized. Therefore, this family of electroactive supramolecular materials may bridge the gap between the inorganic semiconductor world and biological systems. Characterization To design and characterize organic semiconductors used for optoelectronic applications one should first measure the absorption and photoluminescence spectra using commercial instrumentation. However, in order to find out if a material acts as an electron donor or acceptor one has to determine the energy levels for hole and electron transport. The easiest way of doing this, is to employ cyclic voltammetry. However, one has to take into account that using this technique the experimentally determined oxidation and reduction potential are lower bounds because in voltammetry the radical cations and anions are in a polar fluid solution and are, thus, solvated. Such a solvation effect is absent in a solid specimen. The relevant technique to energetically locate the hole transporting states in a solid sample is UV-photoemission spectroscopy. The equivalent technique for electron states is inverse photoemission. There are several techniques to measure the mobility of charge carriers. The traditional technique is the so-called time of flight (TOF) method. Since this technique requires relatively thick samples it is not applicable to thin films. Alternatively, one can extract the charge carrier mobility from the current flowing in a field effect transistor as a function of both the source- drain and the gate voltage. One should be aware, though, that the FET-mobility is significantly larger than the TOF mobility because of the charge carrier concentration in the transport channel of a FET (see below). Other ways to determine the charge carrier mobility involves measuring space charge limited current (SCLC) flow and \\"carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV). In order to characterize the morphology of semiconductor films, one can apply atomic force microscopy (AFM) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS). Charge transport In contrast to organic crystals investigated in the 1960-70s, organic semiconductors that are nowadays used as active media in optoelectronic devices are usually more or less disordered. Combined with the fact that the structural building blocks are held together by comparatively weak van der Waals forces this precludes charge transport in delocalized valence and conduction bands. Instead, charge carriers are localized at molecular entities, e.g. oligomers or segments of a conjugated polymer chain and move by incoherent hopping among adjacent sites with statistically variable energies. Quite often the site energies feature a Gaussian distribution. Also the hopping distances can vary statistically (positional disorder). A consequence of the energetic broadening of the density of states (DOS) distribution is that charge motion is both temperature and field dependent and the charge carrier mobility can be several orders of magnitude lower than in an equivalent crystalline system. This disorder effect on charge carrier motion is diminished in organic field-effect transistors because current flow is confined in a thin layer. Therefore, the tail states of the DOS distribution are already filled so that the activation energy for charge carrier hopping is diminished. For this reason the charge carrier mobility inferred from FET experiments is always higher than that determined from TOF experiments. In organic semiconductors charge carriers couple to vibrational modes and are referred to as polarons. Therefore, the activation energy for hopping motion contains an additional term due to structural site relaxation upon charging a molecular entity. It turns out, however, that usually the disorder contribution to the temperature dependence of the mobility dominates over the polaronic contribution.

Construction and early career The first Sunfish (SS-281) was laid down on 25 September 1941 by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California; launched on 2 May 1942; sponsored by Mrs. J. W. Fowler; and commissioned on 15 July 1942, Comdr. R. W. Peterson in command. Sunfish held her shakedown in the San Diego Bay area and returned to San Francisco for post-shakedown availability. On 26 October, she stood out to sea en route to the Pacific war zone.  First and second war patrols, November 1942 ‚Äì April 1943  She arrived at Pearl Harbor, T.H., on 1 November, and departed on her first war patrol on 23 November. Her assigned patrol area was off the coasts of Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç, Japan. The submarine laid a minefield at the entrance to Iseno Imi on the night of 16 December ‚Äì 17 December. On 18 December, she fired a spread of torpedoes at a transport Kyowa Maru and damaged her. The patrol ended on 14 January 1943, upon her return to Midway Island. Sunfish began her second patrol on 4 February, which took her into the East China Sea. She attacked a ship on the night of 4 March, but the first spread missed the target. Three stern shots gave her the satisfaction of seeing flames shoot up from the target. Two days later, a transport was fired at with a four-torpedo spread, and three explosions were heard. When the submarine raised her periscope, destroyer screws passed over the conning tower. Close depth charges loosened bolts and temporarily extinguished the lights, but no serious damage was suffered. On the night of 13 March, Sunfish launched three torpedoes at a cargo ship in the approaches to Takarajima (Toro Shima in DANFS) in . They ran true, and the 3,262-ton Kosei Maru went under.Position in reference is southeast of the island. Kosei Maru was built as the World War I era Emergency Fleet Corporation Design 1023 type Buffalo Bridge (O/N 218821) in 1919 by Submarine Boat Corporation, Newark, N.J. sold to Japan. The submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 April.  Third and fourth war patrols, May ‚Äì September 1943  Her third patrol was made from 4 May to 24 June in the shipping lanes near Truk Atoll. No enemy shipping was found, so Sunfish reconnoitered Anguar Island on 23 May and shelled a refinery on Fais Island five days later. From 28 July to 25 September, Sunfish sought targets in waters off Formosa. In two attacks on 13 August, she left a tanker down by the stern and witnessed a second ship explode, sending flames high. This signified the end of the converted gunboat Edo Maru. In the early-morning hours of 4 September, Sunfish dodged between lighted sampans to attack a 10-ship convoy. The Kozon Maru went down after a terrific secondary explosion.  Fifth and sixth war patrols, October 1943 ‚Äì March 1944  Sunfish refitted at Pearl Harbor and sailed on 16 October for an area northeast of Formosa. No worthy targets were found, and she returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 December 1943. On 14 January 1944, Sunfish got underway to prowl the shipping lanes between the Caroline and Mariana Islands. She made a photographic reconnaissance of Kusaie and another atoll in the Carolines between 21 January and 30 January. On 23 February, the submarine made four determined attacks on a convoy and sank Kunishima Maru and Shinyubari Maru for a total of 9,437 tons of enemy shipping. When she returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 March, she was routed onward to San Francisco for an overhaul.  Seventh and eighth war patrols, June ‚Äì September 1944  When the overhaul was completed in early June, Sunfish returned to Pearl Harbor and was ordered to begin a patrol on 22 June in the Kuril Islands area. She sank the passenger-cargo ship Shanmai Maru on the night of 5 July. The next day, the submarine destroyed a fleet of 14 sampans and trawlers with her deck guns. A Soviet merchant ship, the Ob, was sunk by Sunfish on 6 July.Axis History Forum The 6,284-ton cargo ship Taihei Maru was torpedoed and sunk on the morning of 9 July. Sunfish steamed to Midway for a refit period from 1 August to 19 August. Sunfish began her eighth war patrol on 20 August when she departed Midway for the Yellow Sea. On 10 September she intercepted a convoy coming out of Tsushima Strait and sank Chihaya Maru and damaged several other targets. On the night of 13 September, another convoy was sighted. Etashima Maru was sunk and Sunfish claimed damage to other targets, including one ship left with her decks awash. The patrol ended at Pearl Harbor on 27 September.  Ninth war patrol, October ‚Äì December 1944  Sunfish returned to the Yellow Sea on 23 October as part of a ‚Äúwolf pack‚Äù that included and . On 17 November, the Sunfish sighted a convoy of eight ships led by the 21,000-ton escort carrier Shinyo. The carrier quickly passed out of range, and word was flashed to the other two members of the pack. Sunfish attacked the remaining ships of the convoy and sank two troopships, with 2,113 killed, and with 448 killed. Spadefish caught Shinyo with four torpedoes and sent her under with 1,130 sailors killed. The running battle continued, and Peto sank Aisakasan Maru and Chinkai Maru, while Spadefish added Submarine Chaser No. 156 to the score. On 29 November, Spadefish sank Daiboshi Maru and the next day, Sunfish sank the transport Dairen Maru. The patrol terminated at Majuro, Marshall Islands, on 19 December 1944 after the coordinated attacks had sunk 59,000 tons of Japanese shipping on a single patrol.  Tenth and eleventh war patrols, January ‚Äì April 1945  Sunfish stood out of Majuro on 15 January 1945 to patrol in the East China and Yellow Seas. However, she had to terminate the patrol on 20 February when a collision with an unsighted ice floe bent both periscopes. The ship entered Apra Harbor, Guam, on 27 February, for refit and repairs. Sunfish began her 11th, and last, war patrol on 31 March 1945 off Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç. She operated in the approaches to Ominato in April. On the 9th, a ship was damaged, but managed to speed away and enter a protected harbor. Five days later, Sunfish launched three torpedoes at a merchantman; but all missed. The submarine carried out a daylight attack on 16 April, which resulted in the sinking of Manryu Maru, a transport, and the frigate Coast Defense Vessel No. 73. Her last torpedoes were expended three days later in night-radar attacks, sinking Kaiho Maru and Taisei Maru. Sunfish returned to Pearl Harbor on 28 April and departed for the United States two days later. Sunfish was in the Mare Island Naval Shipyard from 7 May to 31 July for an overhaul and returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 August. She was preparing for another patrol when hostilities with Japan ceased. The submarine sailed out of Pearl Harbor on 29 August en route to the West Coast. She arrived at Mare Island on 5 September for inactivation, and was decommissioned there on 26 December 1945. She was the first submarine of the Gato class to be decommissioned after the war. Sunfish remained out of commission, serving as a classroom for naval reserve units until she was struck from the Navy List on 1 May 1960. Sunfish received nine battle stars for World War II.

Rustic capitals () is an ancient Roman calligraphic script. Because the term is negatively connoted supposing an opposition to the more 'civilized' form of the Roman square capitals, Bernhard Bischoff prefers to call the script canonized capitals.  History  The script was used between the 1st century and the 9th century, most often between the 4th and 6th centuries. After the 5th century, rustic capitals began to fall out of use, but they continued to be used as a display script in titles and headings, along with uncial as the script of the main text.  Structure  Rustic capitals are similar to Roman square capitals, but are less rigid, influenced more by pen and ink writing on papyrus or parchment than the writing used for inscriptions. The letters are thinner and more compressed, use many more curved lines than do square capitals, and have descenders extending below the baseline.  Grammar  The scripts written in rustic capitals utilize punctus marks (dots which are placed between the words) to denote word separation, contrary to the common practice of scriptura continua (the continuous writing of words without any form of separation see Uncial Script).  Surviving works  Roman brushed capitals: Capitalis rustica About fifty manuscripts with rustic capitals survive, including four copies of works by Virgil (including the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus), one copy of a work by Terence, and one of a work by Prudentius.

It is a version of Hamburg steak.  Background  Hamburg steak is known by the name \\"Frikadelle\\" in Germany since (at least) the 17th century. Hamburg was a common embarcation point for transatlantic voyages during the first half of the 19th century and New York City was the most common destination. Various New York restaurants offered Hamburg-style American fillet, or even beefsteak √† Hambourgeoise. Early American preparations of minced beef were therefore made to fit the tastes of European immigrants. Salisbury steak Coming from this history of ground meat dishes is the Salisbury steak, which today is usually served with a gravy similar in texture to brown sauce. James Salisbury (1823‚Äì1905), an American physician and chemist, advocated for a meat-centered diet to promote health, and the term Salisbury steak has been used in the United States since 1897. Dr. Salisbury recommended this recipe (somewhat different from modern Salisbury steak recipes) for the treatment of alimentation (digestive problems):  U.S. standards of identity (for packaged product)  United States Department of Agriculture standardsFood Standards and Labeling Policy, USDA , FSIS, September 2005, p. 165 for processed, packaged \\"Salisbury steak\\" require a minimum content of 65% meat, of which up to 25% can be pork, except if de- fatted beef or pork is used, the limit is 12% combined.

A leader in the early days of the US Air Force, he was a renowned expert in tactical nuclear warfare, NATO, and military long range planning. In his early career he is known for his involvement in the World War II Laconia incident, where the actions taken by order of Richardson have been identified as a prima facie war crime. Under the conventions of war, ships engaged in rescue operations (including submarines) are held immune from attack.Summary of the below sections Early career Richardson was born in Rockford, Illinois. In 1932, he attended the Gunnery School in Washington, Connecticut, and in 1933, entered Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1935. He received a congressional appointment from Pennsylvania to the United States Military Academy and graduated in June 1939. He joined the expanding US Army Air Forces attending pilot training schools in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Randolph and Kelly fields, Texas, graduating in June 1940. In July 1940, he was assigned as a flight instructor at Randolph Field flying AT-6 Texan and AT-7 Navigator training aircraft and subsequently in the advanced twin-engine school at Barksdale Field, flying Martin B-10 bombers. In September 1941, he was transferred to the 52nd Fighter Group, Selfridge Field, served as squadron commander and group operations officer flying P-40 Warhawk pursuit aircraft, and went with the Group to Norfolk, Virginia, and Florence, South Carolina. On Ascension Island In April 1942, he took command of the 1st Composite Squadron, a unit of 18 P-39 Airacobras pursuit aircraft and five B-25 Mitchell bombers being organized at Key Field, Meridian, Mississippi. He deployed, in August 1942, to the newly constructed and secret Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. Their function was to patrol the sea around the island, to detect and destroy any enemy submarines and surface raiders, and to protect Allied ships in the vicinity of the island. Wideawake Airfield was a key refueling base on the only air resupply route in 1942‚Äì1943 connecting the United States to the Allied Western Desert Campaign raging in North Africa and the Soviet forces through the Persian Gulf and the Caucuses.\\"Egypt‚ÄìLibya Campaign, The US Army Campaigns of World War II\\" US Army Historical Pamphlet CMH Pub 72‚Äì13 The air route stretched from Florida and Texas across the Caribbean region, down the South American east coast to Natal and Recife Brazil, across the South Atlantic through Ascension Island to the British and Belgian colonies in West Africa, across the bottom of the Sahara Desert to Khartoum Sudan, and up the Nile to Egypt and Allied forces in the Middle East and beyond. This was the only way to get large-to-medium aircraft and urgent military supplies to Allied forces in Egypt (specifically Ninth Air Force supporting US Army Forces in the Middle East) in the Allied 1943 Egypt‚ÄìLibya Campaign leading up to the defeat of Rommel and securing North Africa following Operation Torch and the Tunisia Campaign in late 1943.\\"Principal Foreign Transport and Ferrying Routes, Army Air Forces ‚Äì 30 June 1942, Fanita Lanier 1947\\" found in Craven and Cate, AAF in World War II series Principal Atlantic air transport and ferrying routes, 1943 Laconia incident RMS Laconia On early 15 September 1942, while senior operations officer at Ascension, then-Captain Richardson was notified by the island's British liaison that had been torpedoed. Later that morning a transiting A-20 reported sighting and taking fire from two German U-boats. Two dispatched B-25 bombers found neither the submarines nor Laconia. Later that night at about 10 p.m., Richardson was asked to assist in rescue efforts by providing air cover for the en route merchant ships, the nearby Empire Haven and HMS Corinthian at Takoorida. The next day a transiting B-24D Liberator from the 343rd Bombardment Squadron was sent to investigate and found four U-boats displaying the Red Cross flag engaged in rescue operations from the sinking of Laconia. U-boat commander, Lieutenant Commander Werner Hartenstein, had secured permission to conduct rescue operations after discovering that the ship he had just torpedoed, RMS Laconia, carried 1,800 Italian prisoners, a few hundred British and Polish soldiers, plus some number of civilians including women and children, British dependents from Egypt. U-156 was crammed above and below decks with nearly two hundred survivors, including five women, and had another 200 in tow aboard four lifeboats. On 16 September at 11:25 a.m., U-156 was spotted by an American B-24 Liberator bomber flying from a secret airbase on Ascension Island. The submarine was travelling with a Red Cross flag draped across her gun deck. Hartenstein signalled to the pilot in both Morse code and English requesting assistance. A British RAF officer also messaged the aircraft: \\"Laconia survivors on board, soldiers, civilians, women, children\\" Lieutenant James D. Harden of the US Army Air Forces did not respond to the messages, and turned away and notified his base of the situation. The senior officer on duty that day, Captain Robert C. Richardson III, who claimed later that he did not know that this was a Red Cross- sanctioned German rescue operation, ordered the B-24 to \\"sink the sub\\". The patrolling bomber loaded with depth charges and bombs reported that the submarine had a white flag with a red cross and they had unsuccessfully challenged the submarine via radio to display its national flag. The submarine blinked via signal light what the bomber crew understood to read \\"German Sir\\". The bomber crew asked Ascension Island what to do next. The order given by Richardson has been called a prima facie war crime. Under the conventions of war at sea any ship engaged in rescue operations, including submarines, are held immune from attack. The conduct of the aircraft commander appears to be entirely inexcusable since he must have observed the rescue operation. During the time that they are engaged in such an operation, enemy submarines are no longer lawful objects of attack. The fact that the US Army Air Force took no action to investigate this incident, and that no trials took place under the then-effective domestic criminal code, the Articles of War, is a serious reflection on the entire chain of military command. This action became known as the \\"Laconia incident\\", and led Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, chief of German Submarine Operations, to issue the \\"Laconia Order\\" to his U-boat commanders that stated in part \\"No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing members of ships sunk ...\\" At the end of the war, the Laconia Order was unsuccessfully used against Admiral D√∂nitz in his war crime trial, because Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz testified that in the war with Japan the US Navy had followed the same general policy as was set forth in the German admiral's directive.\\"Origin of the Laconia Order\\" by Dr. Maurer Maurer and Lawrence Paszezk, Air University Review, March‚ÄìApril 1964, Pg 36 The Laconia Incident showed how a small tactical decision can have strategic impact across history.The Laconia section is based on two secondary histories compiled from primary historical documents and interviews with survivors and participants of the affair ‚Äì 1) the below referenced Air University article by Dr. Maurer and Pasczezk, and 2) the book The Laconia Affair by Leonce Peillard Back to the United States and on to Europe While on Ascension Island, then-Major Richardson boasted, over drinks, to a visiting Air Staff team that he could successfully ferry a group of P-38 Lightnings via the South Atlantic air route. In March 1943, Richardson was ordered back to the United States as the project officer and flight leader to make good his boast that he could ferry P-38 Lightnings to North Africa via the South Atlantic. In April 1943, he successfully delivered 52 of the original 53 aircraft to Morocco to reinforce US air forces supporting Operation TORCH.Comments in USAF Oral History Interview (K239.0512-1560), pp. 27‚Äì28. From there he was assigned back to the United States as chief of the Aircraft Division, and later as chief of the Fighter Division, Army Air Force Board, Orlando, Florida where he had the opportunity to test fly a number of the experimental aircraft to include the XP-59A, Airacomet, the first US jet fighter, then undergoing testing at Muroc Army Air Field. In July 1944, he was reassigned to the Operations Division, Headquarters US Strategic Air Force in Europe. He spent the first month touring European fighter units briefing them on what he learned from flying the XP-59A, Airacomet, and on suggested tactics to use against the new German jet aircraft. He then served as an action officer in General Carl Spaatz's headquarters in London and Paris through December 1944 where he coordinated what new equipment and weapons coming from the CONUS based Army Force Board with what the European combat units said they needed and experienced. In January 1945, he transferred to the Operations Division of Headquarters, IX Tactical Air Command, Ninth Air Force. In April 1945, he assumed command of the 365th Fighter Group, \\"The Hell Hawks,\\" at Fritzlar, Germany. He led the unit in their support of the General Patton's final push into Germany then transitioned the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter group from wartime to peacetime operations. Upon the redeployment of the 365th Fighter Group back to the United States in September 1945, he remained in the Occupation Forces as chief of the Aircraft Allocation Division, Headquarters, US Air Forces in Europe. In February 1946, he became assistant chief of staff for operations, European Air Transport Service where it was his task to round up, account for, and dispose of all the US aircraft in the European Theater as the US Army Air Forces rapidly demobilized and sent units back to the United States.Comments in USAF Oral History Interview (K239.0512-1560), pp. 43‚Äì52. Evolving into a strategic long-range planner In June 1946, then-Lieutenant Colonel Richardson was assigned to the War Plans Division of the Air Staff in Washington, D.C. In July 1947, he was transferred to the Joint War Plans Committee, which in December 1947, upon implementation of the 1947 Unification Act, became Joint Strategic Plans Group, Joint Chiefs of Staff. Upon creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in 1949, newly promoted Colonel Richardson became the first Air Force planner on the NATO Standing Group. NATO years As one of the original NATO war planners, he prepared the European Theater war plans on how to counter a potential Cold War invasion by the overwhelming Soviet land forces that outnumbered US and NATO conventional forces by a factor of 10-to-1. He worked the negotiation of an agreement for Germany's rearmament and for the establishment of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE) in Paris France. In February 1951, Richardson accompanied General Lauris Norstad to Europe as a member of his planning staff. In July 1951, he was designated as the US Joint Chiefs of Staff representative and military observer to the European Defense Community Treaty Conference in Paris. In July 1953, he was assigned to the Plans Staff of the Air Deputy, SHAPE, when responsibility for US military advice to the European Defense Community was transferred from the US Ambassador to the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. From July 1953 to July 1955, Richardson was special assistant to Air Vice-Marshal Edmund Hudleston, Royal Air Force, Deputy Chief of Staff/Operations SHAPE, and later, the deputy director/policy, Headquarters SHAPE, serving primarily as the US Air Force member of the Inter-Allied Planning Committee (New Approach Group) that developed the concept for an atomic defense of Europe. In that capacity he wrote the original NATO atomic or nuclear war plans and became one of the US military's leading authorities on tactical nuclear warfare, strategy, and concepts.Comments in USAF Oral History Interview (K239.0512-1560), pp. 85‚Äì109, In July 1955, Richardson returned to the United States to attend the National War College, graduating in June 1956. He assumed command of the 83rd Fighter Wing (redesignated 4th Fighter Wing) flying F-86H Sabre and re-opened Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. Atomic weapons and the evolution of theater nuclear warfare From his experience thinking of and drafting NATO's nuclear war plans under President Eisenhower's emphasis on atomic defense to counter Soviet conventional superiority led him in 1955 to publish a series of articles on nuclear and atomic warfare in the Air University Review.\\"Atomic Weapons and Theater Warfare\\" (four articles) Air University Review, winter and spring 1955 As a result, Richardson had become an acknowledged military expert in nuclear warfare and a regular lecturer on the subject at the National Defense College and Air War College. In January 1958, he was transferred to Headquarters US Air Force, to become assistant for Long Range Objectives to the deputy chief of staff/plans and programs. He was promoted to brigadier general in May 1960. With the installation of the new Kennedy Administration, Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara directed the dismantlement of the Air Force and Navy long range plans staffs and ordered the services' long range planning experts out of Washington and into the field. This along with imposing a more restrictive editorial policy on the military services' strategy journals removed the services' key thinkers from the Washington debates arising from the administration's new strategic direction with regard to military procurement and military strategy development.Comments in USAF Oral History Interview (K239.0512-1560), pp. 137‚Äì142. As a result, in June 1961, Richardson was transferred to the Military Assistance Division, Headquarters US European Command, Paris, France, and upon arrival was detailed by General Norstad as director of operations for Live Oak, the Tripartite Berlin Plans and Operations Group air force team that coordinated and executed the NATO air responses to the Soviet attempts close down the Berlin air corridors during the Berlin Crisis. Upon termination of the Berlin Crisis, Richardson was assigned as deputy standing group representative, NATO, effective 1 January 1962 through 1 January 1964. Air Force System Command and strategic acquisition development AFSC Logo Given Secretary of Defense McNamara's known hostility toward any military service long-range planning and to Richardson's strategic thinking, the Air Force assigned Richardson to Headquarters Air Force Systems Command, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. He served as assistant to the commander, then assistant deputy chief of staff for plans, and in August 1965, he was assigned as the deputy chief of staff for science and technology. On 31 July 1966, he reported to Field Command, Defense Atomic Support Agency. His final military assignment was to Headquarters Field Command, Defense Atomic Support Agency, Sandia Base, New Mexico, as deputy commander for weapons and training where he was responsible for managing atomic weapon development and training activities and the nuclear weapons stockpile. Defense policy consultant and learning to influence public policy Richardson retired from active duty on 1 August 1967 and began his second career as a writer, lecturer, and consultant on defense issues, nuclear strategy, and aerospace technology management. He joined his long-time friend and former AFSC commander, General Bernard Adolph Schriever, as a senior associate with Schriever & McKee Associate Consultants to bring his aerospace and systems management expertise to bear on the issues facing urban America. In the 1970s, Richardson greatly expanded his work as an author, lecturer, and policy advocate in the areas of national security, defense theory, defense policy formulation, nuclear strategy, defense technology acquisition, and long range planning. During this decade, he actively advocated conservative viewpoints regarding defense and national security public policy issues serving as: * consultant to American Enterprise Institute * assistant editor for Journal of International Security * member of the American Security Council * executive director, American Foreign Policy Institute * secretary- treasurer for Security and Intelligence Fund * co-chairman of the Coalition for Peace Through Defense As recognized authority on tactical nuclear warfare and defense technology acquisition, he also served as consultant to Los Alamos National Laboratory (1971‚Äì1979), US and European aerospace industries, and Stanford Research Institute. High frontier and the space-based missile defense Strategic Defense Initiative logo In 1981, Richardson teamed up with Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham on a Heritage Foundation project called High Frontier to formulate a long-term national strategy and plan to build a US space-based missile defense. This plan was the foundation for President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.Confessions of a Cold Warrior, Chapter 14, Richardson went on to serve as deputy directory for the High Frontier non-profit organization from 1981 to 2003 that not only advocated the maximum use of US space technology for missile defense but also for the industrial and commercial use of space. Over the two decades he was with High Frontier, Richardson successfully advocated for President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, established the Space Transportation Association, advocated the single-stage-to-orbit (or SSTO) vehicle as a follow-on to the Space Shuttle, and more recently, helped develop a long-term strategy to colonize the Moon.Interview w/ Amd Cooper, current Director High Frontier Notable publications * \\"Atomic Weapons and War Damage,\\" ORBIS, spring 1960; * \\"Do We Need Unlimited Forces for Limited War,\\" Air Force Magazine, March 1959; * \\"Forces in Being ‚Äì The Weapons,\\" Air Force Magazine, August 1958; * \\"In The Looking Glass,\\" Air University Review, winter 1957‚Äì1958; * \\"Nuclear Stalemate Fallacy,\\" Air Force Magazine, August 1956; * \\"Atomic Weapons and Theater Warfare\\" (four articles) Air University Review, winter and spring 1955; * \\"The US Air Force and NATO,\\" Air University Review, winter 1952‚Äì1953; * \\"Defense on the Technological Front,\\" Air Force Magazine, June 1966.

It is one of the six muscles in the lateral rotator group. It was first named by Adriaan van den Spiegel, a professor from the University of Padua in the 16th century. Structure The piriformis muscle originates from the anterior (front) part of the sacrum, the part of the spine in the gluteal region, and from the superior margin of the greater sciatic notch (as well as the sacroiliac joint capsule and the sacrotuberous ligament). It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen to insert on the greater trochanter of the femur. Its tendon often joins with the tendons of the superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and obturator internus muscles prior to insertion. The piriformis is a flat muscle, pyramidal in shape, lying almost parallel with the posterior margin of the gluteus medius. It is situated partly within the pelvis against its posterior wall, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. It arises from the front of the sacrum by three fleshy digitations, attached to the portions of bone between the first, second, third, and fourth anterior sacral foramina, and to the grooves leading from the foramina: a few fibers also arise from the margin of the greater sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the sacrotuberous ligament. The muscle passes out of the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, the upper part of which it fills, and is inserted by a rounded tendon into the upper border of the greater trochanter behind, but often partly blended with, the common tendon of the obturator internus and superior and inferior gemellus muscles.  Variation  In 17% of people, the piriformis muscle is pierced by parts or all of the sciatic nerve. Several variations occur, but the most common type of anomaly (81% of anomalies) is the Beaton's type B which is when the common peroneal nerve pierces the piriformis muscle. It may be united with the gluteus medius, send fibers to the gluteus minimus, or receive fibers from the superior gemellus. It may have one or two sacral attachments; or it may be inserted into the capsule of the hip joint.  Function The piriformis muscle is part of the lateral rotators of the hip, along with the quadratus femoris, gemellus inferior, gemellus superior, obturator externus, and obturator internus. The piriformis laterally rotates the femur with hip extension and abducts the femur with hip flexion. Abduction of the flexed thigh is important in the action of walking because it shifts the body weight to the opposite side of the foot being lifted, which prevents falling. The action of the lateral rotators can be understood by crossing the legs to rest an ankle on the knee of the other leg. This causes the femur to rotate and point the knee laterally. The lateral rotators also oppose medial rotation by the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. When the hip is flexed to 90 degrees, piriformis abducts the femur at the hip and reverses primary function, internally rotating the hip when the hip is flexed at 90 degrees or more. (Netter's Clinical Anatomy, 2010)  Clinical significance Piriformis syndrome occurs when the piriformis irritates the sciatic nerve, which comes into the gluteal region beneath the muscle, causing pain in the buttocks and referred pain along the sciatic nerve. This referred pain is known as sciatica. Seventeen percent of the population has their sciatic nerve coursing through the piriformis muscle. This subgroup of the population is predisposed to developing sciatica. Sciatica can be described by pain, tingling, or numbness deep in the buttocks and along the sciatic nerve. Sitting down, stretching, climbing stairs, and performing squats usually increases pain. Diagnosing the syndrome is usually based on symptoms and on the physical exam. More testing, including MRIs, X-rays, and nerve conduction tests can be administered to exclude other possible diseases. If diagnosed with piriformis syndrome, the first treatment involves progressive stretching exercises, massage therapy (including neuromuscular therapy) and physical treatment. Corticosteroids can be injected into the piriformis muscle if pain continues. Findings suggest the possibility that Botulinum toxin type B may be of potential benefit in the treatment of pain attributed to piriformis syndrome. A more invasive, but sometimes necessary treatment involves surgical exploration; however, the side effects of the surgery could be much worse than alternative treatments such as physical therapy. Surgery should always be a last resort. Landmark The piriformis is a very important landmark in the gluteal region. As it travels through the greater sciatic foramen, it effectively divides it into an inferior and superior part. This determines the name of the vessels and nerves in this region ‚Äì the nerve and vessels that emerge superior to the piriformis are the superior gluteal nerve and superior gluteal vessels. Inferiorly, it is the same, and the sciatic nerve also travels inferiorly to the piriformis.

It is a type of current collector. The use of overhead wire in a system of current collection is reputed to be the 1880 invention of Frank J. Sprague, but the first working trolley pole was developed and demonstrated by Charles Van Depoele, in autumn 1885.Middleton, William D. (1967). The Time of the Trolley, pp. 63‚Äì65, 67. Milwaukee: Kalmbach Publishing. . Origin of the term Machining spare trolley pole wheels The term \\"trolley\\", also used to describe the pole or the passenger car using the trolley pole, is derived from the grooved conductive wheel attached to the end of the pole that \\"trolls\\" the overhead wire. The term \\"trolley\\" predates the invention of the trolley pole. The earliest electric cars did not use a pole, but rather a system in which each tramcar dragged behind it an overhead cable connected to a small cart ‚Äì or \\"troller\\" ‚Äì that rode on a \\"track\\" of overhead wires. From the side, the dragging lines made the car seem to be \\"trolling\\", as in fishing. If the troller cart were to derail from the overhead wire, it would fall with a loud crash onto the roof of the tramcar and be troublesome to reposition; these drawbacks prompted a search for better ways to connect to the power wire. Later, when a pivoted pole replaced the troller, it came to be known as a \\"trolley pole\\". An early development of an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario was built in 1883, having been developed by John Joseph Wright, brother of swindler Whitaker Wright. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of electric railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no evidence about this. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent. Credit for development of the first working trolley pole is given to Charles Joseph Van Depoele, a Belgian engineer who moved to the United States in 1869. Van Depoele made the first public demonstration of the spring-loaded device on a temporary streetcar line installed at the Toronto Industrial Exhibition (now the CNE) in autumn 1885. Depoele's first trolley pole was \\"crude\\" and not very reliable, and he reverted to using the troller system of current collection for a commercial installation on a streetcar system in South Bend, Indiana, which opened on November 14, 1885, and on one in Montgomery, Alabama, in April 1886. However, within a few months, Van Depoele switched to the trolley-pole system for the Montgomery operation. Van Depoele and fellow inventor Frank J. Sprague were \\"working on similar ideas at about the same time\\",Middleton (1967), p. 67. and Sprague employed trolley-pole current collection on an electric streetcar system he installed in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888, also improving the trolley pole wheel and pole designs. Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888. Trolley pole wheel on Twin City Rapid Transit Company No. 1300 The grooved trolley wheel was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was generally used on systems with \\"old\\" style round cross sectional overhead wire. The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved wheel bearing on the underside of the overhead wire provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing overhead wire wear . The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly \\"figure 8\\" cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Curiously, Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978. Although a streetcar with a trolley wheel may evoke an antique look, the trolley shoe is modern and more practical as well as economical. Description of the device A trolley pole is not attached to the overhead wire. The pole sits atop a sprung base on the roof of the vehicle, with springs providing the pressure to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. If the pole is made of wood, a cable brings the electric current down to the vehicle. A metal pole may use such a cable, or may itself be electrically \\"live\\", requiring the base to be insulated from the vehicle body. Modern trolley poles as installed on Vancouver's low-floor trolley buses On systems with double-ended tram cars capable of running in both directions, the trolley pole must always be pulled behind the car and not pushed, or \\"dewiring\\" is very likely, which can cause damage to the overhead wires. At terminus points, the conductor must turn the trolley pole around to face the correct direction, pulling it off the wire either with a rope or a pole and walking it around to the other end. In some cases, two trolley poles are provided, one for each direction: in this case it is a matter of raising one and lowering the other. Since the operator could raise the pole at one end whilst the conductor lowered the other, this saved time and was much easier for the conductor. Care had to be taken to raise the downed pole first, to eliminate the damage caused by arcing between the pole and wire. In the US, the dual-pole system was the most common arrangement on double-ended vehicles. However, pushing of the pole (called \\"back-poling\\" in the US or \\"spear-poling\\" in Australia), was quite common where the trams were moving at slow speeds, such as at wye terminals (also known as reversers) and whilst backing into the sheds. Trolley retrievers on the back of a 1949 trolleybus Trolley poles are usually raised and lowered manually by a rope from the back of the vehicle. The rope feeds into a spring reel mechanism, called a \\"trolley catcher\\" or \\"trolley retriever\\". The trolley catcher contains a detent, like that in an automotive shoulder safety belt, which \\"catches\\" the rope to prevent the trolley pole from flying upward if the pole is dewired. The similar looking retriever (see photo) adds a spring mechanism that yanks the pole downward if it should leave the wire, pulling it away from all overhead wire fittings. Catchers are commonly used on trams operating at lower speeds, as in a city, whilst retrievers are used on suburban and interurban lines to limit damage to the overhead at speed. On some older systems, the poles were raised and lowered using a long pole with a metal hook. Where available, these may have been made of bamboo due to its length, natural straightness and strength, combined with its relative light weight and the fact that it is an insulator. Trolleybuses usually carried one with the vehicle, for use in the event of dewirement, but tram systems usually had them placed along the route at locations where the trolley pole would need reversing. The poles used on trolleybuses are typically longer than those used on trams, to allow the bus to take fuller advantage of its not being restricted to a fixed path in the street (the rails), by giving a degree of lateral steerability, enabling the trolleybus to board passengers at curbside. Single- and double-pole usage When used on a tram or trolley car (i.e. a railway vehicle), a single trolley pole usually collects current from the overhead wire, and the steel rails on the tracks act as the electrical return. To reduce electrolytic corrosion of underground pipes and metallic structures, most tram lines are operated with the wire positive with respect to the rails. Trolleybuses, on the other hand, must use two trolley poles and dual overhead wires, one pole and wire for the positive \\"live\\" current, the other for the negative or neutral return. The tramway system in Havana, Cuba, also utilized the dual-wire system,Morrison, Allen (1996). Latin America by Streetcar: A Pictorial Survey of Urban Rail Transport South of the U.S.A., p. 55. New York: Bonde Press. . as did the Cincinnati, Ohio streetcar system. Decline in usage on railways Pantograph(left) and trolley pole in use on Queens Quay West, Toronto All trolleybuses use trolley poles, and thus trolley poles remain in use worldwide, wherever trolleybuses are in operation (some 315 cities ),Webb, Mary (ed.) (2011). Jane's Urban Transport Systems 2011‚Äì2012, p. \\"[23]\\" (in foreword). Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): Jane's Information Group. . and several manufacturers continue to make them, including Vossloh-Kiepe, ≈†koda and Lekov. However, on most railway vehicles using overhead wire, the trolley pole has given way to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions. Apart from heritage streetcar lines, very few tram/streetcar systems worldwide continue to use trolley poles on vehicles used in normal service. Among the largest exceptions are the streetcar systems of Toronto, Ontario; Philadelphia (the \\"Subway- Surface\\" lines and Route 15); Riga, Latvia (however, new ≈†koda trams in Riga have pantographs); Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India; and Alexandria, Egypt. Smaller systems still using trolley poles for regular service include Hong Kong Tramways, the Daugavpils, Latvia system, and Rio de Janeiro's Santa Teresa Tramway. The MBTA system of Boston still uses trolley poles with the PCC streetcars it uses to serve the Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High Speed Line.  Compatibility with pantographs  switch in Toronto: Two runners for pantographs flank the trolley pole frog. Trams or light rail cars equipped with pantographs normally cannot operate on lines with overhead wiring designed for trolley-pole collection. For this reason, these systems and a few others worldwide retain use of trolley poles, even on new streetcars, in order to avoid the difficulty and expense of modifying long stretches of existing overhead wires to accept pantographs. However, the Toronto Transit Commission, with the impending replacement of its legacy CLRV and ALRV with new Flexity Outlook cars, is converting its overhead power supply to be compatible with both trolley poles and pantographs on an interim basis, as the CLRVs and ALRVs use only trolley poles while the Flexity fleet is equipped for both trolley poles and pantographs. Starting September 12, 2017, streetcars on route 509 Harbourfront started to use pantographs while those on route 510 Spadina continued to use trolley poles along the same section of track on Queens Quay West. (On May 14, 2018, 510 Spadina switched to pantographs.) Cultural references Classic PCC streetcars with trolley poles are still used in Boston; Upon their introduction, trolley poles and the new electrical technology they represented were fascinating to writers, with their lightning- like sparks and power. In January 1889, Boston introduced its first electric streetcars, which became so popular and noteworthy that poet Oliver Wendell Holmes composed a verse about the new trolley pole technology, and the sparking contact shoe at its apex: In 1947, composer Samuel Barber wrote the now-classic orchestral and vocal piece Knoxville: Summer of 1915, based on the childhood reminiscences of James Agee. Partway through the composition, the singer refers to a noisy passing streetcar, with its overhead trolley pole and sparks: See also * Current collectors ** Collector pole ** Contact shoe * Railway electrification system References Category:Tram technology Category:American inventions Category:Locomotive parts Category:Electric rail transport ja:ÈõÜÈõªË£ÖÁΩÆ#„Éà„É≠„É™„Éº„Éù„Éº„É´ ","title":"Trolley pole"},{"id":"1104401","text":"Piriformis syndrome is a condition which is believed to result from compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle. Symptoms may include pain and numbness in the buttocks and down the leg. Often symptoms are worsened with sitting or running. Causes may include trauma to the gluteal muscle, spasms of the piriformis muscle, anatomical variation, or an overuse injury. Few cases in athletics, however, have been described. Diagnosis is difficult as there is no definitive test. A number of physical exam maneuvers can be supportive. Medical imaging is typically normal. Other conditions that may present similarly include a herniated disc. Treatment may include avoiding activities that cause symptoms, stretching, physiotherapy, and medication such as NSAIDs. Steroid or botulinum toxin injections may be used in those who do not improve. Surgery is not typically recommended. The frequency of the condition is unknown, with different groups arguing it is more or less common. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms include gluteal pain that may radiate down buttock and the leg, and that is made worse in some sitting positions. Pathophysiology When the piriformis muscle shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it can compress or strangle the sciatic nerve beneath the muscle. Generally, conditions of this type are referred to as nerve entrapment or as entrapment neuropathies; the particular condition known as piriformis syndrome refers to sciatica symptoms not originating from spinal roots and/or spinal disc compression, but involving the overlying piriformis muscle. In 17% of an assumed normal population the sciatic nerve passes through the piriformis muscle, rather than underneath it; however, in patients undergoing surgery for suspected piriformis syndrome such an anomaly was found only 16.2% of the time leading to doubt about the importance of the anomaly as a factor in piriformis syndrome. Some researchers discount the importance of this relationship in the etiology of the syndrome. MRI findings have shown that both hypertrophy (unusual largeness) and atrophy (unusual smallness) of the piriformis muscle correlate with the supposed condition. Piriformis syndrome may also be associated with direct trauma to the piriformis muscle, such as in a fall or from a knife wound. Diagnosis Piriformis syndrome occurs when the sciatic nerve is compressed or pinched by the piriformis muscle of the hip. It usually only affects one hip at a given time, though both hips may produce piriformis syndrome at some point in the patient's lifetime, and having had it once greatly increases the chance that it will recur in one hip or the other at some future point unless action is taken to prevent it. Indications include sciatica (radiating pain in the buttock, posterior thigh, and lower leg) and the physical exam finding of tenderness in the area of the sciatic notch. If the piriformis muscle can be located beneath the other gluteal muscles, it will feel noticeably cord-like and will be painful to compress or massage. The pain is exacerbated with any activity that causes flexion of the hip including lifting, prolonged sitting, or walking. The diagnosis is largely clinical and is one of exclusion. During a physical examination, attempts may be made to stretch the irritated piriformis and provoke sciatic nerve compression, such as the Freiberg test, the Pace test, the FABER test (flexion, abduction, external rotation), and the FAIR test (flexion, adduction, internal rotation). Conditions to be ruled out include herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), facet arthropathy, spinal stenosis, and lumbar muscle strain. Diagnostic modalities such as CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, and EMG are mostly useful in excluding other conditions. However, magnetic resonance neurography is a medical imaging technique that can show the presence of irritation of the sciatic nerve at the level of the sciatic notch where the nerve passes under the piriformis muscle. Magnetic resonance neurography is considered \\"investigational/not medically necessary\\" by some insurance companies. Neurography can determine whether or not a patient has a split sciatic nerve or a split piriformis muscle ‚Äì this may be important in getting a good result from injections or surgery. Image guided injections carried out in an open MRI scanner, or other 3D image guidance can accurately relax the piriformis muscle to test the diagnosis. Other injection methods such as blind injection, fluoroscopic guided injection, ultrasound, or EMG guidance can work but are not as reliable and have other drawbacks. Prevention The most common etiology of piriformis syndrome is that resulting from a specific previous injury due to trauma. Large injuries include trauma to the buttocks while \\"micro traumas\\" result from small repeated bouts of stress on the piriformis muscle itself. To the extent that piriformis syndrome is the result of some type of trauma and not neuropathy, such secondary causes are considered preventable, especially those occurring in daily activities: according to this theory, periods of prolonged sitting, especially on hard surfaces, produce minor stress that can be relieved with bouts of standing. An individual's environment, including lifestyle factors and physical activity, determine susceptibility to trauma of any given type. Although empirical research findings on the subject have never been published, many believe that taking sensible precautions during high-impact sports and when working in physically demanding conditions may decrease the risk of experiencing piriformis syndrome, either by forestalling injury to the muscle itself or injury to the nerve root that causes it to spasm. In this vein, proper safety and padded equipment should be worn for protection during any type of regular, firm contact (i.e., American football, etc.). In the workplace, individuals are encouraged to make regular assessments of their surroundings and attempt to recognize those things in one's routine that might produce micro or macro traumas. No research has substantiated the effectiveness of any such routine, however, and participation in one may do nothing but heighten an individual's sense of worry over physical minutiae while have no effect in reducing the likeliness of experiencing or re- experiencing piriformis syndrome. Other suggestions from some researchers and physical therapists have included prevention strategies include warming up before physical activity, practicing correct exercise form, stretching, and doing strength training, though these are often suggested for helping treat or prevent any physical injury and are not piriformis-specific in their approach As with any type of exercise, it is thought that warmups will decrease the risk of injury during flexion or rotation of the hip. Stretching increases range of motion, while strengthening hip adductors and abductors theoretically allows the piriformis to tolerate trauma more readily. However, to the extent that piriformis syndrome is actually related to sciatic nerve pain based in the spine, physically \\"warming up\\" the hip muscles will have no effect in preventing disc herniation and subsequent experience of pain along the sciatic pathway. Hip adduction is a strengthening exercise for the piriformis muscle. A cable attached at the ankle can be used to adduct the hip, bringing the leg in toward the opposite side of the body. The same equipment can also be used for hip abduction, where the leg starts beside the opposing leg and moves out to the side, away from the body. Treatment Immediate though temporary relief of piriformis syndrome can usually be brought about by injection of a local anaesthetic into the piriformis muscle. Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though the use of such medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. Conservative treatment usually begins with stretching exercises, myofascial release, massage, and avoidance of contributory activities such as running, bicycling, rowing, heavy lifting, etc. Some clinicians recommend formal physical therapy, including soft tissue mobilization, hip joint mobilization, teaching stretching techniques, and strengthening of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and biceps femoris to reduce strain on the piriformis. More advanced physical therapy treatment can include pelvic-trochanter isometric stretching, hip abductor, external rotator and extensor strengthening exercises, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and massage physiotherapy of the piriformis muscle region. One study of 14 people with what appeared to be piriformis syndrome indicated that rehabilitation programs that included physical therapy, low doses of muscle relaxants and pain relief medication were effective at alleviating most muscle and nerve pain caused by what the research subjects had been told was piriformis syndrome. However, as this study included very few individuals and did not have a control group not receiving treatment (both serious methodological flaws), it provides no insight as to whether the pain in the piriformis would have simply dissipated on its own without any treatment at all, and is therefore not only uninformative, it may actually be misleading. The injury is considered largely self-limiting and spontaneous recovery is usually on the order of a few days or a week to six weeks or longer if left untreated. Stretching Most practitioners agree that spasm, strain, or pain in any muscle can often be treated by regular stretching exercise of that muscle, no matter the cause of the pain. Stretching is recommended every two to three waking hours. Anterior and posterior movement of the hip joint capsule may help optimize the patient's stretching capacity. The muscle can be manually stretched by applying pressure perpendicular to the long axis of the muscle and parallel to the surface of the buttocks until the muscle is relaxed. Another stretching exercise is to lie on the side opposite of the pain with the hip and knee of the upper leg flexed and adducted towards the ground while the torso is rotated so that the back of the upper shoulder touches the ground. Physical Therapists may suggest stretching exercises that will target the piriformis, but may also include the hamstrings and hip muscles in order to adequately reduce pain and increase range of motion. Patients with piriformis syndrome may also find relief from applications of ice which will help reduce inflammation and so may help limit pressure on the sciatic nerve. This treatment can be helpful when pain starts or immediately after an activity that is likely to cause pain. As the length of time progresses, heat may provide temporary relief from many types of muscle pain and will temporarily increase muscle flexibility. Strengthening Failure of conservative treatments such as stretching and strengthening of the piriformis muscle or a high level of immediate pain intensity may bring into consideration various therapeutic injections such as local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine), anti- inflammatory drugs and/or corticosteroids, botulinum toxin (BTX, Botox), or a combination of the three, all of which have a well-documented effectiveness at relieving muscle-related pain. Injection technique is a significant issue since the piriformis is a very deep seated muscle. A radiologist may assist in this clinical setting by injecting a small dose of medication containing a paralysing agent such as botulinum toxin under high-frequency ultrasound or CT control. This inactivates the piriformis muscle for 3 to 6 months, without resulting in leg weakness or impaired activity. Though the piriformis muscle becomes inactivated, the surrounding muscles quickly take over its role without any noticeable change in strength or gait. Such treatments may be more or less curative (with no return to pain), or may have limited timespans of effectiveness. Surgery For rare cases with unrelenting chronic pain, surgery may be recommended. Surgical release of the piriformis muscle is often effective. Minimal access surgery using newly reported techniques has also proven successful in a large-scale formal outcome published in 2005. As with injections, the deactivated/ excised muscle's role in leg movement is completely compensated for by surrounding hip muscles. Failure of piriformis syndrome treatment may be secondary to an underlying internal obturator muscle injury. Epidemiology Comparison of the average cost of treatment between males and females in 2010 and 2011. The average cost is nearly the same for males within these two years. However, the cost of treatment increased in 2011 for females.Hcupnet.ahrq.gov (2010, 2011) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Comparison of Length of stay between males and females in 2010 and 2011. The number of stay decreased for males in 2011. However, the number of hospital stay for females increased in 2011. Piriformis syndrome (PS) data is often confused with other conditions due to differences in definitions, survey methods and whether or not occupational groups or general population are surveyed. This causes a lack of group harmony about the diagnosis and treatment of PS, affecting its epidemiology. In a study, 0.33% of 1293 patients with low back pain cited an incident for PS. A separate study showed 6% of 750 patients with the same incidence. About 6% - 8% of low back pain occurrences were attributed to PS, though other reports concluded about 5% - 36%. In a survey conducted on the general population, 12.2% - 27% included a lifetime occurrence of PS, while 2.2% - 19.5% showed an annual occurrence. However further studies show that the proportion of the sciatica, in terms of PS, is about 0.1% in orthopaedic practice. This is more common in women with a ratio of 3 to 1 and most likely due to the wider quadriceps femoris muscle angle in the os coxae. Between the years of 1991- 1994, PS was found to be 75% prevalent in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania; 20% in other American urban centers; and 5% in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The common ages of occurrence happen between thirty and forty, and are scarcely found in patients younger than twenty; this has been known to affect all lifestyles. Piriformis syndrome is often left undiagnosed and mistaken with other pains due to similar symptoms with back pain, quadriceps pain, lower leg pain, and buttock pain. These symptoms include tenderness, tingling and numbness initiating in low back and buttock area and then radiating down to the thigh and to the leg. A precise test for piriformis syndrome has not yet been developed and thus hard to diagnose this pain. The pain is often initiated by sitting and walking for a longer period. In 2012, 17.2% of low back pain patients developed piriformis syndrome. Piriformis syndrome does not occur in children, and is mostly seen in women of age between thirty and forty. This is due to hormone changes throughout their life, especially during pregnancy, where muscles around the pelvis, including piriformis muscles, tense up to stabilize the area for birth. In 2011, out of 263 patients between the ages of 45 to 84 treated for piriformis syndrome, 53.3% were female. Females are two times more likely to develop piriformis syndrome than males. Moreover, females had longer stay in hospital during 2011 due to high prevalence of the pain in females. The average cost of treatment was $29,070 for hospitalizing average 4 days.

They are similar in form to desmosomes when visualized by electron microscopy, however, desmosomes attach to adjacent cells. Hemidesmosomes are also comparable to focal adhesions, as they both attach cells to the extracellular matrix. Instead of desmogleins and desmocollins in the extracellular space, hemidesmosomes utilize integrins. Hemidesmosomes are found in epithelial cells connecting the basal epithelial cells to the lamina lucida, which is part of the basal lamina. Hemidesmosomes are also involved in signaling pathways, such as keratinocyte migration or carcinoma cell intrusion.  Structure  Hemidesmosomes can be categorized into two types based on their protein constituents. Type 1 hemidesmosomes are found in stratified and pseudo- stratified epithelium. Type 1 hemidesmosomes have five main elements: integrin Œ±6Œ≤4, plectin in its isoform 1a, i. e. P1a, tetraspanin protein CD151, BPAG1e, or bullous pemphigoid antigen isoform e, and BPAG2 (also known as BP180 or type 17 collagen). Type 1 hemidesmosomes are found in stratified and pseudostratified epithelial tissue. Type 2 hemidesmosomes contain integrin Œ±6Œ≤4 and plectin without the BP antigens. Hemidesmosomes have two membrane- spanning components: Integrin Œ±6Œ≤4 and Plectin 1a. Integrin Œ±6Œ≤4 operates as a laminin-332 receptor. Integrin Œ±6Œ≤4 is composed to two Œ± and Œ≤ subunit dimers. The larger Œ≤4 subunit has domains that bind to fibronectin III and calcium. The Œ±6 subunit binds to extracellular BP180, CD151 and laminin-322. When integrin Œ±6Œ≤4 binds to Plectin 1a and BPAG1, it associates with the keratin intermediate filaments in the cytoskeleton. Hemidesmosomes are linked to keratin by plectin isoform 1a from the plakin protein family. Plectin is a 500 kDa protein with a long, rod-like domain and a domain at the end that contains an intermediate filament binding site. BPAG2, or (bullous pemphigoid antigen 2), is a transmembrane protein that exists adjacent to integrins, BPAG2 has domains that bind to plectin, integrin Œ≤4 subunit in the cytoplasm and integrin Œ±6 and laminin-332 in the extracellular space. CD151, a protein of the tetraspanin superfamily, resides on the cell surface of keratinocytes and vascular endothelium. CD151 aids in hemidesmosome formation. BPAG1e is an antigen with multiple isoforms that binds to integrin Œ±6Œ≤4, BPAG2 and keratin 5 and 14. The main role of BPAG1e is for hemidesmosome stability.  Diseases  Keeping the basal epidermal keratinocytes attached to the basal lamina is vital for skin homeostasis. Genetic or acquired diseases that cause disruption of hemidesmosome components can lead to skin blistering disorders between different layers of the skin. These are collectively coined epidermolysis bullosa, or EB. Typical symptoms include fragile skin, blister development, and erosion from minor physical stress. However, the disease also can manifest as erosions on the cornea, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, esophagus, muscular dystrophy and muscular deformity. Mutations in 12 different genes that code for parts of the hemidesmosome have led to epidermolysis bullosa. There are three types of EB: EB simplex (EBS), dystrophic EB (DEB) and junctional EB (JEB). In epidermolysis bullosa simplex, layers of the epidermis separate. EBS is caused by mutations coding for keratin, plectin and BPAG1e. With junctional epidermolysis bullosa, layers of the lamina lucida (part of the basal lamina) separate. This is caused by mutations in integrin Œ±6Œ≤4, laminin 322 and BPAG2. In dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, the layers of the papillary dermis separate from the anchoring fibrils. This is caused by mutations in the collagen 7 gene.

It was formed in 1999 largely in response to the high market share of those companies, and the increasingly frequent take-over of previously Australian-owned companies, including Arnott's and Pauls. In particular, Smith was concerned that many companies which were no longer Australian owned still marketed their products as \\"Australian\\": the iconic Australian breakfast spread Vegemite, for example, was owned by Kraft Foods (now known as Mondelƒìz), which in turn was (until 2007) owned by the Altria Group (formerly known as tobacco giant Philip Morris).Lewis, Peter: Dick Smith's tasty new adventure Archived copy, Landline (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), 23 April 2000. On 26 July 2018, Dick Smith announced the business would close in 2019 due to competition with German supermarket Aldi and to avoid bankruptcy. Licensing arrangements and business Dick Smith Foods does not manufacture its own food products. Instead, it sources products from other Australian-owned companies, which licence the Dick Smith Foods brand label. In 2004, Smith announced his intention to make Dick Smith Foods a commercial operation, and to list it on the stock market by 2009. In the same year, 2004, Smith offered to purchase Vegemite from Kraft, but was unsuccessful.Media Release: Dick Smith offers to buy Vegemite to help out a battling Kraft , Dick Smith Foods, 27 October 2004. In 2006, the Herald Sun newspaper reported that Dick Smith Foods turnover had halved, due in part to the difficulty of finding local suppliers for their products. In 2011, Smith announced that he would be taking control of the management of the company again, after turnover dropped from $80 million to $8 million over the previous five years. He implemented a vision for the return to Australian-owned, Australian-grown produce where all the profits stay in Australia, instead of heading offshore as they do with the majority of foreign-owned food suppliers. The company had previously been managed, and some of its products produced under licence, by the Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company, which pays Dick Smith Foods for the rights to the company's branding. Generally, the brand focuses on producing local alternatives to products with large market shares like Kraft peanut butter and Vegemite.

The paper publishes weekdays during the academic year. The Daily also published several special issues every year: \\"The Orientation Issue,\\" \\"Big Game Issue,\\" and \\"The Commencement Issue.\\" In the fall of 2008, the paper's offices relocated from the Storke Publications Building to the newly constructed Lorry I.

Voices of the Sixties (Random House 2007) and Stanford administrators became worried about liability for the paper's editorials, the paper and the University severed ties.Fischer 2003 In 1973, students founded The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation, a non-profit corporation, to operate the newspaper. A significant event leading to the paper's independence was the 1970 publication of an opinion piece entitled \\"Snitches and Oppression.\\" The author of the piece named two witnesses to the protests that led to his arrest and concluded \\"take care of snitches.\\" The university president, Richard Lyman, called the piece a \\"journalistic atrocity\\" and indicated concern that the university could be held liable for the content of the newspaper and its consequences.UPI \\"Stanford prexy asks cut in paper support\\" Ellensburg (Wash.) Daily Record 10/8/1970\\" During the fall of 1970, the newspaper also announced an editorial policy of destroying unpublished photographs of demonstrations so they could not be used as evidence in court. In April, 1971, little more than a year thereafter, the newspaper's policy led a local district attorney, James Zurcher, to initiate a search of the Daily offices. This occurred shortly after the occupation of a Stanford Hospital building had been broken up by police, some of whom were attacked and injured by the demonstrators. Believing that photographs of these assaults existed in Daily files, detectives spent hours searching the darkroom and staff members' desks. The newspaper, aided by the noted constitutional expert Anthony Amsterdam, filed suit claiming a violation of the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution. Zurcher v. Stanford Daily went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled against the paper, holding that a state may issue a warrant to search and seize evidence from a third party who is not a criminal suspect (although \\"particular exactitude\\" must be exercised when First Amendment considerations are at play). This ruling caused the legislative branch to respond with the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, which increased protections for nonsuspect third parties in legal cases.Hearing on S. 115, S. 1790, and S. 1816 Before the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate, 96th Congress, 2nd Session, Serial No. 96-59 (March 28, 1980).Privacy Protection Act of 1980: Report together with Additional Views of the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate on S. 1790, 96th Congress, 2nd Session, S.

In 1982, after the Stanford football team officially lost the Big Game against cross-bay rival University of California at Berkeley (\\"Cal\\") due to what has become known as \\"The Play,\\" The Daily published a fake edition of The Daily Californian, Cal's student newspaper, announcing officials had reversed the game's outcome. Styled as an \\"extra,\\" the bogus paper headlined \\"NCAA AWARDS BIG GAME TO STANFORD\\". The Daily distributed 7,000 copies around the Berkeley campus early in the morning, before that day's Cal student paper was released. The prank has been credited to four Stanford undergraduates: Tony Kelly, Mark Zeigler, Adam Berns and The Daily's editor-in-chief at the time, Richard Klinger. To cover printing costs, The Daily made souvenir copies available on the Stanford campus for $1 apiece. The Stanford Dailys journalism has sometimes had far-reaching consequences; in the early 1990s a Daily staff member, John Wagner, '91, reported and published an investigative series uncovering significant corruption in the management of the Stanford Bookstore. According to Joanie Fischer's 2003 article about the newspaper in Stanford Magazine, \\"Managers of the independent nonprofit had formed a consulting firm that then leased a vacation home to the Bookstore and embezzled Bookstore funds to furnish it.\\"Fischer In October 2015, The Daily was criticized for failing to investigate misconduct at both the student and University level by Vanity Fair's David Margolick who wrote \\"The Stanford Daily has proved supine\\" in a 7,000-word feature on the unfolding scandal at the Graduate School of Business. When GSB Dean Garth Saloner resigned suddenly on September 14, 2015 amid a wrongful termination suit, The Daily was scooped by Poets & Quants, a blog that covers MBA programs around the world. The lawsuit was filed by a former professor married to fellow GSB professor Deborah H. Gruenfeld, with whom Saloner was having an affair. Though the scandal was covered extensively by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, and several international outlets, The Daily did not do additional reporting beyond its initial announcement of the Dean's resignation. On April 28, 2016, The Daily reported on former Speaker of the House John Boehner's likening of 2016 Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz to \\"Lucifer in the flesh\\" at a campus event.

It is a play cycle consisting of twelve plays depicting specific periods in Jesus' life, from the events surrounding his birth to his death and resurrection. It was first broadcast by the BBC Home Service on Sunday evenings, beginning on 21 December 1941, with new episodes broadcast at 4-week intervals, ending on 18 October 1942. The series was written by novelist and dramatist Dorothy L. Sayers, and produced by Val Gielgud, with Robert Speaight as Jesus. The twelve plays in the cycle are: #Kings in Judea #The King's Herald #A Certain Nobleman #The Heirs to the Kingdom #The Bread of Heaven #The Feast of Tabernacles #The Light and the Life #Royal Progress #The King's Supper #The Princes of This World #King of Sorrows #The King Comes to His Own The project aroused a storm of controversy, even before it was broadcast. Objections arose to the very idea‚Äîatheists complained of Christian propaganda, while devout Christians declared that the BBC would be committing blasphemy by allowing the Christ to be impersonated by a human actor‚Äîand also to Sayers' approach to the material. Sayers, who felt that the inherent drama of the Gospel story had become muffled by familiarity and a general failure to think of its characters as real people, was determined to give the plays dramatic immediacy, featuring realistic, identifiable characters with human emotions, motivations, and speech-patterns. The decision to have the characters speak in contemporary colloquial English was, by itself, the cause of much disquiet among those more accustomed to Jesus and his followers using the polished and formal words of the King James Bible. In the event, although it continued to be criticised by conservative Christians‚Äîone group going so far as to proclaim the fall of Singapore in February 1942 to be a sign of God's displeasure with the seriesMentioned in Welch, JW, Foreword to the published edition of the script.‚ÄîThe Man Born to Be King was generally considered a great success, both as drama and as biblical representation. The public reaction to the series is described in the foreword to the play scripts, first published in 1943, accompanied by a commentary by the author illuminating her attitude to the work and the reasoning behind particular aspects of her dramatisation. There have been many subsequent issues and editions. Other versions In April 1944 Episodes 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 were repeated as a Crucifixion/Resurrection sequence for Easter Week. Again Gielgud produced and Speaight was Jesus, but they were done afresh - for instance, Deryck Guyler played the disciple Andrew which he had not before. Four other full versions were made by the BBC: # Directed by Noel Iliff 1947‚Äì48, with Raf de la Torre as Jesus # Directed by Peter Watts 23 December 1951, with Deryck Guyler as Jesus # Directed by William Glen-Doepel 17 February 1965, with Tom Fleming as Jesus # Directed by Raymond Raikes World Service 1967, first aired domestically 19 January 1975 The last version was the first in stereo. It starred John Westbrook as Jesus, Gabriel Woolf, Denys Blakelock, Denise Bryer, Trevor Martin, Norman Shelley and Robert Eddison. This version was repeated from 6‚Äì21 December 2007 on BBC 7, after Christmas in 2008‚Äì2009 and from 18 April ‚Äì 3 May 2011 on BBC7's replacement, BBC Radio 4 Extra. The Raymond Raikes production reduced the episodes from one hour to forty-five minutes, and condensed the casts in various ways‚Äîfor instance by making The Evangelist, the narrator figure, the same voice as John the disciple (an identification strongly supported by the text of the fifth play). Heron Carvic, originally suggested by the writer, played Caiaphas in every version of the cycle (as well as in the broadcast of Sayers' Lichfield Passion in 1947). Alan Wheatley played Judas in all but the 1965 production. Similarly John Laurie played his original parts of Gestas in four of the productions, and John the Baptist in three. Many other castings overlapped ‚Äî Raf de la Torre, a regular in Sayers' religious plays, was Jesus in the first full revival, and then had small parts in both of the 1960s productions. No copies of the original version are held by the BBC, although recordings do exist elsewhere‚Äîonly \\"King of Sorrows\\" from the original broadcast is completely missing. The 1951/2 version is held on vinyl at the British Library. References Category:Portrayals of Jesus on radio Category:British plays Category:BBC Home Service programmes Category:Plays by Dorothy L.

HD Radio Guide for Seattle-Tacoma Operations and funding KNHC's On-Air Studio A before the 2009 rebuild KNHC's On-Air Studio A after the 2009 rebuild KNHC is owned by Seattle Public Schools and is operated by professional staff who provide training to students of Nathan Hale High School in north Seattle, as an electronic media course. Staff supervise students as they perform production, programming, music selection, copy writing, and on-air hosting. Some regular programs are hosted by alumni or non-student volunteers. The station usually plays general electronic dance music during the day, with a number of specialty, genre-specific shows playing anything from house to industrial and trance after 6 pm. Its in-house live programming includes a four-hour weekday breakfast show, the 15-minute lunchtime mini-mix 8-Bit Work Break, the drive show Drive @ 5, and the new music show Test Spin. Since around 2002, Seattle Public Schools has excluded funding for the station from its annual budget, except for a portion of the salaries and benefits for two staff. In 2019, that amounted to about 12% of the annual operating budget. In 2015, the station became qualified to receive a Community Service Grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The remaining operational budget of the station is raised via fund raising efforts, primarily from bi-annual pledge drives and corporate support announcements known as underwriting. As a non-commercial educational station, they cannot air traditional commercial advertisements. Broadcast coverage and online content The station has one of the widest over-the-air coverage areas for what can be considered a high school radio station. Its signal is broadcast from Entercom's backup tower on Cougar Mountain, and covers an area from north of Seattle to roughly halfway into Tacoma, Washington and across the Puget Sound. The signal can be received as far east as Snoqualmie Pass and as far north as Victoria, British Columbia. It is licensed to Seattle. C89.5 attracts as many as 200,000 broadcast listeners per week. The station also provides multiple live streams from its website, currently operating 32 kbit/s and 128 kbit/s MP3 streams as well as an Ogg stream, which can be received throughout the world via the Internet. C89.5 unveiled a major redesign of its website in April, 2018, along with a change in URL from c895worldwide.com to c895.org. Other upgrades include a real-time playlist and searchable database of the music that is heard on C89.5. History KNHC logo used from 2001 to 2018. KNHC went on the air as a very low power AM station, broadcasting with 100 milliwatts on 1210 kHz, in December 1969. Fairly quickly, however, the high school moved to build a FM station. In September 1970, KNHC received its FM construction permit and went on the air in January 1971. The transmitter was located at Wedgwood Elementary School, and the station broadcast with 10 watts, covering about a 5-mile circle in the north end of Seattle. In September 1972, the station increased its power to 320 watts, and three months later, stereo broadcasts began. A second power increase, in November 1974, increased the ERP to 1,500 watts directional. In December 1977, a HEW/NTIA grant created a sister studio at Cleveland High School on Beacon Hill. At the same time, the Mass Communications magnet school program at Hale begins, including courses in radio, television, journalism, photography, and graphic arts. KNHC's format entering the 1980s featured light rock and pop music, with specialty shows in the evenings and on weekends, including jazz and classical. After yet another power increase to 3 kW, this time non-directional, in October 1981, the station overhauled its format the next year to R&B; and urban, prompting an increase in listenership. The \\"C89\\" name entered use in 1983. New technologies were also deployed; in 1984, a satellite dish was added to receive the urban- oriented Sheridan Broadcasting Networks (an antecedent to today's American Urban Radio Networks), and in 1987, a microwave studio-transmitter link was brought into use along with a new and more efficient antenna. One of the primary challenges in the 1980s was an application filed in December 1983 by the Jack Straw Memorial Foundation and its station, KRAB (now KNDD), to share time with KNHC. The commercial station, which had been facing financial difficulties, set up a noncommercial foundation with the goal of broadcasting in the reserved band between 88 and 92 MHz; Seattle Public Schools saw the filing as a takeover attempt. The case was designated for hearing in 1986, and the courts found in Nathan Hale High School's favor in May 1988 and again after Jack Straw appealed. Ultimately, the foundation built a noncommercial station in Everett, KSER 90.7. In 1988, KNHC filed to increase its power to 30 kW, an increase that was put to use for the first time in 1991. The early 1990s also brought a magnet grant to bolster the high school's mass communications program and a renovation to the radio facility that added a second production studio, engineering room, and offices. In 1995, the station began converting to a digital workflow (a process completed in 2000 with the use of MiniDisc-based equipment), and in 1997, KNHC began streaming on the Internet. The mid-1990s also saw the formation of an articulation agreement with Boise State University to give KNHC students opportunities to further their education. KNHC's transmitter was moved to Cougar Mountain in 2002 after receiving FCC approval the year before. While the effective radiated power dropped, the coverage area was vastly improved with the move to the mountaintop site, primarily to the north of Seattle. The expanded reach of the station and its online stream prompted several distinctions in the decade: across the country, The Village Voice named KNHC best high school radio station in its \\"Best of New York\\" list in 2003, and in 2004, the station became the first non-commercial station in the United States to be a monitored reporter when they joined the Billboard Magazine Dance Radio Airplay panel. Additional technical and facilities improvements, came in 2008, when KNHC installed a new transmitter on Cougar Mountain and began broadcasting in HD Radio, and in November 2009, when it moved into brand-new digital studios and classrooms at Nathan Hale.

The aim is to assist the planning and creating of a small but intensively planted vegetable garden. It results in a simple and orderly gardening system, from which it draws much of its appeal. Mel Bartholomew coined the term \\"square foot gardening\\" in his 1981 book of the same name. Overview A basic, 4x4, 16-unit \\"square-foot garden.\\" The phrase \\"square foot gardening\\" was popularized by Mel Bartholomew in a 1981 Rodale Press book and subsequent PBS television series. Bartholomew, a retired engineer, devised a raised square beds with a grid. Each of these 4 by 4 square beds was then divided into sixteen one-foot squares, the grid. Each square is planted with a different crop species based on a formulation of either one, four, nine or sixteen plants per square depending on the plant's overall size. Once a ‚Äúsquare foot‚Äù is harvested, a different crop can be planted for a continual harvest. To encourage a variety of different crops in succession, and to discourage pests, each square is used for a different kind of plant (crop rotation) within the growing season. The number of plants per square depends on an individual plant's size. For example, a single tomato plant takes a full square, as might herbs such as oregano, basil or mint, while lettuce plants would be planted four per square, and up to sixteen per square of plants such as radish or carrots. Tall plants are trellised on the north side of the bed to avoid shading smaller plants and prevent sprawling on the ground. One advantage of densely planted crops is that they can form a living mulch and can also prevent weeds from establishing or even germinating. Also, natural insect repellent methods such as companion planting (e.g. planting marigolds or other naturally pest-repelling plants) become more efficient in a close space, which may reduce the need to use pesticides. The large variety of crops in a small space also prevents plant diseases from spreading easily Since the beds are typically small, making covers or cages to protect plants from pests, cold, wind or too much sun is more practical than with larger gardens. To extend the growing season of a square foot garden, a cold/hot frame may be built around it, and by facing the cold/hot frame south, the SFG captures more light and heat during the colder months of spring and winter. In 2006 Bartholemew updated the concept with the book \\"All New Square Foot Gardening\\", which advocates using ‚ÄúMel‚Äôs Mix‚Äù created by Bartholomew. After much experimentation, Bartholomew concluded that his formulation of 1/3 peat moss or coconut coir, 1/3 vermiculite and 1/3 blended compost yielded superior results in only a depth. The benefits of the mix included keeping soil friable and virtually weed free with all the necessary nutrients. This mix eliminated the need for artificial fertilizer as compost is added each time you re-plant a square which provides enough nutrients naturally.

The eastern subspecies P. m. yatii is sometimes considered a separate species known as Yate's sparrow.  Description  At long it is one of the smaller species of its family, some shorter than the widespread house sparrow. Like most of its relatives, it is sexually dimorphic with males being more brightly and distinctively marked than females. The male Dead Sea sparrow has a grey crown, rear neck and cheeks, and a small black bib. It has a pale supercilium shading to buff at the rear, and yellow neck sides. The upperparts are dark-streaked reddish brown, and the underparts are grey-white. The female looks like a small house sparrow, with a streaked brown back, greyish head and buff-white underparts. She is paler and smaller billed than the house sparrow, and sometimes shows yellow on the neck sides. The eastern subspecies P. m. yatii is sandier, and the male has a yellow wash to the underparts. The chirping song resembles those of house and Spanish sparrows, but is softer. The flight call is a high- pitched chi-wit. This species is often silent.  Distribution and habitat  The range of this species is spotty in the Middle East, largely in corridors along the Jordan River and the Euphrates River, ranging from southern Turkey and Cyprus to the southwestern corner of Iran. The subspecies P. m. yatii breeds only in the Sistan region of southwestern Afghanistan and eastern Iran. While the species was initially recorded by scientists breeding only in a restricted range by the Dead Sea, hence the species' name, more populations were discovered further east and it expanded its known range over the second half of the 20th century. The species was first recorded on the island of Cyprus in 1973 and bred a few years later. Though changes to habitat reduced the size of this population soon after it is thought small numbers still breed in Cyprus. This species is migratory or dispersive away from its breeding season. The eastern subspecies winters in western Pakistan, but the regular wintering grounds of the western subspecies are largely unknown. Winter searches for the species near its western breeding range only find scattered flocks. It is possible they disperse widely in winter, as flocks have been found in winter further south and east than where they breed, including in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Genetic analysis of birds in Israel revealed high connectivity among different populations indicating migration of individuals between these populations. However, despite this gene flow there is latitudinal variation in wing length and body mass, with individuals in the north of Israel having longer wings and being heavier than those in the south suggesting local adaption in accordance with Bergmann's rule.  Behaviour  This species feeds principally on seeds, like other sparrows. It breeds in dry lowlands with some shrubs, including tamarisk, and access to water. It builds a nest in a tree, and four to seven eggs are laid.

Construction Tinosa (SS-283) launched at Mare Island Navy Yard, 7 October 1942. The Tinosa was laid down on 21 February 1942 at Vallejo, California, by the Mare Island Navy Yard; launched on 7 October 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Katharine Shanks Malloy, wife of Captain William E. Malloy; and commissioned on 15 January 1943, Lt. Comdr. Lawrence Randall Daspit in command. Operations during World War II After preliminary operations, the submarine proceeded to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 16 April 1943. Over the next two years, she completed twelve war patrols in the Pacific and was credited with sinking 16 enemy ships, totaling 64,655 tons.  First and second patrols, May‚ÄìAugust 1943  On her first war patrol, conducted from 3 May to 19 June 1943, Tinosa damaged three enemy ships in the waters east of Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan, while sustaining some depth-charge damage herself. After refitting at Midway, she got underway on 7 July to patrol the sea routes between Borneo and Truk. On 24 July 1943, Tinosa encountered the cargo ship Tonan Maru No. 3, the largest tanker of the Japanese fleet, 19,262 tons, sailing from Palau to Truk. Codebreaker warning had put Tinosa in a perfect position to shoot the tanker with a spread of four torpedoes. None exploded. The boat's commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander L. R. (Dan) Daspit recorded in his log, \\"Target had been carefully tracked and with spread used [torpedoes] could not have run properly and missed.\\" Tinosa made herself a second chance by chasing throughout the following day. Daspit also checked the torpedoes he had left and insured that the magnetic influence exploders had been disabled (see below for why). Even so, the first two torpedoes of the second attack had to be shot at an awkward angle and range. They hit and exploded disabling Tonan Maru's engines. With the target dead in the water Tinosa was in an ideal firing position, moving in to fire on the tanker at the submarine equivalent of point blank range. The torpedo appeared to hit its target but did not explode. Daspit and crew continued to fire torpedoes one at a time at the tanker. All of them hit, but none exploded. Daspit's log gives time of firing of each and states over and over again \\"fired [nth] torpedo. Hit. No apparent effect.\\" Daspit recorded about the sixth one since Tonan Maru had become a \\"sitting duck\\", \\"... Hit. No apparent effect. This torpedo hit well aft on the port side, made splash at the side of the ship and was then observed to have taken a right turn and to jump clear of the water about from the stern of the tanker. I find it hard to convince myself that I saw this.\\" He took his sub to the other side of the target and fired the eighth and ninth torpedoes even as he saw a destroyer approaching from the east. As Tinosa went deep they heard the last torpedo hit and stop running. Daspit recorded in his log, \\"No explosion. Had already decided to retain one torpedo for examination by base.\\" After shooting nine torpedoes at a sitting duck over almost an hour and a half 1009 to 1131, and taking time out to examine the fish in the torpedo room between shots, Lieutenant Commander Daspit took Tinosa back to Pearl Harbor with the single remaining weapon. Daspit stormed into SUBPAC's office. He had shot 15 torpedoes at Tonan Maru over two days and only 2 of them had worked. The others shot under ideal conditions failed to explode. Rear Admiral Lockwood, COMSUBPAC wrote: \\"I expected a torrent of cusswords, damning me, the Bureau of Ordnance, the Newport Torpedo Station and the Base Torpedo Shop, and I couldn‚Äôt have blamed him ‚Äì 19,000 ton tankers don‚Äôt grow on trees. I think Dan was so furious as to be practically speechless. His tale was almost unbelievable, but the evidence was undeniable.\\" Blair, Clay (2001).Silent Victory, Naval Institute Press, p. ~437 When, upon inspection, nothing obvious was found wrong with that last torpedo, Commander Swede Momsen suggested conducting tests on actual warshots by firing them against the cliffs of Kahoolawe, a small island south of Maui from the submarine USS Muskallunge. The first two exploded. The third one did not. Within a few days the cause was traced to a firing pin that was mounted athwart-ships such that when the torpedo hit a target dead-on (ninety degree track angle) the deceleration forces slowed the pin's motion in its bearings and its spring could not move it fast enough to set off the explosive train. A glancing blow, however, would result in the proper behavior (which is why Daspit's first two torpedoes, fired at less optimum track angle, did explode). Two solutions were worked on. One involved recycling a very light metal alloy that had been melted down from the engine of a Japanese airplane that had crashed on Oahu during the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Both solutions were installed into torpedoes and the submarine force had a mostly reliable weapon 21 months after the war started. This was the third strike for the Mark 14 torpedo. It started with the USS Sargo missing 13 of 13 easy shots in December 1941. Finally in June 1942, Admiral Lockwood, the Commander of Submarines South West Pacific (COMSUBSOWESPAC), arranged to have torpedoes ‚Äì with special non-exploding warheads (but unlike the exercise heads of that time and later they were filled to make them just as heavy as the actually explosive-filled warheads) ‚Äì shot at fishnets. They were set to run at . away they went through the nets at depth. The Bureau of Ordnance (BUORD) wouldn't accept this until they were forced to face the facts and conduct their own experiment. They confirmed Lockwood's experiments on 1 August. But that was not the end. In April 1943 BUORD admitted that the magnetic influence exploder was susceptible to premature explosions. Even then it wasn't until 24 July when Admiral Nimitz ordered that the influence exploders be disabled on all Pacific Fleet submarines. This did not apply, however, to COMSUBSOWESPAC. Admiral Christie then in command had been the officer in charge of testing the super secret influence exploder in the 1930s and he just could not give up on the concept and he ordered that his boats continue to use the defective magnetic exploder. This set the stage for Dan Daspit, USS Tinosa and the Tonan Maru to show that the contact exploder was defective as well, as described above.See: Beach, E.L. \\"Culpable Negligence,\\" American Heritage Vol. 32, No. 1, December 1980, p. 43 and Blair, Clay (2001).

United States Submarine Operations in World War II.  Third patrol, September‚ÄìOctober 1943  Tinosa next departed Pearl Harbor on 23 September. Near the Carolines on 6 October, Tinosa sighted a lone tanker. In a midday torpedo attack, she damaged the ship; then dove to . Four depth charges exploded nearby, springing open lockers and knocking men off their feet in the aft torpedo room. Moments later, a fire broke out in the motor room but was brought under control. Throughout the afternoon, Tinosa and continued to harass the tanker until evening, when their target went down. At sunset on 6 October, Tinosa bombarded a radio station on Alet Island, near Truk. She ended the patrol at Midway on 16 October.  Fourth patrol, October‚ÄìDecember 1943  Departing Midway on 27 October, Tinosa headed for the Palau-Truk sea lanes. On 22 November, she sighted two cargo ships and two small escort craft steaming in convoy. The submarine fired six torpedoes, scoring hits on both cargo ships. The entire action took only five minutes and left her between two mortally stricken ships, her position clearly marked by torpedo wakes leading out ahead and astern‚Äîa perfect fix for the enemy escorts. Amid the sounds of the cargo vessels breaking up, Tinosa dove deep to avoid the certain counter- attack of the escort vessels. A short time later, four depth charges exploded close by the submarine, knocking out her planes, gyro, steering, internal communications, and other equipment. She made a wild climb to , then dove to , before her crew regained control. Tinosa then resumed evasive tactics which enabled her to elude the remnants of the convoy late in the afternoon. During an attack on a convoy on 26 November, Tinosa sank Japanese cargo ship Shini Maru and then dodged 34 depth charges, none of which caused her any damage. She emerged from this encounter with a torpedo stuck in her number 5 tube but managed to remedy the problem and headed for the Molucca Passage-Palau traffic lanes. On 3 December, she sighted a large passenger-cargo vessel, the Azuma Maru, protected by a single escort. At 18:20, Tinosa launched a torpedo attack, damaging the Japanese ship. At 21:01 while maneuvering on the surface as she sought to finish off the Azuma Maru, Tinosa came under fire from the burning vessel; and, minutes later, she narrowly avoided being rammed by the crippled enemy ship which circled out of control because of a damaged rudder. At 21:20, Tinosa fired three more torpedoes, and the Azuma Maru sank. She concluded this patrol at Fremantle, Australia, on 16 December 1943.  Fifth patrol, January‚ÄìMarch 1944  After sailing on 10 January 1944 for the South China Sea, Tinosa landed an intelligence team and its supplies at Labian Point, North Borneo, under cover of darkness on 20 January, before proceeding to the Flores Sea. Two days later, she sank Koshin Maru and Seinan Maru and damaged a third ship in a running attack on a convoy off Viper Shoal. In another action on the night of 15 February ‚Äì 16 February, Tinosa drew gunfire from the ships of a convoy as she torpedoed and sank Odatsuki Maru and Chojo Maru. She ended her fifth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 4 March 1944.  Sixth patrol, March‚ÄìMay 1944  In company with and , Tinosa got underway for the East China Sea and her sixth patrol on 29 March. Operating off Japan and the Ryukyus, this wolf pack preyed successfully on passing convoys by stationing units along well-traveled routes. The submarines made six major attacks on this patrol. Tinosa herself sank two Japanese cargo ships, Taibu Maru and Toyohi Maru, in a night attack on 4 May. On this patrol, she also sank a trawler with her gun on 9 May and claimed to have damaged three other vessels. The submarine arrived at Majuro on 15 May.  Seventh patrol, June‚ÄìAugust 1944  After refitting, Tinosa departed the Marshalls on 7 June, bound for the East China Sea. On 18 June, she resorted to unusual tactics in attacking a three-masted 400-ton fishing sampan which had withstood her gunfire. Tinosa closed the enemy vessel, doused her with fuel oil, and set her ablaze by tossing flaming, oil-soaked rags on her deck. Shortly after dawn on 2 July, Japanese planes and patrol vessels forced Tinosa to go deep near Nagasaki and kept her down until dusk. The following day, the submarine sank two passenger- cargo ships in an attack on a convoy, adding Konsan Maru and Kamo Maru to her list of kills. Following this patrol, Tinosa reported to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 7 August, for a much needed overhaul.  Eighth and ninth patrols, November 1944 ‚Äì April 1945  Tinosa departed San Diego on 7 November 1944 and proceeded, via Pearl Harbor, to Nansei Shoto to reconnoiter its waters and to test new FM sonar equipment in locating Japanese mines. After 58 days at sea, Tinosa returned to Pearl Harbor. On 17 March 1945, Tinosa got underway from Tanapag Harbor in the Marshalls. Despite unexplained damage in her bow-plane rigging gear, Tinosa proceeded to the Nansei Shoto area and resumed testing the mine-detecting capabilities of her temperamental FM sonar. She also observed Japanese shipping and took reconnaissance photographs before ending the patrol at Apra Harbor, Guam, on 7 April.  Tenth patrol, April‚ÄìMay 1945  On 28 April, Tinosa headed for Truk. Her FM sonar equipment‚Äîwhich she had received while at Guam‚Äîimproved her sonar range, and she gathered data on sonar performance throughout the voyage. On 3 May, she narrowly escaped damage from bombs dropped by an enemy airplane off Moen Island. Although there was no opportunity to attack enemy shipping during this patrol, Tinosa bombarded a Japanese installation on Ulul Island on the night of 14 May. She also made numerous photographs which she turned over to intelligence officers upon her arrival at Guam on 16 May.  Eleventh and twelfth patrols, May‚ÄìAugust 1945  Tinosa got underway for the Sea of Japan on 29 May. En route, she rescued 10 survivors of a ditched B-29. Acting on this special mission as a member of a wolf pack selected to initiate Operation Barney, an incursion into the Sea of Japan, Tinosa accomplished the dangerous task of plotting mines in Tsushima Strait on 6 June. Following the completion of this special mission, Tinosa made six aggressive torpedo attacks, sank three cargo ships, and‚Äîduring the daylight hours of 12 June‚Äîlaunched a brilliant surface battle against the Keito Maru, a Japanese sea truck. Having sunk four Japanese vessels and damaged a fifth, she completed her 11th patrol arriving at Pearl Harbor on 4 July. After refitting, Tinosa set course for her 12th patrol on 11 August. Before she reached her assigned area this patrol was terminated by Japan's capitulation. On 26 August 1945, she departed Midway for an overhaul at San Francisco. After operating off the West Coast from January to June 1946, she was placed in reserve. In January 1947, Tinosa was placed out of commission.  Second period in commission, 1952‚Äì53  Portside view of Tinosa (SS-283), probably laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Mare Island Group, after she was decommissioned, 2 December 1953. The Korean War precipitated her recommissioning in January 1952. However, she was decommissioned on 2 December 1953, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1958. The use of her hull for experimental and training purposes was authorized on 2 March 1959. She was used as an ASW target, then scuttled off Hawaii in November 1960.

The rose makes an outstanding cut flower and its exceptionally long lasting in water. History The rose cultivar was developed by Jack Harkness of Harkness Roses (R. Harkness & Co. Ltd) at Hitchin, Hertfordshire. The acclaimed nursery, which continues to sell roses today, was established in 1879 in Bedale, Yorkshire by brothers, John Harkness (1857-1933) and (Robert Harkness (1851-1920). Jack Harkness (1918-1994) is the grandson of the original co-founder John Harkness. 'Anne Harkness' was bred by Jack Harkness in 1979 and introduced into Britain in 1980. He named the rose, 'Anne Harkness' to mark the 21st birthday of his niece, Anne Harkness. The parentage of the rose cultivar is a combination of: Rosa 'Bobby Dazzler' √ó Rosa 'Manx Queen' √ó Rosa 'Prima Ballerina' √ó Rosa 'Chanelle' √ó Rosa 'Piccadilly'. The rose has two child plants: Rosa 'Good as Gold' (Warner, 1994) and Rosa 'Penny Lane' (Harkness, 1998). Description 'Anne Harkness' is a medium-tall, narrow, upright shrub, 4 to 5 ft (121-152 cm) in height with a 2 to 3 ft (30-60 cm) spread. It has tall stems bearing large clusters of 6 to 20 flowers. Blooms have an average diameter of 2‚Äî3 in (5‚Äî7 cm) with a petal count of 26 to 40. The double (17-25), medium-sized flowers are lightly scented. Flowers are apricot or apricot-blend in color with yellow or gold edges. 'Anne Harkness' is notable for beginning to bloom late in the season. It is a good repeat bloomer. Flowers can last a very long time in water. It is a popular rose with exhibitors and florists, and is well suited for cut flowers. The flowers are outstanding in August and September. The foliage is very healthy and a glossy, dark green. Powdery mildew can be a problem early in the blooming season.

Since recent findings provide a number of columnar liquid crystals consisting of non-discoid mesogens, it is more common now to classify this state of matter and compounds with these properties as columnar liquid crystals. Takuzo Aida and co-workers recently reported cyclic peptides that self-assemble into polar columnar organizations. These materials can be unidirectionally aligned over large areas by application of an external electric field.Kohei Sato, Yoshimitsu Itoh, and Takuzo Aida http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja203894r Classes Columnar liquid crystals are grouped by their structural order and the ways of packing of the columns. Nematic columnar liquid crystals have no long-range order and are less organized than other columnar liquid crystals. Other columnar phases with long-range order are classified by their two-dimensional lattices: hexagonal, tetragonal, rectangular, and oblique phases. The discotic nematic phase includes nematic liquid crystals composed of flat-shaped discotic molecules without long-range order. In this phase, molecules do not form specific columnar assemblies but only float with their short axes in parallel to the director (a unit vector which defines the liquid-crystalline alignment and order). Current topics of interest The first discotic liquid crystal was found in 1977 by the Indian researcher Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar. This molecule has one central benzene ring surrounded by six alkyl chains. Since then, a large number of discoid mesogenic compounds have been discovered in which triphenylene, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, coronene, and other aromatic molecules are involved. The typical columnar liquid-crystalline molecules have a pi-electron-rich aromatic core attached by flexible alkyl chains. This structure is attracting particular attention for potential molecular electronics in which aromatic parts transport electrons or holes and alkyl chains act as insulating parts. The advantages of liquid-crystalline conductors are their anisotropy, processibility, and self-healing characteristics for structural defects.S. Chandrasekhar, B. K. Sadashiva and K. A.

The State Council () was the supreme state advisory body to the Tsar in Imperial Russia. From 1906, it was the upper house of the parliament under the Russian Constitution of 1906. 18th century Early Tsars' Councils were small and dealt primarily with the external politics. Peter I of Russia introduced the Secret Council. Catherine I of Russia introduced the Supreme Secret Council. Its role varied during different reigns. Peter III of Russia created the Imperial Council on May 20, 1762 (\\"–ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç\\"), or, formally \\"The Council at the Highest Court\\" (\\"–°–æ–≤–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏ –≤—ã—Å–æ—á–∞–π—à–µ–º –¥–≤–æ—Ä–µ\\"). It was dismissed shortly after the succession of Catherine II of Russia. 1810‚Äì1906 The State Council was established by Alexander I of Russia in 1810 as part of Speransky's reforms. Although envisaged by Speransky as the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, it was actually an advisory legislative body composed of people whom the tsar could trust. The number of members varied at different periods. Upon its establishment in 1810 there were 35 members; in 1890 there were 60. The main duty of the Council was the preliminary investigation, promulgation and abrogation of laws. There were four departments of the Council: Legislative; Civil and Ecclesiastical Administration; State Economy; and Industry, Science and Commerce. Each department had its own presiding officer (State Secretary) and met separately to discuss matters assigned to their departments. There were also plenary sessions of the whole Council presided over by the Chairman of the State Council. The Council as a whole examined projects of law proposed by the ministers who were ex-officio members. The majority of their sessions concerned the budget and state expenditures but they would examine anything submitted to them. They had no authority to propose changes to the law, to examine anything that was not submitted to them for examination or decision- making authority. The Council only made recommendations to the monarch, who could support the majority, a minority, or disregard the Council's recommendations altogether, as he saw fit. According to Dominic Lieven it \\"played no part in the formulation of foreign policy and its members' access to the Emperor was very limited.D.C.B. Lieven (1983) Russia and the Origins of the First World War, p. 76 The centenary session of the State Council in the Marie Palace on May 7, 1901, is represented on Ilya Repin's huge canvas (detail shown), now exhibited in the Russian Museum. 1906‚Äì1917 During 1906‚Äì1917, the status of the State Council was defined by the Russian Constitution of 1906. Its chairman was appointed by the Tsar. Half of its members were appointed by the Tsar from persons distinguished at civil and military service, and half by elections from various categories of society, separately: * 56 seats from Zemstvo (1 from each guberniya), * 18 seats from Assemblies of Nobility, * 6 seats from the Russian Orthodox Church: 3 of them from white clergy, and 3 from black clergy, * 12 seats from stock exchange committees, chambers of commerce and business associations, * 6 seats from the Russian Academy of Sciences, * 2 seats from the Parliament of Finland, which refused to send delegates. The State Council was the upper house of the parliament, while the State Duma of the Russian Empire was the lower house. Compared to the contemporary British House of Lords and Prussian Herrenhaus, the Russian upper chamber was more democratically constituted, as half of its members were democratically elected from different sections of society, while the Herrenhaus consisted of hereditary peers, and the House of Lords consisted of hereditary peers and clergy from privileged dioceses. The State Council ceased to exist after the February Revolution of 1917. The Soviet Union did not replace this council until 1991 when the State Council of the Soviet Union was created. The latter council would be short lived and dissolved by year end.

To the north of its mouth is the large Resolution Island, whose Five Fingers Peninsula shelters the mouth of the sound from the northwest; along the east coast of the island, Acheron Passage connects Tamatea / Dusky Sound with Te Puaitaha / Breaksea Sound, to the north. Several large islands lie in the sound, notably Anchor Island, Long Island, and Cooper Island. The upper reaches of the sound are steep-sided, and the high precipitation of the region leads to hundreds of waterfalls cascading into the sound during the rainy season. Seals and dolphins are often sighted in the sound's waters and occasionally visited by whales where the area especially nearby Preservation Inlet was one of earliest shore-based whaling ground for southern right whales, while humpback whales show sudden increasesWhale tales from Dusky Sound: Nice smile, pity about the breath!. The Seaforth River is the largest of many small rivers and creeks which flow into the sound. At its mouth, the sound is wide, and is bordered by the Five Fingers Peninsula to the north and by South Cape and Fannin Bay in the south. The south Island's westernmost point, West Cape lies less than 10 kilometres south of the sound's mouth. Immediately inside the sound's mouth lies the large Anchor Island and numerous small islets, among them the Seal, Petrel, and Many Island groups. To the north of Anchor Island lies Resolution Island, and here its coast in indented by a large triangular cove which separates the Five Fingers Peninsula from the rest of the island. A number of small coves punctuate this coast, including Goose Cove and Earshell Cove. Immediately to the southeast of Anchor Island lies the smaller Indian Island. To the east of Anchor Island, the sound narrows to about 5 kilometres and splits into two broad channels, separated by the aptly named Long Island, which stretches for some 15 kilometres in length but is only around 2000 metres wide at its widest point. The narrower of the two channels, Cook Channel, lies to the south of Long Island; Bowen Channel lies to the north. Bowen Channel links with Acheron Passage, a north‚Äìsouth channel which separates Resolution Island from the mainland and links with Te Puaitaha / Breaksea Sound to the north. Inland from Long Island lies Cooper Island, approximately 8 kilometres in length and up to 5 kilometres in width. Tamatea / Dusky Sound narrows to the east of Cooper Island, reaching its end in two small coves, Shark Cove and Supper Cove. The Seaforth River flows into the eastern end of Supper Cove. Important Bird Area The sound has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a breeding site for Fiordland penguins.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Dusky Sound. Downloaded from on 2012-02-18. History It is believed that MƒÅori occasionally camped by the sound's waters while hunting moa in pre-European times. The inlet was first sighted by Europeans and Captain Cook noted its entrance during his first voyage to New Zealand in 1770. He named it Dusky Bay. On his second expedition he spent two months exploring the sound, and used it as a harbour, establishing workshops and an observatory. It is believed his crew brewed the first beer in New Zealand during his stay. He encountered some Maori with whom he had friendly relations. Later they seemed to have disappeared and it was speculated their countrymen had killed them, perhaps for the presents Cook gave them.A. Charles Begg, Neil C. Begg, Dusky Bay, Christchurch, NZ: Whitcombe & Tombs Ltd., 1968. Cook saw the place as a good harbour for ships entering the Pacific from Europe by the shortest route, highlighting its maritime significance and overlooking its land-locked character. This gave it an unusual prominence in earliest European visits which disappeared as Europeans became more familiar with New Zealand's geography. Tamatea / Dusky Sound was consequently used as a harbour by other European navigators and merchant ships in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. From 1792 it became a favoured site for seal hunters. Men landed by Captain William Raven from the Britannia in that year built the first European house in New Zealand and the first ship in Australasia, and the first European woman known to have been in New Zealand was recorded as a visitor in 1793.Peter Entwisle, Behold the Moon: The European Occupation of the Dunedin District 1770-1848, Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 1998, p.11. A group of 244 Europeans was stranded in Dusky Sound in 1795, which included two women, Elizabeth Bason and Ann Carey, the first known to have lived ashore. The last of this group left in 1797.Entwisle, 1998,p.12. The attention of the sealers moved to Bass Strait from 1798 but returned to New Zealand, at Dusky Sound, from 1802. In that year Captain Charles Bishop and George Bass in the Venus spent 14 days in Dusky Sound stripping iron from the hulk of Captain Brampton's old ship the Endeavour.Not Cook's ship of the same name. The blacksmith converted the iron into axes which they then used in Tahiti to trade for pork before returning to Sydney by November 1802.Rowley Taylor Straight through from London, the Antipodes and Bounty Islands, New Zealand, Heritage Expeditions New Zealand Ltd, Christchurch, 2006, , pp.37, 38 &40. Following this, in January 1803, George Bass asked Governor King of New South Wales for a fishing monopoly, from a line bisecting New Zealand from Dusky Sound to Otago Harbour extending south to include the subantarctic Islands. It was not granted, but it indicates the sealers' area of interest and Dusky Sound's place in it.Robert McNab (ed), Historical Records of New Zealand, 2 vols, Wellington, NZ: Government Printer, 1908 & 1914. The Matilda under Captain Fowler was on this part of the coast in 1814 when six of his lascar (Indian) seamen absconded in an open boat. It seems it was at Dusky Sound they were set upon by Maori when three were killed and eaten and the others enslaved. One or more of them later lived in what is now the Dunedin district.Peter Entwisle, Taka: a Vignette Life of William Tucker 1784-1817, Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005, p.85. Sealers continued to visit until the late 1820s when the second sealing boom faded.Robert McNab, Murihiku, Wellington, NZ: Whitcombe & Tombs, 1909 An attempt was made in 1903 to construct a road from Dusky Sound to Lake Manapouri, but it was never completed, terminating abruptly at Bishop Burn, on the western side of Loch Maree. In December 2019, the name of the fiord was officially altered to Tamatea / Dusky Sound. Access Access to the sound is by sea or air only, with no roads reaching the coast at this point. However, the Dusky Track stretches to the upper reaches of the sound, at Supper Cove, from lakes Manapouri and Hauroko.

Located in the middle of dairy and timber country, it is the centre of the Dungog Shire local government area and at the 2016 census it had a population of 2,025 people. The area includes the Fosterton Loop, of road, used in the annual Pedalfest. A small portion of Dungog lies in the Mid- Coast Council LGA.  History  The traditional owners of the area now known as Dungog are the Gringai clan of the Wonnarua people, a group of Aboriginal Australian people. By 1825 Robert Dawson had named the Barrington area, while surveyor Thomas Florance named the Chichester River in 1827. Two years later George Boyle White explored the sources of the Allyn and Williams rivers. Grants along the Williams followed to men such as Duncan Mackay, John Verge, James Dowling (later a NSW Chief Justice) and others, who, with their assigned convicts, began clearing land and building houses around a district that was by the early 1830s centred on a small settlement first known as Upper William. With a Court of Petty Sessions in 1833 and gazetted in 1838 as the village of Dungog (a local Gringai word), it had a court house, lockup and an increasing number of inns, shops and houses. Lord St, as were Dowling, Mackay, Chapman, Hooke, Brown and Myles, were all named after landowners at the time surveyor Francis Rusden drew up his generous 1838 grid plan of Dungog's streets. The descendants of some of these, notably the Dowlings, Mackays and Hookes, still live in and around Dungog. Others, such as John Lord, went bankrupt or, as did Myles, sold out early and moved to Sydney. Dungog village gradually grew from a mere 25 houses in the 1846 census (three of stone or brick). By 1854, four licences for publicans were granted in Dungog: James Stephenson, Dungog Inn; Joseph Finch, Settlers' Arms; Joseph Robson, Trades' Arms; and Edward Tate, Durham Hotel. Two of these continue to operate today. The plan and street pattern of 1838 gave Dungog generous sized lots that, over the years, have allowed people to build homes with ample space in between, as well as to enjoy cow and horse paddocks close by. Before the 1920s there was relatively little building beyond Lord St. John Wilson, born in Dungog in 1854, described the town as a 'sea of bush and scrub, with a house here and there', and with bullock teams and drays having 'to wend their way between stumps and saplings'. Even in 1892, at the opening of Dungog Cottage Hospital on Hospital Hill to the west, the trek up was largely through open countryside. Boosted by the dairy industry, which began to develop in the 1890s, Dungog grew more rapidly, receiving a further boost with the arrival of the railway in 1911. Many of the finest houses and commercial buildings still to be seen here were built between the end of the nineteenth and the first two decades of the following century. Coolalie (206 Dowling St) and Coimbra (72 Dowling St), as well as the then Angus & Coote, now J A Rose building (146-148 Dowling St) and the Dark stores (184-190 Dowling St) all date from this period of expansion. All, as the Dungog Chronicle continuously proclaimed, were 'up to date', and as the Dungog Chronicle also pointed out, modern improvements such as the 'water service and electric light service has made Dungog a desirable place to live in'. The architects and builders used for these projects were locals; such as C H Button, Town Clerk and architect, or J A Hall, builder, as well as those from Maitland, such as architect J A Pender. Around 1926, Dowling Street was first fully kerbed and the present alignment of the shop facades was established. Money and new businesses were entering the town at this time. While things may have slowed a little thereafter, many new buildings and houses continued to be built in the following years. The Catholic community built a new place of worship in Brown St in 1933, replacing the church that had stood in Dowling St since 1870 (where the Tall Timbers Motel now stands). In 1935 the Bank of NSW replaced its old building on the corner of Dowling and Mackay Sts with one in the, then, very modern Georgian Revival Style. The Second World War was just beginning when the Dungog Chronicle reported: Recent weeks have seen a progressive building campaign in Dungog. Apart from the palatial new building for the Royal Hotel erected and furnished at a cost of some ¬£20,000, and remodelling of the Court House Hotel and Bank Hotel, nine new residences have been completed within the past month. In addition to these works, the Education Department is clearing and grading the playing grounds at the public school, and has erected an ornate brick fence along those grounds on the Dowling-street frontage, whilst the Municipal Council has had two chains of kerbing and guttering carried out in Mary-street. (Dungog Chronicle, 24 November 1939) Since the 1950s, few new public buildings and shops have been erected but homes have continued to be built in weatherboard, brick, fibro or concrete; following the fashions of the time. While dairying has declined, the beef industry has remained, and although most timber is now locked up in national parks, many visitors come these days to enjoy the area's natural beauty. This trend has also meant that numerous older homes have been saved from deterioration by 'tree-changers', who have increasingly bought and renovated older homes in Dungog and its surrounding countryside.Michael Williams, Ah Dungog (Dungog Historical Society, 2011) Smith & Tims railway contractors with employees passing through Dungog to Taree, 1909.  Heritage listings  Dungog has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 101 Main Road: Cooreei Bridge over Williams River * Lord Street: Dungog Courthouse and Residence * 6 Brown Street: Dungog Picture Theatre (James Theatre) Climate Dungog has a mild humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with warm summers and cool winters. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 2,025 people in Dungog. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.4% of the population. * 87.8% of people were born in Australia and 93.0% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Anglican 29.2%, No Religion 18.4%, Catholic 18.3% and Presbyterian and Reformed 9.3%.  Culture  Popular Dungog events are the Dungog Film Festival hosted at the James Theatre, the Dungog Agricultural Show, Pedalfest, the Dungog Rodeo, and the Thunderbolt Rally. Each of these events showcase local produce and talent and bring tourists to the region.  James Theatre  Dungog is the home of the James Theatre, the oldest fully enclosed purpose-built cinema continuously operating in Australia, located at 6 Brown Street. It receives new movie releases soon after cinemas in more populated areas. The Dungog Film Society has been operating from the cinema since 1992 and screens fine films monthly to locals as well as bringing Flickerfest to Dungog and an AGOG weekend of foreign films in September. The theatre is the venue for the Dungog Film Festival, which is held annually. The theatre was first opened on land of James Stuart in December 1912. Originally an open-air theatre, it was roofed by 1914 and in 1918 an enclosed hall built. In order to accommodate \\"talkie\\" movies and to provide improved dance facilities, Stuart commissioned major reconstruction works that commenced in 1930. These works were designed by the Newcastle architect, William Jeater. The reconstruction works included construction of a stage, remodelling the street fa√ßade into the Spanish Mission Style, a new dance floor, new northern entrance, a projection room above the foyer and seating arrangement for 400. It retains the simplicity of a Picture Theatre built in a small country town during the Great Depression. The building is architecturally significant as one of only four Picture Theatres in the New South Wales with Spanish Mission Style facades. The James Theatre Dungog Community Centre has been owned by the Dungog Shire Council since 1979.  Dungog Film Festival  The Dungog Film Festival, inaugurated on 31 May 2007, was a film festival which served the dual purposes of encouraging the local tourism industry and showcasing Australian cinema. It used to take place over four days and some of the proceeds went towards preserving the James Theatre. It used to be held annually in May and was open to Australian filmmakers only. It did not operate in 2013 and in 2014 was replaced by the broader festival of the arts, the Dungog Festival, which is now held on the October Long Weekend. The screenings were shown in local venues including the James Theatre and the RSL auditorium.  Gentlemen of the Road  Dungog hosted the 'Gentlemen of the Road' music festivalWHAT IS A STOPOVER? gentlemenoftheroad.com. Retrieved 2 August 2015 on 20 October 2012. The Gentlemen of the Road is a single performance special event organised by band Mumford and Sons, for which they select a remote town in the country they are touring and hold a day-long music festival featuring local artists and bands with which they are friends. The \\"Dungog Stopover\\" featured Husky, Matt Corby, Willy Mason, Sarah Blasko, Yacht Club DJs, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and headline act Mumford and Sons. Over 13,000 people attended the event held in the town's showground. Attendees were accommodated on campgrounds at the edge of the town, while the band members and entourages stayed at motels and pubs in Dungog.  Education  Dungog High School has approximately 680 students, Children from nearly all of the surrounding towns (e.g.: Clarence Town, Gresford, Paterson, Vacy, Wallarobba, Martins Creek, East Gresford, and Glen Martin) attend.  Historical Society and museum  Founded in 1963, Dungog Historical Society is located in the former School of Arts building which also houses the Dungog Museum. The wide collection showcases Dungog's history and heritage, including information and material about local aboriginals and family history. The core of the display is Dungog: The Making of a Community, telling the story of Dungog via different themes. The colourful panels were produced with a grant from the NSW Ministry of the Arts. Temporary exhibitions are also held.  Rail transport  The town's railway station has been served by the North Coast railway line since 1911. The Great White Train visit in August 1926 was attended by a large crowd. There are approximately six local and six long-distance services to Dungog each day. All services are run by NSW TrainLink.  Sport   Dungog Soccer Club ‚Äì \\"The Boomerangs\\"  Dungog is the home of Dungog Soccer Club. Nicknamed the \\"Boomerangs\\", Dungog compete in the Zone League competitions in the Northern NSW Football Federation. The Club has a strongly established juniors-base with 10 teams competing in competitions across the Hunter Valley.  Other sports  Dungog also has a Rugby League club called the Dungog Warriors which has teams competing in junior and senior competitions. Additionally, Dungog has a Cricket Club and a Netball Association who play a Port Stephens Netball Association in Raymond Terrace.

The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Daryl Quinlivan, was responsible to the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, The Hon. David Littleproud . The Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources was Senator the Hon Richard Colbeck since August 2018. The Assistant Minister to the former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was the Hon Luke Hartsuyker MP. Following the appointment of the Second Morrison Ministry in May 2019, Scott Morrison announced David Littleproud's previous ministerial positions were separated, with Bridget McKenzie as Minister for Agriculture and Littleproud as Minister for Water Resources. The Department again changed to the Department of Agriculture. Overview The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources' vision was to help drive a stronger Australian economy by building a more profitable, more resilient and more sustainable agriculture sector, and by supporting the sustainable and productive management and use of rivers and water resources. The department's annual reports provide information about its operations and performances in each financial year, and reviews its progress towards its objectives. The department's Corporate Plan sets outs the department's eight strategic objectives. Those identified in the 2016‚Äì17 plan include: * building successful primary industries * supporting agricultural communities * expanding agricultural, fisheries and forestry exports * sustaining natural resources for longer-term productive primary industries * improving water use efficiency and the health of rivers, communities, environmental assets and production systems * managing biosecurity and imported food risk * building an efficient and capable department * being a best practice regulator. The department strives to build strong relationships and work with governments, industry, importers and exporters, natural resource managers, primary producers, consumers, research and development organisations, rural communities and travellers. The department employs approximately 4000 full-time equivalent staff, including accountants, animal and meat inspectors, biosecurity officers, economists, information and communication technology (ICT) staff, policy officers, program administrators, researchers, scientists, survey staff and veterinary officers. The corporate structure is organised into divisions to support work across a broad range of agricultural, biosecurity, fisheries and forestry and water management activities. The department is located in regional centres, rural communities and cities throughout Australia. Around 58 per cent of its Australian-based employees work outside Canberra, in capital cities and regional offices, major airports, mail centres, shipping ports, laboratories and abattoirs. Globally, the department works in Bangkok, Beijing, Brussels, Dubai, Jakarta, New Delhi, Rome, Seoul, Tokyo and Washington, to maintain relationships with Australia's trading partners and international organisations. History The department was formed by way of an administrative order issued on 21 September 2015, replacing the previous Department of Agriculture, following the appointment of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister of Australia.

Harkness & Co. Ltd) are rose breeders based at Hitchin, Hertfordshire in England. The nursery was founded in 1879 in Yorkshire by brothers, John and Robert Harkness. Early varieties include 'Mrs. Harkness', 'Frensham' and 'Ena Harkness'. Jack Harkness, grandson of original co-founder, John Harkness, established the first rose hybridization program at the company in 1962, developing vigorous, healthy roses by hybridizing from wild rose species. His most successful new rose cultivars include: 'Amber Queen', 'Belmonte' and 'Anne Harkness'. History Harkness Roses was established in 1879 in Bedale, Yorkshire by brothers, John Harkness (1857-1933) and Robert Harkness (1851-1920). In 1882, John and Robert began to grow and exhibit roses. Their new rose business was a great success; Queen Victoria purchased her roses from Harkness & Sons in the 1890's. John and Robert soon realized that Yorkshire's climate was too cold for an expanding rose growing business. In 1892, they decided to established a branch of the firm in a location with a warmer climate. Neither brother wanted to leave Yorkshire, so it was decided by a coin toss that Robert would move to Hitchin, Hertfordshire to establish the new branch of Harkness and Sons. In 1901, John and Robert decided to dissolve the company and create two separate nurseries. Robert established R. Harkness & Co, today known as Harknes Roses. Rosa 'Amber Queen' \\"Early varieties of Harkness Roses include a sport of hybrid perpetual, 'Heinrich Schultheis', introduced in 1893 as 'Mrs. Harkness'. In the 1950s, Harkness popularized 'Frensham' and 'Ena Harkness', both introduced in 1946 in the United Kingdom Jack Harkness (1918-1994) was the grandson of the original co-founder John Harkness. He established the first rose hybridization program at the company in 1962, developing vigorous, healthy roses by hybridizing from wild rose species. Early successes were with hybrid teas, and then later with floribundas. In the 1970s he began breeding with Rosa persica, an unusual rose species with simple leaves. During his career, Harkness developed many successful rose cultivars, including 'Alexander', 'Mountbatten' and 'Amber Queen'. He is best known for his floribundas and hybrid tea roses. Robert Harkness, son of Jack Harkness (1951-2012), bred more than seventy rose varieties during his career. Among his best known varieties are: Rosa 'Belmonte' and 'Princess of Wales'. Philip Harkness, Jack's son and Robert's brother continues today as co-owner of Harkness Roses.

Fast mapping is thought by some researchers to be particularly important during language acquisition in young children, and may serve (at least in part) to explain the prodigious rate at which children gain vocabulary. In order to successfully use the fast mapping process, a child must possess the ability to use \\"referent selection\\" and \\"referent retention\\" of a novel word. There is evidence that this can be done by children as young as two years old, even with the constraints of minimal time and several distractors. Previous research in fast mapping has also shown that children are able to retain a newly learned word for a substantial amount of time after they are subjected to the word for the first time (Carey and Bartlett, 1978). Further research by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children can remember a novel word a week after it was presented to them even with only one exposure to the novel word. While children have also displayed the ability to have equal recall for other types of information, such as novel facts, their ability to extend the information seems to be unique to novel words. This suggests that fast mapping is a specified mechanism for word learning. The process was first formally articulated and the term 'fast mapping' coined by Harvard researchers Susan Carey and Elsa Bartlett in 1978. (Republished in Papers and Reports on Child Language Development 15, 17‚Äì29.)  Evidence against  Today, there is evidence to suggest that children do not learn words through 'fast mapping' but rather learn probabilistic, predictive relationships between objects and sounds that develop over time. Evidence for this comes, for example, from children's struggles to understand color words: although infants can distinguish between basic color categories, many sighted children use color words in the same way that blind children do up until the fourth year. Typically, words such as \\"blue\\" and \\"yellow\\" appear in their vocabularies and they produce them in appropriate places in speech, but their application of individual color terms is haphazard and interchangeable. If shown a blue cup and asked its color, typical three-year-olds seem as likely to answer \\"red\\" as \\"blue.\\" These difficulties persist up until around age four, even after hundreds of explicit training trials. The inability for children to understand color stems from the cognitive process of whole object constraint. Whole object constraint is the idea that a child will understand that a novel word represents the entirety of that object. Then, if the child is presented with further novel words, they attach inferred meanings to the object. However, color is the last attribute to be considered because it explains the least about the object itself. Children's behavior clearly indicates that they have knowledge of these words, but this knowledge is far from complete; rather it appears to be predictive, as opposed to all-or-none.  Alternate theories  An alternate theory of deriving the meaning of newly learned words by young children during language acquisition stems from John Locke's \\"associative proposal theory\\". Compared to the \\"intentional proposal theory\\", associative proposal theory refers to the deduction of meaning by comparing the novel object to environmental stimuli. A study conducted by Yu & Ballard (2007), introduced cross-situational learning, a method based on Locke's theory. Cross-situtational learning theory is a mechanism in which the child learns meaning of words over multiple exposures in varying contexts in an attempt to eliminate uncertainty of the word's true meaning on an exposure-by- exposure basis. On the other hand, more recent studies suggest that some amount of fast mapping does take place, questioning the validity of previous laboratory studies that aim to show that probabilistic learning does occur. A critique to the theory of fast mapping is how can children connect the meaning of the novel word with the novel word after just one exposure? For example, when showing a child a blue ball and saying the word \\"blue\\" how does the child know that the word blue explains the color of the ball, not the size, or shape? If children learn words by fast mapping, then they must use inductive reasoning to understand the meaning associated with the novel word. A popular theory to explain this inductive reasoning is that children apply word- learning constraints to the situation where a novel word is introduced. There are speculations as to why this is; Markman and Wachtel (1988) conducted a study that helps explain the possible underlying principles of fast mapping. They claim children adhere to the theories of whole-object bias, the assumption that a novel label refers to the entire object rather than its parts, color, substance or other properties, and mutual exclusivity bias, the assumption that only one label applies to each object. In their experiment, children were presented with an object that they either were familiar with or was presented with a whole object term. Markman and Watchel concluded that the mere juxtaposition between familiar and novel terms may assist in part term acquisition. In other words, children will put constraints on themselves and assume the novel term refers to the whole object in view rather than to its parts. There have been six lexical constraints proposed (reference, extendibility, object scope, categorical scope, novel name, conventionality) that guide a child's learning of a novel word. When learning a new word children apply these constraints. However, this purposed method of constraints is not flawless. If children use these constraints there are many words that children will never learn such as actions, attributes, and parts. Studies have found that both toddlers and adults were more likely to categorize an object by its shape than its size or color. Cross-situational learning versus propose but verify The next question in fast mapping theory is how exactly is the meaning of the novel word learned? An experiment performed in October 2012 by the Department of Psychology by University of Pennsylvania, researchers attempted to determine if fast mapping occurs via cross- situational learning or by another method, \\"Propose but verify\\". In cross- situational learning, listeners hear a novel word and store multiple conjectures of what the word could mean based on its situational context. Then after multiple exposures the listener is able to target the meaning of the word by ruling out conjectures. In propose but verify, the learner makes a single conjecture about the meaning of the word after hearing the word used in context. The learner then carries that conjecture forward to be reevaluated and modified for consistency when the word is used again. The results of the experiment seems to support that propose but verify is the way by which learners fast map new words.  Criticisms  There is also controversy over whether words learned by fast mapping are retained or forgotten. Previous research has found that generally, children retain a newly learned word for a period of time after learning. In the aforementioned Carey and Bartlett study (1978), children who were taught the word \\"chromium\\" were found to keep the new lexical entry in working memory for several days, illustrating a process of gradual lexical alignment known as \\"extended mapping.\\" Another study, performed by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children remembered words up to 1 month after the study was conducted. However, more recent studies have shown that words learned by fast mapping tend to be forgotten over time. In a study conducted by Vlach and Sandhofer (2012), memory supports, which had been included in previous studies, were removed. This removal appeared to result in a low retention of words over time. This is a possible explanation for why previous studies showed high retention of words learned by fast mapping. Some researchers are concerned that experiments testing for fast mapping are produced in artificial settings. They feel that fast mapping doesn't occur as often in more real life, natural situations. They believe that testing for fast mapping should focus more on the actual understanding of a word instead of just its reproduction. For some, testing to see if the child can use the new word in a different situation constitutes true knowledge of a word, rather than simply identifying the new word.  Variables affecting an individual's fast mapping ability  Bilingualism  When learning novel words, it is believed that early exposure to multiple linguistic systems facilitates the acquisition of new words later in life. This effect was referred to by Kaushanskaya and Marian (2009) as the bilingual advantage. That being said, a bilingual individual's ability to fast map can vary greatly throughout their life. During the language acquisition process, a child may require a greater amount of time to determine a correct referent than a child who is a monolingual speaker. By the time a bilingual child is of school age, they perform equally on naming tasks when compared to monolingual children. By the age of adulthood, bilingual individuals have acquired word-learning strategies believed to be of assistance on fast mapping tasks. One example is speech practice, a strategy where the participant listens and reproduces the word in order to assist in remembering and decrease the likelihood of forgetting . Bilingualism can increase an individual's cognitive abilities and contribute to their success in fast mapping words, even when they are using a nonnative language.  Socioeconomic status  Children growing up in a low- socioeconomic status environment receive less attention than those in high- socioeconomic status environments. As a result, these children may be exposed to fewer words and therefore their language development may suffer. On norm- references vocabulary tests, children from low- socioeconomic homes tend to score lower than same-age children from a high-socioeconomic environment. However, when examining their fast mapping abilities there were no significant differences observed in their ability to learn and remember novel words. Children from low SES families were able to use multiple sources of information in order to fast map novel words. When working with children from low SES homes, providing a context of the word that attributes meaning, is a linguistic strategy that can benefit the child's word knowledge development.  Face-to-face interaction  Three learning supports that have been proven to help with the fast mapping of words are saliency, repetition and generation of information. The amount of face-to-face interaction a child has with their parent affects his or her ability to fast map novel words. Interaction with a parent leads to greater exposure to words in different contexts, which in turn promotes language acquisition. Face to face interaction cannot be replaced by educational shows because although repetition is used, children do not receive the same level of correction or trial and error from simply watching. When a child is asked to generate the word it promotes the transition to long-term memory to a larger extent.  Evidence of fast mapping in other animals  It appears that fast mapping is not only limited to humans, but can occur in dogs as well. The first example of fast mapping in dogs was published in 2004. In it, a dog named Rico was able to learn the labels of over 200 various items. He was also able to identify novel objects simply by exclusion learning. Exclusion learning occurs when one learns the name of a novel object because one is already familiar with the names of other objects belonging to the same group. The researchers, who conducted the experiment, mention the possibility that a language acquisition device specific to humans does not control fast mapping. They believe that fast mapping is possibly directed by simple memory mechanisms. In 2010, a second example was published. This time, a dog named Chaser demonstrated, in a controlled research environment, that she had learned over 1000 object names. She also demonstrated that she could attribute these objects to named categories through fast mapping inferential reasoning. It's important to note that, at the time of publication, Chaser was still learning object names at the same pace as before. Thus, her 1000 words, or lexicals, should not be regarded as an upper limit, but a benchmark. While there are many components of language that were not demonstrated in this study, the 1000 word benchmark is remarkable because many studies on language learning correlate a 1000 lexical vocabulary with, roughly, 75% spoken language comprehension. Another study on Chaser was published in 2013. In this study, Chaser demonstrated flexible understanding of simple sentences. In these sentences, syntax was altered in various contexts to prove she had not just memorized full phrases or inferred the expectation through gestures from her evaluators. Discovering this skill in a dog is noteworthy on its own, but verb meaning can be fast mapped through syntax. This creates questions about what parts of speech dogs could infer, as previous studies focused on nouns. These findings create further questions about the fast mapping abilities of dogs when viewed in light of a study published in Science in 2016 that proved dogs process lexical and intonational cues separately. That is, they respond to both tone and word meaning. However, excitement about the fast-mapping skills of dogs should be tempered. Research in humans has found fast-mapping abilities and vocabulary size are not correlated in unenriched environments. Research has determined that language exposure alone is not enough to develop vocabulary through fast-mapping. Instead, the learner needs to be an active participant in communications to convert fast-mapping abilities into vocabulary. It is not commonplace to communicate with dogs, nor any non- primate animal, in a productive fashion as they are non-verbal.A dog at the keyboard: using arbitrary signs to communicate requests.

In the deaf population  A study by Lederberg et al., was performed to determine if deaf and hard of hearing children fast map to learn novel words. In the study, when the novel word was introduced, the word was both spoken and signed. Then the children were asked to identify the referent object and even extend the novel word to identify a similar object. The results of the study indicated that deaf and hard of hearing children do perform fast mapping to learn novel words. However, compared to children with normal hearing (aging toddlers to 5 years old) the deaf and hard of hearing children did not fast map as accurately and successfully. The results showed a slight delay which disappeared as the children were a maximum of 5 years old. The conclusion that was drawn from the study is that the ability to fast map has a relationship to the size of the lexicon. The children with normal hearing had a larger lexicon and therefore were able to more accurately fast map compared to deaf and hard of hearing children who did not have as large of a lexicon. It is by around age 5 that deaf and hard of hearing children have a similar size lexicon to 5 year old children of normal hearing. This evidence supports the idea that fast mapping requires inductive reasoning so the larger the lexicon (number of known words) the easier it is for the child to reason out the accurate meaning for the novel word. In the area of cochlear implants (CIs), there are variegated opinions on whether cochlear implants impact a child's ability to become a more successful fast mapper. In 2000, a study by Kirk, Myomoto, and others determined that there was a general correlation between the age of Cochlear Implant implementation and improved lexical skills (e.g. fast mapping and other vocabulary growth skills). They believed that children given implants prior to two years of age yielded higher success rates than older children between five and seven years of age. With that said, researchers at the University of Iowa wish to amend that very generalization. In 2013, \\"Word Learning Processes in Children with Cochlear Implants\\" by Elizabeth Walker and others indicated that although there may be a some levels of increased vocabulary acquisition in CI individuals, many post-implantees generally were slower developers of his/her own lexicon. Walker bases her claims on another research study in 2007 (Tomblin et al.) One of the purposes of this study was to note a CI child's ability to comprehend and retain novel words with related referents. When compared with non-deaf children, the CI children had lower success scores in retention. This finding was based on scorings obtained from their test: from 0 to 6 (0 the worst, 6 the best), CI children averaged a score around a 2.0 whereas non-deaf children scored higher (roughly 3.86). In individuals with ADHD An experiment was performed to assess fast mapping in adults with typical language abilities, disorders of spoken/written language (hDSWL), and adults with hDSWL and ADHD. The conclusion draws from the experiment revealed that adults with ADHD were the least accurate at \\"mapping semantic features and slower to respond to lexical labels.\\" The article reasoned that the tasks of fast mapping requires high attentional demand and so \\"a lapse in attention could lead to diminished encoding of the new information.\\" In individuals with language deficits Fast mapping in individuals with aphasia has gained research attention due to its effect on speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Research done by Blumstein makes an important distinction between those with Broca's aphasia, who are limited in physical speech, as compared to those with Wernicke's aphasia, who cannot link words with meaning. In Broca's aphasia, Blumstein found that whereas individuals with Wernicke's aphasia performed at the same level as the normal control group, those with Broca's aphasia showed slower reaction times for word presentations after reduced voice onset time stimuli. In short, when stimuli were acoustically altered, individuals with Broca's aphasia experienced difficulty recognizing the novel stimuli upon second presentation. Bloomstein's findings reinforce the crucial difference between one's ability to retain novel stimuli versus the ability to express novel stimuli. Because individuals with Wernicke's aphasia are only limited in their understanding of semantic meaning, it makes sense that the participant's novel stimulus recall would not be affected. On the other hand, those with Broca's aphasia lack the ability to produce speech, in effect hindering their ability to recall novel stimuli. Although individuals with Broca's aphasia are limited in their speech production, it is not clear whether they simply cannot formulate the physical speech or if they actually did not process the stimuli. Research has also been done investigating fast mapping abilities in children with language deficits. One study done by Dollaghan compared children with normal language to those with expressive syntactic deficits, a type of specific language impairment characterized by simplified speech. The study found that normal and language impaired children did not differ in their ability to connect the novel word to referent or to comprehend the novel word after a single exposure. The only difference was that the language-impaired children were less successful in their production of the novel word. This implies that expressive language deficits are unrelated to the ability to connect word and referent in a single exposure. The problem for children with those deficits arises only when trying to convert that mental representation into verbal speech. In individuals with intellectual disabilities A few researchers looked at fast mapping abilities in boys with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), also referred to as autism spectrum, and boys with fragile X syndrome (FXS). The experimental procedure consisted of a presentation phase where two objects were presented, one of which was a novel object with a nonsense word name. This was followed by a comprehension testing phase, which assessed the boys' ability to remember and correctly select the novel objects. Even though all groups in the study had fast mapping performances above chance levels, in comparison to boys showing typical development, those with ASD and FXS demonstrated much more difficulty in comprehending and remembering names assigned to the novel objects. The authors concluded that initial processes involved in associative learning, such as fast mapping, are hindered in boys with FXS and ASD. Computational models Research in artificial intelligence and machine learning to reproduce computationally this ability, termed one-shot learning. This is pursued to reduce the learning curve, as other models like reinforcement learning need thousand of exposures to a situation to learn it.

Early years Smith attended West Perry High School in rural Perry County, Pennsylvania, and was a USA Today Honorable Mention All-USA selection in football. College career Musa Smith rushed for 2,202 yards and 19 touchdowns on 454 carries (4.9 yards per carry) during his three-year career at Georgia. This included a spectacular junior campaign in 2002, when he rushed for 1,324 yards and eight touchdowns on 261 carries (5.1 yards per carry), becoming the first Georgia running back to pass 1,000-yards in a season since Garrison Hearst in 1992. Smith played a starring role in Georgia's 2003 Sugar Bowl victory over Florida State on January 1, 2003, carrying the ball 23 times for 145 yards in Georgia's 26-13 win. Professional career Pre-draft Baltimore Ravens Smith being tackled by Domata Peko of the Cincinnati Bengals in 2006. Smith was drafted with the 13th pick of the third round (77th overall) in the 2003 NFL Draft. He played sparingly for much of 2003 and 2004. During a Week 11 game with the Dallas Cowboys in 2004, Smith was horse-collar tackled from behind by safety Roy Williams. Smith's right leg was trapped under the weight of his body, resulting in a severe compound fracture of his right tibia. The injury basically put Smith out of action for two seasons (he played only one game in 2005) and led to the NFL banning the tackle in May 2005. In the 2006 Ravens training camp, Smith outplayed Mike Anderson in the battle for the backup running back job behind Jamal Lewis. In three preseason games in 2006, Smith was tied for the NFL lead with LaMont Jordan with 123 rushing yards on 13 carries (7.9 yards per carry). In total, Smith has rushed for 262 yards and three touchdowns on 62 carries (4.2 yards per carry) in 34 regular season appearances with the Baltimore Ravens, he has also caught 28 passes for 180 yards as of the end of the 2006 season. He was the backup to Willis McGahee and had an increased role in the 2007 season as in past years he mainly played on special teams. Smith had 264 rushing yards and two touchdowns that year. Through his stay with the Ravens, Smith collected 132 rushes for 496 yards, and four touchdowns on a 3.8 yard average. He also had 54 catches for 363 yards, on a 6.7 yard receiving average.

Quarantine in Australia Dog at work searching for fruit in the luggage of passengers embarking from a boat to Tasmania AQIS's import and export inspection and certification is essential to maintaining Australia's highly favourable animal, plant and human health status and access to export markets. Quarantine controls at Australia's borders minimise the risk of exotic pests and diseases to protect Australia's agriculture industries and environment. AQIS does this by specialist Federal law enforcement officers known as Quarantine & Exports Inspectors, or 'Quarantine Officers'. History On 30 March 1908, the Commonwealth Quarantine service came into operation and took over quarantine stations in every Australian state, as allowed in section 2A of the Quarantine Act 1908. The 1956 Summer Olympics held in Melbourne, were prevented by the quarantine regulations to host the equestrian events, therefore they were held in Stockholm, Sweden, five months earlier. Role of AQIS AQIS was the agency responsible for animal, plant and human quarantine border controls, of passengers and cargo. AQIS officers used X-ray machines and sniffer dogs in airports, seaports and mail centres to search for quarantine risk material. Along with Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) AQIS administered the Imported Food Programme, ensuring that food commercially imported into Australia meets Australia's Quarantine Standards and the Food Standards Code. AQIS also provided inspection and certification for a range of agricultural products exported from Australia, to ensure compliance with overseas countries importation requirements.

Born in Havana, Mendieta left for the United States in 1961. Early life and exile Mendieta was born on November 18, 1948, in Havana, Cuba, to a wealthy family prominent in the country's politics and society. Her father Ignacio Alberto Mendieta de Liz√°ur was an attorney and nephew of Carlos Mendieta, who was installed as president by Fulgencio Batista for just under two years; her mother, Raquel Oti de Rojas, was a chemist, researcher, and granddaughter of Carlos Maria de Rojas, a sugar mill owner celebrated for his role in the war against Spain for Cuban independence.Roulet, Laura. \\"Esculturas Rupestres and other Works by Ana Mendieta.\\" Cuba, edited by Alan West-Dur√°n, vol. 1, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2012, pp. 270‚Äì274.

Ana, aged 12, and her 15-year-old sister Raquelin were sent to the United States by their parents to live in Dubuque, Iowa through Operation Peter Pan, a collaborative program run by the US government and the Catholic Charities. Mendieta and her sister Raquelin were among 14,000 children who immigrated to the United States through this program in 1961. Mendieta's first two years in the United States consisted of constant alternation from foster homes and orphanages. The sisters were able to stay together during this time due to a power of attorney signed by their parents mandating that they not be separated. Mendieta and her sister spent their first weeks in refugee camps before moving between several institutions and foster homes throughout Iowa.Ana Mendieta Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. In 1966, Mendieta was reunited with her mother and younger brother; her father joined them in 1979, having spent 18 years in a political prison in Cuba for his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion. Education In Cuba, Mendieta grew up as a sheltered, upper-class child. Mendieta attended an all- girls Catholic private school. When she and her sister were sent to Iowa, they were enrolled in a reform school because the court wanted to avoid sending them to a state institution. When Mendieta studied English in school, her vocabulary was very limited. In junior high school, she discovered a love for art. Mendieta was first a French major and art minor, but when she transferred to the University of Iowa, she was inspired by the avant-garde community and the hills of Iowa's landscape. She earned a BA (enrolled 1969‚Äì1972) and MA in painting and an MFA (enrolled 1972‚Äì1977) in Intermedia under the instruction of acclaimed artist Hans Breder. In college, Mendieta's work focused on blood and violence toward women. Her interest in spiritualism, religion, and primitive rituals developed during this time. She said that she faced a great deal of discrimination in art school. After graduate school, she moved to New York City. Work Through the course of her career, Mendieta created work in Cuba, Mexico, Italy, and the United States. Her work was somewhat autobiographical, drawing from her history of being displaced from her natal Cuba, and focused on themes including feminism, violence, life, death, identity, place and belonging. Her works are generally associated with the four basic elements of nature. Mendieta often focused on a spiritual and physical connection with the Earth. Mendieta felt that by uniting her body with the earth she could become whole again: \\"Through my earth/body sculptures, I become one with the earth ... I become an extension of nature and nature becomes an extension of my body. This obsessive act of reasserting my ties with the earth is really the reactivation of primeval beliefs ... [in] an omnipresent female force, the after image of being encompassing within the womb, is a manifestation of my thirst for being.\\" During her lifetime, Mendieta produced over 200 works of art using earth as a sculptural medium. Her techniques were mainly influenced by Afro-Cuban traditions.Manzor, Lillian. \\"Performing Arts: Performance Art.\\" Cuba, edited by Alan West-Dur√°n, vol. 2, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2012, pp. 732‚Äì735.

Membership in Artists In Residence Inc In 1978, Ana Mendieta joined the Artists In Residence Inc (A.I.R. Gallery) in New York, which was the first gallery for women to be established in the United States. The venture allowed the opportunity for Mendieta to network with other women artists at the forefront of the era's feminist movement. During that time, Mendieta was also actively involved in the administration and maintenance of the A.I.R. In an unpublished statement, Mendieta noted that \\"It is crucial for me to be a part of all my art works. As a result of my participation, my vision becomes a reality and part of my experiences.\\" At the same time, after two years of her involvement at A.I.R. she concluded that \\"American Feminism as it stands is basically a white middle class movement\\", and sought to challenge the limits of this perspective through her art. She met her future husband Carl Andre at the gallery when he served on a panel titled \\"How has women's art practices affected male artist social attitudes?\\"Sneed, Gillian (October 12, 2010). \\"The Case of Ana Mendieta\\". Art in America. Retrieved February 12, 2015. Her resignation in 1982 is attributed, in part, to a dispute instigated by Andre over a collaborative art piece the couple had submitted. In a 2001 journal article, Kat Griefen, director of A.I.R from 2006 to 2011, wrote, > The letter of resignation did not cite any reasons for her departure, but a > number of fellow A.I.R. artists remember the related events. For a recent > benefit Mendieta and Carl Andre had donated a collaborative piece. As was > the policy, all works needed to be delivered by the artist. Edelson recalls > that Andre took offense, instigating a disagreement, which, in part, led to > Mendieta's resignation. Even without this incident, according to another > member, Pat Lasch, Mendieta's association with the now legendary Andre > surely played some role in her decision. In 1983, Mendieta was awarded the Rome Prize from the American Academy in Rome. While in residence in Rome, Mendieta began creating art \\"objects\\", including drawings and sculptures. She continued to use natural elements in her work. Silueta Series (1973‚Äì1980) The Silueta Series (1973‚Äì1980) involved Mendieta creating female silhouettes in nature‚Äîin mud, sand, and grass‚Äîwith natural materials ranging from leaves and twigs to blood, and making body prints or painting her outline or silhouette onto a wall. In a 1981 artist statement, Mendieta said: > I have been carrying out a dialogue between the landscape and the female > body (based on my own silhouette). I believe this has been a direct result > of my having been torn from my homeland (Cuba) during my adolescence. I am > overwhelmed by the feeling of having been cast from the womb (nature). My > art is the way I re-establish the bonds that unite me to the universe. It is > a return to the maternal source. When she began her Silueta Series in the 1970s, Mendieta was one of many artists experimenting with the emerging genres of land art, body art, and performance art. The films and photographs of Siluetas are in connection with the figures surrounding her body. Mendieta was possibly the first to combine these genres in what she called \\"earth-body\\" sculptures.Jacob, Mary Jane. \\"Ana Mendieta: The \\"Silueta\\" Series, 1973‚Äì1980.\\" Galerie Lelong, 1991. p. 3. \\"Creating her own style of body art and earth art that she early on called earth-body sculptures\\" LCCN 91-077297. She often used her naked body to explore and connect with the Earth, as seen in her piece Imagen de Yagul, from the series Silueta Works in Mexico 1973‚Äì1977. Mendieta's first use of blood to make art dates from 1972, when she performed Untitled (Death of a Chicken), for which she stood naked in front of a white wall holding a freshly decapitated chicken by its feet as its blood spattered her naked body.Imagen de Yagul, from the series Silueta Works in Mexico 1973‚Äì1977. SF MoMA. Appalled by the brutal rape and murder of nursing student Sarah Ann Ottens at the University of Iowa, Mendieta smeared herself with blood and had herself tied to a table in 1973, inviting an audience in to bear witness in Untitled (Rape Scene).Ana Mendieta, Untitled (Rape Scene) (1973) Tate Modern, London.Kay Larson (February 16, 2001), Vito Acconci and Ana Mendieta ‚Äì 'A Relationship Study, 1969‚Äì1976', The New York Times. Professor and art historian Kaira Caba√±as writes about Untitled (Rape Scene): > Her body was the subject and object of the work. She used it to emphasize > the societal conditions by which the female body is colonized as the object > of male desire and ravaged under masculine aggression. Mendieta's corporeal > presence demanded the recognition of a female subject. The previously > invisible, unnamed victim of rape gained an identity. The audience was > forced to reflect on its responsibility; its empathy was elicited and > translated to the space of awareness in which sexual violence could be > addressed. In a slide series, People Looking at Blood Moffitt (1973), she pours blood and rags on a sidewalk and photographs a seemingly endless stream of people walking by without stopping, until the man next door (the storefront window bears the name H. F. Moffitt) comes out to clean it up. Mendieta also created the female silhouette using nature as both her canvas and her medium. She used her body to create silhouettes in the grass; she created silhouettes in sand and dirt; she created silhouettes of fire and filmed them burning. Untitled (Och√∫n) (1981), named for the Santer√≠a goddess of waters, once pointed southward from the shore at Key Biscayne, Florida. √ëa√±igo Burial (1976), with a title taken from the popular name for an Afro-Cuban religious brotherhood, is a floor installation of black candles dripping wax in the outline of the artist's body. Through these works, which cross the boundaries of performance, film, and photography, Mendieta explored her relationship with a place as well as a larger relationship with mother Earth or the \\"Great Goddess\\" figure.Blocker, Jane. Where Is Ana Mendieta?: Identity, Performativity, and Exile. Duke University Press, May 1999. p. 47‚Äì48. Mary Jane Jacob suggests in her exhibition catalog Ana Mendieta: The \\"Silueta\\" Series (1973‚Äì1980) that much of Mendieta's work was influenced by her interest in the religion Santer√≠a, as well as a connection to Cuba. Jacob attributes Mendieta's \\"ritualistic use of blood,\\" and the use of gunpowder, earth, and rock to Santer√≠a's ritualistic traditions. Jacob, Mary Jane. \\"Ana Mendieta: The \\"Silueta\\" Series, 1973‚Äì1980.\\" Galerie Lelong, 1991. pp. 4, 10, 17. \\"[p. 4:] Santeria was a source of inspiration for Mendieta.

Mendieta continued in 1973 the ritualistic use of blood ... [p. 17:] Some of Mendieta's materials can also be linked to Santeria. Gunpowder, which she had intuitively begun to use to burn her silhouette into the earth, trees, or rock, is employed in Santeria rituals to make mystic ground drawings and summon the spirits.\\" Jacob also points out the significance of the mother figure, referring to the Mayan deity Ix Chel, the mother of the gods.Jacob, Mary Jane. \\"Ana Mendieta: The \\"Silueta\\" Series, 1973‚Äì1980.\\" Galerie Lelong, 1991. p. 14. \\"In recapturing spirits close to her own origins, Mendieta also turned to Ix Chel, a Mayan deity considered to be Our Mother, the mother of the gods and the patron saint of women and goddess of childbirth.\\" Many have interpreted Mendieta's recurring use of this mother figure, and her own female silhouette, as feminist art. However, because Mendieta's work explores many ideas including life, death, identity, and place all at once, it cannot be categorized as part of one idea or movement. Claire Raymond argues that the Silueta Series, as a photographic archive, should be read for its photographicity rather than merely as documentation of earthworks. In Corazon de Roca con Sangre (Rock Heart with Blood) (1975) Mendieta kneels next to an impression of her body that has been cut into the soft muddy riverbank. Photo etchings of the Rupestrian Sculptures (1981) As documented in the book Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works, edited by Bonnie Clearwater, before her death, Mendieta was working on a series of photo-etchings of cave sculptures she had created at Escaleras de Jaruco, Jaruco State Park in Havana, Cuba.Clearwater, Bonnie, ed. Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works. Grassfield Press, November 1993. p. 11. Her sculptures were entitled Rupestrian Sculptures (1981)‚Äîthe title refers to living among rocks‚Äîand the book of photographic etchings that Mendieta was created to preserve these sculptures is a testament to the intertextuality of Mendieta's work. Clearwater explains how the photographs of Mendieta's sculptures were often as important as the piece they were documenting because the nature of Mendieta's work was so impermanent. Mendieta spent as much time and thought on the creation of the photographs as she did on the sculptures themselves. Mendieta returned to Havana, the place of her birth, for this project, but she was still exploring her sense of displacement and loss, according to Clearwater.Clearwater, Bonnie, ed. Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works. Grassfield Press, November 1993. p. 18. The Rupestrian Sculptures that Mendieta created were also influenced by the Ta√≠no people, \\"native inhabitants of the pre-Hispanic Antilles,\\" which Mendieta became fascinated by and studied.Clearwater, Bonnie, ed. Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works. Grassfield Press, November 1993. p. 12. Mendieta had completed five photo-etchings of the Rupestrian Sculptures before she died in 1985. The book Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works, published in 1993, contains both photographs of the sculptures as well as Mendieta's notes on the project.Clearwater, Bonnie, ed., Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works. Grassfield Press, November 1993. p. 20. Body Tracks (1982) Body Tracks (Rastros Corporales) debuted on April 8, 1982, in Franklin Furnace in New York City. The tracks are long, blurry marks made by Mendieta on a large piece of white paper attached to a wall. While recordings of the sacred music of Afro-Cuban Santeria are heard, Mendieta dipped her hands and forearms into a mixture of tempura paint and animal blood, pressed her hands and arms firmly to its surface and slid down towards the floor.Cathy Curtis (March 20, 1989), Mendieta Exhibit Reveals Lush, Primal Power Los Angeles Times. The performance was documented in the 1987 film Ana Mendieta: Fuego de Tierra, and described by scholar Alexandra Gonzenbach: > In the short piece, the artist enters the studio space, while Cuban music > plays in the background. She dips her hands and forearms into animal blood, > places her back to the camera, lifts her arms and places them on a large > sheet of white paper attached to a wall, and then proceeds to slowly drag > her arms down the page, until almost reaching the bottom. She then walks off > screen and out of the performance space. The camera, documentation, and > performance stops. The resultant pieces of paper were preserved by the artist after the event, and appear now as works of art in their own right in the collection of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University. A still photo from the exhibit was the cover art of the Third Woman Press edition of the feminist anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (2002, ) Film works (1971‚Äì1980) Though well known for her photographs, Mendieta's experimentations with film rose to critical acclaim on the occasion of the 2016 exhibition \\"Ana Mendieta: Experimental and Interactive Films\\" at Galerie Lelong, New York.Randy Kennedy, \\"A Word With: Raquelin Mendieta\\".

Gallery in New York in 1979. She also curated and wrote the introductory catalog essay for an exhibition at A.I.R. in 1981 entitled Dialectics of Isolation: An Exhibition of Third World Women Artists of the United States, which featured the work of artists such as Judy Baca, Senga Nengudi, Howardena Pindell, and Zarina. The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York hosted Mendieta's first survey exhibition in 1987. Since her death, Mendieta has been recognized with international solo museum retrospectives such as \\"Ana Mendieta\\", Art Institute of Chicago (2011); and \\"Ana Mendieta in Context: Public and Private Work\\", De La Cruz Collection, Miami (2012).Ana Mendieta Alison Jacques Gallery, London. In 2004 the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., organized \\"Earth Body, Sculpture and Performance\\", a major retrospective that travelled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Des Moines Art Center, Iowa, and Miami Art Museum, Florida (2004). Mendieta's work features in many major public collections, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Museum of Modern Art in New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Mus√©e d'Art Moderne et Contemporain, Geneva; and Tate Collection, London. Death and controversy Ana Mendieta died on September 8, 1985, in New York City, after falling from her 34th-floor apartment in Greenwich Village at 300 Mercer Street, where she lived with her husband of eight months, minimalist sculptor Carl Andre, who may have pushed her out of the window.Carl Swanson (April 1, 2012), Maximum Outrage Over Minimalist Sculptor New York. She fell 33 stories onto the roof of a deli.Sean O'Hagan (September 21, 2013), Ana Mendieta: death of an artist foretold in blood The Guardian. Just prior to her death, neighbors heard the couple arguing violently.William Wilson (February 18, 1998), Haunting Works From Cuban Exile Mendieta Los Angeles Times. There were no eyewitnesses to the events that led up to Mendieta's death.Vincent Patrick (June 10, 1990), A Death In The Art World The New York Times. A recording of Andre's 911 call showed him saying: \\"My wife is an artist, and I'm an artist, and we had a quarrel about the fact that I was more, eh, exposed to the public than she was. And she went to the bedroom, and I went after her, and she went out the window.\\" In 1988, Andre was tried and acquitted of her murder. During three years of legal proceedings, Andre's lawyer described Mendieta's death as a possible accident or suicide. The judge found Andre not guilty on grounds of reasonable doubt. The acquittal caused an uproar among feminists in the art world, and remains controversial to this day. In 2010, a symposium called Where Is Ana Mendieta? was held at New York University to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death. In May 2014, the feminist protest group No Wave Performance Task Force staged a protest in front of the Dia Art Foundation's retrospective on Carl Andre. The group deposited piles of animal blood and guts in front of the establishment, with protesters donning transparent tracksuits with \\"I Wish Ana Mendieta Was Still Alive\\" written on them. In March 2015, the No Wave Performance Task Force and a group of feminist poets from New York City traveled to Beacon, New York, to protest the Andre retrospective at Dia:Beacon, where they cried loudly in the main gallery, made \\"siluetas\\" in the snow on museum grounds, and stained the snow with paprika, sprinkles, and fake blood. In April 2017, protesters at an Andre retrospective handed out cards at the Geffen Contemporary with the statement: \\"Carl Andre is at MOCA Geffen. ¬øD√≥nde est√° Ana Mendieta?\\" (Where is Ana Mendieta?). This was followed by an open letter to MOCA Director Philippe Vergne protesting the exhibit from the group the Association of Hysteric Curators. Legacy In 2009, Mendieta was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Cintas Foundation. Ana Mendieta's estate is currently managed by the Galerie Lelong in New York City. The estate is also represented by Alison Jacques Gallery, London. In 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for her that began, \\"Mendieta's art, sometimes violent, often unapologetically feminist and usually raw, left an indelible mark before her life was cut short.\\" In 2010 she was the subject of Richard Move's controversial Where is Ana Mendieta? 25 Years Later - An Exhibition and Symposium, which included his film, BloodWork - The Ana Mendieta Story.

This 850-acre resort in Miyazaki, on the southern island of Kyushu, boasts five hotels, several golf-courses, a botanical park and a zoo; but due to bankruptcy, the dome was later bought by Ripplewood, an American private-equity fund, in 2001 for 16.2 billion yen (Dollars 148,000,000m) which is under 10% of its construction costs of 200 billion yen (1,826,000,000m). Ripplewood had also invested an additional 3.5 billion (Dollars 32m) yen on renovations for the dome; but even after the remodeling of the resort, the hotel closed down with liabilities of 276 billion yen (Dollars 2,520,984,000m). The Ocean Dome water park, which opened in 1993 along with the rest of the complex, was visited by 1.25 million people in the peak year of fiscal 1995. Other accommodations within the area include the Seaside Hotel Phoenix, the Sun Hotel Phoenix, and the Cottage Himuka, with 14 cottages in a wooded setting. Depending on the season, entrance cost for the simulated dome was ¬•2600 ($21.17) for an adult and ¬•1600 ($13.03) for a child.

Frank Underhill, born in Stouffville, Ontario, was educated at the University of Toronto and the University of Oxford where he was a member of the Fabian Society. He was influenced by social and political critics such as Bernard Shaw and Goldwin Smith. He taught history at the University of Saskatchewan from 1914 until 1927 with a long interruption during World War I during which he served as an officer in the Hertfordshire Regiment of the British Army on the Western Front. He also taught from 1927 until 1955 at the University of Toronto.

During World War II, Underhill moved away from socialism and became a left-wing liberal continentalist.Bicha, Karel D. \\"Five Canadian Historians and the U.S.A.\\" American Review of Canadian Studies, Vol. 29, 1999. He remained a committed anti-imperialist and was almost dismissed from the University of Toronto in 1941 for suggesting that Canada would drift away from the British Empire and draw closer to the United States. His struggle with the university became a landmark in the history of academic freedom in Canada.Horn, Michiel. Academic Freedom in Canada: A History, University of Toronto Press: Toronto, 1999. , Google Print, p. 154. Underhill's most important writings are collected in the 1960 book of essays, In Search of Canadian Liberalism. In the essays Underhill covered many Canadian concerns such as politics before and after the Canadian Confederation, relations with the United States and Britain and assessments of the actions of Canadian public figures. The essays were praised in the Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature for their \\"iconoclasm and trenchant wit often bordering on sarcasm.\\" Underhill's other notable works include Canadian Political Parties, 1957; The Image of Confederation, 1964; and Upper Canadian Politics in the 1850s, 1967. Underhill was a strong supporter of the United States during the Cold War. He also became a supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada, particularly once his long-time friend, Lester Pearson joined the government.

Benaroya's influence grew, as he argued that any socialist movement in the city must take the form of a federation in which all national groups could participate.

The F√©d√©ration Socialiste Ouvri√®re  Solidaridad Obradera Idealistic and pragmatic at the same time, in Thessaloniki Benaroya played a leading role in the creation, in 1909, of the mainly Jewish Socialist Workers' Federation, or in Ladino, Federacion. The organization took this name because, built on the federative model of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, it was conceived as a federation of separate sections, each representing the four main ethnic groups of the city: Jews, Bulgarians, Greeks and Turks. It published its literature in the languages of these four groups (i.e., Ladino, Bulgarian, Greek and Turkish, respectively) but in practice the two latter sections were under-represented if not nonexistent. The democratic Federacion soon became, under Benaroya's leadership, the strongest socialist party in the Ottoman Empire. It created combative trade unions, attracted important intellectuals and gained a solid base of support among Macedonian workers while cultivating strong links with the Second International. From 1910 to 1911 Benaroya edited its influential newspaper, the Solidaridad Ovradera, printed in Ladino. Unlike other parties which were organised on ethnic lines, as a cross-community group the Federacion was allowed by the Ottoman authorities. A prominent Bulgarian member, Dimitar Vlahov, was a socialist MP in the new Ottoman parliament until 1912.Mete Tun√ßay, Erik Jan Z√ºrcher, Socialism and nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, 1876-1923, British Academic Press, International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam, 1994, , p. 65.Mary C.

Indeed, its leaders initially supported the Young Turks, and Benaroya participated in the \\"Army of Freedom\\" march on Istanbul to help put down the Countercoup of 1909. Alarmed by the growing power of socialist groups, the CUP subsequently launched a crack down, under which Benaroya was jailed three times, in early November 1910, June 1911 (when he was deported to Serbia) and February 1912 (when he was deported to Greece).Iakovos J.

Opposed to the First World War, Benaroya and another Jewish socialist were exiled for two and a half years at the island of Naxos. In contrast to most of the prominent socialists in the pre-1913 Greece who followed Eleftherios Venizelos, Benaroya and the Federacion, adhering to its internationalist ideals, mobilized for neutrality. As this happened to the same policy as pursued by King Constantine and his militaristic entourage, this led to the loss of support for Federacion in Macedonia. From 1915 onwards the Federacion was buoyed by the popular reaction to the war. Both monarchist and Venizelist policy actually assisted the emancipation and the radicalization of the left, and Benaroya, keeping equal distance from both established political groups, was quick to turn the situation to advantage. In the 1915 general elections Federacion sent two deputies representing Thessaloniki (Benaroya and Alberto Couriel) to the Greek Parliament, while it lost by only a few votes for a third seat. It already had strong links with internationalist groups and organizations all over Greece and abroad; from them the Socialist Workers Party was to spring up in due time. However, another socialist faction, headed by the future Prime Minister Alexandros Papanastasiou, who sided with Venizelos in foreign affairs, also had deputies elected in the same election. Papanastasiou and other reform-minded socialists strongly supported Venizelos' liberal brand of nationalism. Benaroya and the Federacion, on the other hand, were influenced by Austromarxists such as Victor Adler, Otto Bauer and Karl Renner, who, sensitive to matters national, searched ways to utilize socialism as a cohesive force for the decrepit Habsburg Monarchy; they elaborated the principle of personal autonomy, according to which national consciousness should be depoliticized and become a personal matter. Modern states should be based on free association and allow self-definition and self-organization of ethnicities in cultural affairs, while a mixed parliament, proportionally representing all nations of the realm, should decide on economic and political questions. The Federacion traced the origins of its federative position in Balkan authors of the Enlightenment like Rigas Velestinlis, and stressed that the forthcoming peace should exclude any change of borders or transfer of populations. The Socialist Workers' Party, that was created under Benaroya's initiative near the end of the First World War, followed closely the Federacion's theses on national self-determination, and wanted to transform the Greek state into a federation of autonomous provinces that would safeguard the rights of minorities and participate in a federative Republic of the Balkan peoples.  Jewish ethnic activism  Benaroya was interested in the Jewish Question since the beginning of his career and made efforts to promote Jewish causes throughout it. His first book was The Jewish Question and Social Democracy (1908) while once in Thessaloniki he founded a group called the Sephardic Circle of Socialist Studies. He also played a leading role in the creation, in 1909, of the mainly Jewish Federacion. Apprehensive of what the resurgent Greek self-confidence behind the Megali Idea might mean for Jews in Greece and Asia Minor, at the time he labelled the campaign imperialist. He envisaged a state free from any ethnic divisions where Jews could exist unpersecuted and free, retaining their religion. Some of his fears might have been argued to have been realised when after the city's fire, the Venizelos administration did not rebuild the original Jewish section, adopting instead a French town plan, but a considerable proportion of the Jewish population remained throughout the following decades, with the Greek government guaranteeing their rights in March 1926. Benaroya was always very interested in combating anti-Semitism, while over later years he shifted his emphasis to reflect the sizable Thessaloniki Jewish community that chose to remain within the Greek state.  Benaroya approaches the Democratic Union  The tomb of Benaroya in the cemetery of Holon. After a historic meeting with Venizelos, Benaroya's tactical abilities resulted in the birth of the Socialist Labour Party of Greece (later named Communist) and the General Confederation of Greek Workers, which helped unite Greek workers. Government persecution of the new movement led to a general strike in 1919. Subsequently, social and political polarization, as well as the prestige of the newborn Soviet Union, strengthened the radicals and before long the party was affiliated to the Leninist Third International. The Labour Centre of Salonica, another creation of Benaroya's, which united more than twelve thousand workers of all nationalities, a good part of them Jews, became the focus of radical socialism. The fall of the Venizelos government (1920) and the war in Anatolia fuelled even more dissent, leading to anti-war riots. In the wake of these developments Benaroya, thrown in prison again, as well as most of the leading members of the party, were marginalized by the radicals. On the other hand, moderate socialists under Alexandros Papanastasiou started preparing their own revolution: their primary aim was now to overthrow the Greek monarchy. In 1922 the Greek army was defeated by the Kemalists and a military revolution ensued that deposed King Constantine. The new government undertook many reforms, notably the distribution of big estates to peasants, but after a general strike, workers were violently suppressed. A little later, in December 1923, Benaroya, together with Couriel and Kordatos, who preferred social-democratic organizational models and opposed radical Bolshevisation considering the circumstances not suitable for a revolution, were expelled from the Communist Party of Greece and he was obliged to quit the editorship of Avanti. Afterwards he focused his action on Thessaloniki's Jewish community, and participated in a splinter group that‚Äîwith help from Papanastasiou, then Prime Minister‚Äîtried unsuccessfully to split the Communist Party. At that time he and Papanastasiou agreed on the need for reforms and not revolution, and on the priority of abolishing the monarchy. An equally urgent imperative, though, was combating racism and anti-Semitism. Benaroya remained politically active after 1924 but as he stayed outside the principal political formations of the left, the communists and Papanastasiou's socialists, his capacity for action was increasingly restricted. In Thessaloniki he had a difficult political life, especially after the Liberals' more nationalist turn by the end of the decade, and the repeated coups d'√©tat of 1935 that destroyed the Republic and the hopes of the democratic left. In the 1940s he lost a son during the Greco- Italian war, he survived the Nazi concentration camps, and led a small socialist party in Greece after his return collaborating himself with Alexandros Svolos. He left to Israel in 1953, to Holon, where he ran a small newspaper kiosk. He died in 1979, aged ninety two, in poverty.

Ibn Rushd later reports this event and describes how Ibn Tufayl then inspired him to write his famous Aristotelian commentaries: Ibn Rushd became Ibn Tufayl's successor after he retired in 1182; Ibn Tufayl died several years later in Morocco in 1185. The astronomer Nur Ed-Din Al-Bitruji was also a disciple of Ibn Tufayl. Hayy ibn Yaqzan Ibn Tufail was the author of ·∏§ayy ibn Yaq·∫ìƒÅn ( Alive, son of Awake), also known as Philosophus Autodidactus in Latin, a philosophical romance and allegorical novel inspired by Avicennism and Sufism, and which tells the story of an autodidactic feral child, raised by a gazelle and living alone on a desert island, who, without contact with other human beings, discovers ultimate truth through a systematic process of reasoned inquiry. Hayy ultimately comes into contact with civilization and religion when he meets a castaway named Absal. He determines that certain trappings of religion, namely imagery and dependence on material goods, are necessary for the multitude in order that they might have decent lives. However, imagery and material goods are distractions from the truth and ought to be abandoned by those whose reason recognizes that they are. Ibn Tufail's Philosophus Autodidactus was written as a response to al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers. In the 13th century, Ibn al-Nafis later wrote the Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Siera al-Nabawiyyah (known as Theologus Autodidactus in the West) as a response to Ibn Tufail's Philosophus Autodidactus. Hayy ibn Yaqdhan had a significant influence on both Arabic literature and European literature, and it went on to become an influential best-seller throughout Western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.Avner Ben-Zaken, Reading Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan: A Cross- Cultural History of Autodidacticism (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011). .G.

A Latin translation of the work, entitled Philosophus Autodidactus, first appeared in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger. The first English translation (by Simon Ockley) was published in 1708.

It supports the work of the late Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, a spiritual teacher with the honorary title Gurudeva. The mission of the temple is to preserve and promote the Saivite Hindu religion. Membership in the temple extends to many countries of the world, including the US, Canada, Mauritius, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Sri Lanka and several European nations. Members are organized into regional temple missions with the goal of supporting Shaivism in their families, communities, and in the global community under the leadership of Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami. History The temple was founded in 1949 by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, a self- appointed Saiva Hindu guru from the United States. The name of the temple is from the Tamil language and could be roughly rendered in English as \\"The temple of God ≈öiva's Revealed Truth.\\" The Saiva Siddhanta temple was incorporated under the laws of the United States of America in the State of California on December 30, 1957, and received recognition of its US Internal Revenue tax exempt status as a temple on February 12, 1962. Among America's oldest Hindu institutions, it established its international headquarters at Kauai Aadheenam, also known as Kauai's Hindu Monastery, on Kauai, Hawaii, on February 5, 1970. Kauai's Hindu Monastery has two temples, Iraivan Temple and Kadavul Temple. Purpose Thousands attend the monthly Ganesha homa at the temple's Spiritual Park in Mauritius. The core purpose of the temple is to protect, preserve and promote the Saivite Hindu religion as embodied in the Tamil culture, traditions and scriptures of South India and Sri Lanka. It is based on the precepts of the Nandinatha Sampradaya, and traces its origins to a two-thousand-year-old lineage of the Kailasa ParamparƒÅ Gurus. The current head of the temple is Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami. The temple is oriented to serving those of Tamil descent, especially those from Sri Lanka. However, its membership is open to seekers of all ethnic backgrounds who wish to follow this ancient religious and cultural pattern. Currently, more than 85% of the global membership are born Hindus living, mostly, in Mauritius, Malaysia, Singapore, India and Sri Lanka. Many of the members living in the West are converts to Hinduism who live the path which leads souls through service, worship, sadhana and yoga toward God Realization. The Saiva Siddhanta temple supports all major projects supervised by Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami, including: * Construction of the Iraivan Temple on Kauai, a white granite stone Siva temple sculpted in India. * Publication of the magazine Hinduism Today. The magazine is widely read among Hindus in India and in the worldwide diaspora. Thus, it provides an important means for worldwide networking, which is widely acknowledged. * Publication and distribution of books, booklets, and online material aimed at educating Hindus and non-Hindus about the Saivite Hindu religion. * Teaching through lessons, literature, study courses, travel- study programs and youth retreats those actively pursuing the spiritual path under his guidance. * Establishment and administration of charity organizations for Hindus worldwide, under the umbrella of Hindu Heritage Endowment. Theology The Saiva Siddhanta temple belongs to a monistic branch of the school of Saiva Siddhanta. Its theology is grounded in the Vedas, Saiva Agamas and the ancient Tirumantiram, a Tamil scripture composed by Tirumular. The temple's theology is based on a synthesis of devotional theism and uncompromising nondualism. It is referred to as \\"monistic theism\\", which recognizes that monism and dualism/pluralism are equally valid perspectives. God is both within us and outside of us, the Creator and the creation, immanent and transcendent. Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami explains: Kauai Hindu Monastery Kauai Hindu Monastery is situated on the Kauai island in Hawaii, consisting of two temples: Kadavul Temple and Iraivan Temple.https://www.himalayanacademy.com Kadavul was established in 1973 by Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. Construction of Iraivan began in 1990; it is the first all-stone, white granite temple to be built in the western hemisphere. In the press Referring to the Iraivan Temple, New York Times reporter Michelle Kayal wrote: Since 1973 the temple has maintained a second temple at the Kauai Aadheenam, called Kadavul Temple, which has Siva Nataraja as the enshrined deity.

He is regarded as the father of medieval Jewish Neoplatonism. His works, all written in Arabic and subsequently translated into Hebrew, Latin and Spanish, entered the medical curriculum of the early thirteenth-century universities in Medieval Europe and remained popular throughout the Middle Ages.Jacquart and Micheau, \\"La M√©decine Arabe et l'Occident M√©di√©val\\", Paris: Editions Maisonneuve et Larose, 1990, p.114 Life Little is known of Israeli's background and career. Much that is known comes from the biographical accounts found in The Generations of the Physicians, a work written by the Andalusian author Ibn Juljul in the 2nd half of the tenth century, and in The Generations of the Nations by Sa'id of Toledo, who wrote in the mid-eleventh century.Stern, \\"Biographical note\\", pp. xxiii-xxiv In the thirteenth century, Ibn Abi Usaybi'a also produced an account, which he based on Ibn Juljul as well as other sources, including the History of the Fatimid Dynasty by Israel's pupil Ibn al-Jazzar.Stern, \\"Biographical note\\", p. xxv. Israeli was born in around 832 into a Jewish family in Egypt. He lived the first half of his life in Cairo where he gained a reputation as a skillful oculist. He corresponded with Saadya ben Joseph al- Fayyumi (882-942), one of the most influential figures in the medieval Judaism, prior to his departure from Egypt. In about 904 Israeli was nominated court physician to the last Aghlabid prince, Ziyadat Allah III. Between the years 905-907 he travelled to Kairouan where he studied general medicine under Ishak ibn Amran al-Baghdadi, with whom he is sometimes confounded (\\"Sefer ha- Yashar,\\" p. 10a). Later he served as a doctor to the founder of the Fatimid Dynasty of North Africa, 'Ubaid Allah al-Mahdi, who reigned from 910-934. The caliph enjoyed the company of his Jewish physician on account of the latter's wit and of the repartees in which he succeeded in confounding the Greek al- Hubaish when pitted against him. In Kairouan his fame became widely extended, the works which he wrote in Arabic being considered by the Muslim physicians as \\"more valuable than gems.\\" His lectures attracted a large number of pupils, of whom the two most prominent were Abu Ja'far ibn al-Jazzar, a Muslim, and Dunash ibn Tamim. Israeli studied natural history, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and other scientific topics; he was reputed to be one who knew all the \\"seven sciences\\". Biographers state that he never married or fathered children. He died at Kairouan, Tunisia, in 932. This date is given by most Arabic authorities who give his date of birth as 832. But Abraham ben Hasdai, quoting the biographer Sanah ibn Sa'id al-Kurtubi (\\"Orient, Lit.\\" iv., col. 230), says that Isaac Israeli died in 942. Heinrich Gr√§tz (Geschichte v. 236), while stating that Isaac Israeli lived more than one hundred years, gives the dates 845-940; and Steinschneider (\\"Hebr. Uebers.\\" pp. 388, 755) places his death in 950. He died in Kairouan. Influence In 956 his pupil Dunash Ibn Tamim wrote an extensive commentary on Sefer Yetzirah, a mystical work of cosmogony which attributes great importance to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and their combinations in determining the structure of the universe. In this work he cites Israeli so extensively that a few nineteenth-century scholars misidentified the commentary as Israeli's. Israeli's medical treatises were studied for several centuries both in the original Arabic and in Latin translation. In the eleventh century, Constantine Africanus, a professor at the prestigious Salerno school of medicine, translated some of Israeli's works into Latin. Many medieval Arabic biographical chronicles of physicians list him and his works. Israeli's philosophical works exercised a considerable influence on Christian and Jewish thinkers, and a lesser degree of influence among Muslim intellectuals. In the twelfth century, a group of scholars in Toledo transmitted many Arabic works of science and philosophy into Latin. One of the translators, Gerard of Cremona, rendered Israeli's Book of Definitions (Liber de Definicionibus/Definitionibus) and Book on the Elements (Liber Elementorum) into Latin. Israeli's work was quoted and paraphrased by a number of Christian thinkers including Gundissalinus, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Vincent de Beauvais, Bonaventura, Roger Bacon and Nicholas of Cusa. Isaac Israeli's philosophical influence on Muslim authors is slight at best. The only known quotation of Israeli's philosophy in a Muslim work occurs in Ghayat al-Hakim, a book on magic, produced in eleventh-century Spain, translated into Latin and widely circulated in the West under the title Picatrix. Although there are passages which correspond directly to Israeli's writings, the author does not cite him by name. His influence also extended to Moses Ibn Ezra (c. 1060-1139) who quotes Isaac Israeli without attribution in his treatise The Book of the Garden, explaining the meaning of Metaphor and Literal Expression. The poet and philosopher Joseph Ibn Tzaddiq of Cordoba (d. 1149) authored a work The Microcosm containing many ideas indebted to Israeli. As Neoplatonist philosophy waned, in addition to the Galenic medical tradition of which Israeli was a part, the appreciable influence of Isaac Israeli diminished as well. Claimed works Omnia opera Ysaac A number of works in Arabic, some of which were translated into Hebrew, Latin and Spanish were ascribed to Israeli, and several medical works were allegedly composed by him at the request of al-Mahdi. In 1515 Opera Omnia Isaci was published in Lyon, France, and the editor of this work claimed that the works originally written in Arabic and translated into Latin in 1087 by Constantine of Carthage, who assumed their authorship, were a 'plagiarism' and published them under Israeli's name, together in a collection with works of other physicians that were also and erroneously attributed to Israeli. Those works translated by Constantine of Carthage were used as textbooks at the University of Salerno, the earliest university in Western Europe, where Constantine was a professor of medicine, and remained in use as textbooks throughout Europe until the seventeenth century. He was the first physician to write about tracheotomy in Arabic. He advised a hook to grasp the skin in the neck as Paulus of Aegina did and afterwards Avicenna and Albucasis. Medical works *Kitab al-·∏§ummayat, The Book of Fevers, in Hebrew Sefer ha-·∏≤ada·∏•ot, ◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊ß◊ì◊ó◊ï◊™, a complete treatise, in five books, on the kinds of fever, according to the ancient physicians, especially Hippocrates. *Kitab al-Adwiyah al-Mufradah wa'l-Aghdhiyah, a work in four sections on remedies and aliments. The first section, consisting of twenty chapters, was translated into Latin by Constantine under the title Di√¶t√¶ Universales, and into Hebrew by an anonymous translator under the title ·π¨ib'e ha-Mezonot. The other three parts of the work are entitled in the Latin translation Di√¶t√¶ Particulares; and it seems that a Hebrew translation, entitled Sefer ha-Mis'adim or Sefer ha-Ma'akalim, was made from the Latin. *Kitab al-Baul, or in Hebrew Sefer ha-Shetan, a treatise on urine, of which the author himself made an abridgement. *Kitab al-Isti·∏≥at, in Hebrew Sefer ha-Yesodot and Latin as De Elementis, a medical and philosophical work on the elements, which the author treats according to the ideas of Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen. The Hebrew translation was made by Abraham ben Hasdai at the request of the grammarian David Kimhi. *Manhig ha-Rofe'im, or Musar ha-Rofe'im, a treatise, in fifty paragraphs, for physicians, translated into Hebrew (the Arabic original is not extant), and into German by David Kaufmann under the title Prop√§deutik f√ºr Aerzte (Berliner's \\"Magazin,\\" xi. 97-112). *Kitab fi al-Tirya·∏≥, a work on antidotes. Some writers attribute to Isaac Israeli two other works which figure among Constantine's translations, namely, the Liber Pantegni and the Viaticum, of which there are three Hebrew translations. But the former belongs to Mohammed al-Razi and the latter to 'Ali ibn 'Abbas or, according to other authorities, to Israeli's pupil Abu Jaf'ar ibn al-Jazzar. Philosophical works *Kitab al-·∏§udud wal- Rusum, translated into Hebrew by Nissim b. Solomon (fourteenth century) under the title Sefer ha-Gebulim weha-Reshumim, a philosophical work of which a Latin translation is quoted in the beginning of the Opera Omnia. This work and the Kitab al-Isti·∏≥at were severely, criticized by Maimonides in a letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon (Iggerot ha-Rambam, p. 28, Leipsic, 1859), in which he declared that they had no value, inasmuch as Isaac Israeli ben Solomon was nothing more than a physician. *Kitab Bustan al-·∏§ikimah, on metaphysics. *Kitab al-·∏§ikmah, a treatise on philosophy. *Kitab al-Madkhal fi al-Manti·∏≥, on logic. The last three works are mentioned by Ibn Abi U·π£aibi'a, but no Hebrew translations of them are known. *Sefer ha-Rua·∏• weha-Nefesh, a philosophical treatise, in a Hebrew translation, on the difference between the spirit and the soul, published by Steinschneider in Ha-Karmel (1871, pp. 400‚Äì405). The editor is of opinion that this little work is a fragment of a larger one. *A philosophical commentary on Genesis, in two books, one of which deals with Genesis i. 20. Attributed works Eliakim Carmoly (\\"·∫íiyyon,\\" i. 46) concludes that the Isaac who was so violently attacked by Abraham ibn Ezra in the introduction to his commentary on the Pentateuch, and whom he calls in other places \\"Isaac the Prattler\\", and \\"Ha-Yi·∫ì·∏•a·∏≥,\\" was none other than Isaac Israeli. But if Israeli was attacked by Ibn Ezra he was praised by other Biblical commentators, such as Jacob b. Ruben, a contemporary of Maimonides, and by ·∏§asdai.

It lies five minutes south of Interstate 64, northeast of Evansville, and approximately twenty miles north of the Ohio River. History Lincoln City was laid out in 1872 when the railroad was extended to that point. The community was named for the Lincoln family. Nearby is the Nancy Hanks Lincoln Memorial, as well as the site of the Lincoln log cabin, built in 1816. President Abraham Lincoln spent much of his childhood (from the ages of 7 to 21) on this farm, and as a young man he practiced law at the nearby Spencer County courthouse. Also located in Lincoln City is the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, a national park managed by the National Park Service that includes a Living Historical Farm that attempts to recreate the early nineteenth-century period during which the Lincoln family lived in the area. The living-history farm is a working pioneer-style homestead with a cabin, outbuildings, split rail fences, animals, gardens, and field crops. NPS interpreters in period clothing perform a variety of activities typical of the 1820s, and the farm's grounds are open year-round. The farm is staffed from mid-April through September full-time, and intermittently in October. The Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial is located on Highway 162 across from Lincoln State Park.

Biography Bodybuilding career In a 2005 interview, Ray said, \\"the two influences that were the main reasons that I got into bodybuilding in the first place, was bodybuilders Chris Dickerson and Bob Paris.\\" In a 1990 documentary, Ray cited Fran√ßois Benfatto as a major inspiration, along with Paris. In over 30 major bodybuilding competitions, Ray only failed once to place in the top five. Signing his first professional bodybuilding sponsor contract in 1988, Ray has been featured in six video documentaries; Lifestyles of the Fit & Famous (Biopic), Final Countdown (Contest Prep for Olympia 1998), Inside & Out- Behind the Muscle, a look at his daily life on the Pro Circuit, To The Extreme (Training Video) Best of Shawn Ray (History of Shawn Ray). \\"Fitness After 40\\" which is a biographical and documentary instyle, showcases Shawn's life after the competitive stage being married with his first child while getting back on the Horse and getting in shape. He is mentioned in The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding by Bill Dobbins and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ray also wrote a book about how to become a bodybuilder, named The Shawn Ray Way. Ray has appeared on more Flexible Magazine covers than any bodybuilder in history and has also featured in many fitness and bodybuilding magazines worldwide. Shawn was a co- host on Flex Magazine Workout on ESPN for 5 years as well as hosting bodybuilding competitions for ESPN as a commentator for 8 years.https://www.revistasuplementacao.com.br/impresso/detalhes/2648-mitos-do- bodybuilding-shawn-ray.html Shawn was the Co-Master of Ceremonies for the 2006 and 2007 Mr. Olympia Competitions held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Shawn is the creator of the only charity fundraiser for professional bodybuilding, Vyo Tech Nutritionals presents: Shawn Ray's CHOC Hospital Golf Invitational. Over the last ten years with the help of other pro fitness, figure and bodybuilding champions, as well as supplement companies and magazines, Shawn has helped raise and donate over $55,000.00 to the Children's Hospital of Orange County by hosting this event annually at Black Gold Golf Club in Yorba Linda, CA. Shawn was the first professional bodybuilder to fail the drug testing at the Arnold Classic, which was when he first lost the title in 1990. He went on to win the title again in 1991. Ray retired from competitive bodybuilding in 2001 and is now working with a shaker manufacturer company from Sweden called SmartShake. He placed in the top five at the Mr. Olympia competition for twelve consecutive years from 1990 to 2001, two of those being first runner-up finishes. He promoted the Shawn Ray Colorado Pro/Am Classic Contest-Expo, held in Denver, Colorado in 2006 and 2007. Shawn also produced a DVD titled 'Fitness after 40' in which Shawn tries to get back into shape. Shawn is now a Feature Writer for Muscular Development Magazine and the Host of MD Radio and MDTV as an Interviewer. He is also making a video documentary called Evolution of Bodybuilding ‚Äì The Movie\\" As of 2016, Shawn is in charge of media coverage of The Arnold Classic Sports Festival on behalf of Muscular Development Magazine.

With these rights, the breeder can choose to become the exclusive marketer of the variety, or to license the variety to others. In order to qualify for these exclusive rights, a variety must be new, distinct, uniform, and stable. A variety is: *new if it has not been commercialized for more than one year in the country of protection; *distinct if it differs from all other known varieties by one or more important botanical characteristics, such as height, maturity, color, etc.; *uniform if the plant characteristics are consistent from plant to plant within the variety; *stable if the plant characteristics are genetically fixed and therefore remain the same from generation to generation, or after a cycle of reproduction in the case of hybrid varieties. The breeder must also give the variety an acceptable \\"denomination\\", which becomes its generic name and must be used by anyone who markets the variety. Typically, plant variety rights are granted by national offices after examination. Seed is submitted to the plant variety office, who grow it for one or more seasons, to check that it is distinct, stable, and uniform. If these tests are passed, exclusive rights are granted for a specified period (typically 20/25 years, or 25/30 years for trees and vines). Annual renewal fees are required to maintain the rights. Breeders can bring suit to enforce their rights and can recover damages for infringement. Plant breeders' rights contain exemptions from infringement that are not recognized under patent law. Commonly, there is an exemption for farm-saved seed. Farmers may store this production in their own bins for their own use as seed, but this does not necessarily extend to brown- bag sales of seed. Further sales for propagation purposes are not allowed without the written approval of the breeder. There is also a breeders' exemption (research exemption in the 1991 Act) that allows breeders to use protected varieties as sources of initial variation to create new varieties of plants (1978 Act), or for other experimental purposes (1991 Act). There is also a provision for compulsory licensing to assure public access to protected varieties if the national interest requires it and the breeder is unable to meet the demand. There is tension over the relationship between patent rights and plant breeder's rights. There has been litigation in Australia, the United States, and Canada over the overlap between such rights.Matthew Rimmer. \\"Franklin Barley Patent Law And Plant Breeders' Rights\\", Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law, December 2003, Vol. 10, No. 4, URL http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v10n4/rimmer104.html Each of these cases was decided on the principle that patents and plant breeders' rights were overlapping and not mutually exclusive. Thus, the exemptions from infringement of plant breeders' rights, such as the saved seed exemption, do not create corresponding exemptions from infringement of the patents covering the same plants. Likewise, acts that infringe the plant breeders' rights, such as exportation of the variety, would not necessarily infringe a patent on the variety, which only allows the patent owner to prohibit making, using, or selling the patented invention. International rights In 1957, in France negotiations took place concerned with the protection of new varieties. This led to the creation of the Union Internationale pour la Protection des Obtentions V√©g√©tales (UPOV) and adoption of the first text of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention) in 1961. The purpose of the Convention was to ensure that the member states party to the Convention acknowledge the achievements of breeders of new plant varieties by making available to them an exclusive property right, on the basis of a set of uniform and clearly defined principles. The Convention was revised in Geneva in 1972, 1978 and 1991. Both the 1978 and the 1991 Acts set out a minimum scope of protection and offer member States the possibility of taking national circumstances into account in their legislation. Under the 1978 Act, the minimum scope of the plant breeder's right requires that the holder's prior authorisation is necessary for the production for purposes of commercial marketing, the offering for sale and the marketing of propagating material of the protected variety. The 1991 Act contains more detailed provisions defining the acts concerning propagating material in relation to which the holder's authorisation is required. The breeder's authorisation is also required in relation to any of the specified acts done with harvested material of the variety, unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the propagating material, or if not doing so could constitute an \\"Omega Threat\\" situation. Under that provision, for example, a flower breeder who protects their variety in the Netherlands could block importation of cut flowers of that variety into the Netherlands from Egypt, which does not grant plant breeders' rights, because the breeder had no opportunity to exercise any rights in Egypt. Member countries also have the option to require the breeder's authorization with respect to the specified acts as applied to products directly obtained from the harvested material (such as flour or oil from grain, or juice from fruit), unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the harvested material. The UPOV Convention also establishes a multilateral system of national treatment, under which citizens of any member state are treated as citizens of all member states for the purpose of obtaining plant breeders rights. It also sets up a multilateral priority filing system, under which an application for protection filed in one member state establishes a filing date for applications filed in all other member states within one year of that original filing date. This allows a breeder to file in any one member country within the one-year period required to preserve the novelty of their variety, and the novelty of the variety will still be recognized when the filing is done in other member countries within one year of the original filing date. However, if the applicant does not wish to make use of priority filing, he or she has four years in which to apply in all other member states, excepting the United States, for all species except tree and vine species in which case he or she has six years to make application. More information can be obtained in Article 10 (1) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2100/94 of 27 July 2004. The trigger to start the four- or six-year period is not actually the date on which the first filing is made but the date on which the variety was first commercialised. The UPOV Convention is not self-executing. Each member state must adopt legislation consistent with the requirements of the convention and submit that legislation to the UPOV Secretariat for review and approval by the UPOV Council, which consists of all the UPOV member states acting in committee. In compliance with these treaty obligations, the United Kingdom enacted the Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964. Similar legislation was passed in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and New Zealand. In 1970 the United States followed the lead of seventeen Western European nations and passed the Plant Variety Protection Act 1970 (US). This legislation provided protection to developers of novel, sexually reproduced plants. However, the United States originally acceded to the UPOV Convention on the basis of the Plant Patent Act and did not bring the PVP Act into compliance with UPOV requirements until 1984 when the Commissioner of Plant Variety Protection promulgated rules to do so. Since the 1980s, the US Patent Office has granted patents on plants, including plant varieties this provides a second way of protecting plant varieties in the United States. Australia passed the Plant Variety Protection Act 1987 (Cth) and the Plant Breeders Rights Act 1994 (Cth). Australian patent law also permits the patenting of plant varieties. In total, 65 countries have signed the UPOV Convention and adopted plant breeders' rights legislation consistent with the requirements of the convention. The WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires member states to provide protection for plant varieties either by patents or by an effective sui generis (stand alone) system, or a combination of the two. Most countries meet this requirement through UPOV Convention-compliant legislation. India has adopted a plant breeders' rights law that has been rejected by the UPOV Council as not meeting the requirements of the treaty. The most recent 1991 UPOV convention established several restrictions upon international plant breeders' rights. While the current legislature of the convention recognizes novel varieties of plants as intellectual property, laws were formed concerning the preservation of seeds for future plantation, such that the need to buy seeds to use in subsequent planting seasons would be significantly reduced, and even potentially eliminated altogether. In addition, the 1991 convention also concerns the method of instigating plant breeding by implementing pre-existing and patented plant species as contributor of vital genetic information in the creation of what would legally be regarded as a new variety of plant. Constituent countries of the World Trade Organization are required to acknowledge the creation of new varieties of plants, and to uphold these creations within full recognition of intellectual property rights laws. A formalized legislature, exemplifying the manner in which such intellectual property rights can be conferred, is demonstrated by the 1991 UPOV convention, which declares such rights upon an individual breeder. This document further identifies a breeder as one who has found or created a plant variety, one who possesses legal authority for the contractual production of a new plant variety, or one who has inherited legal rights to this form of intellectual property as it was derived under either of the two aforementioned conditions. As a result of debate over the protection of hybrid plants as new varieties, the legal measure of double protection, as expressed within the current iteration of the UPOV, can be taken. Double protection mediates the overlap between plant breeders' rights and patents that exists within the purview of intellectual property rights law, by enabling the protections of both to be conferred upon a particular plant variety. Plant breeders' rights (sometimes referred to as breeders' privilege) are contentious, in particular when analysed in balance with other relevant international legal instruments, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (and its Nagoya Protocol) or the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (Plant Treaty). The UPOV is often criticized on this basis.  Plants as intellectual property  There have been contrary opinions expressed by both lawyers and scientists assessing the general necessity, if one exists, for the official protection of plants as a form of intellectual property. Currently, intellectual property rights protect ideas that can be demonstrated as being novel and undiscovered at the time of its legal claim as intellectual property. This definition of novelty, however, has been flexible throughout the history of intellectual property law, both internationally, and within the United States. Expectations of future changes to the legal protection of plant-related forms of intellectual property differ from the legal requirements for the first plant patent.Cook, Robert C. ‚ÄúThe First Plant Patent.‚Äù Journal of the Patent Office Society 14 (1932): 398‚Äì403. Proponents of these laws recognize an overarching need for the financial support of research and development. Agricultural research and development, for example, has been specified as a particularly demanding endeavor, with respect to immediate concerns for the ability to sustainably feed an increasing global population. On the contrary, some believe that a more diverse approach than the imposition of intellectual property rights laws upon new plant varieties is required. This counter argument asserts that complex social, cultural, and economic factors affect the nature of intellectual property and its protection. A specific concern within this argument is with the means by which seeds are accessed within different local and international regions. Recognizing that this process is extremely transient in nature and can vary greatly over time, supporters of this argument purport that this diversity must be reflected within intellectual property rights laws in order for them to exist as an effective protection of plant breeders' rights. As a result of this conflict concerning authority over seeds, new legislation has been implemented in the United States. The Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) is a national attempt that has been introduced within the United States, and is the first of its kind to model its approach regarding plant breeders' rights upon the mechanisms implemented by openly sourced software mechanisms. Subsequent discourse on this approach has arisen, as concerns with the use of open source technology within a legal framework have developed. Some perceive OSSI as having significantly limited plant breeders' ability to access intellectual property rights for new plant varieties. This has resulted in claims that funding for research and development in this sector will also decline.  Seed Sovereignty  Seed sovereignty can be defined as the right ‚Äúto breed and exchange diverse open-sourced seeds.‚Äù Generally, it comes from the belief that communities should have control over their own seed stock, as a means to increase agricultural biodiversity, resilience, and food security. This idea is closely connected to issues of intellectual property rights, particularly related to the patenting of plant genetics, due to the importance of seed saving in seed sovereignty. Activists argue that farmers and individuals should have legal protection for the practice for maintaining traditional plant varieties. Seed sovereignty activists also argue that seed saving should be protected on the grounds of environmentalism and food security.LaDuke, Winona. (2012). Seeds of Our Ancestors, Seeds of Life, TEDxTC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHNlel72eQc In addition, some activists argue that seed sovereignty is important because of the cultural value of certain seeds and plant varieties, especially among indigenous communities.White, Rowen. (2018). The Native Seed Pod, Episode 1. https://www.nativeseedpod.org/podcast/2018/episode-1-the-natural-law-of-seeds Seed sovereignty has strong ties to the food justice and food sovereignty movements, due to its focus on increasing food security for all communities.

They are capable of speeds in excess of 200 knots (370 km/h or 230 miles/h).  Design and capabilities  Design began in the 1960s when the NII-24 research institute was ordered to produce a new weapon capable of engaging nuclear submarines. The merger of the institute and GSKB-47 created the Research Institute of Applied Hydromechanics, who continued with the design and production of the Shkval. Previously operational as early as 1977, the torpedo was announced as being deployed in the 1990s. The Shkval is intended as a countermeasure against torpedoes launched by undetected enemy submarines. Shkval nose cone Shkval rear, showing the guidance fins and the electronics connector The VA-111 is launched from 533 mm torpedo tubes at before its solid-fuel rocket ignites and propels it to speeds of . Some reports indicate that speeds of 250+ knots may be achieved, and that work on a version was underway. This high speed is due to supercavitation, whereby a gas bubble, which envelops the torpedo, is created by outward deflection of water by its specially-shaped nose cone and the expansion of gases from its engine. This minimizes water contact with the torpedo, significantly reducing drag. Shkval is supposed to have a rocket-type engine, but in the recent years has emerged publications from Russia and China about a \\"hydro ramjet\\" that use hydro reactive metal fuel (HRF) used for high speed torpedo. Available schemes of this type of engine shows also a dedicated steam circuit for the supercavitation generating head. Early designs may have relied solely on an inertial guidance system. The initial design was intended for nuclear warhead delivery. Later designs reportedly include terminal guidance and conventional warheads. The torpedo steers using four fins that skim the inner surface of the supercavitation gas bubble. To change direction, the fin(s) on the inside of the desired turn are extended, and the opposing fins are retracted. In 2016, KTVR was upgrading Shkval.  Manufacture  The torpedo is manufactured in Kyrgyzstan by a state-owned factory. In 2012 the Russian government asked for a 75% ownership of the factory in exchange for writing off massive Kyrgyz debt to Russia.  Espionage  In 2000, former U.S. Naval intelligence officer and an alleged Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) spy Edmond Pope (Captain, USN, retired) was held, tried, and convicted in Russia of espionage related to information he obtained about the Shkval weapon system. Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned Pope in December 2000 on humanitarian grounds because he had bone cancer.

It is near to the towns of Yusifiyah and Iskandariya at the geographic coordinates . Covering an area of over 28 km¬≤, the site comprises 116 separate factories and over 1,100 structures of various kinds. It is now disused and many of the buildings have been destroyed by bombing, looting and accidental explosions. In October 2004, the facility became the centre of international attention after a UN agency reported hundreds of tonnes of stored explosives \\"missing\\" (see Al Qa'qaa high explosives controversy). Origins of Al Qa'qaa Al Qa'qaa was built in the 1970s with most of the equipment coming from Germany and Yugoslavia. It was completed in 1981, just in time to meet the demands of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Under the regime of Saddam Hussein the facility was a key agency of the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization. It included plants for producing solid-propellant rockets and ammunition. The complex also included factories producing steel, aluminum, and centrifuges. It was Iraq's principal production facility for specialist explosives, notably RDX and HDX. The facility was named after a distinguished soldier in the army of the 7th century Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, of whom it was said \\"the voice of Al Qa'qaa in an army is better than one thousand fighters.\\" By analogy, as Saddam Hussein explained in a visit on May 23, 2001, the workers at Al Qa'qaa were equivalent to a far greater number of their enemies: :\\"Every Iraqi works in the same way Caliph Umar Ibn-al-Khattab used to work with when the commander, who led the Muslims' army on Iraq's front, to back him with several thousands of fighters. So, he sent him four fighters only, including Al- Qa'qaa. He considered each one of these fighters equal to 1,000 fighters. Had the Iraqis not worked in this way and with spirit now, they would not have achieved, with this small number, what was not achieved by others who outnumber them.\\"Republic of Iraq Radio, Baghdad, May 23, 2001 Al Qa'qaa and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction The Al Qa'qaa plant was heavily involved in Iraq's clandestine program to produce weapons of mass destruction, with its workers' expertise in explosives being used to develop explosive lenses for nuclear weapons. Iraq's program suffered serious setbacks due to the Israeli destruction of the experimental reactor at Osirak in June 1981 and a massive accidental explosion at Al Qa'Qaa in August 1989, which severely damaged the plant and was heard hundreds of miles away. British-Iraqi journalist Farzad Bazoft attempted to investigate the incident by disguising himself as a medical technician in order to infiltrate Al Qa'qaa. However, he was caught and executed on charges related to his visit. In March 1990, customs officials at Heathrow Airport in London seized a case of military electrical capacitors - key components of triggers for explosive lenses - which was bound for Al Qa'qaa. The United States subsequently charged five people and two British companies with violations of export regulations. During the 1991 Gulf War the facility was severely damaged by bombing. After the war, the UN weapons inspectors UNSCOM further destroyed and sealed weapons and facilities at the base. However, part of the base was rebuilt and attracted concern from Western countries. In September 2002, the plant was named by the British Government in Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (the \\"September Dossier\\") as being the site of a rebuilt phosgene production facility. Although phosgene has industrial uses in small quantities, there are no legitimate nonmilitary uses for such large scale production, and it is capable of being used as a chemical weapon, as was done by Germany in World War I. The British and Americans also alleged that a large consignment of 81 mm aluminium tubes delivered to the plant were to be used as rotors in centrifuges to produce enriched uranium. IAEA officials inspected the site at least ten times in 2002 and 2003 but discovered no weapons of mass destruction. The aluminum tubes did exist, but they were determined to be for short-range artillery rockets (which Iraq was allowed to possess). The inspectors left the country in mid-March 2003 shortly before the US-led invasion of Iraq. They sealed the bunkers where explosives were stored, but were not permitted to return after the United States took control. The Al Qa'qaa high explosives controversy is over the question of when the IAEA-sealed explosives were removed from their bunkers; whether it happened before, during or after the invasion of Iraq.

Sexwale was imprisoned on Robben Island for his anti-apartheid activities, alongside figures such as Nelson Mandela. After the 1994 general election--the first fully democratic election in South Africa--Sexwale became the Premier of Gauteng Province. He served in the government of South Africa as Minister of Human Settlements from 2009 to 2013. Early life and education Sexwale was born in the township of Orlando West, in Soweto. His father was a clerk at Johannesburg General Hospital and had fought against the Germans in World War II. Sexwale grew up amid the turmoil of the black township's upheaval, and graduated from Orlando West High School in 1973. Sexwale became a member of the Steve Biko's Black Consciousness Movement in the late 1960s and became a local leader of the radical South African Students' Movement. In the early 1970s, he joined the African National Congress's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (\\"spear of the nation\\"). While in Swaziland, he completed a Certificate in Business Studies at the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. In 1975, Sexwale went into exile, undergoing military officers' training in the Soviet Union, where he specialized in military engineering. Imprisonment Upon his return to South Africa in 1976, Sexwale was captured after a skirmish with the South African security forces and, along with 11 others, was charged and later convicted of terrorism and conspiracy to overthrow the government after an almost two-year-long trial in the Supreme Court of South Africa in Pretoria. In 1977, Sexwale was sent to the Robben Island maximum-security prison to serve an 18-year sentence. While imprisoned at Robben Island, he studied for a BCom degree at the University of South Africa. Sexwale was released in June 1990 under the terms of the Groote Schuur Agreement between the National Party government and the African National Congress. He had spent 13 years in prison. During this time he was represented in part by a paralegal named Judy van Vuuren. They began a personal relationship while he remained in prison, and soon after his release, in 1990, they married. Political career After his release, Sexwale returned to Johannesburg, where he served as head of the public liaison department of the African National Congress Headquarters. He was subsequently appointed the head of special projects, reporting to the ANC's military headquarters. In September 1990, he was elected as a member of the executive committee of the ANC in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV) region. He became the chairperson of the ANC in the PWV region in 1991, a position he held until his resignation in late 1997. After the South African elections in April 1994, Sexwale was elected as the first premier of the new PWV Province (renamed Gauteng Province in December 1994). In this role, he was credited with bringing peace to several politically volatile townships. Sexwale left politics for the corporate sector in 1998. The reasons for this were never made completely clear, but was reportedly due to feeling stifled by central government restrictions as well as becoming exhausted by internal African National Congress intrigues. Further speculation is that Sexwale left politics due to strong disagreements with the then Vice-President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki. Other speculation is that his marriage opened business opportunities in the white-dominated financial sectors that allowed him opportunities not open to other black leaders. Sexwale, Cyril Ramaphosa and Mbeki were possible candidates jostling for the presidency after Mandela stepped down. Once Thabo Mbeki appeared as the favourite candidate, both Sexwale and Ramaphosa left politics to follow successful careers as businessmen. On 7 January 2007, The Sunday Times reported that Sexwale was campaigning for a leadership position within the ANC, which would have put him in position to replace Thabo Mbeki as President of South Africa in 2009. Sexwale admitted on BBC's Hard Talk that if asked to stand for the elections as party president by structures of the ANC, he would seriously consider it.Tycoon may run for top ANC post BBC 8 January 2007 He was elected to the ANC's 80-member National Executive Committee in December 2007 in 10th place, with 2,198 votes.Brendan Boyle, \\"Winnie Mandela tops ANC election list\\" , The Times (South Africa), 21 December 2007.

Mvelaphanda Group Upon leaving the public sector, Sexwale founded Mvelaphanda Holdings (mvelaphanda is the Venda word for \\"progress\\"), a company of which he is still executive chairman. Mvelaphanda is primarily focused on the mining, energy and related sectors. Some of Sexwale's main interests are oil and diamond mining, for which he has been granted concessions across Africa and Russia; these interests are controlled by a subsidiary of Mvelaphanda Holdings called Mvelaphanda Resources, of which he is chairman. Through his Mvelaphanda Group Tokyo Sexwale has substantial holdings in the mining sector. He is currently discussing with the Kazakh-owned Eurasian National Resources Corporation a plan to buy into mining interests in Guinea. A negotiating team is in secret talks about financing a local mining company to be owned by the Guinean state.Africa Confidential, \\"South Africa: Higher Taxes, Less Nationalisation\\", AllAfrica (8 June 2012) The new mining code, drafted by advisers to the Guinean President Alpha Cond√©, would grant the new state entity a free 15% stake in Guinea's mining projects, with the option to buy another 20%. Tokyo Sexwale was a business partner with Alpha Cond√© even before Cond√© became president.John Helmer,\\" South African Oligarch Beats Oleg Deripaska To The Pot In Guinea\\", Business Insider (13 June 2012) Sexwale's Mvelphanda Holdings and Walter Hennig's Palladino Holdings have entered into a partnership with US investment fund managers Och-Ziff Capital Management in African Global Capital, a natural resources investment fund focussing on the continent. Africa Management Limited In January 2008 OZ Management, Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings and Walter Hennig‚Äôs Palladino Holdings announced the creation of a new joint venture, Africa Management Limited. As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established African Global Capital, as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities. Tokyo Sexwale said: \\"We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm.\\" Presidential ambitions He was mentioned as a possible candidate for Deputy President of the African National Congress in 2007. In September 2007 he announced his candidacy for the ANC Presidential nomination at the party convention in Polokwane. Prior to the convention, he withdrew his nomination and backed then Deputy President - Jacob Zuma. He did not stand for the Deputy Presidency as certain media speculation expected, the post eventually going to Kgalema Motlanthe. In 2009, he was appointed as Minister of Human Settlements by President Jacob Zuma having previously been touted as a possible Foreign Affairs or Defense Minister. 2012 ANC Leadership election Sexwale was nominated as Kgalema Motlanthe's Deputy Presidential running mate on 2 October 2012 by various regions in the Eastern Cape, the ruling party's second largest branch. The African National Congress Youth League also indicated that it would back Sexwale for the Deputy Presidency at the ANC's leadership election Manguang, Free State. On 18 December 2012, Sexwale was defeated for the post of Deputy President, coming in last place he received 463 votes while Cyril Ramaphosa received 3 018 votes and Mathews Phosa received 470 votes. Personal life His nickname of \\"Tokyo\\" is derived from his involvement with the sport of karate as a youth. Sexwale has two children by a first wife, and two children by his second wife, Judy van Vuuren, a paralegal he met on Robben Island. Following his financial success, he moved into the previously predominantly white suburb of Illovo with his family. In 2013 Sexwale and his second wife filed for divorce. Three days after the death of Mandela, on 8 December 2013, Sexwale appeared at a prayer service in Houghton, South Africa, where he hailed Mandela as the \\"purest of the purest good\\" and encouraged everyone to learn from his example: \\"His method was that of solving a society's most impractical problems through talking and engaging.\\". Controversies In 2001 Sexwale was accused, along with Cyril Ramaphosa and Mathews Phosa, of plotting to depose President Thabo Mbeki. Sexwale denied the charges and all three received the backing of Nelson Mandela; they were later exonerated from all accusations. In 2002, he was refused a visa to enter the United States, which kept him from attending the listing of Gold Fields (a company in which he holds a 15 percent stake) on the New York Stock Exchange. It later transpired that he, along with many prominent South African anti- apartheid figures such as Nelson Mandela and South African cabinet minister Sidney Mufamadi, were still on that country's list of global terrorists. After initiating legal action, going so far as to having papers served on the U.S. Department of State and following personal intervention by Condoleezza Rice, Sexwale and the others received ten-year waivers from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Homeland Security, as the government felt that permanently delisting them would mean changing the law, which would be a lengthy process. In July 2008 a bill became law in the US to \\"provide relief for certain members of the African National Congress regarding admissibility\\" and the ANC itself was removed from the terrorist list though on 28 October 2013, the ANC demanded an apology after Sexwale was held at a US airport because he was still on a terrorist watchlist.Tokyo Sexwale arrested in New York, at the Sowetan Live; by Reuters; published 28 October 2013; retrieved 12 February 2014 In 2005, Sexwale was roundly criticized for being \\"indecisive\\" during the live finale of the South African version of The Apprentice, which he fronted on SABC3.

Sexwale is believed to be the driver behind two British Virgin Island vehicles, Palladino Holdings and Floras Bell, which are managed by Walter Hennig. In April 2011 Walter Hennig concluded a secret deal with the Guinean President Alpha Cond√© that would transfer billions of Dollars of mining assets belonging to companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto - who want to invest billions to develop the mines of Guinea ‚Äì to South African intermediary Palladino Capital.Boubacar Bah Caba, \\"Major Issues: Conde accused of having sold off the Guinean mining interests in favor of South African ... for $ 25 million\\", Guineenews (2 June 2012) The deal comprised a loan of US$25 million to the Guinean government to finance the start-up of a new Guinean state mining company. Behind Walter Hennig and the $25 million loan agreement, are Sexwale; Mark Willcox, the chief executive of Mvelaphanda Group, and several other businessmen of South African, Polish, and British extraction. One of them is Ian Hannam a famous London banker who tried to arrange Rusal‚Äôs float on the London Stock Exchange in 2007, but failed. The loan deal is now tipped for a potential investigation by the World Bank which would look into whether the loan was actually intended to finance a new state-mining company, as outlined in the contract, or to benefit political or individual interests in return for mining concessions. Mahmoud Thiam, the former Guinean mining minister and political opponent of President Alpha Cond√©, claimed that Tokyo Sexwale \\"was angry with the president because he was not delivering on his promises\\" and that Tokyo was funding the president's election campaign through the loan deal. In July 2012, the Russian publication –ê—Ä–≥—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –∏ –§–∞–∫—Ç—ã (Argumenty I Fakty, Arguments and Facts) reported that Walter Hennig, through Palladino Capital 2, made a series of payments totalling $25 million to the Guinean president's son, Mohammed Cond√©. The payments were made by Walter Hennig from an account held in Turks and Caicos into an offshore account held by Mohammed Cond√© in Monaco. The money was originally lent by Hennig's offshore company, Palladino Capital 2, in order to start the state mining company but various news articles have cited anonymous sources who have claimed that the US$25 million was never reflected in the country's accounts. When faced with these accusations, Sexwale has declined to comment personally and instead has released statements through his spokesperson Xolani Xundu that he would not confirm or deny any of the claims from \\"faceless sources\\".Jacques Dommisse, \\"Media reports in the West African state reveal that the ‚Äòsecret deal‚Äô was never disclosed despite a promise for absolute transparency on state deals\\", City Press (24 June 2012) Awards Sexwale has received many honours and awards, including the L√©gion d'honneur from France, an honorary doctorate from Nottingham Trent University, an honorary doctorate from De Montfort University, the Order of the Freedom of Havana (Cuba), the Cross of Valour (Ruby Class) from South Africa, and the Reach and Teach Leadership Award, from the United States. He is also chancellor of the Vaal University of Technology. Sexwale is also an honorary colonel in the South African Air Force and chair of the Council for the Support of National Defence, whose aim is to encourage part-time military service as well as building support in society for those who wish to serve in the military as volunteers. In 2004, he was voted 43rd in the list of \\"Top 100 Great South Africans\\". Sexwale holds positions in many international organisations, such as president of the South African/Russian Business, Technological and Cultural Association, and Vice President of the South African/Japanese Business Forum. He is also an Honorary Consul General of Finland in South Africa.

It passed with 6,571,694 (59.0%) votes in favor and 4,578,725 (41.0%) against. It was an initiative statute that limited the California law on unfair competition, restricting private lawsuits against a company only to those where an individual is injured by and suffers a financial loss due to an unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business practice and providing that otherwise only public prosecutors may file lawsuits charging unfair business practices. Proponents argued that the measure would limit \\"frivolous lawsuits\\" against companies, which they claimed result mainly in a windfall for lawyers rather than consumers. Proponents also argued that businesses ultimately must pass along their costs in the form of higher prices to consumers. Opponents charged that the proposition was heavily funded by businesses who wanted to weaken consumer rights by limiting Californians' ability to enforce environmental, public health, and consumer protection laws such as 1986's Proposition 65. Official summary * Limits individual's right to sue by allowing private enforcement of unfair business competition laws only if that individual was injured by, and suffered financial/property loss because of, an unfair business practice. * Requires private representative claims to comply with procedural requirements applicable to class action lawsuits. * Authorizes only the California Attorney General or local government prosecutors to sue on behalf of general public to enforce unfair business competition laws. * Limits use of monetary penalties recovered by Attorney General or local government prosecutors to enforcement of consumer protection laws.

It is located in the upper Roch Valley by the foothills of the South Pennines, northeast of Rochdale and north-northeast of Manchester; Milnrow and the M62 motorway are to the south, and the rural uplands of Blackstone Edge are to the east. In 2001, Littleborough and its suburbs of Calderbrook, Shore and Smithy Bridge,. had a population of 13,807. Historically a part of Lancashire, Littleborough and its surroundings have provided evidence of Neolithic, Celtic, Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Littleborough was a hamlet in the manor of Hundersfield, parish of Rochdale and hundred of Salford.. It was focussed upon the junction of two ancient routes over the Pennines ‚Äî one of which may have been a Roman road ‚Äî that joined to cross the River Roch. By 1472, Littleborough consisted of a chapel, a cluster of cottages, and an inn, and its inhabitants were broadly farmers who were spurred to weave wool by merchants who passed between the markets at Rochdale and Halifax. When cotton was introduced as a base to make textiles, Littleborough experienced an influx of families, mostly from the neighbouring West Riding of Yorkshire. Affluent homes and estates were established on Littleborough's fringes. In the late 18th century, the low-altitude Summit Gap between Littleborough and Walsden was approved as the best route over the Pennines for the Rochdale Canal and the Manchester to Leeds railway; Hollingworth Lake was built at Littleborough's south side as a feeder reservoir to regulate the waters of the canal. This infrastructure encouraged industrialists to modify Littleborough's traditional handloom cloth workshops with a mechanised form of textile production. Attracted to the area's natural resources and modern infrastructure, coal mining, engineering ventures and increasingly large textile mills contributed to Littleborough's population growth and urbanisation, sealing its status as a mill town. Local government reforms established the Littleborough Urban District in 1894 which was governed by its own district council until its abolition in 1974. During the mid-20th century, imports of cheaper foreign goods prompted the gradual deindustrialisation of Littleborough, but its commercial diversity allowed it to repel the ensuing economic depression experienced elsewhere in North West England. Subsumed into the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in 1974, Littleborough endures as a commuter town with a distinct community; its Civic Trust works to preserve and enhance its historic character, and societies exist to use the surrounding countryside for water-skiing, horse riding and other recreational activities. Littleborough's stone-built town centre is designated as a Conservation Area for its special architectural qualities. History Evidence of human activity in the area, dating to at least the Neolithic period, exists in the form of ancient flint tool and arrowhead discoveries. Rochdale Museum hold an early Iron Age bracelet made of a shale from Kimmeridge in Dorset, which was found in 1929 on Flint Hill, east of Blackstone Edge. A torc (or necklet) with ornamentation of a late-Celtic design was found in the Mawrode area of Littleborough in 1832; and the name Calderbrook is derived from an ancient Celtic language, two factors implying inhabitation by Britons. Littleborough is supposed to have been the site of a small station along the Roman road that is routed from Mamucium (Manchester) to Eboracum (York) which skirts the town. Evidence of Roman occupation in Littleborough comes from finds of coins and pottery, and the right arm of a silver statue of Victory.. Following the Roman departure from Britain, the remaining population came under the influence of the Anglo-Saxons. Place names indicate the Anglo-Saxon settlement of the Littleborough area, for example the ‚Äògate' element in Lydgate and Reddyshore Scout Gate is Old English for ‚Äòroad'. The name Littleborough is itself derived from the Old English l»≥tel bruh (meaning small fortified place) or else l»≥tel br√≥c (meaning small watercourse). In 1848 the population was chiefly employed in three flannel-mills, four cotton-factories, in bleachworks, six coal-pits, a stone-quarry and in brick-making. Governance Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Littleborough was a chapelry and component area of Hundersfield, an ancient township within the parish of Rochdale and hundred of Salford. Hundersfield later constituted a civil parish encompassing several settlements to the northeast of Rochdale, until its dissolution. Littleborough's first local authority was a Local board of health established in 1870; Littlborough Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for parts of the then townships of Blatchinworth and Calderbrook, of Wuerdle and Wardle and of Butterworth, with the local board's territory being expanded into further parts of these townships in 1879. Under the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the local board expanded to encompass all of Blatchinworth and Calderbrook and became the Littleborough Urban District, a local government district in the Rochdale Poor Law Union and administrative county of Lancashire. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Littleborough Urban District was abolished, and Littleborough and its outlying settlements have, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, within the Metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. In anticipation of the new local government arrangement, Littleborough Urban District Council applied for civil parish status to be granted to the locality after 1974, however the application was not successful. The Littleborough Neighbourhood Forum is now forming as a result of the Localism Act 2011.Neighbourhood Forum website Geography A view towards Littleborough and Rochdale from Blackstone Edge. At (53.644¬∞, ‚àí2.098¬∞), and north-northwest of central London, Littleborough stands roughly above sea level, on the western slopes of the Pennines, north-northeast of Manchester city centre, in the valley of the River Roch. Blackstone Edge and West Yorkshire are to the east; Rochdale and Milnrow are to the southwest and south respectively. In Littleborough are the localities and suburbs of Calderbrook, Chelburn, Durn, Featherstall, Gale, Hollinworth, Laneside, Rake, Shore, Sladen, Smithy Bridge, Stansfield, Summit and Whitelees. Transport Littleborough is served by the town's two railway stations, Littleborough itself and at Smithy Bridge. The town is situated on the A58 between Rochdale and Halifax and is the starting point of the A6033 which runs northwards up to Todmorden. The town is also well provided with buses which connect all districts in the Rochdale area and into the Pennine towns as far as Halifax.

Biography Barth√©lemy Dumortier was a son of the merchant and city councillor Barth√©lemy-Fran√ßois Dumortier and of Mariue-Jeanne Willaumez. He married Philippine Ruteau and they had a son, Barth√©lemy-No√´l Dumortier (1830-1915). Barth√©lemy-Charles became politically active in the early eighteen twenties. In 1824 he founded the Courrier de l'Escaut, a paper critical of the government. He adhered in 1830 to the Belgian revolution. In 1831 he became a member of the first elected parliament of the new kingdom, as the member for Tournai. He remained elected until 1847. He then switched seats, and was now elected for the city of Roulers and held this seat until his death. In 1872 he was awarded the honorary title of Minister of State. He also was awarded nobility with the title of earl. However, for unknown reasons, he did not raise the necessary patent letters and was therefore not ennobled. Botanist In the early 1820s, Dumortier published in Latin his first contribution to botany. In 1827 he published a complete national flora, the Florula Belgica. In 1829 Dumortier was already regarded as one of the greatest naturalists of the Low-Countries and became a member of the Acad√©mie de Bruxelles. He not only studied botany but also zoology. In 1835 Dumortier first proposed the genus Lepidozia. His reputation as a botanist was so brilliant that the Home Office asked him to be its representative in the Brussels‚Äô Botanic Garden, then a joint stock company, supported by the State. In 1862, the Soci√©t√© Royale de Botanique de Belgique was created and Dumortier became its president. When the company that ran the Brussels‚Äô botanic garden collapsed, Dumortier developed the idea of a state-owned botanic garden in the capital. He succeeded in convincing the Parliament in 1869 of buying the impressive herbarium and dried collections of the late Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. A few months later the state bought the garden of the 'Soci√©t√© Royale d‚ÄôHorticulture de Belgique'. Dumortier hoped to create a botanic garden whose role model was the Royal Kew Gardens. His name was given to two plant species: to the Hemerocallis dumortieri (Hemerocallidoideae) and to the Stenocereus dumortieri (Cactaceae). Some consider him to be the true discoverer of cell division, although he is rarely credited as such.Amos, B. (2000). Lessons from the history of light microscopy. Nature Cell Biology, 2: E151-E152.

Albert Moulton Foweraker (7 July 1873 - January, 1942) was an English painter. He was educated at Exeter Cathedral School, was an exhibitioner at Cavendish College, Cambridge in 1890, and went on to Christ's College, from where he obtained his Degree in Applied Science in 1893. He obtained First Class Honours, City & Guilds in 1896, and was a qualified Milling Engineer. He was also sometime Demonstrator In Science at Exeter Technical College. He was married in July 1897 to Annie Triphina Coles. In 1898, he took up art professionally, and between that year and 1912, he exhibited his work regularly. He was made a member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1902, and sent 52 paintings to exhibitions at their Galleries in Pall Mall during these years. He also exhibited at several important provincial galleries. He originated an exhibition of works by modern painters at Exeter, which developed into the Devon And Cornwall Fine Art Society. He moved from Exeter to Lelant, Cornwall in 1902, and travelled frequently to Spain, especially the South during the early 1900s and in the 1920s. He also visited Southern France and North Africa, and produced many paintings from these travels. He was also a very prolific local artist, and painted a very large number of landscapes and local scenes from Devon, Cornwall and, of course, Dorset, to which County he moved in the mid-1920s, living at Northbrook Road, Swanage for many years. He was fascinated by the effects of certain light on the landscape, particularly moonlight, as his paintings show. He is known for his use of the colour blue, and his moonlight paintings of people carrying lanterns and light shining from windows are much sought after. He appeared to have been very interested in the RMS Titanic disaster of 1912, particularly in the Enquiries subsequently held, apparently suspecting suppression of certain information. In 1940 he made a Codicil to his Will, leaving various documents and papers relating to these matters, to the British Museum. The artist died in January 1942 at Swanage, at the age of 68, and is buried in Godlingston Cemetery, Ulwell, Swanage. A common source of confusion with his paintings is that his signature can easily be read by the unwary as 'Doweraker', and in this guise 'A.M. Doweraker, fl.1920s-1940s' can be found in auction records.

It failed to pass with 3,901,748 (37.6%) votes in favor and 6,471,506 (62.4%) against. It was a state constitutional amendment that would have required voter approval for any state legislation reducing certain local government revenues from January 2003 levels. It was officially known as the Local Taxpayers and Public Safety Protection Act. Local governments (cities and counties) in California primarily receive their revenue from three sources: property taxes, local sales taxes, and the vehicle license fees. Proposition 65 was born out of frustration from local governments as the California state government increasingly used local revenues to pay for state government programs, especially during tough financial times. Proponents of the proposition ultimately used it as a bargaining tool to negotiate an agreement with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the California State Legislature on protecting local government revenues. The result was the compromise Proposition 1A on the same ballot, which provided more flexible terms and deferred its restrictions until 2006. As a result, previous proponents of Proposition 65 dropped their support in favor of Proposition 1A. This proposition conflicted with the provisions of Proposition 1A on the same ballot. The California Constitution provides that if the provisions of two approved propositions are in conflict, only the provisions of the measure with the higher number of \\"yes\\" votes at the statewide election take effect.

These reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. [The Calvin cycle uses the reducing powers ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use. These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process. There is not a direct reaction that converts CO2 to a sugar because all of the energy would be lost to heat.] There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle: carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration. Though it is called the \\"dark reaction\\", the Calvin cycle does not actually occur in the dark or during nighttime. This is because the process requires reduced NADP which is short-lived and comes from the light-dependent reactions. In the dark, plants instead release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves to provide energy for the plant. The Calvin cycle thus happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis (C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM)); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day to make this process work. Coupling to other metabolic pathways  These reactions are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain as the energy required to reduce the carbon dioxide is provided by NADPH produced in photosystem I during the light dependent reactions. The process of photorespiration, also known as C2 cycle, is also coupled to the calvin cycle, as it results from an alternative reaction of the RuBisCO enzyme, and its final byproduct is another glyceraldehyde-3-P. Calvin cycle Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation The Calvin cycle, Calvin‚ÄìBenson‚ÄìBassham (CBB) cycle, reductive pentose phosphate cycle (RPP cycle) or C3 cycle is a series of biochemical redox reactions that take place in the stroma of chloroplast in photosynthetic organisms. The cycle was discovered in 1950 by Melvin Calvin, James Bassham, and Andrew Benson at the University of California, Berkeley by using the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Photosynthesis occurs in two stages in a cell. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage and transport molecules ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle uses the energy from short-lived electronically excited carriers to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds that can be used by the organism (and by animals that feed on it). This set of reactions is also called carbon fixation. The key enzyme of the cycle is called RuBisCO. In the following biochemical equations, the chemical species (phosphates and carboxylic acids) exist in equilibria among their various ionized states as governed by the pH. The enzymes in the Calvin cycle are functionally equivalent to most enzymes used in other metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway, but they are found in the chloroplast stroma instead of the cell cytosol, separating the reactions. They are activated in the light (which is why the name \\"dark reaction\\" is misleading), and also by products of the light-dependent reaction. These regulatory functions prevent the Calvin cycle from being respired to carbon dioxide. Energy (in the form of ATP) would be wasted in carrying out these reactions that have no net productivity. The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following: :3 + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ \\\\+ 9 ATP ‚Üí glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) + 6 NADP+ \\\\+ 9 ADP + 3 + 8 Pi (Pi = inorganic phosphate) Hexose (six-carbon) sugars are not a product of the Calvin cycle. Although many texts list a product of photosynthesis as , this is mainly a convenience to counter the equation of respiration, where six- carbon sugars are oxidized in mitochondria. The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or \\"triose phosphates\\", namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Steps In the first stage of the Calvin cycle, a molecule is incorporated into one of two three-carbon molecules (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or G3P), where it uses up two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADPH, which had been produced in the light-dependent stage. The three steps involved are: Calvin cycle step 1 (black circles represent carbon atoms) Calvin cycle steps 2 and 3 combined # The enzyme RuBisCO catalyses the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, RuBP, a 5-carbon compound, by carbon dioxide (a total of 6 carbons) in a two- step reaction. The product of the first step is enediol-enzyme complex that can capture or . Thus, enediol-enzyme complex is the real carboxylase/oxygenase. The that is captured by enediol in second step produces an unstable six-carbon compound called 2-carboxy 3-keto 1,5-biphosphoribotol (or 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate) that immediately splits into 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, or 3-PGA, a 3-carbon compoundCampbell, and Reece Biology: 8th Edition, page 198. Benjamin Cummings, December 7, 2007. (also: 3-phosphoglyceric acid, PGA, 3PGA). # The enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase catalyses the phosphorylation of 3-PGA by ATP (which was produced in the light-dependent stage). 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPGA, glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate) and ADP are the products. (However, note that two 3-PGAs are produced for every that enters the cycle, so this step utilizes two ATP per fixed.) # The enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyses the reduction of 1,3BPGA by NADPH (which is another product of the light-dependent stage). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (also called G3P, GP, TP, PGAL, GAP) is produced, and the NADPH itself is oxidized and becomes NADP+. Again, two NADPH are utilized per fixed. Regeneration stage of the Calvin cycle The next stage in the Calvin cycle is to regenerate RuBP. Five G3P molecules produce three RuBP molecules, using up three molecules of ATP. Since each molecule produces two G3P molecules, three molecules produce six G3P molecules, of which five are used to regenerate RuBP, leaving a net gain of one G3P molecule per three molecules (as would be expected from the number of carbon atoms involved). Simplified C3 cycle with structural formulas The regeneration stage can be broken down into steps. # Triose phosphate isomerase converts all of the G3P reversibly into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), also a 3-carbon molecule. # Aldolase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase convert a G3P and a DHAP into fructose 6-phosphate (6C). A phosphate ion is lost into solution. # Then fixation of another generates two more G3P. # F6P has two carbons removed by transketolase, giving erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P). The two carbons on transketolase are added to a G3P, giving the ketose xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P). # E4P and a DHAP (formed from one of the G3P from the second fixation) are converted into sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (7C) by aldolase enzyme. # Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (one of only three enzymes of the Calvin cycle that are unique to plants) cleaves sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate into sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, releasing an inorganic phosphate ion into solution. # Fixation of a third generates two more G3P. The ketose S7P has two carbons removed by transketolase, giving ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), and the two carbons remaining on transketolase are transferred to one of the G3P, giving another Xu5P. This leaves one G3P as the product of fixation of 3 , with generation of three pentoses that can be converted to Ru5P. # R5P is converted into ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P, RuP) by phosphopentose isomerase. Xu5P is converted into RuP by phosphopentose epimerase. # Finally, phosphoribulokinase (another plant-unique enzyme of the pathway) phosphorylates RuP into RuBP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, completing the Calvin cycle. This requires the input of one ATP. Thus, of six G3P produced, five are used to make three RuBP (5C) molecules (totaling 15 carbons), with only one G3P available for subsequent conversion to hexose. This requires nine ATP molecules and six NADPH molecules per three molecules. The equation of the overall Calvin cycle is shown diagrammatically below. The overall equation of the Calvin cycle (black circles represent carbon atoms) RuBisCO also reacts competitively with instead of in photorespiration. The rate of photorespiration is higher at high temperatures. Photorespiration turns RuBP into 3-PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate, a 2-carbon molecule that can be converted via glycolate and glyoxalate to glycine. Via the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate, two glycines are converted into serine +. Serine can be converted back to 3-phosphoglycerate. Thus, only 3 of 4 carbons from two phosphoglycolates can be converted back to 3-PGA. It can be seen that photorespiration has very negative consequences for the plant, because, rather than fixing , this process leads to loss of . C4 carbon fixation evolved to circumvent photorespiration, but can occur only in certain plants native to very warm or tropical climates‚Äîcorn, for example. Products The immediate products of one turn of the Calvin cycle are 2 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) molecules, 3 ADP, and 2 NADP+. (ADP and NADP+ are not really \\"products.\\" They are regenerated and later used again in the Light-dependent reactions). Each G3P molecule is composed of 3 carbons. For the Calvin cycle to continue, RuBP (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) must be regenerated. So, 5 out of 6 carbons from the 2 G3P molecules are used for this purpose. Therefore, there is only 1 net carbon produced to play with for each turn. To create 1 surplus G3P requires 3 carbons, and therefore 3 turns of the Calvin cycle. To make one glucose molecule (which can be created from 2 G3P molecules) would require 6 turns of the Calvin cycle. Surplus G3P can also be used to form other carbohydrates such as starch, sucrose, and cellulose, depending on what the plant needs.Russell, Wolfe et al.Biology: Exploring the Diversity of Life.Toronto:Nelson College Indigenous,1st ed, Vol. 1, 2010, pg 151 Light- dependent regulation These reactions do not occur in the dark or at night. There is a light-dependent regulation of the cycle enzymes, as the third step requires reduced NADP. There are two regulation systems at work when the cycle must be turned on or off: the thioredoxin/ferredoxin activation system, which activates some of the cycle enzymes; and the RuBisCo enzyme activation, active in the Calvin cycle, which involves its own activase. The thioredoxin/ferredoxin system activates the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-P phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, and ribulose-5-phosphatase kinase, which are key points of the process. This happens when light is available, as the ferredoxin protein is reduced in the photosystem I complex of the thylakoid electron chain when electrons are circulating through it. Ferredoxin then binds to and reduces the thioredoxin protein, which activates the cycle enzymes by severing a cystine bond found in all these enzymes. This is a dynamic process as the same bond is formed again by other proteins that deactivate the enzymes. The implications of this process are that the enzymes remain mostly activated by day and are deactivated in the dark when there is no more reduced ferredoxin available. The enzyme RuBisCo has its own, more complex activation process. It requires that a specific lysine amino acid be carbamylated to activate the enzyme. This lysine binds to RuBP and leads to a non-functional state if left uncarbamylated. A specific activase enzyme, called RuBisCo activase, helps this carbamylation process by removing one proton from the lysine and making the binding of the carbon dioxide molecule possible. Even then the RuBisCo enzyme is not yet functional, as it needs a magnesium ion bound to the lysine to function. This magnesium ion is released from the thylakoid lumen when the inner pH drops due to the active pumping of protons from the electron flow. RuBisCo activase itself is activated by increased concentrations of ATP in the stroma caused by its phosphorylation.

History Typically individual Kemptown domestic property The area takes its name from Thomas Read Kemp's Kemp Town residential estate of the early 19th Century, but the one-word name now refers to an area larger than the original development and is more correctly King's Cliff. Much of the housing is slightly later but still of the Regency style, although there is also Victorian architecture and some more modern buildings. Conversions of grand Regency buildings into flats and bars has provided Kemptown with some distinctive properties; one club is housed within the Sassoon Mausoleum the former burial chamber of Edward Sassoon. In the nineteenth century, Kemptown was home to the Brighton Institute for Deaf and Dumb Children, at 127-132 Eastern Road (now demolished), opposite Brighton College. One of its inmates was Richard Aslatt Pearce, the first deaf ordained Anglican clergyman.The Internet Archive: Anecdotes & Incidents of the Deaf and Dumb, by W. R. Roe (2009): \\"A deaf and dumb clergyman\\" Since 1950, the locality has given its name to the Brighton Kemptown parliamentary constituency, covering a wider area of eastern Brighton and at times Peacehaven. Location and surrounding areas Municipal beach huts below King's Cliff (Kemptown) Central Brighton is to the west of the area. Travelling inland (north) from Kemptown one finds Queen's Park above the western portion of Kemptown. Further to the east are the Bristol Estate, Craven Vale estate, and Whitehawk, sometimes collectively known as \\"East Brighton\\". Returning south to the seafront, Kemptown's easterly neighbours are Black Rock and then Roedean. Also within walking distance is Brighton Marina. Community and facilities Historically known as an actors' and artists' quarter, it has a sizeable gay community and a network of streets with specialised shops, hotels, caf√©s and pubs. There is a space available to the community in the crypt of St. George's Church, known as The Crypt, which was built with support from a European Union urban regeneration fund. The Royal Sussex County Hospital is located in Kemptown. Kemptown Carnival is held each year. Transport Kemptown gained a railway station in 1869. The line, featuring two viaducts and a tunnel, was built at great cost partly to block the route for other railways from London. The railway lost out to bus traffic (the route from Brighton was longer than the road journey) and was closed to passenger traffic in 1933, surviving for freight until the 1970s.

The parish covers , and comprises two villages and two smaller settlements; it has a population of 6,427Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Gravesham Retrieved 6 March 2010 increasing slightly to 6,722 at the 2011 census. Meopham is sometimes described as the longest settlement in England although others such as Brinkworth, Wiltshire make the same claim. Meopham is one of the longest linear settlements in Europe, being in length. History The name of the village derives from Meapaham (Meapa's village): it is first recorded in 788, in the reign of King Offa. The modern pronunciation of the name comes from different ways of writing and spelling. Benedictine monks established a priory hospital at Meopham in the 12th century and throughout the Middle Ages three medieval manor housesKent History Illustrated, Frank W Jessup, 1966 Kent County Council \\\\- those of Meopham, Dodmore and Nurstead - governed the land now encompassing the parish. Edward Hasted in 1797 described the village as being \\"out of the way\\" and with \\"no well frequented thoroughfare through it\\". Since the 1920s, when the road numbering scheme started, the main road through the village, the A227, has become busier as a through-route connecting North Kent with the M20 motorway at the foot of the North Downs, although this now has been somewhat relieved by the M25. Historically, the parish of Meopham was in the Hundred of Toltingtrough. The parish The parish comprises the main village, divided into four named settlements; the outlying village of Harvel (approx 2 miles south-east); and two other settlements: Dodmore (still comprising mostly rural land from The Street southeastwards for approx 1 mile towards Harvel) and Culverstone (approx 1.5 miles to the south). The Parish Council, which now owns the lordship of the manor of Meopham, meets at Meopham Windmill and consists of twelve members (aka joint trustees of the ancient manor). The main village From the north along the main A227, the four settlements are Hook Green; The Street (Dodmore); Meopham Green; and Culverstone. The first three contain conservation areas. There were originally seven village greens in the parish; only three remain today. Hook Green is the most northerly of the settlements. Originally called Hoo Green, it lies around a small triangular village green to the west of the main road. There are again many listed buildings in the area, including the Weavers Cottage. More modern developments are situated near to Meopham Railway Station to the north, as is The Railway Tavern. There is also an Italian restaurant, Bartellas, formerly the Fox & Hounds public house. The Street (Dodmore) is the oldest of the village's settlements, where parts of the medieval manorial mansion of Dodmore stand, although the original structure was badly damaged in an earthquake of 1382: it is close to the 14th-century church, the parish church of St John the Baptist. In addition, there are many other historic buildings, including The George Inn, where the manorial court of Dodmore once sat. At The George Inn there is still the Courtroom Bar, the room in which the court baron of the manor was held. The present lord of the manor of Dodmore owns the Tudor manor house. The family of the cricketer Thomas Nordish worked Dodmore Manor Farm. In the late 20th century Ifield CC relocated to within Dodmore's ancient manorial boundaries, becoming New Ifield CC. Killick's Mill, Meopham Meopham Green is by far the largest remaining village green in the parish. The main road passes to the west; around the other two sides are buildings, many of which are of 18th- and 19th-century origin. Here are two public houses: the King's Arms; and The Cricketers' Inn, previously The Long Hop. Just to the north of the Green is Meopham Vineyard. Meopham Green is home to a cricket pitch, where the sport has been played every summer since at least 1776, and which is one of Kent's idyllic settings for the game; the former Prime Minister, Sir John Major, is a patron of Meopham Cricket Club where he stood on a soapbox during the 1992 general election campaign. Meopham Windmill is nearby. Culverstone Green is the most southerly of the main village settlements. The original village green has mostly been given up to road widening. On the main road, and down Whitepost Lane to the east, are both older and modern houses; a small supermarket; and a petrol station. A notable local house is \\"Lacknut House\\" (circa 1843) named after the area of land \\"Lacknuts\\" which was used as a fruit farm and is located directly opposite Culverstone Green. There is a considerably built-up area between the main road and Harvel. This is known as Culverstone Valley: it covers some and lies among woodlands. It is described as a unique development, which in its origins was the result of the sale of plots of land in the 1930s. Originally, chalets, shacks and caravans were built on the plots. Since then unauthorised developments, often extending the original buildings, have taken place in an area which is now Green Belt. Poor access and limited facilities such as proper drainage has led Gravesham Borough Council to take action by curbing this trend. Other settlements The other two main settlements in the parish are Nurstead (until 1935 a separate civil parish), where Nurstead Court is located next to the parish church, with former estate workers' cottages nearby; and Camer, once home to the family of Smith-Masters, with a few cottages near Camer Park. Geography The village lies on the dip slope of the North Downs, above sea level in Kent. The windmill Meopham Windmill and Green The windmill was built by James Killick, a millwright from Strood, in 1801. After his death in 1823, it passed to his wife Sukey, then to his son James, and after to his grandson Thomas who died in 1891. The Killicks lived in Strood where the family also owned mills and were reputed to walk the eight miles to Meopham each day. The mill worked by wind until 1929 and then by engine until 1965. It has been fully restored and is now in full working order. Churches Meopham Church There are two Church of England parish churches (now combined into one benefice): the grade I listed parish church of St John the Baptist,British listed buildings retrieved 20 July 2013 Meopham and Nurstead's 14th-century church of St Mildred. Other churches include Mount Zion Baptist Church built in 1828 and nearby Meopham Green, South Street Baptist Church, to the north of Culverstone and the Roman Catholic Church of St Paul, consecrated in 1965. Education There are three state schools in the village: the secondary Meopham School has developed as a specialist sports academy, and this is where Meopham Library is situated too; there are two primary schools: Meopham Community Academy (formerly Meopham Community Primary School) and Culverstone Green Primary School. Gravesend Grammar School is within the borough, and nearby are fee-paying schools, such as Cobham Hall School, and King's School, Rochester. Transport The main road through the village, the A227, carries a large amount of traffic. It first became a main road under the Turnpike Acts in 1825, when it was designed to connect Gravesend with Wrotham. Meopham Railway Station, at the north end of the village, is on the Chatham Main Line which runs to Victoria Station in London. Ebbsfleet International Station is under away.

The listeners are astonished at her great age, but she humbly replies by listing several others in China and Japan who had supposedly lived to great age, including her grandfather Yotsugi. She says her name is Ayame (iris), which was given to her because of her birth on the fifth day of the fifth month, the same day as the , although she had also been given the nickname Imakagami (the new mirror) by her mistress Murasaki Shikibu, in reference to a poem by Bai Juyi that described the casting of a new mirror on that day.Keene 1999 : 560, citing (566, note 31) Takehana 1984 : 38-39 (Vol. 1). The rest of the work describes the old lady's recollections of the past.

Their traditional homeland, historically known as \\"Bangash district,\\" stretches from Kohat to Tall and Spƒ´n Ghar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, as well as smaller parts of Paktia, Afghanistan. The Bangash are also settled in large numbers in Uttar Pradesh, India, especially in the city of Farrukhabad,Balland, Daniel. Encyclopaedia Iranica. BANGA·π¶. Originally Published: December 15, 1988. which was founded in 1714 by Nawab Muhammad Khan Bangash. The Bangash are split almost evenly between Shia Muslims and Sunni Muslims. There are also some Sikhs among the Bangash especially in Hangu, Upper Kurram, and Orakzai. The Bangash mostly speak a northern variety of Pashto similar to Afridi Pashto. Etymology According to a popular folk etymology, the name Bangash, Bungish or Bangakh is derived from bon-kash (), which is Persian for \\"root drawer\\" or \\"root destroyer,\\" implying that during battles, the Bangash would not rest until they had annihilated the enemy. Mythical genealogy According to a popular mythical genealogy, the Bangash tribe descended from a man named Ismail, who is described as a governor of Multan whose 11th-generation ancestor was Khalid ibn al-Walid, the famous Arab commander of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. According to the legend, Ismail moved from Multan to settle in Gardez, Paktia, while his wife was from Farmul in Urgun, Paktika. Ismail had two sons, GƒÅr and SƒÅmil, who were the progenitors of the modern Gari and Samilzai clans of the Bangash, respectively. Modern scholars reject this account as apocryphal, but some scholars hypothesized that \\"Ismail\\" may be a metaphor for a missionary (da'i) or a small Ismaili Shia community, around whom the Bangash tribe might have formed. History During the early modern period, the Bangash homeland was known as \\"Bangash district.\\" Babur, a Timurid (and later Mughal) ruler from Fergana (in present-day Uzbekistan) who captured Kabul in 1504, described Bangash district in his Baburnama as one of the 14 t≈´mƒÅn of Kabul province.\\"The Garden of the Eight Paradises\\", Stephen Frederic Dale, pg. 304 Timurid raids Babur attacking Kohat in 1505 In 1505, after plundering Kohat for two days, Babur's Timurid army marched southwest to raid Bangash district. As they reached a valley surrounded by mountains between Kohat and Hangu, the Bangash Pashtuns occupied the hills on both sides, surrounding the army. However, the Timurids successfully pushed the Pashtuns down towards a nearby detached hill, after which the Timurids surrounded them from all sides and got hold of them. About 100 to 200 Pashtuns were taken during the attack. Babur wrote in his Baburnama: \\"We had been told that when Afghans are powerless to resist, they go before their foe with grass between their teeth, this being as much as to say, 'I am your cow.' Here we saw this custom; Afghans unable to make resistance, came before us with grass between their teeth. Those our men had brought in as prisoners were ordered to be beheaded and a pillar of their heads was set up in our camp.\\" On the next day, Babur reached Hangu, where the Bangash Pashtuns had fortified a sangar on the top of a hill. The Timurid army immediately captured it and beheaded about 100 to 200 more Pashtuns, setting up another tower of heads. From Hangu, the Timurid army marched to Tall. The soldiers set out to plunder the Bangash Pashtuns of the neighborhood. Afterwards, the Timurids marched from Bangash to Bannu on the Kurram River, where they set up their third pillar of severed heads. Roshani movement In the second half of the 16th century, the Bangash tribe joined the Roshani movement of Pir Roshan, who migrated with his family and few of his disciples from Waziristan to Tirah. The Roshanis rebelled against the Mughal emperor Akbar, who constantly sent punitive expeditions to crush the movement. After Pir Roshan's death, the movement was led by his youngest son Pir Jalala. In 1587, Akbar sent a strong Mughal force against him to the Bangash region. In 1599, Pir Jalala took Ghazni but it was quickly recovered by the Mughals. Pir Jalala was succeeded by his nephew Ahdad, who set up a base in Charkh, Logar, and attacked Mughal-held Kabul and Jalalabad several times between 1611 and 1615, but was unsuccessful. In 1626, Ahdad died during a Mughal attack in Tirah. In 1630, when Pir Roshan's great-grandson, Abdul Qadir, launched attacks on the Mughal army in Peshawar, thousands of Pashtuns from the Bangash, Afridi, Mohmand, Kheshgi, Yusufzai, and other tribes took part. The Roshanis failed in the attack, but continued their resistance against the Mughals throughout the 17th century. Khwaja Muhammad Bangash, who belonged to the Bangash tribe, was a famous 17th-century Pashto Sufi poet and mystic associated with the Roshani movement. Karrani dynasty of Bengal Karrani-ruled Bengal (1564‚Äì1576) The Karrani dynasty was founded in 1564 by Taj Khan Karrani, a Karlani Pashtun hailing from the Kurram valley in Bangash district. It was the last dynasty to rule the Bengal Sultanate. Taj Khan Karrani was formerly an employee of the Sur Pashtun emperor, Sher Shah Suri. His capital was at Gaur (in present-day Malda district, West Bengal, India). He was succeeded by his brother Sulaiman Khan Karrani, who shifted the capital from Gaur to Tandah (also in Malda district) in 1565. In 1568, Sulaiman Khan annexed Orissa to the Karrani sultanate. Sulaiman Khan's authority extended from Cooch Behar to Puri, and from Son River to Brahmaputra River. On 25 September 1574, the Mughal Empire captured the Karrani capital Tandah. The Battle of Tukaroi fought on 3 March 1575 forced Daud Khan Karrani, the last Karrani ruler, to withdraw to Orissa. The battle led to the Treaty of Katak in which Daud ceded the whole of Bengal and Bihar, retaining only Orissa. Daud Khan, however, later invaded Bengal, declaring independence from Mughal emperor Akbar. The Mughal onslaught against the Karrani sultanate ended with the Battle of Rajmahal on 12 July 1576, during which Daud Khan was captured and later executed by the Mughals. However, the Pashtuns and the local landlords known as Baro Bhuyans led by Isa Khan continued to resist the Mughal invasion. Later in 1612 during the reign of Jahangir, Bengal was finally integrated as a Mughal province. Bangash state of Farrukhabad Muhammad Khan Bangash (1713-1743), the first Nawab of Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, India Muhammad Khan Bangash, who belonged to the Bangash tribe, became the first Nawab of Farrukhabad in 1713 in Uttar Pradesh, India. He named the city after then Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar. The Bangash Nawabs encouraged merchants and bankers to come and settle in Farrukhabad for the promotion of commercial activities. Very important in this respect was the establishment of the Farrukhabad mint, which apart from being an emblem of sovereignty, stimulated bullion imports and attracted numerous bankers to work in the city. The superior quality of the Farrukhabad currency, both gold and silver, was well-known in the eighteenth century as it became the most trustworthy and hardest currency of northern India. Ahmad Shah Durrani (1747‚Äì1772), the founder of the Afghan Durrani Empire, preferred coins made at the Farrukhabad mint. The third Nawab of Farrukhabad, Ahmad Khan Bangash, took part in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 and supported Ahmad Shah Durrani to defeat the Marathas. Because of its reputation as a centre of commerce and finance, Farrukhabad began to attract new Pashtun immigrants from Afghanistan. However, Bangash-held Farrukhabad suffered from a steep economic and political decline under the British Company Raj, because the British colonial officers ordered to close the famed Farrukhabad mint and halt the bullion trade in 1824 as part of their policy to centralize the economy of India. The abolition of the mint dealt a heavy blow to the thriving grain trade and precipitated a monetary crisis in the urban and rural areas of the region. The Bangash Nawabs continued to rule Farrukhabad until they were defeated by the British at Kannauj on 23 October 1857 during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Today, many Bangash are settled in Uttar Pradesh, most notably in Farrukhabad. Bhopal State Dost Mohammad Khan Orakzai (1707‚Äì1728), founder of the Bhopal State (from a painting at Golghar Museum) Taj Mahal palace at Bhopal, built by Shah Jahan Begum (1868‚Äì1901) The Orakzai tribe is historically closely related to the Bangash; their traditional homeland (Orakzai District) was part of Bangash district. In 1723, Dost Mohammad Khan, who belonged to the Orakzai tribe and was formerly a mercenary in the Mughal army, founded the Bhopal State in the present-day Madhya Pradesh state of central India. After his death in 1728, his descendants, the Nawabs of Bhopal, continued ruling the state. Between 1819 and 1926, the state was ruled by four women ‚Äì the Nawab Begums ‚Äì unique in the royalty of those days. The third Nawab Begum of Bhopal, Shah Jahan Begum (1868‚Äì1901), built the Taj Mahal palace at Bhopal as her residence. Hamidullah Khan, the last sovereign Nawab of the dynasty, officially acceded the state to India in 1949.  Pashto dialect  The Bangash speak a northern or \\"harder\\" variant of Pashto similar to that of the Afridi dialect, but slightly differing in some lexicographical and phonetic features.  Religion  Most Bangash follow the religion of Islam, split almost evenly between Twelver Shia Muslims and Hanafi Sunni Muslims. The Bangash, along with the closely related Orakzais and Turis, are the only Pashtun tribes with large Shia populations. The Shia Bangash are more concentrated around Upper Kurram and Hangu, while the Sunni Bangash are more concentrated around Lower Kurram and Tall. There is a small minority of Sikhs among the Bangash in Hangu, Orakzai, and Kurram. Due to the ongoing insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, like many other tribal Pashtuns, some Pashtun Sikhs were internally displaced from their ancestral villages to settle in cities like Peshawar and Nankana Sahib.

This genus was first described in 1884 by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh based on a nearly complete skeleton discovered in Garden Park, Colorado, in rocks belonging to the Morrison Formation. The type species is Ceratosaurus nasicornis. The Garden Park specimen remains the most complete skeleton known from the genus, and only a handful of additional specimens have been described since. Two additional species, Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus and Ceratosaurus magnicornis, have been described in 2000 from two fragmentary skeletons from the Cleveland- Lloyd Quarry of Utah and from the vicinity of Fruita, Colorado. The validity of these additional species has been questioned, however, and all three skeletons possibly represent different growth stages of the same species. In 1999, the discovery of the first juvenile specimen was reported. Since 2000, a partial specimen was excavated and described from the Lourinh√£ Formation of Portugal, providing evidence for the presence of the genus outside of North America. Fragmentary remains have also been reported from Tanzania, Uruguay, and Switzerland, although their assignment to Ceratosaurus is currently not accepted by most paleontologists. Ceratosaurus was a medium-sized theropod. The original specimen is estimated to be or long, while the specimen described as C. dentisulcatus was larger, at around long. Ceratosaurus was characterized by deep jaws that supported proportionally very long, blade-like teeth, a prominent, ridge-like horn on the midline of the snout, and a pair of horns over the eyes. The forelimbs were very short, but remained fully functional; the hand had four fingers. The tail was deep from top to bottom. A row of small osteoderms (skin bones) was present down the middle of the neck, back, and tail. Additional osteoderms were present at unknown positions on the animal's body. Ceratosaurus gives its name to the Ceratosauria, a clade of theropod dinosaurs that diverged early from the evolutionary lineage leading to modern birds. Within the Ceratosauria, some paleontologists proposed it to be most closely related to Genyodectes from Argentina, which shares the strongly elongated teeth. The geologically older genus Proceratosaurus from England, although originally described as a presumed antecedent of Ceratosaurus, was later found to be unrelated. Ceratosaurus shared its habitat with other large theropod genera including Torvosaurus and Allosaurus, and it has been suggested that these theropods occupied different ecological niches to reduce competition. Ceratosaurus may have preyed upon plant-eating dinosaurs, although some paleontologists suggested that it hunted aquatic prey such as fish. The nasal horn was probably not used as a weapon as was originally suggested by Marsh, but more likely was used solely for display. Description Size of two specimens compared to a human, with the holotype of Ceratosaurus nasicornis (USNM 4735) in orange and a larger specimen (UMNH VP 5278) in blue Ceratosaurus followed the body plan typical for large theropod dinosaurs. A biped, it moved on powerful hind legs, while its arms were reduced in size. Specimen USNM 4735, the first discovered skeleton and holotype of Ceratosaurus nasicornis, was an individual or in length according to separate sources. Whether this animal was fully grown is not clear. Othniel Charles Marsh, in 1884, suggested that this specimen weighed about half as much as the contemporary Allosaurus. In more recent accounts, this was revised to , , or . Three additional skeletons discovered in the latter half of the 20th century were substantially larger. The first of these, UMNH VP 5278, was informally estimated by James Madsen to have been around long, but was later estimated at in length. Its weight was calculated at , , and in separate works. The second skeleton, MWC 1, was somewhat smaller than UMNH VP 5278 and might have been in weight. The third, yet undescribed, specimen BYUVP 12893 was claimed to be the largest yet discovered, although estimates have not been published. Another specimen (ML 352), discovered in Portugal in 2000, was estimated at in length and in weight. Artist's impression of C. nasicornis The exact number of vertebrae is unknown due to several gaps in the spine of the Ceratosaurus nasicornis holotype. At least 20 vertebrae formed the neck and back in front of the sacrum. In the middle portion of the neck, the (bodies) of the vertebrae were as long as they were tall, while in the front and rear portions of the neck, the centra were shorter than their height. The upwards projecting were comparatively large, and in the dorsal (back) vertebrae, were as tall as the vertebral centra were long. The sacrum, consisting of six fused , was arched upwards, with its vertebral centra strongly reduced in height in its middle portion, as is the case in some other ceratosaurians. The tail comprised around 50 and was about half of the animal's total length; in the holotype, it was estimated at . The tail was deep from top to bottom due to its high neural spines and elongated chevrons, bones located below the vertebral centra. As in other dinosaurs, it counterbalanced the body and contained the massive caudofemoralis muscle, which was responsible for forward thrust during locomotion, pulling the upper thigh backwards when contracted. Distinguishing skull features of Ceratosaurus: The fused left and right nasal bones form a prominent nasal horn (top), and the teeth of the upper jaw are exceptionally long (bottom). These fossils are part of specimen MWC 1 from Fruita, Colorado, and are on display at the local Dinosaur Journey Museum. The scapula (shoulder blade) was fused with the coracoid, forming a single bone without any visible demarcation between the two original elements. The C. nasicornis holotype was found with an articulated left fore limb including an incomplete (hand). Although during preparation, a cast had been made of the fossil beforehand to document the original relative positions of the bones. Carpal bones were not known from any specimen, leading some authors to suggest that they were lost in the genus. In a 2016 paper, Matthew Carrano and Jonah Choiniere suggested that one or more cartilaginous (not bony) carpals were probably present, as indicated by a gap present between the forearm bones and the metacarpals, as well as by the surface texture within this gap seen in the cast. In contrast to most more-derived theropods, which showed only three digits on each manus (digits I‚ÄìIII), Ceratosaurus retained four digits, with digit IV reduced in size. The first and fourth metacarpals were short, while the second was slightly longer than the third. The metacarpus and especially the first phalanges were proportionally very short, unlike in most other basal theropods. Only the first phalanges of digits II, III, and IV are preserved in the holotype; the total number of phalanges and unguals (claw bones) is unknown. The anatomy of metacarpal I indicates that phalanges had originally been present on this digit, as well. The pes (foot) consisted of three weight- bearing digits, numbered II‚ÄìIV. Digit I, which in theropods is usually reduced to a dewclaw that does not touch the ground, is not preserved in the holotype. Marsh, in his original 1884 description, assumed that this digit was lost in Ceratosaurus, but Charles Gilmore, in his 1920 monograph, noted an attachment area on the second metatarsal demonstrating the presence of this digit. Uniquely among theropods, Ceratosaurus possessed small, elongated, and irregularly formed osteoderms (skin bones) along the midline of its body. Such osteoderms have been found above the neural spines of cervical vertebrae 4 and 5, as well as caudal vertebrae 4 to 10, and probably formed a continuous row that might have extended from the base of the skull to most of the tail. As suggested by Gilmore in 1920, their position in the rock matrix likely reflects their exact position in the living animal. The osteoderms above the tail were found separated from the neural spines by to , possibly accounting for skin and muscles present in between, while those of the neck were much closer to the neural spines. Apart from the body midline, the skin contained additional osteoderms, as indicated by a by large, roughly quadrangular plate found together with the holotype; the position of this plate on the body is unknown. Specimen UMNH VP 5278 was also found with a number of osteoderms, which have been described as amorphous in shape. Although most of these were found at most 5 m apart from the skeleton, they were not directly associated with any vertebrae, unlike in the C. nasicornis holotype, so their original position on the body cannot be inferred from this specimen. Skull Diagram of the Ceratosaurus nasicornis holotype skull in top and side view by Charles Gilmore, 1920: This reconstruction is now thought to be too wide in top view. The skull was quite large in proportion to the rest of its body. It measures in length in the C. nasicornis holotype, measured from the tip of the snout to the , which connects to the first cervical vertebra. The width of this skull is difficult to reconstruct, as it is heavily distorted, and Gilmore's 1920 reconstruction was later found to be too wide. The fairly complete skull of specimen MWC 1 was estimated to have been in length and in width; this skull was somewhat more elongated than that of the holotype. The back of the skull was more lightly built than in some other larger theropods due to extensive skull openings, yet the jaws were deep to support the proportionally large teeth. The lacrimal bone formed not only the back margin of the antorbital fenestra, a large opening between eye and , but also part of its upper margin, unlike in members of the related Abelisauridae. The quadrate bone, which was connected to the lower jaw at its bottom end to form the jaw joint, was inclined so that the jaw joint was displaced backwards in relation to the occipital condyle. This also led to a broadening of the base of the lateral temporal fenestra, a large opening behind the eyes. The most distinctive feature was a prominent horn situated on the skull midline behind the bony nostrils, which was formed from fused protuberances of the left and right nasal bones. Only the bony horn core is known from fossils‚Äîin the living animal, this core would have supported a keratinous sheath. While the base of the horn core was smooth, its upper two-thirds were wrinkled and lined with groves that would have contained blood vessels when alive. In the holotype, the horn core is long and wide at its base, but quickly narrows to only further up; it is in height. It is longer and lower in the skull of MWC 1. In the living animal, the horn would likely have been more elongated due to its keratinous sheath. Behind the nasal horn, the nasal bones formed an oval groove; both this groove and the nasal horn serve as features to distinguish Ceratosaurus from related genera. In addition to the large nasal horn, Ceratosaurus possessed smaller, semicircular, bony ridges in front of each eye, similar to those of Allosaurus. These ridges were formed by the lacrimal bones. In juveniles, all three horns were smaller than in adults, and the two halves of the nasal horn core were not yet fused. The premaxillary bones, which formed the tip of the snout, contained merely three teeth on each side, less than in most other theropods. The of the upper jaw were lined with 15 blade-like teeth on each side in the holotype. The first eight of these teeth were very long and robust, but from the ninth tooth onward they gradually decrease in size. As typical for theropods, they featured finely edges, which in the holotype contained some 10 denticles per . Specimen MWC 1 merely showed 11 to 12, and specimen UMNH VP 5278 12 teeth in each maxilla; the teeth were more robust and more recurved in the latter specimen. In all specimens, the tooth crowns of the upper jaws were exceptionally long. In specimen UMNH VP 5278, they measured up to in length, which is equal to the minimum height of the lower jaw. In the holotype, they are in length, which even surpasses the minimum height of the lower jaw. In other theropods, a comparable tooth length is only known from the possibly closely related Genyodectes. In contrast, several members of the Abelisauridae feature very short tooth crowns. In the holotype, each half of the , the tooth-bearing bone of the , was equipped with 15 teeth, which are, however, poorly preserved. Both specimens MWC 1 and UMNH VP 5278 show only 11 teeth in each dentary, which were, as shown by the latter specimen, slightly straighter and less sturdy than those of the upper jaw. History of discovery Holotype specimen of C. nasicornis C. nasicornis skeleton restoration by Othniel Charles Marsh from 1892, depicted in an erroneous upright position and with excess vertebrae in the spine resulting in an overly elongated trunk The first specimen, the holotype USNM 4735, was discovered and excavated by farmer Marshall Parker Felch in 1883 and 1884. Found in articulation, with the bones still connected to each other, it was nearly complete, including the skull. Significant missing parts include an unknown number of vertebrae; all but the last ribs of the trunk; the humeri (upper arm bones); the distal finger bones of both hands; most of the right fore limb; most of the left hind limb; and most of the feet. The specimen was found encased in hard sandstone; the skull and spine had been heavily distorted during fossilization. The site of discovery, located in the Garden Park area north of Ca√±on City, Colorado, and known as the Felch Quarry 1, is regarded as one of the richest fossil sites of the Morrison Formation. Numerous dinosaur fossils had been recovered from this quarry even before the discovery of Ceratosaurus, most notably a nearly complete specimen of Allosaurus (USNM 4734) in 1883 and 1884. After excavation, the specimen was shipped to the Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, where it was studied by Marsh, who described it as the new genus and species Ceratosaurus nasicornis in 1884. The name Ceratosaurus may be translated as \\"horn lizard\\" (from Greek Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÇ/Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÑŒøœÇ, keras/keratos‚Äî\\"horn\\" and œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ/sauros‚Äî\\"lizard\\"), and nasicornis with \\"nose horn\\" (from Latin nasus‚Äî\\"nose\\" and cornu‚Äî\\"horn\\"). Given the completeness of the specimen, the newly described genus was at the time the best-known theropod discovered in America. In 1898 and 1899, the specimen was transferred to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, together with many other fossils originally described by Marsh. Only part of this material was fully prepared when it arrived in Washington; subsequent preparation lasted from 1911 to the end of 1918. Packaging and shipment from New Haven to Washington caused some damage to the Ceratosaurus specimen. In 1920, Charles Gilmore published an extensive redescription of this and the other theropod specimens received from New Haven, including the nearly complete Allosaurus specimen recovered from the same quarry. Reconstruction of the holotype specimen of C. nasicornis by Charles W. Gilmore, 1920, showing known elements In an 1892 paper, Marsh published the first skeletal reconstruction of Ceratosaurus, which depicts the animal at in length and in height. As noted by Gilmore in 1920, the trunk was depicted much too long in this reconstruction, incorporating at least six dorsal vertebrae too many. This error was repeated in several subsequent publications, including the first life reconstruction, which was drawn in 1899 by Frank Bond under the guidance of Charles R. Knight, but not published until 1920. A more accurate life reconstruction, published in 1901, was produced by Joseph M. Gleeson, again under Knight's supervision. The holotype was mounted by Gilmore in 1910 and 1911, and since then was exhibited at the National Museum of Natural History. Most early reconstructions show Ceratosaurus in an upright posture, with the tail dragging on the ground. Gilmore's mount of the holotype, in contrast, was ahead of its time: Inspired by the upper thigh bones, which were found angled against the lower leg, he depicted the mount as a running animal with a horizontal rather than upright posture and a tail that did not make contact with the ground. Because of the strong flattening of the fossils, Gilmore mounted the specimen not as a free-standing skeleton, but as a bas-relief within an artificial wall. With the bones being partly embedded in a plaque, scientific access was limited. In the course of the renovation of the museum's dinosaur exhibition between 2014 and 2019, the specimen was dismantled and freed from the encasing plaque. In the new exhibition, which is set to open in 2019, the mount is planned to be replaced by a free-standing cast, and the original bones to be stored in the museum collection to allow full access for scientists. Probably the first life restoration of Ceratosaurus, drawn in 1899 by Frank Bond under the guidance of Charles R. Knight, but not published until 1920 Additional finds in North America After the discovery of the holotype of C. nasicornis, a significant Ceratosaurus find was not made until the early 1960s, when paleontologist James Madsen and his team unearthed a fragmentary, disarticulated skeleton including the skull (UMNH VP 5278) in the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. This find represents one of the largest-known Ceratosaurus specimens. A second, articulated specimen including the skull (MWC 1) was discovered in 1976 by Thor Erikson, the son of paleontologist Lance Erikson, near Fruita, Colorado. A fairly complete specimen, it lacks lower jaws, forearms and gastralia. The skull, although reasonably complete, was found disarticulated and is strongly flattened sidewards. Although a large individual, it had not yet reached adult size, as indicated by open sutures between the skull bones. Scientifically accurate three-dimensional reconstructions of the skull for use in museum exhibits were produced using a complicated process including molding and casting of the individual original bones, correction of deformities, reconstruction of missing parts, assembly of the bone casts into their proper position, and painting to match the original color of the bones. Both the Fruita and Cleveland-Lloyd specimens were described by Madsen and Samuel Paul Welles in a 2000 monograph, with the Utah specimen being assigned to the new species C. dentisulcatus and the Colorado specimen to the new species C. magnicornis. The name dentisulcatus refers to the parallel grooves present on the inner sides of the premaxillary teeth and the first three teeth of the lower jaw in that specimen; magnicornis points to the larger nasal horn. The validity of both species, however, was questioned in subsequent publications. Brooks Britt and colleagues, in 2000, claimed that the C. nasicornis holotype was in fact a juvenile individual, with the two larger species representing the adult state of a single species. Oliver Rauhut, in 2003, and Matthew Carrano and Scott Sampson, in 2008, considered the anatomical differences cited by Madsen and Welles to support these additional species to represent ontogenetic (age-related) or individual variation. Partial juvenile specimen, North American Museum of Ancient Life A further specimen (BYUVP 12893) was discovered in 1992 in the Agate Basin Quarry southeast of Moore, Utah, but still awaits description. The specimen, considered the largest known from the genus, includes the front half of a skull, seven fragmentary pelvic dorsal vertebrae, and an articulated pelvis and sacrum. In 1999, Britt reported the discovery of a Ceratosaurus skeleton belonging to a juvenile individual. Discovered in Bone Cabin Quarry in Wyoming, it is 34% smaller than the C. nasicornis holotype and consists of a complete skull as well as 30% of the remainder of the skeleton including a complete pelvis. Besides these five skeletal finds, fragmentary Ceratosaurus remains have been reported from various localities from stratigraphic zones 2 and 4-6 of the Morrison Formation, including some of the major fossil sites of the formation. Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, yielded an isolated right premaxilla (specimen number DNM 972); a large shoulder blade (scapulocoracoid) was reported from Como Bluff in Wyoming. Another specimen stems from the Dry Mesa Quarry, Colorado, and includes a left scapulocoracoid, as well as fragments of vertebrae and limb bones. In Mygatt Moore Quarry, Colorado, the genus is known from teeth. Finds outside North America From 1909 to 1913, German expeditions of the Berlin Museum f√ºr Naturkunde uncovered a diverse dinosaur fauna from the Tendaguru Formation in German East Africa, in what is now Tanzania. Although commonly considered the most important African dinosaur locality, large theropod dinosaurs are only known through few and very fragmentary remains. In 1920, German paleontologist Werner Janensch assigned several dorsal vertebrae from the quarry \\"TL\\" to Ceratosaurus, as Ceratosaurus sp. (of uncertain species). In 1925, Janensch named a new species of Ceratosaurus, C. roechlingi, based on fragmentary remains from the quarry \\"Mw\\" encompassing a quadrate bone, a fibula, fragmentary caudal vertebrae, and other fragments. This specimen stems from an individual substantially larger than the C. nasicornis holotype. Restoration of C. nasicornis by Joseph M. Gleeson from 1901, made under supervision of Charles R. Knight. In their 2000 monograph, Madsen and Welles confirmed the assignment of these finds to Ceratosaurus. In addition, they ascribed several teeth to the genus, which had originally been described by Janensch as a possible species of Labrosaurus, Labrosaurus (?) stechowi. Other authors questioned the assignment of any of the Tendaguru finds to Ceratosaurus, noting that none of these specimens displays features diagnostic for that genus. In 2011, Rauhut found both C. roechlingi and Labrosaurus (?) stechowi to be possible ceratosaurids, but found them to be not diagnostic at genus level and therefore designated them as nomina dubia (doubtful names). In 1990, Timothy Rowe and Jacques Gauthier mentioned yet another Ceratosaurus species from Tendaguru, Ceratosaurus ingens, which purportedly was erected by Janensch in 1920 and was based on 25 isolated, very large teeth up to in length. However, Janensch assigned this species to Megalosaurus, not to Ceratosaurus; therefore, this name might be a simple copying error. Rauhut, in 2011, showed that Megalosaurus ingens was not closely related to either Megalosaurus or Ceratosaurus, but possibly represents a carcharodontosaurid, instead. In 2000 and 2006, paleontologists led by Oct√°vio Mateus described a find from the Lourinh√£ Formation in central- west Portugal (ML 352) as a new specimen of Ceratosaurus, consisting of a right femur (upper thigh bone), a left tibia (shin bone), and several isolated teeth recovered from the cliffs of Valmit√£o beach, between the municipalities Lourinh√£ and Torres Vedras. The bones were found embedded in yellow to brown, fine-grained sandstones, which were deposited by rivers as floodplain deposits and belong to the lower levels of the Porto Novo Member, which is thought to be late Kimmeridgian in age. Additional bones of this individual (SHN (JJS)-65), including a left femur, a right tibia, and a partial left fibula (calf bone), were since exposed due to progressing cliff erosion. Although initially part of a private collection, these additional elements became officially curated after the private collection was donated to the Sociedade de Hist√≥ria Natural in Torres Vedras, and were described in detail in 2015. The specimen was ascribed to the species Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus by Mateus and colleagues in 2006. A 2008 review by Carrano and Sampson confirmed the assignment to Ceratosaurus, but concluded that the assignment to any specific species is not possible at present. In 2015, Elisabete Malafaia and colleagues, who questioned the validity of C. dentisulcatus, assigned the specimen to Ceratosaurus aff. Ceratosaurus nasicornis. Other reports include a single tooth found in Moutier, Switzerland. Originally named by Janensch in 1920 as Labrosaurus meriani, the tooth was later assigned Ceratosaurus sp. (of unknown species) by Madsen and Welles. In 2008, Mat√≠as Soto and Daniel Perea described teeth from the Tacuaremb√≥ Formation in Uruguay, including a presumed premaxillary tooth crown. This shows vertical striations on its inner side and lacks denticles on its front edge; these features are, in this combination, only known from Ceratosaurus. The authors, however, stress that an assignment to Ceratosaurus is infeasible as the remains are scant, and furthermore note that the assignment of the European and African material to Ceratosaurus has to be viewed with caution. Classification C. nasicornis holotype, as mounted by Charles Gilmore in 1910 and 1911, National Museum of Natural History In his original description of the Ceratosaurus nasicornis holotype and subsequent publications, Marsh noted a number of characteristics that were unknown in all other theropods known at the time. Two of these features, the fused pelvis and fused metatarsus, were known from modern-day birds, and according to Marsh, clearly demonstrate the close relationship between the latter and dinosaurs. To set the genus apart from Allosaurus, Megalosaurus, and coelurosaurs, Marsh made Ceratosaurus the only member of both a new family, the Ceratosauridae, and a new infraorder, the Ceratosauria. This was questioned in 1892 by Edward Drinker Cope, Marsh's rival in the Bone Wars, who argued that distinctive features such as the nasal horn merely showed that C. nasicornis was a distinct species, but were insufficient to justify a distinct genus. Consequently, he assigned C. nasicornis to the genus Megalosaurus, creating the new combination Megalosaurus nasicornis. Although Ceratosaurus was retained as a distinct genus in all subsequent analyses, its relationships remained controversial during the following century. Both the Ceratosauridae and Ceratosauria were not widely accepted, with only few and poorly known additional members identified. Over the years, separate authors classified Ceratosaurus within the Deinodontidae, the Megalosauridae, the Coelurosauria, the Carnosauria, and the Deinodontoidea. In his 1920 revision, Gilmore argued that the genus was the most basal theropod known from after the Triassic, so not closely related to any other contemporary theropod known at that time; it thus warrants its own family, the Ceratosauridae. It was not until the establishment of cladistic analysis in the 1980s, however, that Marsh's original claim of the Ceratosauria as a distinct group gained ground. In 1985, the newly discovered South American genera Abelisaurus and Carnotaurus were found to be closely related to Ceratosaurus. Gauthier, in 1986, recognized the Coelophysoidea to be closely related to Ceratosaurus, although this clade falls outside of Ceratosauria in most recent analyses. Many additional members of the Ceratosauria have been recognized since. The Ceratosauria split off early from the evolutionary line leading to modern birds, thus is considered basal within theropods. Ceratosauria itself contains a group of derived (nonbasal) members of the families Noasauridae and Abelisauridae, which are bracketed within the clade Abelisauroidea, as well as a number of basal members, such as Elaphrosaurus, Deltadromeus, and Ceratosaurus. The position of Ceratosaurus within basal ceratosaurians is under debate. Some analyses considered Ceratosaurus as the most derived of the basal members, forming the sister taxon of the Abelisauroidea. Oliver Rauhut, in 2004, proposed Genyodectes as the sister taxon of Ceratosaurus, as both genera are characterized by exceptionally long teeth in the upper jaw. Rauhut grouped Ceratosaurus and Genyodectes within the family Ceratosauridae, which was followed by several later accounts. Shuo Wang and colleagues, in 2017, concluded that the Noasauridae were not nested within the Abelisauroidea as was previously assumed, but instead were more basal than Ceratosaurus. Because noasaurids had been used as a fix point to define the clades Abelisauroidea and Abelisauridae, these clades would consequently include many more taxa per definition, including Ceratosaurus. In a subsequent 2018 study, Rafael Delcourt accepted these results, but pointed out that, as a consequence, the Abelisauroidea would need to be replaced by the older synonym Ceratosauroidea, which was hitherto rarely used. For the Abelisauridae, Delcourt proposed a new definition that excludes Ceratosaurus, allowing for using the name its traditional sense. Wang and colleagues furthermore found that Ceratosaurus and Genyodectes form a clade with the Argentinian genus Eoabelisaurus. Delcourt used the name Ceratosauridae to refer to this same clade, and suggested to define the Ceratosauridae as containing all taxa that are more closely related to Ceratosaurus than to the abelisaurid Carnotaurus. Mounted cast of a juvenile skeleton, Dinosaur Discovery Museum The following cladogram showing the relationships of Ceratosaurus is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Diego Pol and Oliver Rauhut in 2012: A skull from the Middle Jurassic of England apparently displays a nasal horn similar to that of Ceratosaurus. In 1926, Friedrich von Huene described this skull as Proceratosaurus (meaning \\"before Ceratosaurus\\"), assuming that it was an antecedent of the Late Jurassic Ceratosaurus. Today, Proceratosaurus is considered a basal member of the Tyrannosauroidea, a much more derived clade of theropod dinosaurs; the nasal horn therefore would have had evolved independently in both genera. Oliver Rauhut and colleagues, in 2010, grouped Proceratosaurus within its own family, the Proceratosauridae. These authors also noted that the nasal horn is incompletely preserved, opening the possibility that it represented the foremost portion of a more extensive head crest, as seen in some other proceratosaurids such as Guanlong. Paleobiology Ecology and feeding Dry season at the Mygatt-Moore Quarry showing Ceratosaurus (center) and Allosaurus fighting over the desiccated carcass of another theropod Within the Morrison Formation, Ceratosaurus fossils are frequently found in association with those of other large theropods, including the megalosaurid Torvosaurus and the allosaurid Allosaurus. The Garden Park locality in Colorado contained, besides Ceratosaurus, fossils attributed to Allosaurus. The Dry Mesa Quarry in Colorado, as well as the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry and the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, feature, respectively, the remains of at least three large theropods: Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, and Torvosaurus. Likewise, Como Bluff and nearby localities in Wyoming contained remains of Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, and at least one large megalosaurid. Ceratosaurus was a rare element of the theropod fauna; it is outnumbered by Allosaurus at an average rate of 7.5 to 1 in sites where they co-occur. Several studies attempted to explain how these sympatric species could have reduced direct competition. Donald Henderson, in 1998, argued that Ceratosaurus co-occurred with two separate potential species of Allosaurus, which he denoted as \\"morphs\\": a morph with a shortened snout, a high and wide skull, and short, backwards-projecting teeth, and a morph characterized by a longer snout, lower skull, and long, vertical teeth. Generally speaking, the greater the similarity between sympatric species regarding their morphology, physiology, and behavior, the more intense competition between these species will be. Henderson came to the conclusion that the short-snouted Allosaurus morph occupied a different ecological niche from both the long-snouted morph and Ceratosaurus: The shorter skull in this morph would have reduced bending moments occurring during biting, thus increased bite force, comparable to the condition seen in cats. Ceratosaurus and the other Allosaurus morph, though, had long-snouted skulls, which are better compared to those of dogs: The longer teeth would have been used as fangs to deliver quick, slashing bites, with the bite force concentrated at a smaller area due to the narrower skull. According to Henderson, the great similarities in skull shape between Ceratosaurus and the long-snouted Allosaurus morph indicate that these forms engaged in direct competition with each other. Therefore, Ceratosaurus might had been pushed out of habitats dominated by the long-snouted morph. Indeed, Ceratosaurus is very rare in the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry, which contains the long-snouted Allosaurus morph, but appears to be more common in both Garden Park and the Dry Mesa Quarry, in which it co-occurs with the short-snouted morph. Reconstructed skeletons of Allosaurus and C. nasicornis in fighting postures, at Dinoworld Expo, Yokohama Furthermore, Henderson suggested that Ceratosaurus could have avoided competition by preferring different prey items; the evolution of its extremely elongated teeth might have been a direct result of the competition with the long-snouted Allosaurus morph. Both species could also have preferred different parts of carcasses when acting as scavengers. The elongated teeth of Ceratosaurus could have served as visual signals facilitating the recognition of members of the same species, or for other social functions. In addition, the large size of these theropods would have tended to decrease competition, as the number of possible prey items increases with size. Foster and Daniel Chure, in a 2006 study, concurred with Henderson that Ceratosaurus and Allosaurus generally shared the same habitats and preyed upon the same types of prey, thus likely had different feeding strategies to avoid competition. According to these researchers, this is also evidenced by different proportions of the skull, teeth, and fore limb. The distinction between the two Allosaurus morphs, however, was questioned by some later studies. Kenneth Carpenter, in a 2010 study, found that short-snouted individuals of Allosaurus from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry represent cases of extreme individual variation rather than a separate taxon. Furthermore, the skull of USNM 4734 from the Garden Park locality, which formed the basis for Henderson's analysis of the short-snouted morph, was later found to have been reconstructed too short. In a 2004 study, Robert Bakker and Gary Bir suggested that Ceratosaurus was primarily specialized in aquatic prey such as lungfish, crocodiles, and turtles. As indicated by a statistical analysis of shed teeth from 50 separate localities in and around Como Bluff, teeth of both Ceratosaurus and megalosaurids were most common in habitats in and around water sources such as wet floodplains, lake margins, and swamps. Ceratosaurus also occasionally occurred in terrestrial localities. Allosaurids, however, were equally common in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. From these results, Bakker and Bir concluded that Ceratosaurus and megalosaurids must have predominantly hunted near and within water bodies, with Ceratosaurus also feeding on carcasses of larger dinosaurs on occasion. The researchers furthermore noted the long, low, and flexible body of Ceratosaurus and megalosaurids. Compared to other Morrison theropods, Ceratosaurus showed taller neural spines on the foremost tail vertebrae, which were vertical rather than inclined towards the back. Together with the deep chevron bones on the underside of the tail, they indicate a deep, \\"crocodile-like\\" tail possibly adapted for swimming. On the contrary, allosaurids feature a shorter, taller, and stiffer body with longer legs. They would have been adapted for rapid running in open terrain and for preying upon large herbivorous dinosaurs such as sauropods and stegosaurs, but as speculated by Bakker and Bir, seasonally switched to aquatic prey items when the large herbivores were absent. However, this theory was challenged by Yun in 2019, suggesting Ceratosaurus was merely more capable of hunting aquatic prey then other theropods of the Morrison Formation then its contemporaries as opposed to being fully semiaquatic. Restoration of a feeding C. nasicornis In his 1986 popular book The Dinosaur Heresies, Bakker argued that the bones of the upper jaw were only loosely attached to the surrounding skull bones, allowing for some degree of movement within the skull, a condition termed cranial kinesis. Likewise, the bones of the lower jaw would have been able to move against each other, and the quadrate bone to swing outwards, spreading the lower jaw at the jaw joint. Taken together, these features would have allowed the animal to widen its jaws in order to swallow large food items. In a 2008 study, Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer re- evaluated similar claims made for other dinosaurs, concluding that the presence of muscle-powered cranial kinesis cannot be proven for any dinosaur species, and was likely absent in most. Function of the nasal horn and osteoderms In 1884, Marsh considered the nasal horn of Ceratosaurus to be a \\"most powerful weapon\\" for both offensive and defensive purposes, and Gilmore, in 1920, concurred with this interpretation. The use of the horn as a weapon is now generally considered unlikely, however. In 1985, David Norman believed that the horn was \\"probably not for protection against other predators,\\" but might instead have been used for intraspecific combat among male ceratosaurs contending for breeding rights. Gregory S. Paul, in 1988, suggested a similar function, and illustrated two Ceratosaurus engaged in a nonlethal butting contest. In 1990, Rowe and Gauthier went further, suggesting that the nasal horn of Ceratosaurus was \\"probably used for display purposes alone\\" and played no role in physical confrontations. If used for display, the horn likely would have been brightly colored. A display function was also proposed for the row of osteoderms running down the body midline. Forelimb function Cast of the hand of C. nasicornis (AMNH 27631): Most phalanges of the fingers are missing. The strongly shortened metacarpals and phalanges of Ceratosaurus raise the question whether the manus retained the grasping function assumed for other basal theropods. Within the Ceratosauria, an even more extreme manus reduction can be observed in abelisaurids, where the forelimb lost its original function, and in Limusaurus. In a 2016 paper on the anatomy of the Ceratosaurus manus, Carrano and Jonah Choiniere stressed the great morphological similarity of the manus with those of other basal theropods, suggesting that it still fulfilled its original grasping function, despite its shortening. Although only the first phalanges are preserved, the second phalanges would have been mobile, as indicated by the well-developed articular surfaces, and the digits would likely have allowed a similar degree of motion as in other basal theropods. As in other theropods other than abelisaurids, digit I would have been slightly turned in when flexed. Brain and senses Cast of the skull of the C. nasicornis holotype, showing the large nasal horn, American Museum of Natural History A cast of the brain cavity of the holotype was made under Marsh's supervision, probably during preparation of the skull, allowing Marsh to conclude that the brain \\"was of medium size, but comparatively much larger than in the herbivorous dinosaurs\\". The skull bones, however, had been cemented together afterwards, so the accuracy of this cast could not be verified by later studies. A second, well preserved braincase had been found with specimen MWC 1 in Fruita, Colorado, and was CT-scanned by paleontologists Kent Sanders and David Smith, allowing for reconstructions of the inner ear, gross regions of the brain, and cranial sinuses transporting blood away from the brain. In 2005, the researchers concluded that Ceratosaurus possessed a brain cavity typical for basal theropods, and similar to that of Allosaurus. The impressions for the olfactory bulbs, which house the sense of smell, are well-preserved. While similar to those of Allosaurus, they were smaller than in Tyrannosaurus, which is thought to have been equipped with a very keen sense of smell. The semicircular canals, which are responsible for the sense of balance and therefore allow for inferences on habitual head orientation and locomotion, are similar to those found in other theropods. In theropods, these structures are generally conservative, suggesting that functional requirements during locomotion have been similar across species. The foremost of the semicircular canals was enlarged, a feature generally found in bipedal animals. The orientation of the lateral semicircular canal indicates that the head and neck were held horizontally in neutral position. Fusion of metatarsals and paleopathology The holotype of C. nasicornis was found with its left metatarsals II to IV fused together. Marsh, in 1884, dedicated a short article to this at the time unknown feature in dinosaurs, noting the close resemblance to the condition seen in modern birds. The presence of this feature in Ceratosaurus became controversial in 1890, when Georg Baur speculated that the fusion in the holotype was the result of a healed fracture. This claim was repeated in 1892 by Cope, while arguing that C. nasicornis should be classified as a species of Megalosaurus due to insufficient anatomical differences between these genera. However, examples of fused metatarsals in dinosaurs that are not of pathological origin have been described since, including taxa more basal than Ceratosaurus. Osborn, in 1920, explained that no abnormal bone growth is evident, and that the fusion is unusual, but likely not pathological. Ronald Ratkevich, in 1976, argued that this fusion had limited the running ability of the animal, but this claim was rejected by Paul in 1988, who noted that the same feature occurs in many fast-moving animals of today, including ground birds and ungulates. A 1999 analysis by Darren Tanke and Bruce Rothschild suggested that the fusion was indeed pathological, confirming the earlier claim of Baur. Other reports of pathologies include a stress fracture in a foot bone assigned to the genus, as well as a broken tooth of an unidentified species of Ceratosaurus that shows signs of further wear received after the break. Paleoenvironment and paleobiogeography All North American Ceratosaurus finds come from the Morrison Formation, a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sedimentary rocks in the western United States, and the most fertile source for dinosaur bones of the continent. According to radiometric dating, the age of the formation ranges between 156.3 million years old (Mya) at its base, and 146.8 million years old at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. Ceratosaurus is known from Kimmeridgian and Tithonian strata of the formation. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinh√£ Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. Skeletons of C. nasicornis and Dryosaurus, Carnegie Museum The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327‚Äì329. Other dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods Koparion, Stokesosaurus, Ornitholestes, Allosaurus, and Torvosaurus; the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus; and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, Othnielia, Gargoyleosaurus, and Stegosaurus. Allosaurus, which accounted for 70 to 75% of all theropod specimens, was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles like Dorsetochelys, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans such as Hoplosuchus, and several species of pterosaurs such as Harpactognathus and Mesadactylus. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns and ferns (gallery forests) to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum. A partial Ceratosaurus specimen indicates the presence of the genus in the Portuguese Porto Novo Member of the Lourinh√£ Formation. Many of the dinosaurs of the Lourinh√£ Formation are the same genera as those seen in the Morrison Formation, or have a close counterpart. Besides Ceratosaurus, the researchers also noted the presence of Allosaurus and Torvosaurus in the Portuguese rocks are primarily known from the Morrison, while Lourinhanosaurus has so far only been reported from Portugal. Herbivorous dinosaurs from the Porto Novo Member include, among others, the sauropods Dinheirosaurus and Zby, as well as the stegosaur Miragaia. During the Late Jurassic, Europe had just been separated from North America by the still narrow Atlantic Ocean, and Portugal, as part of the Iberian Peninsula, was still separated from other parts of Europe. According to Mateus and colleagues, the similarity between the Portuguese and North American theropod faunas indicates the presence of a temporary land bridge, allowing for faunal interchange. Malafaia and colleagues, however, argued for a more complex scenario, as other groups, such as sauropods, turtles, and crocodiles, show clearly different species compositions in Portugal and North America. Thus, the incipient separation of these faunas could have led to interchange in some but allopatric speciation in other groups.

Since 1994 he was Head of the Centre for Oriental Studies, senior research fellow, Department of History, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Tartu. From 1969 to 1973 he served as lecturer of the Chair of General History at Tartu State University. Later he was dismissed for anti-communist views and subsequently worked for ten years as engineer of the Cabinet for Oriental Studies. He was partly rehabilitated in 1983 and promoted to head of the Laboratory for History and Semiotics (1983‚Äì1991). He later served as head of the Laboratory for Oriental Studies (1991‚Äì1994). His main research fields included: Buddhist MahƒÅyƒÅna texts, Buddhist mythology, classical Indian literature and culture, classical Chinese texts, Tibetan Buddhist texts and the history of small nations and peoples. He was one of the first who applied the methods of semiotic analysis for investigation of Buddhist texts and other texts of classical Oriental thought. M√§ll was one of the central figures of the branch of oriental studies in the Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School in 1960‚Äì70s. In the 1990s he worked on the elaboration of the conception of humanistic base texts; since 1998 the initiator and head of the research project \\"Humanistic base texts in the history of mankind\\"; and author of ten books and over one hundred academic articles. M√§ll was inspired to become a Buddhist and buddhologist by well-known Estonian theologian and philosopher Uku Masing in the early 1960s. He later studied under and worked together with several Buddhist and non- Buddhist teachers and scholars including Nikolai Konrad, Alexander Piatigorsky, Oktiabrina Volkova, Youri Parfionovich, Lev Menshikov and Lama Bidia Dandaron. He was a teacher and spiritual master for many Estonian Buddhists and orientalists of the younger generation. In the 1990s he established close ties with The Dalai Lama and served as the main organizer of both of his visits to Estonia (1991 and 2001). M√§ll was the founder and director of the first MahƒÅyƒÅna Institute (which existed from 1991 to 1994). He was awarded the Order of the White Star, IV degree in 2001.

His work was included in the first anthology of Imagist poetry, Des Imagistes, which was edited by Ezra Pound and published in 1914. He was a first cousin once removed of Edward Upward. His parents were George and Mary Upward, and he was survived by an elder sister (Mary) Edith Upward.The Times (London, England), Friday, Nov 19, 1926; pg. 17 Upward was brought up as a member of the Plymouth Brethren and trained as a lawyer at the Royal University of Dublin (now University College Dublin). While living in Dublin, he wrote a pamphlet in favour of Irish Home Rule. Upward later worked for the British Foreign Office in Kenya as a judge. Back in Britain, he defended Havelock Wilson and other labour leaders and ran for election as a Lib-Lab candidate, taking 659 votes in Merthyr at the 1895 general election.F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918 He wrote two books of poetry, Songs of Ziklag (1888) and Scented Leaves from a Chinese Jar. He also published a translation Sayings of Confucious and a volume of autobiography, Some Personalities (1921). Upward wrote a number of now-forgotten novels: The Prince of Balkistan (1895), A Crown of Straw (1896), A Bride's Madness (1897), The Accused Princess (1900) (source: Duncan, p. xii), \\"'The International Spy: Being a Secret History of the Russo-Japanese War\\" (1905), and Athelstane Ford. His 1910 novel \\"The Discovery of the Dead\\" is a collected fantasy (listed in Bleiler) dealing with the emerging science of Necrology. His 1913 book The Divine Mystery is an anthropological study of Christian mythology. In 1908, Upward self-published a book (originally written in 1901) which he apparently thought would be Nobel Prize material: The New Word. This book is today known as the first citation of the word \\"Scientology\\", however there was no delineation in this book of its definition by Upward. It is unknown whether L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Scientology-organization, knew of this book. In 1917 the British Museum refused to take Upwards' manuscripts, \\"on the grounds that the writer was still alive,\\" and Upward burned them (source: Duncan, p. xi). He shot himself in November 1926. Ezra Pound would a decade later satirically remark that this was due to his disappointment after hearing of George Bernard Shaw's Nobel Prize award which Shaw won in 1925.

It takes its name from a 15th-century public house, which was renamed in the 18th century after the Battle of Vigo Bay. While a nearby hamlet named Vigo was recorded on an 18th-century map, the present village was built in the mid-20th century, on a site that was previously a disused World War II army camp. The civil parish was created in 2000 from the parish of Meopham The village is situated in the middle of chestnut woodland at the top of the North Downs, east of the road between Gravesend and Wrotham. Trosley Country Park lies immediately south of the village and forms part of the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In the 2001 census Vigo civil parish had a population of 2,201,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Gravesham Retrieved 6 March 2010 reducing to 2,065 at the 2011 Census. History The Vigo Inn is reputed to date from 1471. It was renamed after the Battle of Vigo Bay, a naval battle fought in 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession. An apocryphal story suggests that the inn was renamed by a man who bought it with the proceeds of war prizes gained during the battle. Little is recorded about the area until the 1870s when Sir Sidney Waterlow purchased large areas of land including the village of Fairseat, a good proportion of Stansted, and land from Wrotham to Meopham. The parts of the estate were linked by a small bridge bearing the family crest over Trottiscliffe Road, which is still in evidence today. In 1887 he built Trosley Towers on the crest of the escarpment to the east of Trottiscliffe Road. It was approached by two drives and surrounded by wooded grounds. Other private drives were constructed, one of which is Hamilton Drive which still survives in Trosley Towers Country Park and runs from the site of the old house to Commority Road. Sir Sidney died in 1906 and the estate passed to his son Sir Philip. When he died in 1931 the estate was sold off. Some of the houses, such as Pilgrims House at the bottom of Trottiscliffe Road, were bought by tenants. Trosley Towers and the woodlands were sold to Mr E. E. Shahmoon in 1935. During this time chalets were built in the area. In 1936 Mr Shahmoon had Trosley Towers demolished and built Hamilton Lodge and adjoining stables. One story suggests that the Lodge and stables were built to accommodate the Shah of Persia and his racehorses on his visits to England. Second World War In 1942 the area was taken over by the army. With the outbreak of war and the subsequent increase in size of the army, there was a need for large numbers of suitable candidates to train as officers. This training normally took place at an Officer Cadet Training Unit (OCTU) which was attached to the arm of the service in which the cadet would eventually serve. There were several OCTUs and therefore duplication of resources occurred and standards varied from unit to unit, so in the early part of 1942 it was decided to standardise the basic training and send all potential officer cadets to a pre-OCTU for up to eight weeks, before their attendance at their specialist OCTU. With a few exceptions, all officer cadets were required to attend the newly formed pre- OCTU Wrotham Camp, which was situated on what is now the site of Vigo Village. Training areas extended northwards through all of Happy Valley, almost to Meopham, and south to farmland beyond the Pilgrims Way. The site handled the majority of officers for the British Army for the next four years, handling up to 10,000 men at any one time. The new camp was formed and administered by the 148th Independent Brigade Group, which became known as the 148th Training Brigade. Hamilton Lodge became the brigade's headquarters. Permanent staff and instructors who lived in the area were allowed to return home at evenings and weekends whilst the remainder were either accommodated on the site or billeted in Meopham or Wrotham. Cadets were housed in Nissen huts. Training consisted of lectures and demonstrations in a variety of subjects, tactics, map reading, field craft, camouflage and the operation of a variety of weapons including grenades and mortars. Field craft areas close to the camp were in 'Happy Valley' and night exercises took place in and around Luddesdown, Pilgrims Way, Addington and Ryarsh with a rifle range in the chalk pit, an assault course at the bottom of the escarpment and mortar and grenade ranges to the south of the Pilgrims Way. All instruction regarding vehicles was done at the D Wing [Driving and Maintenance]. The Wing had a large transport column of vehicles from 15cwt. trucks to 10 ton recovery vehicles plus hundreds of motor-cycles. The main motor pool was situated on what is now Vigo Rugby Club and motor cycle training was undertaken on a figure of eight course in the area of what is now Highview. The camp continued to operate through to the early part of 1946 (the decision to abolish the Brigade was taken on 8 April). Today little is left of what was at one time the largest pre-OCTU in the world. Only the outlines of some of the foundations in the surrounding woods, a concrete platform at the top of the escarpment which was a map reading point and a crumbling assault course wall at the bottom of the escarpment are now visible. Only one building remains, with its large, rusting double doors, it is situated behind Vigo School and was one of the motor transport garages. The only other reminder left today is in the name of one of the roads running through the village, Erskine Road, named after the Commanding Officer of the 148 Training Brigade from January 1943, and the Brigade HQ, Hamilton Lodge, on the Harvel Road. Post war With the departure of the army in 1946, the area was occupied by people who, for the most part, had lost everything during the Blitz. Here they found ready-made accommodation (in the form of Nissen Huts) and well-made roads, and soon a community formed. The presence of about 1000 people in the area prompted the councils of Strood, Gravesend, West Malling and Northfleet to improve conditions for the inhabitants: roads were improved, toilets installed, and the huts partitioned to provide three rooms. The council charged rent and the settlement became known as Vigo Village. The old camp lecture hall, Erskine Hall (on what is now the School field), was still standing and served the community in a variety of forms and at one point it was used as a storage facility for props from the London Palladium. A bus service was started along with a shopping centre, known as Piccadilly Circus. There was a library in Erskine Hall, and a doctor's surgery in Henley Street nearby. The stables at the back of Hamilton Lodge were used as a primary school from about 1948. Before this children attended Meopham and Culverstone schools. A scout group, the 17th Gravesend, was also started and run by the Church Army. To the east of the site, on what was the old army motorcycle training course (now the area of Highview), was a caravan site. By the late 1950s many of the residents were re-housed in nearby areas and the land was cleared to a certain extent. The land was then sold by Mr Shahmoon to Croudace Ltd, a property development company. The shopping centre was built later and the Villager pub opened in 1985.The Villager https://villagervigo.com/about- us/ Transport Vigo is served by buses to Sevenoaks and Gravesend.Kent County Council https://www.kent.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3853/Trosley-Country-Park- leaflet.pdf References External links *Vigo Parish Council *Vigo Village Primary School Category:Villages in Kent Category:Gravesham Category:Civil parishes in Kent ","title":"Vigo, Kent"},{"id":"1104874","text":"This penultimate scene of the Admonitions Scroll shows a palace lady sitting in quiet contemplation, presumably following the admonitions in the accompanying lines: \\"Therefore I say: Be cautious and circumspect in all you do, and from this good fortune will arise. Calmly and respectfully think about your actions, and honor and fame will await you.\\" Human self-reflection is the capacity of humans to exercise introspection and to attempt to learn more about their fundamental nature and essence. The earliest historical records demonstrate the great interest that humanity has had in itself. More than 3,000 years ago, \\"Know thyself\\", an ancient maxim by the Delphic oracle, Pythia, was inscribed on the forecourt of the Temple of Apollo when it was built over one of the oldest known religious sites in Ancient Greece. Human self-reflection is related to the philosophy of consciousness, the topic of awareness, consciousness in general, and the philosophy of mind. History Early writings Notions about the status of humanity may be revealed by the etymology of ancient words for humans. Latin homo (PIE *d ∞«µ ∞mÃ•m≈ç) means \\"of the earth, earthling\\", probably in opposition to \\"celestial\\" beings. Greek (mycenaean *anthropos) means \\"low-eyed\\", again probably contrasting with a divine perspective. From the third-millennium Old Kingdom of Egypt, belief in an eternal afterlife of the human ka is documented along with the notion that the actions of a person would be assessed to determine the quality of that existence. A claim of dominance of humanity alongside radical pessimism because of the frailty and brevity of human life is asserted in the Hebrew Bible Genesis 1:28, where dominion of humans is promised, but contrarily, the author of Ecclesiastes, bewails the vanity of all human effort. Classical antiquity Protagoras made the famous claim that humans are \\"the measure of all things; of what is, that it is; of what is not, that it is not\\". Socrates advocated the ancient adage for all humans to \\"Know thyself\\", and gave the (doubtlessly tongue-in-cheek) definition of humans as, \\"featherless bipeds\\" (Plato, Politicus). Aristotle described humans as the \\"communal animal\\" (Œ∂·ø∂ŒøŒΩ œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ), i.e., emphasizing society-building as a central trait of human nature, and being a \\"thought bearer animal\\" (, animal rationale), a term that also may have inspired the species taxonomy, Homo sapiens. Middle Ages The dominant world-view of medieval Europe, as directed by the Catholic Church, was that human existence is essentially good and created in \\"original grace\\", but because of concupiscence, is marred by sin, and that its aim should be to focus on a beatific vision after death. The thirteenth century pope Innocent III wrote about the essential misery of earthly existence in his \\"On the misery of the human condition\\"‚Äîa view that was disputed by, for example, Giannozzo Manetti in his treatise \\"On human dignity\\". Renaissance A famous quote of Shakespeare's Hamlet (II, ii, 115‚Äì117), expresses the contrast of human physical beauty, intellectual faculty, and ephemeral nature: Selbstbetrachtung (self-reflection) pen and ink drawing by Alfred Kubin (c. 1901) Ren√© Descartes famously and succinctly proposed: Cogito ergo sumDescartes, Ren√©; Principia Philosophiae (1644), Part 1, article 7: \\"Ac proinde h√¶c cognitio, ego cogito, ergo sum, est omnium prima & certissima, qu√¶ cuilibet ordine philosophanti occurrat.\\" (French: \\"Je pense donc je suis\\"; English: \\"I think, therefore I am\\"), not an assessment of humanity, but certainly reflecting a capacity for reasoning as a characteristic of humans, that potentially, could include individual self- reflection. Modern era The Enlightenment was driven by a renewed conviction, that, in the words of Immanuel Kant, \\"Man is distinguished above all animals by his self-consciousness, by which he is a 'rational animal'.\\" In conscious opposition to this tradition during the nineteenth century, Karl Marx defined humans as a \\"labouring animal\\" (animal laborans). In the early twentieth century, Sigmund Freud dealt a serious blow to positivism by postulating that, to a large part, human behaviour is controlled by the unconscious mind.  Comparison to other species  Various attempts have been made to identify a single behavioural characteristic that distinguishes humans from all other animals. Many anthropologists think that readily observable characteristics (tool-making and language) are based on less easily observable mental processes that might be unique among humans: the ability to think symbolically, in the abstract, or logically; however, several species have demonstrated some abilities in these areas and neither is it clear at what point in human evolution these traits became prevalent. Such characteristics may not be restricted to the species, Homo sapiens, as the extinct species of the genus Homo, since Homo neanderthalensis and Homo erectus were adept tool makers and may have had linguistic skills. In learning environments, reflection is an important processing part in order to maximize the utility of an experience. Rather than moving on to the next 'task' humans may review the process and outcome of a task and‚Äîwith the benefit of a little distance (lapsed time)‚Äîmay reconsider what the value of experience might be and for the context of which it was a part.  In meditation  Often during meditation humans experience introspection. When the brain experiences introspection, it can be said to be \\"reflecting upon itself\\". The action is described as \\"the looking into our own minds and reporting what we there discover\\". A study done by Cara Rosaen and Rita Benn analyzed middle school students who had not meditated prior to the study. Researchers found young people meditating for the first time experienced \\"improvement in skills indicative of emotional intelligence (self-control, self-reflection/awareness, and flexibility in emotional response)\\". The study concluded saying that middle school students who meditated for the first time experienced \\"increased state of restful alertness and greater capacity for self-reflection, self-control, and flexibility as well as improved academic performance.\\"  In sobriety  A study involving clients in a twelve-step program explored the role of self‚Äëreflection through diary writing, not only as daily therapy, but in a retrospective context. The study concluded that clients who read and reflected on their past diary entries demonstrated increased participation in the treatment program. The twelve-step program is based on self reflection and the accountability of actions past. The article by Mitchell Friedman indicates that success in one's recovery relies on self-reflection.

The novel was serialized in The Pall Mall Magazine and McClure's Magazine from December 1897 through June 1898. Plot summary The story is set within a framing narrative told by a supporting character from The Prisoner of Zenda. The frame implies that the events related in both books took place in the late 1870s and early 1880s. This story commences three years after the conclusion of Zenda, and deals with the same fictional country somewhere in Germanic Middle Europe, the kingdom of Ruritania. Most of the same characters recur: Rudolf Elphberg, the dissolute absolute monarch of Ruritania; Rudolf Rassendyll, the English gentleman who had acted as his political decoy, being his distant cousin and lookalike; Flavia, the princess, now queen; Rupert of Hentzau, the dashing well-born villain; Fritz von Tarlenheim, the loyal courtier; Colonel Sapt, the King's Bodyguard; Lieutenant von Bernenstein, the loyal soldier. Queen Flavia, dutifully but unhappily married to her cousin Rudolf V, writes to her true love Rudolf Rassendyll. The letter is carried by von Tarlenheim and his servant Bauer to be delivered by hand, but Fritz is betrayed by Bauer and it is stolen by the exiled Rupert of Hentzau and his loyal cousin the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim. Hentzau sees in it a chance to return to favour by informing the pathologically jealous and paranoid King. Rassendyll returns to Ruritania to aid the Queen, but is once more forced to impersonate the King after Rupert fatally shoots Rudolf V in a remote hunting lodge. After tracing Bauer to the house of Mother Holf, Rassendyll and Rupert engage in an epic duel. Hentzau is mortally wounded and Rassendyll burns the letter. However, he is assassinated in the hour of triumph by Bauer ‚Äîand thus is spared the crisis of conscience over whether or not to continue the royal deception for years. Rassendyll is buried as the King in a state funeral, while Sapt and Rassendyll's servant James stage a fire at the hunting lodge that burns the King's body beyond recognition. Rudolf V is buried as Rudolf Rassendyll, while Flavia reigns on alone, the last of the Elphberg dynasty. Adaptations James K. Hackett starred in Daniel Frohman's 1898 stage production of Rupert of Hentzau. Stage After a successful year on tour, a theatrical adaptation of Rupert of Hentzau opened at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City on April 10, 1899. Written by Anthony Hope with contributions by Edward Everett Rose, the play starred James K. Hackett in the dual roles of King Rudolf and Rudolf Rassendyll. Film Elaine Hammerstein and Bert Lytell in Rupert of Hentzau (1923) Several motion picture adaptations were made, although not as many as for Zenda. Film versions of Rupert of Hentzau include the following: *1915 film version Rupert of Hentzau starring Gerald Ames in the title role and Henry Ainley as Rassendyl *1923 Selznick Pictures film with Lew Cody as Rupert, turning the tragic ending on its head: Flavia abdicates to marry Rassendyll, and Ruritania is declared a republic). *A spoof version, Rupert of Hee Haw, was released in 1924. Stan Laurel plays an alcoholic king, whose queen, Mae Laurel, deposes and replaces him with an identical salesman named Rudolph Razz. Razz's manners are so uncourtly that a courtier, James Finlayson, challenges him to a duel. (See also Lord Haw-haw.) *A 1957 British TV movie Rupert of Hentzau starring John Westbrook as Rudolf Rassendyll/The King, Sarah Lawson as Queen Flavia, Robert Shaw as Rupert of Hentzau, Stanley Van Beers as Colonel Sapt, Maurice Kaufmann as Fritz von Tarlenheim, Jennifer Wright as Helga von Tarlenheim, John Gabriel, Paul Eddington as the Count Luzau-Rischenheim, Jeremy Burnham as Lieutenant Bernenstein, Diana Lamnert as Rosa Holf, Meadows White as James and Margery Caldicott as Mother Holf. *A 1964 British television series Rupert of Hentzau starring George Baker as Rudolf Rassendyl/The King, Barbara Shelley as Queen Flavia, Peter Wyngarde as Rupert of Hentzau, John Phillips as Colonel Sapt (renamed Zapt), Tristram Jellinek as Fritz von Tarlenheim, Derek Blomfield as the Count of Luzau- Rischenheim, John Breslin as Bauer and Mark Burns as Lieutenant Bernenstein. All six episodes are now lost. David O. Selznick considered making a film version of the novel, as a follow-up to his hugely successful 1937 film of The Prisoner of Zenda, using again Douglas Fairbanks Jr. He decided not to because of the tragic subject matter and his commitment to filming Gone with the Wind. The 1923 silent film version had been produced by his father, Lewis J. Selznick, and his brother, Myron Selznick. On screen, Rupert as a character has been played by matinee idols such as Ramon Novarro (1922), Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. (1937), and James Mason (1952).

Pulse Polio is an immunisation campaign established by the government of India to eliminate poliomyelitis (polio) in India by vaccinating all children under the age of five years against the polio virus. The project fights polio through a large- scale, pulse vaccination programme and monitoring for poliomyelitis cases. Vellore, (Tamil Nadu) was the first Indian state to become 100% polio-free through the pulse strategy, and rest of India adopted the strategy in 1995. History India, vaccination against polio started on 1978 with Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). By 1999, it covered around 60% of infants, giving three doses of OPV to each. In 1985,the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) was launched to cover all the districts of the country. UIP became a part of child survival and safe motherhood program (CSSM) in 1992 and Reproductive and Child Health Program (RCH) in 1997 . This program led to a significant increase in coverage, up to 5%. The number of reported cases of polio also declined from thousands during 1987 to 42 in 2010. In 1995, following the Global Polio Eradication Initiative of the World Health Organization (1988), India launched Pulse Polio immunization program with Universal Immunization Program which aimed at 100% coverage. The last reported cases of wild polio in India were in West Bengal and Gujarat on 13 January 2011. On 27 March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared India a polio free country, since no cases of wild polio been reported in for five years. Preventive Pulse Polio The Pulse Polio Initiative (PPI) aims at covering every individual in the country. It aspires to reach even children in remote communities through an improved social mobilisation plan.Best Practices * Not a single child should miss the immunization and leaving no chance of polio occurrence. * Cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) to be reported in time and stool specimens of them to be collected within 14 days. Outbreak response immunisation (ORI) to be conducted as early as possible. * Maintaining a high level of surveillance. * Performance of good mop-up operations where polio has disappeared. Steps involved * Set up of booths in all parts of the country. * Initialising walk-in cold rooms, freezer rooms, deep freezers, ice-lined refrigerators and cold boxes for a steady supply of vaccine to booths. * Arranging employees, volunteers, and vaccines. * Ensuring vaccine vial monitor on each vaccine vial. * Immunising children with OPV on national immunisation days. * Identifying missing children from immunisation process. * Surveillance of efficacy. Publicity was extensive and included replacing the national telecoms' authority ringtone with a vaccination day awareness message, posters, TV and cinema spots, parades, rallies, and one-to- one communication from volunteers. Vaccination booths were set up, with a house-to-house campaign for remote communities. Difficulties Testing showed that three doses of vaccine was enough to protect children in developed countries, but it became obvious that this was not enough in some areas of India. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recommended eight to ten doses for each child. Children in some areas of India are weaker and often had diarrhea, which reduced the efficiency of the vaccine. Open defecation, monsoon flooding, and a lack of water treatment made it easier for a child to swallow more polio virus. As a result, children with too few doses of vaccine were not fully protected and sometimes got polio. The eradication program therefore gave drops over and over again, to boost children's immunity higher and as a precaution against missed children. Few parents initially knew that the vaccination campaign was trying to eradicate the disease, so they did not understand the reasons for the increasing intensity of vaccination. The increasing frequency of the drops and cases of polio among partially vaccinated children, caused rumours that the drops did not work. On July 30, 2013 a nine-month-old boy from Navi Mumbai tested positive for vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) type 2. This was the fourth such case recorded in the country in 2013. Many parts of India are remote and hard to access. People in some areas had had poor and caste-discriminatory treatment by government health authorities, which made them less willing to assist in the vaccination programme. The time demands of polio vaccination sometimes left health care workers with less time for other services. The absence of any free health services other than polio vaccination and contraception lead to rumours that the drops caused infertility. Rumours about vaccinations varied by area, but were clustered, so that there was a greater risk of a cluster of unvaccinated children. Some believed that vaccinating newborns, children who are ill, or previously vaccinated children was not safe; the last polio case in India was a girl who had not been vaccinated because she was sickly.http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/22/health/india-end-of-polio/index.html There were also rumours that the polio drops were made from the blood of pigs, dogs, or mice, or from pig fat. Poor participation of doctors and nurses, difficulty in maintaining and procuring vaccine, difficulty in procuring vehicles, and a lack of support from community members have caused problems in the program, as has fatigue at the length of the anti-polio campaign. Support The campaign was supported by organisations including the Indian federal and state governments, international institutions, and non- governmental organisations. It is part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, spearheaded by Rotary International, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

To cast a wider net for poliovirus detection and to maximize sensitivity so that every poliomyelitis case is detected, in 2005, the Global Poliomyelitis Eradication Initiative adapted AFP as a surveillance tool and broadened the case definition of AFP in India. The expanded case definition of AFP encompasses causes of nonpolio AFP (NP-AFP), including Guillian-Barr√© syndrome, transverse myelitis and traumatic neuritis, and ambiguous cases.The WHO is attempting to phase out the use of live oral polio vaccine to eliminate the risk that the active virus in the vaccine could mutate into a form that can harm unvaccinated children.https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/28/534403083/mutant- strains-of-polio-vaccine-now-cause-more-paralysis-than-wild-polio See also * Polio * Eradication of polio * Healthcare in India * Vaccination * Polio Vaccine * Pulse vaccination strategy * Polio v/s Polio victims, documentary about the campaign  References   External links  * India vaccinates nearly 80 million children * Indian Governance * IUEPN: India Unite to End Polio Now Category:Health programmes in India Category:Polio ","title":"Pulse Polio"},{"id":"1104897","text":"Black September was the conflict fought in Jordan between the JAF and the PLO primarily in September 1970.

Established in 1949, the Gardens are administered by the Australian Government's Department of the Environment and Energy. The botanic gardens were added to the Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004. The botanic gardens are the largest living collection of native Australian flora, the mission of the ANBG is to study and promote Australia's flora. The gardens maintains a wide variety of botanical resources for researchers and cultivates native plants threatened in the wild. The herbarium code for the Australian National Botanic Gardens is CANB. History When Canberra was being planned in the 1930s, the establishment of the gardens was recommended in a report in 1933 by the Advisory Council of Federal Capital Territory. In 1935, The Dickson Report set forth a framework for their development. A large site for the gardens was set aside on Black Mountain. In September 1949, the ceremonial planting of first trees by Prime Minister Ben Chifley and Director of Kew Gardens, Sir Edward Salisbury took place. Development of the site, facilities and collection progressed and the Gardens were officially opened in October 1970 by Prime Minister John Gorton. To celebrate the Gardens' 50th anniversary in 2020 a new Banksia Garden was created, showcasing a wide selection of the over-170 Banksia species spread across the coasts and hinterland of most of mainland Australia and Tasmania. The Gardens has tenure over on Black Mountain. Approximately are currently developed as the Botanic Gardens. Plans for the development of the remaining land are on hold until funds are available. The collection The gardens is organised in thematic sections, plants are grouped by shared taxonomy or are presented in ecological groupings that exist in nature. More than 5,500 species are cultivated. Displays include: * Rainforest Gully, featuring plants for the rainforests of Eastern Australia *Rock Garden, a display of plants which occur in habitats from the desert to alpine areas *Sydney Region Flora, a display of the divers flora endemic to the sandstone formations of the Sydney basin * Mallee Plants, the mallees is the name given to multi-stemmed eucalypts and the shrubs and grasses associated with them * Banksias, waratahs and grevilleas (family Proteaceae) *Callistemon, Leptospermum and Melaleuca (family Myrtaceae) *The Eucalypt Lawn, features about one fifth of Australian eucalypt species *Wattles (Genus Acacia)  Physical description  The area is located on the north-eastern side of Black Mountain and consists of steep to gently sloping hillsides cut by several gullies. The setting is within dry sclerophyll woodland dominated by Eucalyptus Rossii, E. Mannifera ssp Maculosa and E. Macrorhyncha. Soils in the area are predominantly red/yellow earths and red earth/ red podsolic soils with associated lithosols and siliceous sands. The Gardens comprise sections devoted to different taxonomic plant groups and ecological themes focussed on Australian native plants. The site is crossed by a network of paths which wind amongst the various garden beds. Areas of native bushland are still present on the site. One area on the upper slopes had been developed as a nature trail. Special features within the Gardens include the eucalypt lawn, rockery, rainforest gully, mallee shrubland, Hawkesbury sandstone and the Aboriginal trail. The rainforest area has been developed in what was previously a dry gully and has been planted to represent the eastern coast of Australia: Tasmanian species occupy the lower end of the gully and Victorian, New South Wales and Queensland species in sequence moving up the gully. The proposed conservatory at the upper end will allow the cultivation of tropical species. The Gardens are used as an education centre from primary to tertiary levels including horticultural and taxonomic training. They are also important for scientific research into the taxonomy, horticulture and biology of native plant species. The living collections are particularly important for this function. A large number of rare and endangered plant species are also included in the living collections, thus ensuring the preservation of their genotypes and allowing some protection through cultivation. Due to the mature vegetation and a wide range of habitats present in the area, over 100 native and exotic bird species have been recorded from the Gardens. Research The Australian National Herbarium is held on site at the National Botanic Gardens. The Herbarium houses the third largest collection of pressed, dried plant specimens in Australia.Thiers, B.

The belief is that these teachings were originally esoterically hidden by various adepts such as Padmasambhava and dakini such as Yeshe Tsogyal (consorts) during the 8th century, for future discovery at auspicious times by other adepts, who are known as tert√∂ns. As such, terma represent a tradition of continuous revelation in Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism. Termas are a part of tantric literature. Terma tradition Tradition holds that terma may be a physical object such as a text or ritual implement that is buried in the ground (or earth), hidden in a rock or crystal, secreted in a herb, or a tree, hidden in a lake (or water), or hidden in the sky (space). Though a literal understanding of terma is \\"hidden treasure\\", and sometimes refers to objects that are hidden away, the teachings associated should be understood as being 'concealed within the mind of the guru', that is, the true place of concealment is in the tert√∂n's nature or essence of mind. If the concealed or encoded teaching or object is a text, it is often written in dakini script, a non-human type of code or writing that only a tert√∂n can decipher. Fremantle (2001: p. 19) states: In this way, one may see the tradition of terma and tert√∂n as analogous to that of inspiration and providing a legitimate cultural forum to ensure continuation of tantric tradition, and ensuring Tibetan Buddhism's and B√∂n's continued relevancy in an evolving world. The terma tradition is particularly prevalent in, and significant to, the Nyingma lineage. Two of the most famous tert√∂n in the 20th century, Jigdral Yeshe Dorje (2nd Dudjom Rinpoche) and Dilgo Khyentse, were Nyingmapa. Tert√∂n are also prevalent in B√∂n traditions and a few tert√∂n have been Kagyupa. Padmasambhava and his principal consorts and disciples secreted away and hid religious texts, ritual objects and relics etc., to secure and protect Buddhism during the time of decline under Langdarma. Some of these terma have been rediscovered and special terma lineages established throughout Tibet as a result. Out of this activity developed, especially within the Nyingma tradition, two ways of dharma transmission: the so-called \\"long oral transmission\\" from teacher to student in unbroken disciplic lineages, and the \\"short transmission\\" of terma. The foremost revealers of these terma were the Five Terton Kings and the Eight Lingpas. In the 19th century, some of the most famous were the Khenkong Choksum referring to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Jamgon Kongtrul and Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa. Terma have been relayed by nƒÅga and the dakini - of the underworld and the heavens, respectively - and have also been hidden by teachers such as the great translator Longchenpa. Sometimes terma are discovered by a master and reconcealed for a later tert√∂n to find.  Antecedents and analogies in other traditions  The central Mahayana figure Nagarjuna rediscovered the last part of the \\"Prajnaparamita Sutra in one hundred thousand verses\\" in the realm of nƒÅga, where it had been kept since the time of Gautama Buddha. The terma tradition of rediscovering hidden teaching is not unique to Tibet. It has antecedents in India and cultural resonances in Hindu Vaishnavism as well. The Vaishnava saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is said to have rediscovered a fragment of the Brahma Samhita in a trance state of devotional ecstasy. There is another occasion involving Chaitanya, who deposited his divine love (prema) for great saint Narottama Dasa in the Padma River in Bangladesh. When Narottama Dasa turned twelve years of age, he collected this treasure after a revelation in a dream.Premavilasa ch. 8, 10 In the Western world a similar tradition is held in Mormonism. Underwood notes, \\"[Joseph] Smith looks like an American terton-seer translating ancient [terma] texts written in cryptic Reformed Egyptian,\\" like the dakini script, \\"by the great prophets of the past, Mormon and Moroni.\\" Similar to Padmasambhava, the purpose cited by these prophets for hiding the texts for a future time was in \\"keeping the faith on track by making clear the fundamental 'plain and precious' principles of the tradition.\\" And as mind- terma are \\"not physically discovered but are revealed through the mind of the terton,\\" Joseph Smith's revelations of the prophecies of Enoch and the parchment of John did not have any direct physical source but were revealed through Smith's mind. Skousen contrasts Smith's work with the terma tradition, particularly the Book of Mormon, in claiming that Smith did not rely on \\"mindstream transmission,\\" but was translating from a text written on gold plates. However, witnesses note that Smith didn't use what was allegedly the gold plates during the translation, but translated by scrying with a seer stone in a hat, dictating the text as he saw it appear in his mind in a trance-like state of consciousness, suggesting a mystical translation with the text coming from Smith's mind. Types of terma Fremantle (2001: p. 17) affirms that according to tradition: > Termas are of two main kinds: earth treasures and intention, or mind, > treasures. A teaching concealed as an intention treasure appears directly > within the mind of the tert√∂n in the form of sounds or letters to fulfill > the enlightened intention of Padmakara. Earth treasures include not only > texts, but also sacred images, ritual instruments, and medicinal substances, > and are found in many places: temples, monuments, statues, mountains, rocks, > trees, lakes, and even the sky. In the case of texts, they are not, as one > might imagine, ordinary books that can be read straightaway. Occasionally, > full-length texts are found, but they are usually fragmentary, sometimes > consisting of only a word or two, and they are encoded in symbolic script, > which may change mysteriously and often disappears completely once it has > been transcribed. They are simply the material supports that act as a > trigger to help the tert√∂n reach the subtle level of mind where the teaching > has really been concealed. It is the tert√∂n who actually composes and writes > down the resulting text, and so may be considered its author.Fremantle, > Francesca (2001). Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the > Dead. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. p.17. The earth-terma are physical objects -- which may be either an actual text, or physical objects that trigger a recollection of the teaching. The mind-terma are constituted by space and are placed via guru-transmission, or realizations achieved in meditation which connect the practitioner directly with the essential content of the teaching in one simultaneous experience. Once this has occurred, the tert√∂n holds the complete teaching in mind and is required by convention to transcribe the terma twice from memory (if of textual nature) in one uninterrupted session. The transcriptions are then compared, and if no discrepancy or inconsistency is evident the terma is sealed as authentic. The tert√∂n is required to realise the essence of the terma prior to formal transmission. In one sense, all terma may be considered mind-termas , since the teaching associated is always inserted in the essence of the mind of the practitioner; in other words the terma is always a direct transmission from the essence of the mind of the guru towards the essence of the mind of the tert√∂n. The terma may also be held in the mind of the tert√∂n and realised in a future incarnation at a beneficent time. A vision of a syllable or symbol may leaven the realisation of the latent terma in the mind of the tert√∂n. The process of hiding in the mind implies that the practitioner is to gain realisation in that life. At the time of terma concealment, a prophecy is generally made concerning the circumstances in which the teaching will be re- accessed. Especially in the case of an earth-terma, this usually includes a description of locality, and may specify certain ritual tools or objects which are required to be present, and the identities of any assistants and consorts who are required to accompany or assist the tert√∂n. Though somewhat contentious, the kind of revealed teaching embodied in the terma system is based in solid Mahayana Buddhist traditions. The example of Nagarjuna is often cited; the Prajnaparamita teachings are traditionally said to have been conferred on Nagarjuna by the King of the nƒÅgas, who had been guarding them at the bottom of a lake. Similarly, the Six Treatises of Asanga are considered to have been conferred on him by the Buddha Maitreya, whom he visited in Tushita heaven during a vision. \\"Pure visions\\" are pure teachings received from the vision of deities. These are not necessarily terma, because they do not require mindstream transmission from a guru to the practitioner experiencing the pure vision. The esoteric teachings resulting from pure vision are based on the tantras, and are sometimes considered as terma due to their merit. B√∂n Terma A terma tradition also exists in B√∂n. Most B√∂n termas were hidden during the period of decline under King Trisong Deutsen, and rediscovered around the 11th century. Teachings were hidden by masters such as Lishu Tagring and Drenpa Namkha, often inside Buddhist temples, as in Samye and Lhodrak.

It is popularly (but incorrectly) known as the Tibetan Book of the Dead. As a set of funerary texts and practices, it had a very specialized utility, and was revealed by Karma Lingpa, who also revealed the Zhitro teachings. Among other terma cycles are: Major *Longchen Nyingthig: Another well-known Dzogchen cycle of texts, revealed to tert√∂n Jigme Lingpa in the 18th century. *Rinchen Terdzod: Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Jamgon Kongtrul, and Chogyur Dechen Lingpa assembled thousands of Terma treasure texts from the Nyingma tradition all across Tibet, creating the 108 volumes of the Rinchen Terdzod. *Jangter () revealed by Rigdzin Godem. Features the prominent subcycle Konchok Chidu revealed by the tert√∂n Jatson Nyingpo and is widely practiced in Kagyu lineages as well. *Chokling Tersar revealed by Chogyur Dechen Lingpa.

The island is situated on the leeward (western) side of Heron Reef, a fringing platform reef of significant biodiversity, supporting around 900 of the 1,500 fish species and 72% of the coral species found on the Great Barrier Reef.University of Queensland Centre for Marine Studies: Island Research Station. Retrieved 2006-JUL-14. During the summer months Heron Island is also home to over 200,000 birds including Noddy Turns and Mutton Birds. The island is about long and at its widest, giving an area of approximately . The highest point, near the western tip, is above sea level. A dune ridge along the southern shore rises some above sea level, lower dunes on the north-eastern side are only about above the sea. Heron Island and an extrapolated version of the research station are the scene of much of the first part of Arthur C. Clarke's The Deep Range. History Harbour and Research Station from helicopter Heron Island was discovered on 12 January 1843 by a Royal Navy expedition comprising the corvette and the cutter Bramble. The expedition, commanded by Captain Francis Blackwood, was engaged in surveying the eastern edge of the Great Barrier Reef to map out detailed plans for safe passages within the reef. Naval Historical Society of Australia The island was named by Lieutenant Charles Bampfield Yule, the commander of Bramble. The island did not become inhabited until the early 20th century when a turtle cannery was established. The aim was to profit from the seasonal influx of green turtles, but the venture soon found it difficult to keep the business afloat. Other attempts at establishing fisheries were abandoned. In 1932 Captain Christian Poulsen, engaged in bringing fishing parties to the reef, realised the potential of the island as a tourist attraction. In 1936 he bought the lease of the island for ¬£290. On 11 September 1943, the entire island was declared a National Park. Land use Heron Island Resort Heron Island Resort, operated by The Aldesta Group, is located in the north-west corner of the island. The resort is a popular getaway for scuba diving and snorkelling and accommodates up to 300 guests and 100 staff members. In March 2012 Heron Island Resort was featured in the BBC's nature TV series, Great Barrier Reef. Heron Island Research Station The University of Queensland Heron Island Research Stationhttps://www.uq.edu.au/heron-island-research-station/content/front-page is situated in the island's south-west quarter. Established in the 1950s by the Great Barrier Reef Committee with the University of Queensland becoming a partner in its operations in 1970, the facility is one of the world's principal coral reef research stations, with a wide variety of research undertaken on coral reef ecology. Heron Island Research Station suffered a large fire on Friday, 30 March 2007. No one was injured.UQ News: Update on Heron Island Research Station fire. Version of 2007-MAR-30. Retrieved 2008-APR-06. In June 2008 the new student accommodation, comprising 80 beds, was officially opened and used for the first time by Tropical Marine Network students . The teaching laboratories and new research building with 9 research labs, library, darkroom, computer room and aquaria deck were officially reopened in February 2009. In 2010, a state of the art climate change experimental facility was opened at the Research Station. Sir David Attenborough and Atlantic Productions filmed segments for the documentary, David Attenborough's Great Barrier Reef, at Heron Island Research Station in late 2014. National Park The eastern half of the island is protected and forms part of the Capricornia Cays National Park, with a permanent ranger's station onsite. Harbour There is a small man-made channel and wooden jetty on the western shore of the island, where the daily catamaran launch from Gladstone docks and supplies to the island are delivered. The rusted wreck of HMCS Protector lies at the entrance to the channel, and was towed to there in 1945 to form a breakwater for visiting vessels. Utilities The island has no fresh water supply. A small desalination plant on the island uses reverse osmosis technology to supply water for human consumption. Similarly, three diesel generators (and some solar panels) supply electricity to the island. Ecology Heron Island has notably rich soil for a tropical coral cay, particularly in the dense southern forest. This is due to the presence of tens of thousands of wedge-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna pacifica) during breeding season. These birds disturb the humus as they dig their nesting burrows, and thus prevent the formation of Jemo soil, a phosphatic hardpan topped off by raw humus. The hardpan is formed by leaching of surface- or tree-nesting seabirds' guano in the absence of burrowing animals. Flora Flowers of Pisonia grandis Wild poinsettia (Euphorbia cyathophora) has become extensively naturalised on Heron Island. Rich forests of Pisonia grandis dominate the centre and south of Heron Island. Towards the eastern and north-western ends, the forest is readily accessible, but its heart is a dense tangle, interrupted only by a few trails. Some trees in the heart of the forest grow to 10‚Äì11 m, but most are just 6‚Äì8 m high. The understory is largely absent here, formed only by scattered Celtis paniculata, Ficus opposita and Pipturus argenteus with a height of 2‚Äì4 m; some Celtis also grow higher and emerge through the Pisonia canopy. Patches of shrubs ‚Äì mainly Abutilon albescens, with Melanthera biflora (probably var. canescens), and the introduced wild poinsettia (Euphorbia cyathophora) ‚Äì are found here and there. Herbaceous plants are scarce here, mainly consisting of the grass Stenotaphrum micranthum. The more open forest is composed of much the same plants, but the Pisonia does not predominate as much. A few Pandanus tectorius screwpines are also found here, and the understory is far more prominent. North of the Pisonia forest, a band of open shrubland with some trees extends from the resort to the island's eastern tip. Octopus bush (Heliotropium foertherianum) and sea cabbage (Scaevola taccada) form the major bush cover, while Abutilon and Melanthera are the characteristic ground plants. The trees here are mainly Pandanus, but also Celtis, the she-oak Casuarina equisetifolia ssp. incana, Ficus, bay cedar (Suriana maritima). Herbs‚Äîmainly the parasitic vine Cassytha filiformis as well as Euphorbia tannensis ssp. eremophila and grasses (mainly Pacific island thintail, Lepturus repens var. subulatus) are abundant. The eastern end is marked by a similar habitat, with mainly Casuarina, Scaevola and Heliotropium. This type of vegetation, with some Pandanus in between, extends along the southern and northern dune ridges. On the dune slopes, Boerhavia repens, Commicarpus chinensis var. chinensis (or Commicarpus australis?), the searocket Cakile edentula, yet another Euphorbia (probably Euphorbia sparrmanii), and kuroiwa grass (Thuarea involuta) are common. Cordia subcordata dominates the north-western forest but is rare elsewhere on the island. East of the resort in the north-western part of Heron Island there is another type of forest, more open than the central wood. The main tree here is the manjack Cordia subcordata of which few are found elsewhere on Heron Island; Pisonia trees are present but not dominant. The Abutilon‚ÄìEuphorbia cyathophora‚ÄìMelanthera scrub grows thick here. Scaevola and Heliotropium as well as patches of the dropseed grass Sporobolus virginicus occur at this forest's edge. The sea turtle nesting area is further east, making up the central part of the northern shoreside. The animals' burrowing has prevented a proper forest from forming. Consequently, though the usual tree species are found in isolated individuals, the sand is overgrown with herbs and small shrubs, mainly Cakile, Cassytha, Euphorbia eremophila, Lepturus and Melanthera. Around the western end there is an abundance of plants introduced by the research and resort activity, some deliberately as ornamentals, others accidentally. Notable are Euphorbia cyathophora and Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum, as well as papaya (Carica papaya), coconut palm (Cocos nucifera), oleander (Nerium oleander) and temple tree (Plumeria rubra) which have been planted. Fauna An octopus bush full of black noddy nests. Heron Island is part of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area. The island's forest and surrounding dunes provide habitat for thousands of nesting seabirds, including the wedge-tailed shearwater (Ardenna pacifica) and the south-western black noddy (Anous minutus minutus), during the breeding season between October and April. Over 120,000 white-capped noddies nest on the island during this period. All-year resident and breeding on Heron Island are: * Silver gull (Larus novaehollandiae forsteri) * Eastern reef egret (Egretta s. sacra) * Buff-banded rail (Gallirallus philippensis mellori) * Bar-shouldered dove (Geopelia h. humeralis) * Sacred kingfisher (Todiramphus s. sanctus) * Black- faced cuckooshrike (Coracina n. novaehollandiae) * Capricorn silvereye (Zosterops lateralis chlorocephalus) eastern reef egret looking for noddy fledglings to eat. This is the namesake \\"heron\\" of Heron Island. Though other herons may occasionally visit the island, the only member of the Ardeidae which is a breeding resident is the eastern reef egret. And even though the terms \\"heron\\" and \\"egret\\" are not scientific, the former is generally used to denote the large Ardea whereas the smaller Egretta species are usually called \\"egrets\\". Insofar, the only \\"true\\" heron that could ever be found on Heron Island is the white-necked heron (Ardea pacifica), which is only seen every now and then as a rare vagrant. Since 2003, a pair of white- bellied sea eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster) have nested on Heron Island. However, in June 2019 the tree their nest sat in fell down killing the female. As of October 2019 the male has been seen with another adult but no nest has been built. Heron Island is also famous for its green sea turtle nesting ground. At least one species of rat, probably the widespread polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), is found on the island. Though even these small rats are known to harm island birds, this is insignificant on islands so close to a continent; while the rats probably feed on eggs and nestlings, they do not threaten the breeding bird populations as a whole. Heron Island is also a major nesting site for green (Chelonia mydas) and Indopacific loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta gigas). Around 98% of all turtles that nest on the island are green turtles, and only 2% of them will be loggerheads. The Indopacific hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata bissa) has been seen on the reef but does not breed on the island. Other marine life includes the inhabitants of the coral reef, and around early October, cetaceans (e.g. humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae) pass Heron Island on their migration to their summer quarters in subantarctic waters. , a project called \\"The Turtle Cooling Project\\" is being undertaken by scientists from the World Wildlife Fund Australia, University of Queensland, Deakin University and the Queensland Government. It is looking at the effect of global warming on northern green turtle breeding, in particular the effect of producing more male turtles owing to the higher temperatures. They are working in the area around Raine Island, Heron Island and Moulter Cay. A notable and much-studied invertebrate of Heron Island is Cerithium moniliferum, a small marine snail. These animals will form large groups as the tide recedes. Feeding on beach rock at a specific height over the average low tide level, the snails slowly move about in their clusters, preserving the precious moisture that allows them to breathe overwater. Mosquitos and other biting insects are rare on the island. However, diseases such as avian malaria and avian pox, which are carried by biting mosquitoes have been found in low numbers in the island's silvereyes.  Geology  Heron Reef is a lagoonal platform reef. It has developed in a high energy environment with high tidal flows promoting water turnover and unobstructed access to the ocean. The reef dates from the Holocene period but shows evidence of possible development in the Pleistocene period. Core analysis of the reef from 1937, demonstrated a thickness of at least 15m of stacked limestone, with an eastward sloping disconformity.  Known shipwrecks on the reef  Jane Lockhart sank between 11 and 17 December 1868 on Lady Musgrave Island / Heron Island / Masthead Reef or One Tree Island. The vessel was a two-mast schooner. Departed from Sydney with general cargo for Broadsound; and ran aground on Lady Musgrave Is; maybe on Heron Is or One Tree Island or Masthead Reef Lost on a reef off Heron Island on the night of 17 December 1868. The crew took to the boat and safely reached the pilot station at Keppel Island. Originally stated as on Lady Musgrave reef (most unlikely) later news reports claim wreck on Heron Island with some other reports mention the wreck on either One Tree Island or Mast Head. The vessel was built in 1861 at Ulladulla, New South Wales and registered in Sydney with the Official number of 36858 and a Registered number of 9/1861.Australian shipwrecks Vol. 2 1851‚Äì1871 By Loney, J.

Governance The southern part of Barnards Green constitutes the major part of the Chase ward of the civil parish governed by Malvern Town Council. As well as Barnards Green, the ward also includes the extensive Ministry of Defence property occupied by QinetiQ, the campus of The Chase school, the village of Poolbrook, and the largely rural south-eastern area of the adjoining Poolbrook and Malvern commons. To the north, the Barnards Green area spills into the Pickersleigh ward. Population As with the rest of Malvern, Barnards Green owes much of its development to the area's rapid expansion from a cluster of hamlets and manors to a busy spa town during the mid-19th century. Barnards Green experienced a further population boost in 1942 when the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) relocated to Malvern to occupy a site having two of its main entrances in the Barnards Green area. In the early 1950s the construction of the large Pound Bank council estate led to an increase in the population, and to the commercial activity in the shopping centre. Population figures for Barnards Green as an area are not recorded separately. Geography At the centre of Barnard's Green is a pear-shaped roundabout where (clockwise) the Barnards Green Road, B4211 / B4208 from the town centre, Pickersleigh Road (B4208), Upper Chase Road, Barnards Green Road (which forks to become Poolbrook Road (B4208) and Guarlford Road (B4211), Court Road, and Avenue Road all meet.

He was awarded a Fields Medal in 1978, a Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2005, and an Abel Prize in 2020, becoming the fifth mathematician to receive the three prizes. In 1991, he joined the faculty of Yale University, where he is currently the Erastus L. De Forest Professor of Mathematics.  Biography  Margulis was born to a Russian family of Lithuanian Jewish descent in Moscow, Soviet Union. At age 16 in 1962 he won the silver medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He received his PhD in 1970 from the Moscow State University, starting research in ergodic theory under the supervision of Yakov Sinai. Early work with David Kazhdan produced the Kazhdan‚ÄìMargulis theorem, a basic result on discrete groups. His superrigidity theorem from 1975 clarified an area of classical conjectures about the characterisation of arithmetic groups amongst lattices in Lie groups. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1978, but was not permitted to travel to Helsinki to accept it in person, allegedly due to anti-semitism against Jewish mathematicians in the Soviet Union. His position improved, and in 1979 he visited Bonn, and was later able to travel freely, though he still worked in the Institute of Problems of Information Transmission, a research institute rather than a university. In 1991, Margulis accepted a professorial position at Yale University. Margulis was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2001.National Academy of Sciences Elections. Notices of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 48 (2001), no. 7, p. 722 In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-02-02. In 2005, Margulis received the Wolf Prize for his contributions to theory of lattices and applications to ergodic theory, representation theory, number theory, combinatorics, and measure theory. In 2020, Margulis received the Abel Prize jointly with Hillel Furstenberg \\"For pioneering the use of methods from probability and dynamics in group theory, number theory and combinatorics.\\"  Mathematical contributions  Margulis's early work dealt with Kazhdan's property (T) and the questions of rigidity and arithmeticity of lattices in semisimple algebraic groups of higher rank over a local field. It had been known since the 1950s (Borel, Harish-Chandra) that a certain simple-minded way of constructing subgroups of semisimple Lie groups produces examples of lattices, called arithmetic lattices. It is analogous to considering the subgroup SL(n,Z) of the real special linear group SL(n,R) that consists of matrices with integer entries. Margulis proved that under suitable assumptions on G (no compact factors and split rank greater or equal than two), any (irreducible) lattice Œì in it is arithmetic, i.e. can be obtained in this way. Thus Œì is commensurable with the subgroup G(Z) of G, i.e. they agree on subgroups of finite index in both. Unlike general lattices, which are defined by their properties, arithmetic lattices are defined by a construction. Therefore, these results of Margulis pave a way for classification of lattices. Arithmeticity turned out to be closely related to another remarkable property of lattices discovered by Margulis. Superrigidity for a lattice Œì in G roughly means that any homomorphism of Œì into the group of real invertible n √ó n matrices extends to the whole G. The name derives from the following variant: : If G and G' are semisimple algebraic groups over a local field without compact factors and whose split rank is at least two and Œì and Œì' are irreducible lattices in them, then any homomorphism f: Œì ‚Üí Œì' between the lattices agrees on a finite index subgroup of Œì with a homomorphism between the algebraic groups themselves. (The case when f is an isomorphism is known as the strong rigidity.) While certain rigidity phenomena had already been known, the approach of Margulis was at the same time novel, powerful, and very elegant. Margulis solved the Banach‚ÄìRuziewicz problem that asks whether the Lebesgue measure is the only normalized rotationally invariant finitely additive measure on the n-dimensional sphere. The affirmative solution for n ‚â• 4, which was also independently and almost simultaneously obtained by Dennis Sullivan, follows from a construction of a certain dense subgroup of the orthogonal group that has property (T). Margulis gave the first construction of expander graphs, which was later generalized in the theory of Ramanujan graphs. In 1986, Margulis gave a complete resolution of the Oppenheim conjecture on quadratic forms and diophantine approximation. This was a question that had been open for half a century, on which considerable progress had been made by the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood circle method; but to reduce the number of variables to the point of getting the best-possible results, the more structural methods from group theory proved decisive. He has formulated a further program of research in the same direction, that includes the Littlewood conjecture.

The route and mountain pass partially lies on the Mar Lodge Estate. Like many traditional routes, the ends of the route through the Lairig Ghru are like the ends of a frayed rope. From the south the Lairig Ghru can be approached from Braemar though Glen Lui, or Glen Dee, and from Blair Atholl through Glen Tilt. From the north the Lairig Ghru can be approached from Glen More through the Chalamain Gap, and from Aviemore through the Rothiemurchus Forest by way of the Crossroads above Allt Dr√πidh. Name Watson gives the place name \\"L√†irig Dhr√π\\", meaning pass of Dhru or Druie, with the local pronunciation \\"Laarig Groo\\". He suggests the \\"probable\\" derivation as from Dr√πdhadh meaning oozing.Watson (1975) Any visitor to the summit of the Lairig Ghru would accept that as a possible derivation because two watercourses, one on each side of the summit, appear to \\"ooze\\" from the valley floor. However, Gordon is much less certain about the derivation of the name, writing: The weight of suggestion is - therefore - that Lairig Ghru is certainly the hill pass (of something) and that something is probably related to the water flowing from the floor of the valley close to the summit. Many Gaelic place names have lost their original spelling and meaning through translation into English. The prolific and late Dundonian mountaineer, Syd Scroggie felt that the name Lairig Ghru was such a case and suggested that the Lairig Ghru was the Lairig Ruadh (Red Pass). This fits with the original name of the mountain range, \\"Am Monadh Ruadh\\" (The Red Mountains). History Historically the Lairig Ghru has been used simply as a route between Deeside and Strathspey. It is often referred to as a Drove Road, and while it's not wrong to do so, arguably that over-emphasises one specific use. The Lairig Ghru has been a route used by many different people, for many different purposes as made clear in Haldane (1952), and was in regular use long before the height of the droving trade in the more peaceful times after the middle of the 18th century: The Lairig Ghru was used as a droving-route as late as 1873 - Haldane (1952) - to Braemar and farther south. Until approximately the 1870s men from Rothiemurchus annually, in the spring, cleared the track of rocks that had fallen on to it during the winter. Modern road traffic now travels over the Pass of Drumochter via the A9 or The Lecht on the A939, and the Lairig Ghru is left to walkers. The full route from Aviemore to Braemar is about , though many walkers cut the walk short by starting or finishing at Linn of Dee. The from there to Braemar is along a tarmac road. Recreational use Although the Lairig Ghru has long been used by travellers to get between Strathspey and Deeside, it has also been used recreationally since at least the early twentieth century. Anderson (1911) writes: An even earlier recreational mention is a report on the snow conditions in the Lairig Ghru by C. G. Cash in April 1901: This snow report by C. G. Cash implies a familiarity with the Lairig Ghru, both his own, and his readers. Waypoints (from the south) 200px There are many waypoints and features in the Lairig Ghru which, because of map scale, do not appear on the old 1-inch, nor 1:50,000 scale maps. Others only exist in older-books Gordon (1925), Watson (1975) - for example - because the authors, acquainted with local-people and local-traditions, have described these features and recorded their names. There is no objective measure of where the ends of the Lairig Ghru are. 'Gordon defines \\"Lairig\\" as a \\"Hill Pass\\".Gordon (1948) In that case, the landscape is arguably too open for the \\"ends\\" of the Lairig's track to extend much beyond the imaginary lines drawn between the summits of Carn a' Mhaim and The Devil's Point at the southern end - and Carn Eilrig and Castle Hill at the northern end. From the south, the two main approaches to the Lairig Ghru follow the Glen Lui Route or the Glen Dee Route. These two routes come together soon after crossing the imaginary line between Carn a' Mhaim and The Devil's Point creating the first waypoint. Soon after this coming together, the track splits again with the left-hand (roughly NW) branch leading to the Cairngorm Club footbridge across the River Dee towards Corrour Bothy and the mountains to the west of the Lairig Ghru. Corrour Bothy Corrour Bothy is a simple stone building below Coire Odhar, which lies between The Devil's Point and Cairn Toul on the western side of the river. It is now used as a mountain refuge and maintained by the Mountain Bothies Association. The single room has a fireplace and chimney in its northern gable, there is also an outer composting toilet facility in its own room had recently been installed. Clach nan Taillear Literally \\"stone of the tailors\\" (Watson (1975)) is a large ribbed stone by the side of the Lairig Ghru track close to where the Allt Coire an t-Saighdeir joins the river. Gordon describes how this stone got its name, writing: River Dee From Corrour, roughly N towards the head of Glen Dee and the hanging valley From Braeriach, roughly SW towards the head of Glen Dee Although all the rain that falls on the slopes at either side of the southern half of the Lairig Ghru eventually drains into the River Dee and the \\"official\\" source of the River Dee, the Wells of Dee, is high on Braeriach, the River Dee (as a named watercourse on maps) starts at the confluence of Allt a' Gharbh choirie and Allt na Lairig Ghru. At this point, near the head of Glen Dee, the main valley turns roughly west towards An Garbh Choire, and the Lairig Ghru track continues northward into the hanging valley as shown in the photograph. The Duke's Path Only shown on the 1:25,000 scale maps, The Duke's Path is a made-path on the western side of the Lairig Ghru, following the course of the burn draining Coire Ruadh and leading to the bealach between Braeriach and Sron na Lairige. During the nineteenth century, what was then the Mar Estate (see Mar Lodge Estate), was a private hunting estate owned by the Duke of Fife (created Duke in 1889, and dying in 1912). In Gordon (1925) the author describes using this path on an ascent of Braeriach, continuing: Pools of Dee The Lairig Ghru track winds around a series of pools on the Mar side of the summit. These are thought by many (incorrectly) to be the source of the River Dee. Watson (1975) explains that the Pools of Dee are an invention rather than a pure Anglicisation of the old name Lochan Dubh na Lairige (black tarn of the Lairig). At least one of these pools is reputed to contain trout in spite of these pools having no obvious outflow, nor inflow. Slightly to the south of the largest pool, the burn named Allt na Lairig Ghru flows from the floor of the valley flowing south to join with the burn named Allt a' Gharbh choirie to create the River Dee proper. March Burn The March Burn is a burn on the Mar side of the summit, draining the eastern-slope above it and disappearing below the rocks before it reaches the floor of the valley. Gordon (1925) describes it as falling in a white spray to the Lairig from the northern spur of Ben Mac Dhui. \\"March has nothing to do with the month of the year, but refers to the old use of the word meaning boundary. The summit of the Lairig Ghru marks the boundary between Deeside (Aberdeenshire) and Strathspey (Inverness-shire). Watson (1975) gives the old name of Allt na Criche (the burn of the boundary), giving the local pronunciation as Creech.\\" Summit Watson gives the summit height as about ,Watson (1975) and the Cairngorm Tourist Map (1975) gives a spot-height of 2,733 feet. Angus Sinclair Memorial Hut Plaque now attached to a rock marking the site of the Sinclair Memorial Hut A bothy was built in 1957 by members of the Edinburgh University OTC as a memorial to Dr William Angus Sinclair FRSE, who died on Cairn Gorm on 21 December 1954. The refuge was located near the cross-roads where the tracks from Sron na Lairige and the Chalamain Gap cross the Lairig Ghru. Like many other man-made shelters in the mountains of Scotland that were very accessible from public roads, it was demolished and removed in about 1991. Chalamain Gap View of The Chalamain Gap This boulder-strewn ravine is used as a route between the Lairig Ghru and Glen More. The name \\"Chalamain Gap\\" has been applied relatively recently to this ravine, since in Alexander (1928) the author does not name the gap, but describes it - writing: Watson does not name the ravine \\"Chalamain Gap\\" either, but refers to it as the location of the Sinclair Hut: More recently, Diack (2006) gives the name as Eag Coire na Comhdhalack {The Ravine of the Corrie of the Assembly}.

After Jordan lost control of the West Bank to Israel in 1967, Palestinian fighters known as fedayeen moved their bases to Jordan and stepped up their attacks on Israel and Israeli-occupied territories. One Israeli retaliation on a PLO camp based in Karameh, a Jordanian town along the border with the West Bank, developed into a full- scale battle. The perceived joint Jordanian-Palestinian victory against Israel during the 1968 Battle of Karameh led to an upsurge in Arab support for the fedayeen in Jordan, in both new recruits and financial aid. The PLO's strength in Jordan grew, and by the beginning of 1970, groups within the PLO had begun to openly call for the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy. Acting as a state within a state, the fedayeen disregarded local laws and regulations, and even attempted to assassinate King Hussein twice‚Äîleading to violent confrontations between them and the Jordanian Army in June 1970. Hussein wanted to oust them from the country, but hesitated to strike because he did not want his enemies to use it against him by equating Palestinian fighters with civilians. PLO actions in Jordan culminated in the Dawson's Field hijackings incident of 6 September, in which the PFLP hijacked three civilian aircraft and forced their landing in Zarqa, taking foreign nationals as hostages, and later blowing up the planes in front of international press. Hussein saw this as the last straw, and ordered the army to take action. On 17 September, the Jordanian Army surrounded cities with significant PLO presence including Amman and Irbid, and began shelling Palestinian refugee camps where the fedayeen were established. The next day, forces from the Syrian Army, with Palestine Liberation Army markings, intervened in support of the fedayeen and advanced towards Irbid which the fedayeen had occupied and declared to be a \\"liberated\\" city. On 22 September, the Syrians withdrew from Irbid after the Jordanians launched an air-ground offensive that inflicted heavy losses on the Syrians. Mounting pressure by Arab countries (such as Iraq) led Hussein to halt the fighting. On 13 October he signed an agreement with Arafat to regulate the fedayeen's presence in Jordan. However, the Jordanian military attacked again in January 1971 and the fedayeen were driven out of the cities, one by one, until 2,000 fedayeen surrendered after being surrounded in a forest near Ajloun on 17 July, marking the end of the conflict. Jordan allowed the fedayeen to leave for Lebanon via Syria, and the fedayeen later participated in the 1975 Lebanese Civil War. The Black September Organization was founded after the conflict to carry out reprisals against Jordanian authorities, and the organization's first noted attack was the assassination of Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi Tal in 1971 who had commanded parts of the operations that expelled the fedayeen. The organization then shifted to attacking Israeli targets, including the highly publicized Munich massacre of Israeli athletes. Even though Black September did not reflect a Jordanian-Palestinian divide, as there were Palestinians and Jordanians on both sides of the conflict, it paved the way for such a divide subsequently. Background Palestinians in Jordan View of Jabal Al-Hussein Palestinian refugee camp in Amman After Jordan annexed the West Bank in 1950, it conferred its citizenship on the West Bank Palestinians. The combined population of the West Bank and Jordan consisted of two-thirds Palestinians (one-third in the West Bank and one-third in the East Bank) and one-third Jordanians. Jordan provided Palestinians with seats amounting to half the parliament and Palestinians enjoyed equal opportunities in all sectors of the state. This demographic change influenced Jordanian politics. King Hussein considered that the Palestinian problem would remain the country's overriding national security issue; he feared an independent West Bank under PLO administration would threaten the autonomy of his Hashemite kingdom. The Palestinian factions were supported variously by many Arab governments, most notably Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who gave them political support. The Palestinian nationalist organization Fatah started organizing cross-border attacks against Israel in January 1965, often drawing severe Israeli reprisals upon Jordan. The Samu Incident launched by Israel on 13 November 1966 was one such reprisal, after three Israeli soldiers were killed by a Fatah landmine. The Israeli assault on the Jordanian controlled West Bank town of As-Samu inflicted heavy casualties on Jordan. Israeli writer Avi Shlaim argued that Israel's disproportionate retaliation exacted revenge on the wrong party, as Israeli leaders knew from their interaction with Hussein that he was doing everything he could to prevent such attacks. Hussein, who felt he had been betrayed by the Israelis, drew fierce local criticism because of this incident. It is thought that this contributed to his decision to join Egypt and Syria's war against Israel in 1967. In June 1967 Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan during the Six-Day War. PLO's growing strength after the Battle of Karameh After Jordan lost the West Bank, Fatah under the PLO stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel from Jordanian soil, making the border town of Karameh their headquarters. On 18 March 1968, an Israeli school bus was blown up by a mine near Be'er Ora in the Arava, killing two adults and wounding ten children‚Äîthe 38th Fatah operation in little more than three months. On 21 March, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units entered Jordan and launched a reprisal attack on Karameh that developed into a full-scale battle that lasted a day. The PLO suffered some 200 casualties and another 150 taken prisoner; 40‚Äì84 Jordanian soldiers were also killed. Israeli losses stood at around 30 killed and 69‚Äì161 wounded, and they also left behind several vehicles. King Hussein after checking an abandoned Israeli tank on 21 March 1968 during the Battle of Karameh. The perceived joint Palestinian-Jordanian victory led to an upsurge in support for the fedayeen in Jordan. Both sides declared victory: Israel had fulfilled its objective of destroying the Karameh camp, but failed to capture Arafat, while Jordan and the PLO had exacted relatively heavy Israeli casualties. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein let them take the credit. The fedayeen used the battle's wide acclaim and recognition in the Arab world to establish their national claims. The Karameh operation also highlighted the vulnerability of bases close to the Jordan River, so the PLO moved them farther into the mountains. Further Israeli attacks targeted Palestinian militants residing among the Jordanian civilian population, giving rise to friction between Jordanians and guerrillas.Herzog, 205‚Äì206 Palestinians and Arabs generally considered the battle a psychological victory over the IDF, which had been seen as \\"invincible\\" until then, and recruitment into guerilla units soared.A.I.Dawisha, Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century: From Triumph to Despair, Princeton University Press, 2003 p.258 Fatah reported that 5,000 volunteers had applied to join within 48 hours of the events at Karameh. By late March, there were nearly 20,000 fedayeen in Jordan. Iraq and Syria offered training programs for several thousand guerrillas. The Persian Gulf states, led by Kuwait, raised money for them through a 5% tax on the salaries of their tens of thousands of resident Palestinian workers, and a fund drive in Lebanon raised $500,000 from Beirut alone. The Palestinian organizations also began to guarantee a lifetime support for the families of all guerrillas killed in action. Within a year after the battle, Fatah had branches in about eighty countries. After the battle, Fatah gained control of the PLO in Egypt. Palestinian fedayeen from Syria and Lebanon started to converge on Jordan, mostly in Amman. In Palestinian enclaves and refugee camps in Jordan, the police and army were losing their authority. The Wehdat and Al-Hussein refugee camps came to be referred as \\"independent republics\\" and the fedayeen established administrative autonomy by establishing local government under the control of uniformed PLO militants‚Äîsetting up checkpoints and attempting to extort \\"taxes\\" from civilians. Seven-point agreement In early November 1968, the Jordanian army attacked a fedayeen group named \\"Al-Nasr\\" (meaning victory) after the group had attacked Jordanian police. Not all Palestinians were supportive of Al-Nasr's actions, but the Jordanian response was meant to send a message that there would be consequences for challenging the government's authority. Immediately after the incident, a seven-point agreement was reached between King Hussein and Palestinian organizations, that restrained unlawful and illegal fedayeen behavior against the Jordanian government. Fedayeen of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Jordan, early 1969 The PLO would not live up to the agreement, and came to be seen more and more as a state within a state in Jordan. Fatah's Yasser Arafat replaced Ahmad Shukeiri as the PLO's leader in February 1969. Discipline in the different Palestinian groups was poor, and the PLO had no central power to control the different groups. A situation developed of fedayeen groups rapidly spawning, merging, and splintering, sometimes trying to behave radically in order to attract recruits. Hussein went to the United States in March 1969 for talks with Richard Nixon, the new American president. He argued for Israel's adherence to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, in which it was required to return territories it had occupied in 1967 in return for peace. Palestinian factions were suspicious of Hussein, as this meant the withdrawal of his policy of forceful resistance towards Israel, and these suspicions were further heightened by Washington's claim that Hussein would be able to liquidate the fedayeen movement in his country upon resolution of the conflict. Fatah favored not intervening in the internal affairs of other Arab countries. However, although it assumed the leadership of the PLO, more radical left-wing Palestinian movements refused to abide by that policy. By 1970, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) led by George Habash and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) led by Nayef Hawatmeh, began to openly question the legitimacy of the Hashemite monarchy, and called for its overthrow and replacement with a revolutionary regime. Other radical groups included the Syrian Ba'ath's As- Sa'iqa, and the Iraqi Ba'ath's Arab Liberation Front: these saw Hussein as \\"a puppet of Western imperialism\\", \\" a reactionary\\", and \\"a Zionist tool\\". They claimed that the road to Tel Aviv passed through Amman, which they sought to transform into the Hanoi of Arabia. They also stirred up conservative and religious feelings with provocative anti-religious statements and actions, such as putting up Marxist and Leninist slogans on mosque walls. PFLP patrol in Amman, 12 June 1970 According to Shlaim, their growing power was accompanied by growing arrogance and insolence. He quotes an observer describing the PLO in Jordan, : Palestinians claimed there were numerous agents provocateurs from Jordanian or other security services present among the fedayeen, deliberately trying to upset political relations and provide justification for a crackdown. There were frequent kidnappings and acts of violence against civilians: Chief of the Jordanian Royal Court (and subsequently Prime Minister) Zaid al-Rifai claimed that in one extreme instance \\"the fedayeen killed a soldier, beheaded him, and played football with his head in the area where he used to live\\".Arafat's War by Efraim Karsh, p. 28 Ten-point edict and June confrontations The situation placed Hussein in a severe dilemma: if he used force to oust the fedayeen, he would alienate himself from the Palestinians in the country and the Arab World. However, if he refused to act to strike back at the fedayeen, he would lose the respect of Jordanians, and more seriously, that of the army, the backbone of the regime, which already started to pressure Hussein to act against them. In February 1970, King Hussein visited Egyptian President Nasser in Cairo, and won his support for taking a tougher stance against the fedayeen. Nasser also agreed to influence the fedayeen to desist from undermining Hussein's regime. Upon his return, he published a ten-point edict restricting activities of the Palestinian organizations, which included prohibition of the following: carrying arms publicly, storing ammunitions in villages, and holding demonstrations and meetings without prior governmental consent. The fedayeen reacted violently to these efforts aimed at curbing their power, which led Hussein to freeze the new regulation; he also acquiesced to fedayeen demands of dismissing the perceived anti-Palestinian interior minister Muhammad Al- Kailani. Hussein's policy of giving concessions to the fedayeen was to gain time, but Western newspapers started floating sensationalized stories that Hussein was losing control over Jordan and that he might abdicate soon. PLO leaders Yasser Arafat, Nayef Hawatmeh and Kamal Nasser speaking at a press conference in Amman after the June events, 1970 Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, who were openly supporting the fedayeen, sent Jordan financial subsidies, placing Hussein in a difficult position. Hussein saw no external forces to support him other than the United States and Israel, but that would act as fuel for fedayeen propaganda against him. On 17 February 1970, the American embassy in Tel Aviv relayed three questions from Hussein to Israel asking about Israel's stance if Jordan chose to confront the fedayeen. Israel replied positively to Hussein, and committed that they would not take advantage if Jordan withdrew its troops from the borders for a potential confrontation. Israeli artillery and airforce attacked Irbid on 3 June as reprisal for a fedayeen attack on Beit Shean, killing one soldier, as well as killing seven and injuring twenty-six civilians. The Jordanian army retaliated and shelled Tiberias for the first time in 22 years; Hussein ordered the shelling but realized it was the start of a dangerous cycle of violence. Consequently, he requested, through the American embassy in Amman, a ceasefire with the Israelis to buy time so that he could take strong measures against the fedayeen. The message to Israel stated that \\"the Jordanian government was doing everything it could to prevent fedayeen rocket attacks on Israel. King deeply regrets the rocket attacks. Jordan Army under orders to shoot to kill any fedayeen attempting to fire rockets and fedayeen leaders had been told again evening of 3 June that violators would be shot on sight\\". Israel accepted Hussein's request following pressure from the Americans. In the summer of 1970, the Jordanian army was on the verge of losing its patience with the fedayeen. After a provocation from the fedayeen, a tank battalion moved from the Jordan Valley without orders from Amman, intending to retaliate against them. It took the personal intervention of the King and that of the 3rd Armored Division commander Sharif Shaker, who blocked the road with their cars, to stop its onslaught. Fighting broke out again between the fedayeen and the army in Zarqa on 7 June. Two days later, the fedayeen opened fire on the General Intelligence Directorate's (mukhabarat) headquarters. Hussein went to visit the mukhabarat headquarters after the incident, but his motorcade came under heavy fedayeen fire, killing one of his guards. Bedouin units of the army retaliated for the assassination attempt against their king by shelling Al-Wehdat and Al-Hussein camps, which escalated into a conflict that lasted three days. An Israeli army meeting deliberated on events in Jordan; according to the director of Israel's Military Intelligence, there were around 2,000 fedayeen in Amman armed with mortars and Katyusha rockets. Hussein's advisors were divided: some were urging him to finish the job, while others were calling for restraint as victory could only be accomplished at the cost of thousands of lives, which to them was unacceptable. Hussein halted the fighting, and the three-day conflict's toll was around 300 dead and 700 wounded, including civilians. A ceasefire was announced by Hussein and Arafat, but the PFLP did not abide by it. It immediately held around 68 foreign nationals hostage in two Amman hotels, threatening to blow them up with the buildings if Sharif Shaker and Sharif Nasser were not dismissed and the Special Forces unit disbanded. Arafat did not agree with the PFLP, but had to play along as he feared public opinion. Hussein compromised and reduced tensions by appointing Mashour Haditha Al-Jazy, who was considered a moderate general, as army chief of staff, and Abdelmunim Al-Rifai as prime minister, who in turn included six Palestinians as ministers in his government. Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's security advisor, gave the following assessment of the events in Jordan: Newsreel about King Hussein's challenges in 1970 June 1970 became one of the most uncertain periods for the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan, as most foreign diplomats believed that events favored the fedayeen, and that the downfall of the monarchy was just a matter of time. Although Hussein was confident, members of his family started to wonder for how long the situation would last. 72-year-old Prince Zeid bin Hussein ‚Äì the only son of Hussein bin Ali (Sharif of Mecca) that did not become a king ‚Äì was visiting Amman in June and stayed with Hussein in the royal palace. He saw Hussein's management of the affair, and before he left, told his son that he thought Hussein to be the \\"most genuine, able and courageous Hashemite he had ever met\\", as well as \\"the greatest leader among all the Hashemite kings\\". Another ceasefire agreement was signed between Hussein and Arafat on 10 July. It recognized and legitimized fedayeen presence in Jordan, and established a committee to monitor fedayeen conduct. The American-sponsored Rogers Plan for the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict was publicized in July‚Äîbased on Security Council Resolution 242. Nasser and Hussein accepted the plan, but Arafat rejected it on 26 July, claiming that it was a device to liquidate his movement. The PFLP and DFLP were more uncompromising, vehemently rejecting the plan and denouncing Nasser and Hussein. Meanwhile, a ceasefire was reached between Egypt and Israel on 7 August, formally ending the War of Attrition. On 15 August, Arafat was alleged to have said that \\"we have decided to convert Jordan into a cemetery for all conspirators‚ÄîAmman shall be the Hanoi of the revolution.\\" Paradoxically, Arafat had cautioned Habash and Hawatmeh, the respective leaders of the PFLP and the DFLP, from provoking the regime, as it enjoyed military superiority and could terminate their existence in Jordan at any time. But his calls went unheeded, and they started to call more openly for the overthrow of the Hashemites as a \\"prelude to the launching of a popular war for the liberation of Palestine\\". Another engagement between the army and the fedayeen occurred at the end of August, after the fedayeen ambushed army vehicles and staged an armed attack on the capital's post office. Black September Aircraft hijackings Jordanian army unit escorts rescued families back to Amman, 9 September 1970. Hussein's motorcade came under fire on 1 September for the second time in three months, triggering clashes between the army and the fedayeen in Amman up until 6 September. On 6 September, three planes were hijacked by the PFLP: SwissAir and TWA jets that landed at Azraq, Jordan, and a Pan Am jet that was flown to Cairo and immediately blown up after passengers were deplaned. The two jets that landed in Jordan had 310 passengers; the PFLP threatened to blow them up if fedayeen from European and Israeli prisons were not released. On 9 September, a third plane was hijacked to Jordan: a BOAC flight from Bahrain with 115 passengers was diverted to Zarqa. The PFLP announced that the hijackings were intended \\"to bring special attention to the Palestinian problem\\". After 371 hostages were removed, the planes were dramatically blown up in front of international press on 12 September. However, 54 hostages were kept by the organization for around two weeks. Arab regimes and Arafat were not pleased with the hijackings; the latter considered them to have caused more harm to the Palestinian issue. But Arafat could not dissociate himself from the hijackings, again because of Arab public opinion. Dawson's Field aircraft being blown up in Zarqa by PFLP fedayeen in front of international press, 12 September 1970 Al-Jazy, the perceived pro-Palestinian newly appointed army chief of staff, resigned on 9 September in the midst of the hijacking crisis, and was replaced by Habis Majali, who was brought in from retirement. Natheer Rasheed, the intelligence director who had been appointed a month earlier, claimed that Al-Jazy was paid 200,000 Jordanian dinars, and that his resignation letter was written by the PLO. Shlaim claims that the prelude consisted of three stages: \\"conciliation, containment and confrontation\\". He argues that Hussein was patient so that he could demonstrate that he had done everything he could to avoid bloodshed, and that confrontation only came after all other options had been exhausted, and after public opinion (both international and local) had tipped against the fedayeen. Jordanian army attacks King Hussein on the first day of the operation meeting with his advisors, Prime Minister Wasfi Tal (right) and Army Chief of Staff Habis Majali (left), 17 September 1970 On the evening of 15 September, Hussein called in his advisors for an emergency meeting at his Al-Hummar residence on the western outskirts of Amman. Amer Khammash, Habis Majali, Sharif Shaker, Wasfi Tal, and Zaid al-Rifai were among those who were present; for some time they had been urging Hussein to sort out the fedayeen. The army generals estimated that it would take two or three days for the army to push the fedayeen out of major cities. Hussein dismissed the civilian government the following day and appointed Muhammad Daoud, a Palestinian loyalist to head a military government, thereby declaring martial law. Other Palestinians in the military government included figures like Adnan Abu Oudeh, an officer in the mukhabarat. Abu Oudeh later asked Hussein what the most difficult decision was that he had to make, to which the king replied: \\"The decision to recapture my capital.\\" On 17 September, the 60th Armoured Brigade entered the capital Amman from different directions and shelled the Wehdat and Hussein refugee camps where the fedayeen were based with tanks, artillery and mortars. The fedayeen put up a stiff resistance as they were well prepared, and the fighting lasted the next ten days without break. Simultaneously, the army surrounded and attacked other fedayeen-controlled cities including: Irbid, Jerash, Al-Salt and Zarqa. The three days estimated by Hussein's generals could not be achieved, and the ensuing stalemate led Arab countries to step up pressure on Hussein to halt the fighting. Foreign intervention Jordan feared foreign intervention in the events in support of the fedayeen; this soon materialized on 18 September after a force from Syria with Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) markings marched towards Irbid, which the fedayeen had declared a \\"liberated\\" city. The 40th Armoured Brigade managed to block the Syrian forces' advance after heavy fighting. A second, much larger, Syrian incursion occurred on the same day: it consisted of two armored and one mechanized infantry brigades of the 5th Infantry Division, and around 300 tanks. Although the Syrian tanks had PLA markings, the troops were Syrian Army regulars. Syria issued no statement regarding the situation, but it is believed that the purpose of its intervention was to help the fedayeen overthrow the monarchy. Another tentative explanation is that the Syrians wanted to create a haven for the fedayeen in northern Jordan, from where they could negotiate with Hussein. Map showing fedayeen concentrations in Jordan prior to September 1970, and the Syrian invasion There were also concerns of Iraqi interference. A 17,000-man 3rd Armoured Division of the Iraqi Army had remained in eastern Jordan since after the 1967 Six-Day War. The Iraqi government sympathized with the Palestinians, but it was unclear whether the division would get involved in the conflict in favor of the fedayeen. Thus, the Jordanian 99th Brigade had to be detailed to monitor the Iraqis. David Raab, one of the plane hijacking hostages, described the initial military actions of Black September: Hussein arranged a cabinet meeting on the evening of the Syrian incursion, leaving them to decide if Jordan should seek foreign intervention. Two sides emerged from the meeting; one group of ministers favored military intervention from the United Kingdom or the United States, while the other group argued that it was an Arab affair that ought to be dealt with internally. The former group prevailed as Jordan was facing an existential threat. Britain refused to interfere militarily for fear of getting involved in a region-wide conflict; arguments such as \\"Jordan as it is is not a viable country\\" emerged. The British cabinet then decided to relay the Hussein's request to the Americans. Nixon and Kissinger were receptive to Hussein's request. Nixon ordered the U.S. Navy's 6th Fleet to be positioned off the coast of Israel, near Jordan. By 19‚Äì20 September, the U.S. Navy had concentrated a powerful force in the Eastern Mediterranean. Its official mission was to protect American interests in the region and to respond to the capture of about 54 British, German, and U.S. citizens in Jordan by PLO forces. Later, declassified documents showed that Hussein called an American official at 3 a.m. to request American intervention. \\"Situation deteriorating dangerously following Syrian massive invasion\\", Hussein was quoted. \\"I request immediate physical intervention both land and air... to safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Jordan. Immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative.\\"Centurion tank in Irbid, 17 September 1970 On 22 September, Hussein ordered the Royal Jordanian Air Force (RJAF) to attack the Syrian forces. A joint air-ground offensive proved successful, contributing to the success was the Syrian Air Force's abstention from joining. This has been attributed to power struggles within the Syrian Ba'athist government between Syrian Assistant Regional Secretary Salah Jadid and Syrian Air Force commander Hafez Al-Assad. Al-Assad claimed power after a coup on 13 November. Iraqi impartiality was attributed to Iraqi general Hardan Al-Tikriti's commitment to Hussein not to interfere‚Äîhe was assassinated a year later for this. It is thought that the rivalry between the Iraqi and Syrian Ba'ath Party was the real reason for Iraqi non-involvement. The airstrikes inflicted heavy losses on the Syrians, and on the late afternoon of 22 September, the Syrian 5th Division began to retreat.Pollack, Arabs at War, 2002, pp. 339‚Äì340 A meeting of the Israeli Cabinet on that day was divided on whether or not to intervene in Jordan. Israel intervened after much reluctance by having its Air Force fly over the already retreating Syrian units in a show of support to Hussein but without engaging. Israeli military commanders had prepared a contingency plan to occupy Jordanian territory‚Äìincluding the Gilead Heights, Karak and Aqaba‚Äìin case the country disintegrated and there was a land-grab by its Iraqi, Syrian and Saudi Arabian neighbors. Egyptian brokered agreement After successes against the Syrian forces, the Jordanian Army steadily shelled the fedayeen's headquarters in Amman, and threatened to also attack them in other regions of the country. The Palestinians suffered heavy losses, and some of their commanders were captured. On the other hand, in the Jordanian army there were around 300 defections, including ranking officers such as Mahmoud Da'as. Hussein agreed to a cease-fire after Arab media started accusing him of massacring the Palestinians. Jordanian Prime Minister Muhammad Daoud defected to Libya after being pressured by President Muammar Al-Gaddafi, while the former was in Egypt representing Jordan at an emergency Arab League summit. Hussein himself decided to fly to Cairo on 26 September, where he was met with hostility from Arab leaders. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. On 27 September, Hussein and Arafat signed an agreement brokered by Egyptian President Nasser. Nasser died the following day of a heart attack.Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser brokering a ceasefire between Yasser Arafat and King Hussein at the emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 27 September 1970. Nasser died the following day of a heart attack. The Jordanian army regained control of key cities and intersections in the country before accepting the ceasefire agreement brokered by Egypt's Nasser. Hussein appointed a Palestinian, Ahmad Toukan, as prime minister, instructing him to \\"bandage the wounds\\". In the period following the ceasefire, Hussein publicly revealed that the Jordanian army had uncovered around 360 underground PLO bases in Amman, and that Jordan held 20,000 detainees, among whom were \\"Chinese advisors\\". Role of Pakistani Zia-ul-Haq and Iranian leftist guerillas  The head of a Pakistani training mission to Jordan, Brigadier Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (later Chief of Army Staff and President of Pakistan), was involved on the Jordanian side. Zia had been stationed in Amman for three years prior to Black September. During the events, according to CIA official Jack O'Connell, Zia was dispatched by Hussein north to assess Syria's military capabilities. The Pakistani commander reported back to Hussein, recommending the deployment of a RJAF squadron to the region. O'Connell also said that Zia personally led Jordanian troops during the battles. Two Iranian leftist guerilla organizations, the Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas (OIPFG) and the People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI), were involved in the conflict against Jordan. Their \\"collaboration with the PLO was particularly close, and members of both movements even fought side by side in Jordan during the events of Black September and trained together in Fatah camps in Lebanon\\". On 3 August 1972, PMOI operatives bombed the Jordanian embassy in Tehran during King Hussein's state visit as an act of \\"revenge\\" for the events of Black September. Casualties Arafat claimed that the Jordanian army killed 25,000 Palestinians‚Äîother estimates put the number at between 2,000 and 3,400. The Syrian invasion attempt ended with 120 tanks lost, and around 600 Syrian casualties. Jordanian soldiers suffered around 537 dead. Post- September 1970 A group of fedayeen intercepted by Israeli border patrols after having fled across the Jordan River, 21 July 1971. Another agreement, called the Amman agreement, was signed between Hussein and Arafat on 13 October. It mandated that the fedayeen respect Jordanian sovereignty and desist from wearing uniforms or bearing arms in public. However it contained a clause requiring that Jordan recognize the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinians; Wasfi Tal rejected this clause. Habash and Hawatmeh continued their attacks on the monarchy in spite of the Amman agreement. Hussein appointed Tal to form a government. Tal was seen as anti-Palestinian, however he had made pro-Palestinian gestures during his previous two tenures as prime minister. Tal viewed Arafat with suspicion as he considered that the PLO concentrated its efforts against the Jordanian state rather than against Israel. On one occasion, Tal lost his temper and shouted at Arafat \\"You are a liar; you don't want to fight Israel!\\". Shlaim describes Tal as a more uncompromising figure than Hussein, and very popular with the army. Clashes between the army, and the PFLP and DFLP, ensued after Tal was instated. Tal launched an offensive against fedayeen bases along the Amman-Jerash road in January 1971, and the army drove them out of Irbid in March. In April, Tal ordered the PLO to relocate all its bases from Amman to the forests between Ajloun and Jerash. The fedayeen initially resisted, but they were hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned. In July, the army surrounded the last remaining 2,000 fedayeen from the Ajloun-Jerash area. The fedayeen finally surrendered and were allowed to leave to Syria, some 200 fighters preferred to cross the Jordan River to surrender to Israeli forces rather than to the Jordanians. At a 17 July press conference, Hussein declared that Jordanian sovereignty had been completely restored, and that there \\"was no problem now\\". Aftermath Jordan In the wake of the conflict, the new civilian government of Tal began a wide-scale purge of the government's bureaucracy and military, freeing them from any supporters of the guerrillas. This effectively meant that large numbers of Palestinian officers, bureaucrats and even some Jordanians were expelled from their jobs. This was accompanied by a war by Tal on the newspapers and massive arrests of the government against the \\"saboteurs\\". Many newspapers were closed, their permits withdrawn and their editors rejected. Even though the conflict was not a result of a Jordanian-Palestinian divide as there were Palestinians and Jordanians on both sides of the conflict, but rather paved the way for the divide. Ali Kassay further elaborated: Hussein's resilience in the face of the joint Palestinian-Syrian challenge impressed both the West and Israel. Nixon ordered $10 million in aid to be delivered to Jordan, and another $30 million requested from Congress. Fedayeen Wasfi Tal (right) with Yasser Arafat (left) on 12 December 1970 during ceasefire negotiations. Tal was assassinated on 28 November 1971 in Egypt by the Black September Organization. The Black September Organization was established by Fatah members in 1971 for reprisal operations and international strikes after the September events. On 28 November 1971, four of the group's members assassinated Prime Minister Wasfi Tal in the lobby of the Sheraton Cairo Hotel in Egypt while he was attending an Arab League summit. The group would go on to perform other strikes against Jordan, and against Israeli and Western citizens and property outside of the Middle East, such as the Munich massacre against Israeli athletes in 1972. The Black September Organization was later disbanded in 1973‚Äì1974 as the PLO sought to exploit the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and pursue a diplomatic strategy. Fatah has always publicly denied its responsibility for Black September operations, but by the 2000s, some high- ranking Fatah and Black September officials acknowledged the relationship. Lebanon In the September fighting, the PLO lost its main base of operations. Fighters were driven to Southern Lebanon where they regrouped. The enlarged PLO presence in Lebanon and the intensification of fighting on the Israeli‚ÄìLebanese border stirred up internal unrest in Lebanon, where the PLO fighters added dramatically to the weight of the Lebanese National Movement, a coalition of Muslims, Arab nationalists and leftists who opposed the rightist, Maronite-dominated government. These developments helped precipitate the Lebanon Civil War, in which the PLO would ultimately be expelled to Tunisia.

It was directed by W. S. Van Dyke and starred Norma Shearer as Marie Antoinette. Based upon the 1932 biography of the ill-fated Queen of France by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, it had its Los Angeles premiere at the legendary Carthay Circle Theatre, where the landscaping was specially decorated for the event. The film was the last project of Irving Thalberg who died in 1936 while it was in the planning stage. His widow Norma Shearer remained committed to the project even while her enthusiasm for her film career in general was waning following his death. With a budget close to two million dollars, it was one of the more expensive films of the 1930s, but also one of the bigger successes. Plot In 1769 Vienna, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria tells her daughter Maria Antonia she is to marry the Dauphin Louis-Auguste. Marie is excited to become the future Queen of France but grows dismayed upon learning her husband is a shy man more at home with locksmithing than attending parties. After countless attempts to please him, Louis reveals he cannot produce heirs, prompting Marie to associate with the power-hungry Duc d'Orleans. On her second wedding anniversary, Madame du Barry, King Louis XV's mistress, gifts Marie with an empty cradle and a poem critical of her inability to produce an heir. Despite Marie's outrage, Louis proves to be too weak to stand up to his grandfather. Sometime later, Marie meets Swedish Count Axel Fersen at a costume ball, during which she wagers and loses an expensive necklace. Count Mercy, the Austrian ambassador, scolds her for her wanton behaviour but she pays him little mind. Marie then hosts a ball in an attempt to make amends with du Barry and please Count Mercy. The attempt fails, however, when du Barry draws attention to Louis' absence and Marie responds with a reference to du Barry's past. The King decides to annul the marriage, prompting Louis to defend Marie. Marie, meanwhile, flees to Count Mercy's residence after learning she is to be sent back to Austria. While there, she reunites with Fersen, who professes his love for her. Realising she too has fallen in love with Fersen, Marie goes to tell Louis but learns she cannot leave him as the King is dying of smallpox and Louis himself is still fond of her. She agrees to remain and they ascend to the throne following the King's death. Despite Marie's attempts to continue their relationship, Fersen refuses to risk ruining her reputation and tells her to fulfil her duties as France's Queen. She goes on to give birth to daughter Marie Th√©r√®se and son Louis Charles. Some years later, when the Dauphin has grown into a young boy, peasants throw stones at Marie's carriage while she has taken her children for a drive. She is shocked at the intense dislike displayed by the people of France. She blames d'Orleans for inciting them. Marie later rejects a jeweller's expensive and elaborate necklace, but she is framed by court insiders plotting to acquire the necklace for themselves, and the Affair of the Diamond Necklace erupts. Marie is outraged, but d'Orleans tells the royal couple to abdicate the throne in favour of the Dauphin under the regency of d'Orleans. The French Revolution comes, and the royal family is taken prisoner. Fersen returns with a plan of escape, but when the Dauphin tells a guard that his father is a locksmith, the King is recognised and arrested after a former priest at Versailles identifies him. The King is put on trial and sentenced to death, and spends his last night with his family, his children not realising this is the last night they will spend with their father. Marie is heartbroken, but is then separated from her children, put on trial and condemned to death. The Dauphin, too young to understand what is going on around him, is forced to testify against his mother. The night before she is executed, Fersen goes to the prison and they pledge their love to each other, with Marie telling him that she will never say goodbye. The next morning she goes bravely to her execution, which Fersen witnesses from a distance.

However, a clash with Louis B. Mayer after the failure of her film Operator 13 led to the couple switching to neighboring Warner Bros. Norma Shearer was the wife of MGM studio head Irving Thalberg when this project was greenlit sometime before his death in 1936. This was reportedly Shearer's favorite role. Originally to be directed by Sidney Franklin, the job was given to W.S. Van Dyke. Irving Thalberg originally planned for Charles Laughton to play the role of Louis XVI, but Laughton, after lengthy deliberations, finally declined. Costumes and set designs The film boasted thousands of expensive costumes and lavish set design. The array of costumes created for the film are among the most expensive in film history. Costume designer Adrian visited France and Austria in 1937 to research the period. While there he purchased vast quantities of antique materials, French lace, and period accessories for use in the film. He studied the paintings of Marie Antoinette, even using a microscope on them, so that the embroidery could be identical. Fabrics were specially woven and subsequently embroidered with stitches sometimes too fine to be seen with the naked eye. The studio raged at the amount of money being spent on costumes for the film. The attention to detail was extreme, from the framework to hair. Some gowns were extremely heavy due to the amount of embroidery, fabric and precious stones used in their creation. Ms. Shearer's gowns alone had the combined weight of over 1,768 pounds, the heaviest being the 108 pound wedding dress created using hundreds of yards of white silk satin hand embroidered in gilt thread. Originally slated to be shot in Technicolor, many of the gowns were specially dyed. The fur trim on one of Ms. Shearer's capes was therefore dyed the exact shade of her eyes.The Costumes of Marie Antoinette The Movies and the Woman The elaborate costumes were subsequently reused multiple times in other period films to offset the cost of their creation. Many have survived and exist in both museum and private costume collections internationally. The ballroom at Versailles was built to be twice as large as the original to give the ball sequences a grander scale. Genuine French furniture from the period was purchased and shipped to Hollywood, some of it thought to have originally been from Versailles. The budget was a then-enormous $2.9 million. After calculating the huge expense of costume and set design, plans to render it in color were scrapped because of concerns it would cost even more to add Technicolor.DVD Verdict Review - Marie Antoinette (1938) Reception The film premiered on July 8, 1938 at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles following a lavish outdoor red carpet ceremony for which the nearby lawns were transformed into an imitation of the gardens of the Palace of Versailles. The premiere, including the preparations of the grounds, is depicted in a short black-and-white newsreel film Hollywood Goes to Town produced by M-G-M. The film was popular but because of its enormous cost recorded a loss of $767,000. Home media Sofia Coppola released her 2006 film version of the life of the queen at Versailles, causing Warner Bros. to release its 1938 vault version of Marie Antoinette on DVD. Extras are sparse, with two vintage shorts included on the disc: \\"Hollywood Goes to Town\\" provides a glimpse of the elaborate premiere for the movie, while a trailer is also included.

Lymphangiogenesis plays an important physiological role in homeostasis, metabolism and immunity. Impaired or excessive lymphatic vessel formation has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions including neoplasm metastasis, oedema, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lymphangiomatosis and impaired wound healing. The role of the lymphatic system in these diseases has received renewed interest largely due to the discovery of LEC lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) -specific markers such as podoplanin, LYVE-1, PROX1, desmoplakin and VEGF-C receptor VEGFR-3. These specific markers have enabled insights into functional and molecular lymphatic biology. There are several known pro-lymphangiogenesis inducers such as VEGF-C, hyaluronic acid and ephrin-B2. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain VEGF-C patterning during lymphangiogenesis, including formation of Turing patterns.

Born to a minor diplomatic official and his wife, Nolan was educated at the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where he was noted as an enthusiastic horseman and military theorist. After early graduation he was commissioned as a subaltern in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment, serving in Austria, Hungary and on the Polish frontier, where he again became known for his horsemanship and was promoted to senior lieutenant. Due to the nepotism inherent in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces, Nolan succeeded in transferring to the British Army as a Cornet in the 15th Light Dragoons. Deployed in India, Nolan was eventually made the regimental riding master and an aide-de-camp to General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, accompanying him on horse trials to evaluate the use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was made a Captain in 1850. Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led to the adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East in the early days of the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, and in this role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade. 40 percent of the Light Brigade's soldiers were killed, wounded, captured or rendered unfit for service, including Nolan, who was the first casualty of the charge. Contemporary accounts blamed Nolan for failing to properly communicate the order, either accidentally or deliberately, while some modern historians apportion the blame not only to Nolan but also Lord Raglan, commander of the British forces in the Crimea, and the cavalry commander, Lord Lucan. Early life and education Lord Fitzroy Somerset, who interviewed Nolan and permitted him to join the British Army Nolan was born on 4 January 1818 to Babington and Elizabeth Nolan, in York County, Upper Canada. Following his father's dismissal from his minor diplomatic post at the British consulate in Milan, Nolan was accepted into the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where he was known as Ludwig by his fellow cadets. His father's desire to see him given a chance to enter a prestigious branch of the armed forces meant that Nolan was regularly transferred to other cadet schools to learn more about the military. Enthusiastic about the cavalry, he was noted as an excellent horseman and student of military theory, as well as history. With the multi-lingual nature of Austro-Hungary, he also studied languages, including Hungarian. Other subjects studied there included fortification, water engineering, mathematics, fencing, swimming and bridge-building. Nolan graduated from the Pioneer School a year early in May 1835, probably following a recommendation from Prince Liechtenstein, and was made a subaltern in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment. Nolan served in Austria, Hungary and on the Polish frontier, and was again noted for his horsemanship and language skills. His confidential report from 1838 commended his \\"great zeal and application\\", and he was highly popular within the regiment, rising to become the senior lieutenant. Despite this, his status as a foreigner and a commoner limited his opportunities for promotion. Although promotions in the Austrian Army theoretically were merit-based, in practise the gentry exchanged favours and money unofficially to secure them. Nolan's father attempted to get him a commission with the British Army, with little success until Nolan's return to the United Kingdom for the coronation of Queen Victoria in July 1838. While there, he secured an interview with Lord Fitzroy Somerset while his father negotiated with the Austrian General Clam-Gallas to permit Nolan to leave the Austrian armed forces. Eventually, following the payment of ¬£450, Nolan was granted a commission as a Cornet in the 15th Light Dragoons of the British Army on 23 April 1839. His resignation from the Austrian army was never formally accepted, and he was struck off the rolls on 31 October 1899, 45 years after his death. 15th Light Dragoons India Despite the negative associations with service there, Nolan had deliberately transferred to a regiment operating in India. He initially travelled to Maidstone, where the 15th maintained a troop to train new recruits, under the command of Captain George Key. He then caught a troopship to Bombay, the Malabar, which arrived on 9 November. Soon after arrival he fell ill and was granted two years of sick leave, starting from 26 March 1840, and returned to Britain. He returned to active service in June 1841, again to the Maidstone depot, and became a Lieutenant on the 19th. He went on leave again in August to take the riding master's course and exam, and returned on 8 March 1842, newly qualified. His attachment to the Maidstone depot gave Nolan the opportunity to further study and practice cavalry theory; he met several other officers with a similar interest, including Captain Key, with whom he became close friends. By 1842 his time at Maidstone had ended, and he departed for India in October, arriving at Madras on 9 May 1843. The 15th Light Dragoons were stationed in Bangalore, a relatively peaceful area, and Nolan did not see action during his time there. He was appointed regimental riding master on 13 August 1844, in recognition of his expertise at horsemanship. In his spare time, Nolan raced his horse Arab Beauty. At the Bangalore Cantonment Races in October 1846, he placed second in two races, and won both the Galloway Stakes and Ladies' Purse. A year later he entered Sahagun, without success. As regimental riding master he introduced substantial changes to the cavalry training programme, reintroducing the use of leaping bars, training individual soldiers before teaching formation riding to entire squads, and appointing a dedicated soldier in each troop who was trained to break in new horses. Over the next few years the regiment's standard of horsemanship rose, increasing Nolan's reputation. When the regiment was inspected by Major General John Aitchison, a man known for his high standards, he wrote that: Nolan then became a staff officer, joining the staff of General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, as an aide-de-camp in January 1849. He quickly became close friends with Berkeley's two sons, Charles and George, who were also enthusiastic about horse-racing. In 1850 Nolan accompanied Berkeley on a tour of the region, conducting horse trials to evaluate the use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was also promoted, purchasing a Captaincy on 8 March. Despite these successes, Nolan recognised that his prospects were far more limited in India than in England, and he could not afford the increased costs of serving in the colonies. At the same time, service in India was not taken seriously by many of the officers in high command, and would not be sufficient on its own to advance him. Accordingly, he obtained two years sick leave on 16 January 1851 and returned to England, intending to tour Europe and write a book on cavalry theory. Grand tour and cavalry theory Duke of Cambridge, who attended tests of \\"Nolan's saddle\\", later ordered and used by the British Army. (Collodion, 1855, by Roger Fenton) After a brief period in England, Nolan and Colonel George Key toured the continent, visiting countries including France, Russia, Sweden and the German states. The Swedish Horse Guards under Curt von Stedingk left a particular impression, with Nolan later writing that they were \\"one of the best regiments of foreign cavalry I have ever seen\\", and he was also impressed by Fran√ßois Baucher, initially considering simply translating Baucher's M√©thode d'√©quitation into English. In Russia, he attended a military review of Cossack and Circassian cavalry, and passing through Germany, observed the Saxon dragoons. Eventually, following his return to Maidstone in October 1852 (and promotion to commander of the regiment's troop there), he published his first book, The Training of Cavalry Remount Horses: A New System, through Parker, Furnivall & Parker. Dedicated to Berkeley, the book was highly specialised and intended for practical use, aimed specifically at cavalry officers rather than equestrians generally. The reaction to the book was limited, partly because of its specialised nature. His second book, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, covered cavalry theory more widely and made a series of recommendations, including the use of carbines on foot rather than from the saddle, and substantial improvements to the cavalry saddle itself. The existing saddle, in use since 1796, was considered too high, restricting the use of a rider's lower legs, leading to instability. Accordingly, he designed a new saddle, with the assistance of the saddler sergeant at Maidstone depot, which focused on reducing rubbing against the horse, improved comfort and weighed less than the existing design. The resulting saddle was tested in April 1853, with attendance by the Duke of Cambridge, inspector general of cavalry. The reaction was positive, and the army commissioned it as a new model for the cavalry, known as the Universal Wood Arch Pattern design, but informally referred to as \\"Nolan's saddle\\". Cavalry: Its History and Tactics received a much warmer reception than Training, with the Illustrated London News praising his knowledge and enthusiasm while recommending it for civilians as well as the military. Another review in The Times was also approving. Over the next few decades it continued to be well received, and was seen as \\"an important, even ground- breaking, work\\". The book gave him substantial prominence, both in Britain and the United States. It was also discussed in India, where it was praised as \\"the manual for a cavalry officer who would understand his profession and reflect honour upon it\\". A copy was sent to Bonneau du Martray of the French Imperial Staff by Major-General Wetherall of the British staff; Du Martray, having read the book, translated the entire work as Histoire et Tactique de la Cavalerie. Crimean War Remount mission With the Crimean War fast approaching, the British Army needed some way of obtaining cavalry horses in Turkey. One method was simply to ship horses from Britain, but this was time- consuming and expensive, and would result in a large number dying. Alternately, horses could be bought in the Middle East, if suitable ones could be identified. The Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for War, needed an experienced cavalry officer to undertake such a search. With Nolan's new-found reputation he was a logical choice, and Newcastle had him struck off from the 15th Hussars and made aide-de-camp to General Richard Airey, backdated to 17 March 1854. Issued with a \\"special service\\" passport, he departed to Constantinople, meeting the steamship Thabor at Marseilles. After arriving in Turkey he met with Skene, the British Vice-Consul, who had him introduced to Omar Pasha and invited to view the Turkish regiments. Nolan was not particularly impressed by them, judging the irregulars incapable of withstanding a Russian cavalry charge and finding the horses too small. He ordered 250 of them anyway, finding them appropriate for the British artillery if not for the cavalry. His report to Somerset (now Baron Raglan, and commander of the British forces in Turkey) included a proposal for a trip to Syria, where he claimed the horses were more appropriate. This proposal was eventually agreed to, and he went to ƒ∞skenderun on 9 May. When they arrived they discovered that Turkish officials had already bought most of the army horses in northern Syria, and so they continued on to Beirut and then Damascus. Even there, they failed to find horses of sufficient quality, and so they left the city on 21 May in hopes of making contact with the Bedouin. They left with a train of 292 horses, mostly bought from the 'Anizzah, and were met at Beirut by the steamship Trent and transported back to Turkey. Staff officer Prince Menshikov, Russian commander at the Battles of Alma and Balaclava Nolan returned to the British forces to join the Light Division at Devna as aide-de-camp to Airey. The Royal Navy had control over the Black Sea, and with a Russian treaty with Turkey and Austria, the enemy forces were withdrawing from Eastern Europe. Despite this favourable outcome, the British government wished to negotiate with the Russians from a strong position. The decision was taken to invade the Crimea itself, with the objective of destroying or capturing the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. Raglan personally considered this unrealistic ‚Äì British forces knew little about the region, the port's defences, or the strength of the Russian military, with estimates of troop numbers varying between 45,000 and 140,000. It was also quite a distance away, causing logistical difficulties. With the Crimea identified as the target, Nolan and his fellow staff officers had to plan the assault, which eventually included 30,000 infantry, 1,240 cavalry and 54 guns, along with 24,000 French soldiers and 70 of their guns. The cavalry alone required 3,379 horses, and with such a small number of ships available the Heavy Brigade would be part of a second wave ‚Äì until it arrived, the Light Brigade would be relied on as the sole unit of cavalry. The force departed for the Crimea on 2 September 1854, and began landing at Kalamita Bay, 35 miles north of Sevastopol itself. Airey had the light cavalry engage in reconnaissance and screening while the rest of the force moved off the transports, and they were fully ashore by the 18th. On the 19th, they began marching to Sevastopol ‚Äì still without the Heavy Brigade. The force reached the Bulganak River that day, where skirmishers found a force of Cossacks and Russian infantry, with a light battery of artillery. The infantry and artillery had been hidden in a dip in the terrain while the British formed up, and their placement put the British cavalry in heavy danger. Raglan decided to withdraw, and sent a troop forward to cover the retreat; this body's confidence deceived the Russians into thinking that there was a larger British force than there was, and they failed to pursue the retreating cavalry. A day later, the British force, together with the French under General St Arnaud, defeated the Russians at the Battle of Alma. Nolan spent the battle as a liaison due to his fluent French, and was often galloping between the two allied armies. They resumed marching on 26 September and entered the plains of Balaclava, near Sevastopol. Balaclava The British camp in Balaclava was on a plateau, with two approaches ‚Äì the South and North valleys ‚Äì and a small hill, known as the Causeway Heights, between them. At Balaclava, the force waited for supplies while the allied ships bombarded the forts surrounding Sevastopol, starting on 17 October. The forts proved to be particularly strong, but some damage was caused and Admiral Kornilov killed. From then on, time and time again, the allied navy would bombard the forts, causing damage, which the Russians would then repair each night. While the allied armies waited to strengthen their positions and increase their resources, Prince Menshikov, commander of the Russian forces, had a desire to provide a victory to the Tsar following his defeat at Alma. He formed a plan to cut the British army off from the harbour at Balaclava, with a secondary objective of capturing the harbour itself. The Russian forces assembled on 24 October, and attacked at around 7am on the 25th. General Gribbe covered the Russian left flank, with Semiakin, Levoutsky and Scudery on his right: General Ryzhov waited behind them, prepared to support any individual force that came under trouble. The Turkish forces in the first redoubts were quickly overwhelmed and forced to flee. At 8am Raglan ordered the Heavy and Light cavalry brigades, under Lord Lucan, to move into line with the second set of Turkish-occupied redoubts. The order confused and infuriated Lucan ‚Äì there was only one set of redoubts that had been occupied by the Turks, and it was now abandoned. Doing so also meant leaving the Turks and 550 British infantry to meet the Russian charge alone, without any cavalry support. Despite Raglan's \\"lackadaisical wording\\", Lucan interpreted the order (correctly) to require him to place the Light Brigade at the mouth of the North Valley to Balaclava, a position that left the cavalry dangerously exposed: because of the terrain, they would not be able to see advancing Russian troops until they were less than 50 feet away. As Raglan watched the cavalry form up at the mouth of the North Valley, 30 minutes after giving the order, he changed his mind and had them returned to their original position. At the same time, Raglan wished to reinforce the Turks and British infantry, and ordered Lucan to detach four of the five Heavy Brigade cavalry regiments and send them to the defensive line. This further angered Lucan, since splitting the force in half merely reduced the cavalry's overall effectiveness, but he again complied. The result was that the first fork of the Russian cavalry attack encountered The Thin Red Line and were driven off, while the second fork, crossing the heights above the plain, encountered four regiments of the Heavy Brigade. The Russians ‚Äì with between 1,500 and 2,000 men ‚Äì were initially surprised to see the 800 British cavalry approaching, allowing Scarlett, the commander of the Heavy Brigades, to charge the Russians uphill. By this point Lucan had left Lord Cardigan in charge of the Light Brigade and raced over to the Heavies, later claiming that his duty trumpeter had ordered the British charge, which eventually forced the Russians to flee. The Light Brigade The timeline of the Charge When Lucan left the Light Brigade idling on the plateau, he instructed Cardigan to defend the position against attack. Cardigan interpreted this to mean that he should not leave the plateau, and the Brigade remained mostly immobile while the Heavy Brigade engaged the Russian cavalry (over the objection of some of the Light Brigade's officers). This prevented the British cavalry from adequately pursuing the Russians, and no attacks were mounted down the North Valley through which they had retreated. Due to the failure of their attack, the Russians chose not to advance further, leading to Raglan deciding to attempt to retake the captured Turkish fortifications using the Light and Heavy brigades with two divisions of infantry. Although the 1st Division advanced swiftly, the 4th Division was deliberately slow, making Raglan increasingly impatient. He dispatched an aide to Lucan ordering that \\"Cavalry to advance and take advantage of any opportunity to recover the heights. They will be supported by the infantry which have been ordered to advance on two fronts\\". Lucan interpreted this to mean he should await the infantry support before attacking. About 40 minutes later, with the infantry still having not arrived, Raglan's staff officers spotted Russian artillery teams approaching the fortifications with equipment to remove captured guns. To avoid the guns being taken, Raglan dispatched Nolan to carry a message to Lucan that read: As Nolan rode towards Lucan's position, Raglan shouted that he should \\"Tell Lord Lucan the cavalry is to attack immediately\\"; his fourth order. The Russian forces included the Don Cossack field artillery battery, containing between eight and twelve guns, drawn up at the bottom of the North Valley, with regiments of cavalry waiting behind it. Nolan carried the message to Lucan; when Lucan asked what guns were referred to, Nolan is said to have indicated, by a wide sweep of his arm, not the Causeway redoubts but the Don Cossack battery in the North Valley, around a mile away. After a brief debate, Lucan ordered the Light Brigade forward. Cardigan claimed that Lucan had ordered him to attack without quarter given, despite him pointing out the Russian artillery; Lucan, on the other hand, claimed he told Cardigan to retire from battle \\"if no opportunity to take his objective presented itself\\". Regardless, the Brigade drew swords and was ordered by Cardigan to advance down the valley. Nolan had explicitly asked to join the Brigade for the fight, and was allowed to. The Charge The Light Brigade set off down the valley with Cardigan out in front, riding Ronald,Undated issue of Saddle & Bridle , St Louis, MO, quoted in leading the charge. Almost at once Nolan was seen to rush across the front, passing in front of Cardigan. It may be that he then realised the charge was aimed at the wrong target, and was attempting to stop or turn the brigade, but the Russian guns opened fire, and an artillery shell splinter mortally wounded Nolan in the chest. As the cavalry continued on its course, Nolan's horse carried him back almost to the Brigade's starting point before he finally fell from the saddle, dead. Captain Godfrey Morgan (subsequently 1st Viscount Tredegar), who was close by and saw what happened, later recounted: Russian artillery continued to fire on the Light Brigade. As Lucan advanced after them with the Heavy Brigade, he saw the Light Brigade being overwhelmed by the Russian artillery and ordered the Heavies back, saying that \\"They have sacrificed the Light Brigade; they shall not the Heavy, if I can help it\\". Lucan's subsequent explanation was that he saw no point in having a second brigade mown down, and he was best positioned where he was to render assistance to Light Brigade survivors returning from the charge. The French light cavalry, the Chasseurs d'Afrique, was more effective in that it cleared the Fedyukhin Heights of the two half batteries of guns, two infantry battalions, and Cossacks to ensure the Light Brigade would not be hit by fire from that flank, and it later provided cover for the remaining elements of the Light Brigade as they withdrew. Although unnamed, the correspondent was William Howard Russell The remainder of the Light Brigade eventually reached the Russian artillery, wreaking havoc on the fleeing gunners, before pursuing the Russian cavalry behind the artillery down the remainder of the valley. Despite being outnumbered five to one, the British cavalry who pursued the Russians managed to disrupt the enemy for some time before being killed or captured. Of the cavalry who had stayed with the abandoned artillery guns, 60 or 70 were collected by George Paget, who retired back to the British lines despite Russian cavalry harrying them. The result was 110 dead, 130 wounded, and 58 missing or captured ‚Äì 40 percent losses in an action that lasted 20 minutes. Despite the heavy losses amongst the men he led, Lord Cardigan survived the battle. Although stories circulated afterwards that he was not actually present,Woodham Smith, p. 258. he led the charge from the front and, never looking back, did not see what was happening to the troops behind him. He reached the Russian guns, took part in the fight, and then returned alone up the valley without bothering to rally or even find out what had happened to the survivors. He afterwards said all he could think about was his rage against Nolan, who he thought had tried to take over the leadership of the charge from him. After riding back up the valley, he considered he had done all that he could and then, with considerable sang-froid, left the field and went on board his yacht in Balaclava harbour, where he ate a champagne dinner.Woodham Smith, p. 262. In December 2016, it was reported that a letter was found in the British Library, written by Lieutenant Frederick Maxse, who was on Lord Raglan's staff at Balaclava, stating that Lord Raglan had sent an order for the Light Brigade to \\"follow the enemy and try to prevent the enemy from carrying away the guns\\"; those guns were some British artillery guns which were at risk. Raglan having sent Nolan to give the order, Nolan, instead of passing on the order verbatim complete as given, passed it on to Lord Lucan orally as \\"There, my lord, is your enemy! There are your guns!\\", and added the word \\"attack\\", when Raglan had intended merely a show of force. Nolan's version of the order and accompanying gesture were misunderstood, causing the disaster. Maxse's letter said that Nolan was annoyed at how little the Light Brigade had done previously, and that Nolan was angry against Lord Lucan. Nigel Kingscote (another of Raglan's staff officers) agreed that the fault was Nolan's, and said that Nolan, if he had lived, would have been \\"broke by court martial\\".Sunday Telegraph Sunday 11 December 2016, p. 12 Legacy A coat belonging to Nolan displayed in the National Army Museum At the time of his death, Nolan was the last male member of his family. His cousins, the Neylans, adopted his surname and have carried his name on since then in the form of Nolan-Neylan. Some friends had a plaque erected in his memory at Holy Trinity Church in Maidstone, although his body remained in the Crimea. Most of his possessions were given to Colonel Key, including the copyright on Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, his house in London and his interests in the Adelphi Estate in Tobago. The Charge itself and the tragedy that resulted was blamed on both Lucan and Nolan by William Howard Russell ‚Äì Nolan, for misunderstanding the order and issuing a confusing message, and Lucan, for not properly keeping an eye on the terrain. Raglan himself primarily blamed Lucan, who was infuriated by this and wrote a letter to Horse Guards Parade disputing Raglan's claim. This was too much for Viscount Hardinge, the Commander-in- Chief of the Forces, who had Lucan resign his command and return to Britain. With Hardinge unwilling to give him a court martial, Lucan wrote a pamphlet titled A Vindication of the Earl of Lucan from Lord Raglan's Reflections and a series of letters to The Times that revealed Raglan's order to have been highly ambiguous and \\"not the kind of dispatch required by an officer on the battlefield\\". At the same time, Nolan's method of delivery had been imperious, and he had insisted the urgency of the attack ‚Äì something clear in Raglan's verbal order to him, but not in the written order. Public opinion became divided; people both attacked Nolan and rallied to his defence. The major newspapers, at least, maintained that with Nolan's status as a mere messenger it was inconceivable that he alone could have destroyed the Light Brigade without failings by Lucan. Lord Cardigan defended Nolan by saying the Captain \\"did not have the least idea of the mistake which was about to be perpetrated.\\" Within the Crimea, however, the majority \\"roundly damned\\" Nolan. The Charge was soon overshadowed by other scandalous and bloody military failures such as the continued failure of the Siege of Sevastopol. Terry Brighton writes in Hell Riders that \\"in the 150 years since the charge historians have generally agreed that the blunder was indeed Nolan's. Most argue that he misunderstood the order, and when asked by Lord Lucan what Raglan intended by it pointed towards the wrong enemy guns and sent the Light Brigade to its destruction. In recent years it has even been suggested that he deliberately misled Lucan about which guns were to be attacked\\". Brighton himself distributes the blame more widely, holding that Raglan, Lucan and Nolan were at fault, but that the vast majority of the blame lies with Lucan. David Buttery, in Messenger of Death, agrees that the blame was at least partially Lucan's for failing to conduct adequate reconnaissance. Nolan was played by David Hemmings in the 1968 film The Charge of the Light Brigade. In the film Nolan is portrayed as a haughty, glory-hungry officer, but also a \\"symbol of youth, energy and professionalism ... desperate ... to reform the army\\". A more sympathetic, though still impetuous, portrayal of Nolan was created by George MacDonald Fraser in his picaresque novel of 1973, Flashman At The Charge. A totally ficticous \\"Major Geoffrey Vickers\\", standing in for Nolan but with utterly different motives in ordering the charge, was played by Errol Flynn in the 1936 movie, The Charge of the Light Brigade.

The Roadpacer was introduced to compete with large Japanese flagship sedans Toyota Century, Nissan President, Isuzu Statesman de Ville, and the Mitsubishi Debonair.

History Early years (2003-2005) The band, originally a quartet, was founded in 2003 by Tatiana DeMaria. In 2004 they released their debut single, 'Peace Sex & Tea' which charted in the UK's top 50, followed by their 'Pessimist' EP, a live recording of part of their set from Reading Festival 2004, which entered the BBC's Official Rock Chart at number 18. Both Single/EP were released independently through EX Records in conjunction with the Extreme Sports Channel. As the band started making ripples, they earned a support slot with The Offspring and HorrorPops in Paris, where they were exposed to 13,000 people. Throughout 2005, TAT experienced several lineup changes which eventually saw the band become a trio, with the inclusion of bassist Nick Kent and drummer Jake Reed. After more UK touring, they flew to Poland to join Coalition For Kids, a two-week stadium tour to raise money for terminally ill children. CCS & USA debut (2006-2008) 2006 saw the release of their next single, \\"Champagne Cocaine & Strawberries\\", which they released and distributed themselves. During this period, Jake Reed briefly left the band and was replaced by former drummer Robin Guy until his return. For this reason, Robin can be seen in the promotional video for 'Champagne Cocaine & Strawberries'. It was later this year that the band embarked on the Vans Warped Tour for the first time, playing the second month of the travelling festival on the ShiraGirl stage. In 2007, TAT toured the UK and Europe with such notable punk acts as NOFX and The Bouncing Souls (whom they met on Warped Tour '06) as well as Me First And The Gimme Gimmes, The Draft and The Loved Ones. In October, they spent three weeks in Atlanta, GA where they recorded the bulk of their debut album. TAT released their album preview EP entitled This Is...TAT in 2008. They completed the Vans Warped Tour and embarked on several other North American/Canadian tours with Alice Cooper, Lagwagon and MxPx.  Soho Lights (2008-2010) Soho Lights, the band's debut album, was released on 28 October 2008 through their own label, Red Wagon Records, with nationwide distribution across the USA via Sony's RED Distribution. However, the album was not initially released in the UK, which caused frustration for both the band and their home fans. The album later found a digital UK release through iTunes, but never in a physical format. After a short break over the festive period and playing a one off homecoming show in London, The band returned to the US in February for a Californian tour with Pennywise and Authority Zero. Nick Kent was unable to attend the tour due to a wrist operation and was temporarily replaced by Nick Stagnaro of Good Guys In Black for all shows. In March and April, TAT embarked on their first solo American tour, and in the Summer they played the entire 2009 Warped Tour, performing on the Hurley stage. The band then toured with Alice Cooper that same summer for three weeks. A fall tour with Social Distortion was scheduled and promoted; however, TAT later announced that due to unforeseen circumstances they would be unable to perform. In September, the band started writing material for their second full-length album. DeMaria also lent her vocals to Reel Big Fish's 2009 album of covers, Fame, Fortune, and Fornication, where she sang a duet with Aaron Barrett on Talk Dirty to Me.  Second album and future (2011-present) In 2011, TAT announced that they were back in the studio recording their second up album and appeared on Warped Tour 2011 bringing some of their new material to the live set along with a handful of LA, NY and UK shows. During this time DeMaria wrote and produced several songs for the soundtrack of Blue Crush 2, the direct-to-DVD sequel of 2002's Blue Crush, which TAT performed along with a cover of the Allman Brothers' \\"Soulshine\\". In December 2011, the band self-released the EP Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell. In 2015, TAT released a new song titled \\"Anxiety\\" and embarked on the 2015 Vans Warped Tour through the US and Canada for two months.

They published English language literature for distribution on the European continent outside Great Britain, including initial serial publications of novels by Charles Dickens. Though copyright protection did not exist between nations in the 19th century, Tauchnitz paid the authors for the works they published, and agreed to limit their sales of English-language books to the European continent, as authors like Dickens or Bulwer-Lytton had separate arrangements for publication and sale in Great Britain. Carl Christoph Traugott Tauchnitz Carl Christoph Traugott Tauchnitz (1761‚Äì1836), born at Grossbardau near Grimma, Saxony, established a printing business in Leipzig in 1796 and a publishing house in 1798. He specialized in the publication of dictionaries, Bibles, and stereotyped editions of the Greek and Roman classics. He was the first publisher to introduce stereotyping into Germany. The business was carried on by his son, (1798‚Äì1884), until 1865, when the business was sold to O. Holtze. He left large sums to the city of Leipzig for philanthropic purposes. Founding of Bernhard Tauchnitz Christian Bernhard, Freiherr von Tauchnitz (August 25, 1816 Schleinitz, present day UnterkakaAugust 11, 1895 Leipzig), the founder of the firm of Bernhard Tauchnitz, was the nephew of Carl Christoph Traugott Tauchnitz. Christian's father died when he was young and his uncle played an important part in his development. His printing and publishing firm was started at Leipzig (Germany) on February 1, 1837. Bernhard started the Collection of British and American Authors in 1841, a reprint series familiar to anglophone travellers on the continent of Europe. These inexpensive paperbound editions, a direct precursor to mass-market paperbacks, were begun in 1841, and eventually ran to over 5,000 volumes. In 1868 he began the Collection of German Authors, followed in 1886 by the Students' Tauchnitz Editions. Early copyright reformer In the early 1900s, a journalist writing about the company suggested that the warning on the covers of Tauchnitz's English-language books, \\"Not to be introduced into England or into any British colony,\\" might lead some to believe that the books were not legitimate. In fact the books were authorised by the authors or their representatives for Continental sale only. The authors were paid royalties even at a time when no copyright protection for English and American books existed in Germany. That was Baron Tauchnitz's policy from the foundation of his company. He wrote in his original prospectus: > \\"Allow me to remark that I, as well as any other publisher in Germany, have > at present the right to embark in such undertakings without any permission > from the authors; and that my propositions arise solely from a wish thereby > to take the first step towards a literary relationship between England and > Germany, and towards an extension of the rights of copyright, and to publish > my editions in accordance with those rights.\\"Tighe Hopkins (July 1901) \\"The > Tauchnitz Edition\\", The Critic, An Illustrated Monthly Review of Literature, > Art and Life, Vol.29 No.1 pp.331‚Äì343, Published for The Critic Company by > G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York Christian Karl Bernhard Tauchnitz. from a portrait by Vilma Lwoff-Parlaghy In 1841, when Tauchnitz started his English-language editions, there were no copyright treaties between England or the United States and Continental countries. Although Tauchnitz's editions were authorised, they were not protected from copyright infringement and he could offer no such protection to the authors he paid. A few years later, various Continental States formed copyright treaties with Britain: Prussia and Saxony in 1846, France in 1852, and successively nearly all European states. In these countries, the Tauchnitz Authorised Edition became the Copyright Edition. Finally, the Berne Convention of 1886 conferred copyright upon authors in its fullest form over the greater part of the developed world. Tauchnitz editions were the only authorised editions of works by American authors on the Continent of Europe until 1891, when, by the Copyright Treaty with the United States of America, they too became copyright editions. Honours bestowed In 1860 he was ennobled with the title of Freiherr (Baron) for his services to literature, and in 1877 was made a life member of the Saxon Upper Chamber.w:de:S√§chsischer Landtag (1831‚Äì1918) (German) From 1866 to 1895 he was British Consul-General for the kingdom and duchies of Saxony. Christian Karl Bernhard Christian Bernhard was succeeded in the business by his son, Baron Christian Karl Bernhard Tauchnitz (born May 29, 1841). Christian Karl received his education at the F√ºrstenschule in Meissen, studied law at the Universities of Berlin, Z√ºrich and Leipzig, and was a Doctor of Jurisprudence, and had passed the state examination by the age of twenty-one. He made a tour of Europe, stayed some time in England, and learned to speak and write English with barely a flaw. In 1866, he entered into partnership with his father at his firm. Catalogue Details) The two authors who first attracted Tauchnitz's attention were Dickens and Lytton with the novels Pickwick Papers and Pelham which appeared in 1841. Twenty-two years later, in 1863, the five-hundredth title of the series was published under the title Five Centuries of the English Language and Literature. In 1869, an English-language edition of The New Testament, exhibiting the differences between the original Alexandrine, Sinaitic and Vatican manuscripts, was the one-thousandth title. It was dedicated by the Baron \\"To my English and American Authors, as a Token of Esteem for the Living, and a Tribute of Remembrance to the Dead.\\" In 1881, the two-thousandth title, Of English Literature in the Reign of Victoria by Henry Morley was issued, in which facsimiles of the signatures of all the authors who had been published in the Tauchnitz series appeared. By 1901, 3,500 books had been published. It was not only a catalogue of English works. German and French works filled a large space as well as the Greek and Latin classics which had been a speciality of his uncle Karl. His German edition of the Bible was a scholarly work. It included contributions from important German scholars including, Karl Gottfried Wilhelm Theile, Seligman Baer, Franz Delitzsch, Constantin von Tischendorf and Oscar von Gebhardt, together with the Bibliotheca Patrum. Scientific works, books on jurisprudence, and dictionaries covering most of the world's major languages, filled the catalogue as well. The publishers amassed a huge amount of correspondence from authors of the day which amounted to an important Who's Who of the time. Letters of thanks and dedications from many authors were in the Tauchnitz archive. These included letters from Harrison Ainsworth, Wilkie Collins, Maria Susanna Cummins, Louisa M. Alcott, Marguerite Gardiner, Baron Lytton, Dinah Craik, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens, Benjamin Disraeli, Gladstone, Thomas Babington Macaulay, George Henry Lewes, George Eliot, Nathaniel Hawthorn, Washington Irving, Longfellow, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Lever, Thackeray, Charles Reade, Tennyson, Robert Browning, Gerald Du Maurier, James Payn and Robert Louis Stevenson.  The Todd-Bowden Collection of Tauchnitz Editions  The Todd- Bowden Collection is an important collection of Tauchnitz editions in the British Library. It was acquired in 1992, with the aid of the German KulturStiftung der L√§nder and the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The collection includes approximately 6,700 volumes, together with sale catalogues, leaflets, and other advertising material and is one of the most important collections of Tauchnitz books outside Germany.Todd-Bowden Collection of Tauchnitz Editions.

Category:Logic ","title":"Normal form (natural deduction)"},{"id":"1105073","text":"An adjuvant (from Latin, \\"adjuvare\\", meaning \\"to help\\") is a pharmacological or immunological agent that improves the immune response of a vaccine. Adjuvants may be added to a vaccine to boost the immune response to produce more antibodies and longer-lasting immunity, thus minimizing the dose of antigen needed. Adjuvants may also be used to enhance the efficacy of a vaccine by helping to modify the immune response to particular types of immune system cells: for example, by activating T cells instead of antibody-secreting B cells depending on the purpose of the vaccine. Adjuvants are also used in the production of antibodies from immunized animals. There are different classes of adjuvants that can affect the immune response in different ways, but the most commonly used adjuvants include aluminium hydroxide and paraffin oil. Immunologic adjuvants Immunologic adjuvants are added to vaccines to stimulate the immune system's response to the target antigen, but do not provide immunity themselves. Adjuvants can act in various ways in presenting an antigen to the immune system. Adjuvants can act as a depot for the antigen, presenting the antigen over a longer period of time, thus maximizing the immune response before the body clears the antigen. Examples of depot type adjuvants are oil emulsions. An adjuvant can also act as an irritant, which engages and amplifies the body's immune response. A tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (DPT) vaccine, for example, contains small quantities of inactivated toxins produced by each of the target bacteria, but also contains some aluminium hydroxide. Such aluminium salts are common adjuvants in vaccines sold in the United States and have been used in vaccines for more than 70 years. Mechanism Adjuvants are needed to improve routing and adaptive immune responses to antigens. This reaction is mediated by two main types of lymphocytes, B and T lymphocytes. Adjuvants apply their effects through different mechanisms. Some adjuvants, such as alum, function as delivery systems by generating depots that trap antigens at the injection site, providing a slow release that continues to stimulate the immune system. This is now under debate, as studies have shown that surgical removal of these depots had no impact on the magnitude of IgG1 response. As stabilizing agents Although immunological adjuvants have traditionally been viewed as substances that aid the immune response to the antigen, adjuvants have also evolved as substances that can aid in stabilizing formulations of antigens, especially for vaccines administered for animal health. Types * Analgesic adjuvants * Inorganic compounds: alum, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, calcium phosphate hydroxide * Mineral oil: paraffin oil * Bacterial products: killed bacteria Bordetella pertussis, Mycobacterium bovis, toxoids * Nonbacterial organics: squalene * Delivery systems: detergents (Quil A) * Plant saponins from Quillaja (See Quillaia), soybean, Polygala senega * Cytokines: IL-1, IL-2, IL-12 * Combination: Freund's complete adjuvant, Freund's incomplete adjuvant * Food-based oil: Adjuvant 65, which is a product based on peanut oil. Adjuvant 65 was tested in influenza vaccines in the 1970s, but was never released commercially. Mechanism of immune stimulation Adjuvants can enhance the immune response to the antigen in different ways: * Extend the presence of antigen in the blood * Help the antigen presenting cells absorb antigen * Activate macrophages and lymphocytes * Support the production of cytokines Alum as an adjuvant Alum was the first aluminium salt used as an adjuvant, but has been almost completely replaced by aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate for commercial vaccines. Adverse effects Adjuvants may make vaccines too reactogenic, which often leads to fever. This is often an expected outcome upon vaccination and is usually controlled in infants by over-the-counter medication if necessary. An increased number of narcolepsy (a chronic sleep disorder) cases in children and adolescents was observed in Scandinavian and other European countries after vaccinations to address the H1N1 \\"swine flu\\" pandemic in 2009. Narcolepsy has previously been associated with HLA-subtype DQB1*602, which has led to the prediction that it is an autoimmune process. After a series of epidemiological investigations, researchers found that the higher incidence correlated with the use of AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Pandemrix). Those vaccinated with Pandemrix have almost a 12 times higher risk of developing the disease. The adjuvant of the vaccine contained vitamin E that was no more than a day's normal dietary intake. Vitamin E increases hypocretin-specific fragments that bind to DQB1*602 in cell culture experiments, leading to the hypothesis that autoimmunity may arise in genetically susceptible individuals, but there is no clinical data to support this hypothesis.

A rotary snowplow is a piece of railroad snow removal equipment with a large circular set of blades on its front end that rotate to cut through the snow on the track ahead of it. The precursor to the rotary snowplow was the wedge snowplow. History The rotary was invented in Toronto, Canada, by dentist J.W. Elliot in 1869. He never built a working model or prototype, although he wanted to. Orange Jull of Orangeville, Ontario, expanded on Elliot's design, building working models he tested with sand. During the winter of 1883‚Äì1884, Jull contracted with the Leslie Brothers of Toronto to build a full-size prototype that proved successful. Jull later sold his design rights to Leslie Brothers, who formed the Rotary Steam Shovel Manufacturing Company in Paterson, New Jersey. Leslie Brothers contracted with Cooke Locomotive & Machine Works in Paterson to do the actual construction.\\"The Leslie Brothers and Their Giant Snowblower\\" author Paul Swanson, January 1987 Trains Magazine Another inventor is said to be Col. Lewis P. Campbell. He is listed in US patent 1848554 (filed in 1929). Operation Wedge snowplows were the traditional mechanized method of clearing snow from railroad tracks. These pushed snow off the tracks, deflecting it to the side. Deeper drifts cannot easily be cleared by this method; there is simply too much snow to be moved. For this purpose, the rotary snowplow was devised. A rotary snowplow at work in New Ulm, Minnesota. Operational rotary snowplow Xrotd 9213 of Rhaetian Railway Rotary plows are often deployed when snow is too deep or hard-packed for traditional plows. The ability to operate slowly, as there is no requirement for train momentum to break up the snow, is often an advantage in mountainous regions, where a high speed derailment could be disastrous. Many rotary plows are not self- propelled, so one or more locomotives are coupled behind it to push the plow along the line. An engine within the plow's carbody rotates the large circular assembly at the front of the plow. The blades on this wheel cut through the snow and force it through a channel just behind the disk to an output chute above the blade assembly. The chute can be adjusted to throw the snow to either the left or the right side of the tracks. An operator sits in a cab just above and behind the blade assembly to control the speed of the blades and the direction of output from the chute. With the increasing prevalence of diesel locomotives, multiple-unit train controls have been added to the cabs, so that the pushing locomotives can be controlled from the plow. In areas of particularly deep snowfall, such as California's Donner Pass, railroads sometimes created a train consisting of a rotary snowplow at each end, with the blade ends pointing away from each other, and two or three locomotives coupled between them. With a plow on each end, the train was able to return to its starting location even if the snow covered the tracks it had just passed over. Such a train would also be able to clear multiple track mainlines efficiently as it could make a pass in one direction on one track, then reverse direction and clear the next track. This practice became standard for the Southern Pacific Railroad on Donner Pass following the January 1952 stranding of the City of San Francisco train; during attempts to clear the avalanches that had trapped the train, two rotary plows were themselves trapped by avalanches, and the crew of a third was killed when their plow was hit by an avalanche. Rotary snowplows are expensive due to their high maintenance costs, which the railroad incurs regardless of whether they are needed in a given year. As a result, most railroads have eliminated their rotaries, preferring to use a variety of types of fixed-blade plows that have significantly lower maintenance costs, in conjunction with bulldozers, which can be used year-round on maintenance-of-way projects. In addition, because rotaries leave an open-cut in the snowbank that fixed-blade plows cannot push snow past, once rotaries have been used, they must be used for all further significant snowfalls until the snowbank has melted. Since rotaries, which need some form of fuel to power the blades, also cost more to operate than fixed-blade plows, they are now generally considered to be a tool of last resort for the railroads that own them. The few remaining rotary plows in North America are either owned by museum railroads, or are kept in reserve for areas with poor road access and routine severe snowfall conditions. The largest remaining fleet of rotaries consists of Union Pacific Railroad's six ex-Southern Pacific plows reserved for Donner Pass. Japan sees widespread use of rotary snowplows in its many mountain passes.  Power  Early rotaries had steam engines inside their car bodies to power the blades; a few are still in working order, and in particular one on the White Pass & Yukon Route in Alaska performs annual demonstration runs through thick snow for the benefit of photographers and railway enthusiasts. Rotaries of newer construction are either diesel- or electric-powered. Many steam plows were converted to electricity. Some electric plows can take their power from a locomotive, while others are semi-permanently coupled to power units, generally old locomotives with their traction motors removed; these are colloquially called \\"snails.\\" (This is derived from the fact that engineless but motored units that take their power from another locomotive are \\"slugs\\"; thus the opposite, with engine but no motors, is a \\"snail.\\") Hall of Fame induction In 2001, the rotary snowplow was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame.Rotary Snowplow North America Railway Hall of Fame. The hall of fame recognizes and establishes an enduring tribute to the people and things that have made significant contribution relating to railway industry in North America.

It originated as \\"carnival\\" in Mikhail Bakhtin's Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics and was further developed in Rabelais and His World. For Bakhtin, \\"carnival\\" (the totality of popular festivities, rituals and other carnival forms) is deeply rooted in the human psyche on both the collective and individual level. Though historically complex and varied, it has over time worked out \\"an entire language of symbolic concretely sensuous forms\\" which express a unified \\"carnival sense of the world, permeating all its forms\\". This language, Bakhtin argues, cannot be adequately verbalized or translated into abstract concepts, but it is amenable to a transposition into an artistic language that resonates with its essential qualities: it can, in other words, be \\"transposed into the language of literature\\". Bakhtin calls this transposition the carnivalization of literature. Although he considers a number of literary forms and individual writers, it is Francois Rabelais, the French Renaissance author of Gargantua and Pantagruel, and the 19th century Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky, that he considers the primary exemplars of carnivalization in literature. The carnival sense of the world Bakhtin's four categories of the carnival sense of the world: # Familiar and free interaction between people: carnival often brought the unlikeliest of people together and encouraged the interaction and free expression of themselves in unity. # Eccentric behaviour: unacceptable behaviour is welcomed and accepted in carnival, and one's natural behaviour can be revealed without consequences. # Carnivalistic m√©salliances: the familiar and free format of carnival allows everything that may normally be separated to reunite ‚Äî Heaven and Hell, the young and the old, etc. # Profanation: in carnival, the strict rules of piety and respect for official notions of the 'sacred' are stripped of their power ‚Äî blasphemy, obscenity, debasings, 'bringings down to earth', celebration rather than condemnation of the earthly and body-based. The primary act of carnival is the mock crowning and subsequent de-crowning of a carnival king. It is a \\"dualistic ambivalent ritual\\" that typifies the inside-out world of carnival and the \\"joyful relativity of all structure and order\\".Bakhtin (1984). p. 124 The act sanctifies ambivalence toward that which is normally considered absolute, single, monolithic. Carnivalistic symbols always include their opposite within themselves: \\"Birth is fraught with death, and death with new birth.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 125 The crowning implies the de-crowning, and the de-crowning implies a new crowning. It is thus the process of change itself that is celebrated, not that which is changed. The carnival sense of the world \\"is opposed to that one-sided and gloomy official seriousness which is dogmatic and hostile to evolution and change, which seeks to absolutize a given condition of existence or a given social order.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 160 This is not to say that liberation from all authority and sacred symbols was desirable as an ideology. Because participation in Carnival extracts all individuals from non-carnival life, nihilistic and individualistic ideologies are just as impotent and just as subject to the radical humour of carnival as any form of official seriousness. The spirit of carnival grows out of a \\"culture of laughter\\". Because it is based in the physiological realities of the lower bodily stratum (birth, death, renewal, sexuality, ingestion, evacuation etc.), it is inherently anti-elitist: its objects and functions are necessarily common to all humans‚Äî\\"identical, involuntary and non-negotiable\\". Bakhtin argues that we should not compare the \\"narrow theatrical pageantry\\" and \\"vulgar Bohemian understanding of carnival\\" characteristic of modern times with his Medieval Carnival. Carnival was a powerful creative event, not merely a spectacle. Bakhtin suggests that the separation of participants and spectators has been detrimental to the potency of Carnival. Its power lay in there being no \\"outside\\": everyone participated, and everyone was subject to its lived transcendence of social and individual norms: \\"carnival travesties: it crowns and uncrowns, inverts rank, exchanges roles, makes sense from nonsense and nonsense of sense.\\" The carnivalization of literature Bakhtin's term the carnivalization of literature (which Morson and Emerson point out could also be called \\"the literization of carnival\\") refers to the transposition of the essential qualities of the carnival sense of the world into a literary language and a literary genre. The seriocomic genres The ancient seriocomic genres initiated the \\"carnivalistic line\\" in Western literature. Of these, the most significant were Socratic dialogue and Menippean satire. According to Bakhtin, the seriocomic genres always began with \\"the living present\\". Everything took place \\"in a zone of immediate and even crudely familiar contact with living contemporaries.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 108 Unlike the \\"serious\\" genres (tragedy, epic, high rhetoric, lyric poetry), the seriocomic genres did not rely on legend or long-held tribal belief and custom for their legitimacy. Instead they consciously relied on experience and free invention, often manifesting a critical and even cynical attitude toward conventional subjects and forms. They eschewed the single-voiced, single- styled nature of the serious genres, and intentionally cultivated heterogeneity of voice and style. Characteristic of these genres are \\"multi- toned narration, the mixing of high and low, serious and comic; the use of inserted genres ‚Äì letters, found manuscripts, retold dialogues, parodies on the high genres... a mixing of prosaic and poetic speech, living dialects and jargons...\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 108 Thus in the ancient seriocomic genres, language was not merely that which represents, but itself became an object of representation.Morson and Emerson (1990). p.461 Socratic dialogue Originally a kind of memoir genre consisting of recollections of actual conversations conducted by Socrates, the Socratic dialogue became, in the hands of Plato, Xenophon and others, a freely creative form bound only by the Socratic method of dialogically revealing the truth.Bakhtin (1984). p. 109 Bakhtin lists five aspects of the genre that link it to carnivalization: (1) The Socratic notion of the dialogic nature of truth and human thought, posited in opposition to \\"official monologism, which pretends to possess a ready-made truth\\" (Bakhtin notes that this is a formal quality only, and that in the hands of a dogmatic school or religious doctrine the dialogue can be transformed into merely another method for expounding a ready-made truth); (2) Syncrisis, the juxtaposition of differing perspectives on an object, and anacrisis, the elicitation or provocation of a full verbal expression of the interlocutor's opinion and its underlying assumptions; (3) The protagonist is always an ideologist and the interlocutors are made into ideologists, thus provoking the event of the testing of truth; (4) a tendency to create the extraordinary situation (e.g. Socrates on the threshold of an impending death sentence in The Apology), which forces a deeper exposition through the loosening of the bonds of convention and habit; (5) It introduces, in embryonic form, the concept of the image of an idea (which will later attain full expression in Dostoevsky): \\"the idea is organically combined with the image of a person... The dialogic testing of the idea is simultaneously also the testing of the person who represents it\\".Bakhtin (1984). pp. 110‚Äì12 Menippean satire The tradition known as Menippean satire began in ancient Greece with Antisthenes, an author of Socratic dialogues, and the Cynic satirist Menippus, although it first became recognized as a genre through the first century B.C. Roman scholar Varro. According to Bakhtin, the roots of the genre \\"reach directly back into carnivalized folklore, whose decisive influence is here even more significant than it is in the Socratic dialogue.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 112 Its characteristics include intensified comicality, freedom from established constraints, bold use of fantastic situations for the testing of truth, abrupt changes, inserted genres and multi-tonality, parodies, oxymorons, scandal scenes, inappropriate behaviour, and a sharp satirical focus on contemporary ideas and issues.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 490‚Äì91Bakhtin (1984). pp. 114‚Äì120 Despite the apparent heterogeneity of these elements, Bakhtin emphasizes the internal integrity of the genre and its thorough grounding in a carnival sense of the world. He notes its unparalleled capacity for reflecting the social and philosophical ethos of its historical setting ‚Äì principally the epoch of the decline of national legend, which brought with it the gradual dissolution of long- established ethical norms and a concomitant rise in free interaction and argumentation over all manner of \\"ultimate questions\\".Bakhtin (1984). p 119 The internal dialogical freedom of the genre is coupled with an equally free external capacity for the absorption of other genres, for example the diatribe, the soliloquy and the symposium. Dostoevsky and polyphony The tradition of Menippean satire reached its summit in the nineteenth century, according to Bakhtin, in the work of Dostoevsky. Menippean satire was the fertile ground on which Dostoevsky was able to grow his entirely new carnivalized genre‚Äîthe polyphonic novel. According to Bakhtin, Dostoevsky was familiar with works by Lucian (such as Dialogues of the Dead and Menippus, or The Descent Into Hades), Seneca (Apocolocyntosis), Petronius (The Satyricon), Apuleius (The Golden Ass), and possibly also the satires of Varro.Bakhtin (1984). p. 143, 179 He was also probably influenced by modern European manifestations of the genre in authors such as Goethe, F√©nelon, Diderot and Voltaire. Bakhtin observes that although Dostoevsky may not have consciously recognized his place as the heir of the tradition, he undoubtedly instinctively adopted many of its carnivalistic forms, as well as its liberated approach to the use of those forms, and adapted them to his own artistic purposes. The dialogic sense of truth, the device of the extraordinary situation, the unencumbered frankness of speech, the clash of extreme positions and embodied ideas over ultimate questions, the technique of anacrisis, \\"threshold\\" dialogues in extreme or fantastic situations: present in Menippean satire, these qualities are given a new and more profound life in Dostoevsky's polyphonic novel.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 465 In this \\"carnival space and time\\", a reality beyond the quotidian fog of convention and habit comes to life, allowing a special type of \\"purely human\\" dialogue to occur. In polyphony, character voices are liberated from the finalizing and monologizing influence of authorial control, much like the participants in carnival revel in the temporary dissolution of authoritarian social definitions and \\"ready-made\\" truths, and a new dialogical truth emerges in the play of difference: a \\"plurality of consciousnesses, with equal rights and each with its own world, combine but are not merged in the unity of the event.\\"Bakhtin (1984). pp. 6‚Äì7 See also *Grotesque body *Dialogue (Bakhtin) Notes Bibliography   Category:Literary genres Category:Literary concepts ","title":"Carnivalesque"},{"id":"1105105","text":"Flight Commander Miles Jeffery Game Day , (1 December 1896 ‚Äì 27 February 1918) was a World War I flying ace credited with five aerial victories, and also a war poet.

He was educated at Sandroyd and Repton Schools.Day (1919), p.7. Military career Day joined the Royal Navy as a probationary flight sub- lieutenant, and was confirmed in the rank of flight sub-lieutenant on 21 August 1915. He received the Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1949 after flying a Caudron biplane at the Royal Naval Flying School, Eastchurch, on 2 October 1915. He was first stationed aboard the seaplane carrier , part of the Harwich Force, where he gained a reputation as a skilled and daring flyer,Day (1919), p.16. and was promoted to flight lieutenant on 31 December 1916. Day chafed at the lack of activity at Harwich, and gained a transfer to the light cruiser .Day (1919), p.18. Following her grounding in August 1917, he was posted to the experimental air station at RNAS Kingsnorth on the Isle of Grain.Day (1919), p.19. Day was already an experienced pilot when he joined No. 13 Squadron RNAS, based at Dunkirk, on 19 December 1917. Between 3 January and 19 February 1918 he scored five victories while flying a Sopwith Camel. On 27 February, he was shot down in flames into the sea about 25 miles west of Dunkirk by a German seaplane. According to his commanding officer's report: :\\"...He was shot down by six German aircraft which he attacked single-handed, out to sea. He had out-distanced his flight, I think because he wished to break the [enemy's] formation, in order to make it easier for the less experienced people behind him to attack. He hit the enemy and they hit his machine, which burst into flames; but, not a bit flurried, he nose-dived, flattened out, and landed perfectly on the water. He climbed out of his machine and waved his fellow-pilots back to their base; being in aeroplanes [not sea-planes] they could not assist him.\\"Day (1919), p.8. A search was immediately launched, but no trace of him was found. Having no known grave, he is commemorated on the Chatham Naval Memorial, Kent, England. Honours and awards ;Distinguished Service Cross :Flight Lieutenant (acting Flight Commander) Miles Jeffrey Game Day, RNAS (since killed). :For great skill and bravery as a fighting pilot. On 25 January he attacked, single-handed, six enemy triplanes, one of which he shot down. On 2 February 1918 he attacked and destroyed an enemy two-seater machine on reconnaissance at 18,000 feet. He destroyed several enemy machines in a short space of time, and, in addition, had numerous indecisive engagements. Poetry Day began writing poetry during his spare time, initially humorous verses for his fellow officers in the style of W. S. Gilbert,Day (1919), p.14. but later, inspired by Rupert Brooke's The Old Vicarage, Grantchester, he began to compose longer serious poems. Only three of these; \\"On the Wings of the Morning\\", \\"An Airman's Dream\\" and part of \\"To My Brother\\", were published in his lifetime, the first in Cornhill, and the other two in The Spectator.Day (1919), p.63. \\"To My Brother\\" was inspired by the death of his older brother Dennis Ivor Day, who was serving as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery when he was shot by a sniper at Vermelles on 25 September 1915, finally dying from the injury on 7 October. Day's collected poems were published post-war, and two of his poems were anthologized in A Treasury of War Poetry, British and American Poems of the World War, 1914-1919, edited by George Herbert Clarke, and also in Cambridge Poets 1914-1920: an Anthology, compiled by Edward Davison, published in 1920.

From its source on Dartmoor it flows in a generally southerly direction past some of the best-preserved archaeological remains on the moor. It leaves the moor at the town of Ivybridge and continues southward, passing the settlements of Ermington, Modbury and Holbeton. Near Holbeton it becomes a ria and empties into the English Channel in Bigbury Bay, between the rivers Yealm and Avon. Toponymy The Ravenna Cosmography, an imperfect list of place-names that was compiled in the early 8th century from late Roman sources, lists amongst many others, over twenty names that probably refer to places in south-west England. Most of these have not been positively identified, but the name Aramis/Aranus/Armis was suggested to be the River Erme by Rivet and Smith in The Place-names of Roman Britain (1979). The first certain documentary reference to the river is as Irym in the cartulary of Buckfast Abbey, dated 1240. Other early recorded forms are Hyrm, Irm, Erm and, in the mid 16th century, Arme. The derivation of the name remains unknown. Ekwall's suggestion that it is a back-formation from Ermington is now thought to be unlikely. Tristram Risdon, in his 1811 Survey of Devon gives an alternate name for the River Erme as the River Arme. He also refers to the mouth of the River Erme as Armouth.Risdon T (1811), The Chorographical Description or Survey of the County of Devon In Donn's map of Devon published in 1765, the village of Mothecombe at the mouth of the river, is referred to as Muddicomb.Donn, Benjamin; A map of the County of Devon The river just below Erme Pits On Dartmoor The River Erme rises near the centre of southern Dartmoor on the Abbot's Way less than a mile to the south of the source of the River Plym. Between these two sources lies Duck's Pool, where there is a plaque and letterbox in memory of the Dartmoor author William Crossing. There are extensive early tin mining workings nearby known as Erme Pits, which are in places over 15 metres deep. For the first mile or so the river flows south- eastwards. It is joined on the north bank by Wollake, which is the lower part of the Blacklane Brook that rises on the southern flanks of Fox Tor a mile and a half to the north, between Crane Hill and Naker's Hill. The short streams, Dry Lake and Red Lake also join on this side, the latter rising near the disused clay works at Redlake. The confluence of Red Lake, and the source of the Erme are two of the thirty-three places that delineate the ancient boundary of the Forest of Dartmoor. On this stretch, a short stream flowing down Hortonsford Bottom from Langcombe Hill also joins the river from the south. Between Stingers Hill and Redlake the river turns southward into an area known as The Meadow, where it is crossed by the Upper Erme stone row, the longest on Dartmoor at .Butler 1993, pp.74‚Äì7. For the next mile or more downstream from here there are extensive archaeological remains on the river's banks, most notably Erme Pound (the highest and largest Bronze Age enclosure in the area),Butler 1993, pp.73‚Äì4. Downing's House (a well-preserved \\"tinner's cache\\" or \\"beehive hut\\" with much of its roof preserved),Butler 1993, pp.65‚Äì6. and a number of tinner's huts and blowing houses. The river leaving its gorge with part of Piles Copse on the left As the river reaches the edge of the high moor, it flows through the gorge it has cut between Stalldown Barrow on the west and Piles Hill to the east. Here, on the eastern bank, lies Piles Copse which is one of the few areas of ancient woodland on Dartmoor and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Although the moorland valley of the Erme today appears to be natural and unspoiled, the entire valley floor from its source down to Piles Copse is artificial, being created by the extensive tin- streaming operations that took place between the 4th and 14th centuries. Supporting evidence for this was provided by a study published in 2004 which showed that phases of aggradation occurred lower down the valley between the 4th century and the 7th century, and in the 13th century. Leaving the open moor, the river passes into enclosed land and under its first road bridge at the hamlet of Harford. At this point it is joined by the minor stream of Butter Brook, with its now disused reservoir. From Harford down to the boundary of the national park, which here follows the main railway line between Plymouth and Exeter, much of the river's course is in woodland and is a popular site for kayaking and canoeing, especially in Long Timber Woods. Ivybridge to Holbeton After leaving the national park, the river continues southward, passing through the centre of the town of Ivybridge where it formed the source of the town's prosperity by powering a grist mill, a paper mill and a fulling and tucking mill. In 1813 the only bridge over the river in the village (as it was then) was the inspiration for J. M. W. Turner's painting The Ivy Bridge. Immediately south of Ivybridge, the river passes beneath the Devon Expressway ‚Äì the main road link between Exeter and Plymouth ‚Äì and then continues to flow southerly through countryside. On its western bank is the village of Ermington with its famous crooked church spire and the Grade I listed Flete House, the river has been measured near the village since 1973, yielding an average flow of . The A379 road between Modbury and Yealmpton crosses the river at Sequer's Bridge, shortly below which the river flows over a weir and becomes tidal. Surrounding this stretch of the river there are several apple orchards, remnants of the many that were once here. Unlike most of the South Hams where the field boundaries consist of Devon hedge banks, hereabouts the boundaries are walls constructed from rounded river boulders, more like the dry stone walls found on Dartmoor. Looking up the estuary at high tide... ... and at low tide The estuary As it passes to the east of the village of Holbeton the Erme becomes a ria with extensive areas of salt marsh and mud that are uncovered at low tide. The geology of the area is mostly slate from the Devonian period. The river enters the English Channel near the villages of Kingston to the east and Mothecombe and Holbeton to the west and at the mouth of the estuary lie the beaches of Wonwell and Mothecombe. The estuary is surrounded by the 5,000 acre Flete Estate. History In 1991 and 1992 some 42 tin ingots were found in the mouth of the estuary on the north side of the West Mary Reef. These date from between 500 BC and 600 AD. Tin mining was in existence on Dartmoor from an early date. Dartmoor tin-mining would have been a major part of the South Devon economy throughout its history. There is an Iron Age hill fort at Holbury near Holbeton overlooking the estuary from the west and evidence of a very early 11th Century fort and settlement just a little way inland at Oldaport. In the 1950s and again in the 1990s a variety of fragments of \\"Dark Ages\\" and Roman pots were discovered on Mothecombe beach There are four ruined lime kilns in the estuary; all are in an advanced state of disrepair. Limestone came by sea from Plymouth quarries. Coal arrived on the beach from South Wales and was unloaded to horse-drawn carts. Some was stored in a shed at the top of the Mothecombe slip, but some was loaded into a small barge to move further up the estuary as far as Efford. From Clyng Corn Mill (now a private house to Orcheton Quay) there used to be a canal which has long since silted up and is now just a small stream. This canal brought goods to and from Modbury and beyond. \\"Runaway Lane\\" was the main link between Orcheton Quay and Modbury. The 1809 Ordnance Survey map shows the canal very clearly. There was a fishing community on Wonwell beach for many years but the houses are now in ruins and overgrown. Professional fishermen worked the beach until the 1960s.River Erme, a journey through time; Alec Rogers, 1999 The main catch was lobster and crab. These were boiled on the beach and carried to the village of Kingston on donkeys. The withies which were used to make the pots and panniers were grown in willow plats (areas of pollarded willow) in the area.The architectural heritage of Kingsbridge & District; Then & How; Petter, Helen Mary and Chitty, Anthony; Published by Dartington Amenity Research Trust for South Hams Society; pre 1977 Many ships have been lost in the area over the centuries.McDonald K, (2002) (Third Edition) Shipwrecks of the South Hams, Wreckwalker Books, Thurlestone The Salcombe Cannon Wreck of the 1630s is a notable site. A large cast iron Swedish gun dating to 1690‚Äì1720 has been found in the estuary. On 15 December 1793, went aground on the jagged East Mary rocks, which together with the West Mary Rocks form a mostly submerged bar to the estuary. At the court martial, the vessel's pilot stated that he believed that he was entering Plymouth Sound, some 14 miles west. Smuggling Smuggling activity took place in the estuary. Initially the coast was patrolled by the Riding Officers of the Preventive, supplanted by the coastguards: on the Mothecombe side are the original Coastguard Cottages - just above Coastguard Beach. \\"Customs Ports\\" were first set out in 1558 as administrative areas. In 1786 when every part of the coastline came under the jurisdiction of the local \\"Customs Port\\", the Plymouth jurisdiction extended as far east as Challaborough and therefore covered the estuary. Records showHolbeton Memories, Leonard W Williams, Penwill Ltd 1994 that the Coastguard Station existed at Mothecombe in 1822 with 5 Boatmen and an Officer. In 1870 the Chief Officer of Coastal Guard at Mothecombe was Robert S Matson.Morris and Co.'s Commercial Directory and Gazetteer. 1870 By 1881 the River Erme was included in the Dartmouth \\"Customs Port\\".Various, The New Maritime History of Devon - Volume 2, 1994, Conway Maritime Press Coastguards were also based in the village of Kingston. The next station going east was at Charlaborough (Ringmore) - now called Challaborough. World War II Persier was hit by a torpedo near to the Eddystone Lighthouse in 1945 and her wreck is just outside the estuary. In 1940 a detachment of Indian troops were stationed at Woodleigh and there is a remembrance of these troops and their mules delivering barbed wire to Mothecombe for the coastal defences.. There was a memory of a dog setting off mines on the estuary recorded in a publication produced by the Kingston History Society.Various (1987) Kingston Remembered A platoon of the 5th Buffs Regiment was stationed on Wonwell Beach; some in a Nissen Hut and some in one of the old cottages. One soldier was stationed at the phone box in Kingston to take messages to the beach. There was a mine field at the high-water mark which was fenced on the landward side. Mothecombe Beach had a similar minefield. One of the mines on Wonwell was set off by a missing dog after the platoon at Wonwell had been withdrawn (as the beach was covered from Mothecombe). Others became unstable and also exploded. The 1919 and 1947 Ordnance Survey maps show a \\"rifle range\\" stretching up the estuary from Owen's Point to Pamflete‚Äîthis may have been related to war time activity. Film locations Filming took part for some of the Hornblower TV series on the Wonwell slip, Wonwell Beach and Mothecombe Beach. International Velvet (1978) has an opening scene across the sands. In 1985 Scobbiscombe Farm, which is above and just to the east of the estuary, was used as a location for the film Revolution which concerned the American War of Independence. The cast included Al Pacino, Donald Sutherland and a whole host of cut out British Red Coats, one of whom found a new home in a local greenhouse for a while.Walk the South Hams Coast, Salcombe to Plymouth Chips Barber, Obelisk Publications 2001 Sense and Sensibility (1995) was shot at various locations on the estuary including Efford House (country home of the \\"Dashwoods\\"), Mothecombe House and Mothecombe Beach. Rebecca (1996) was filmed at Mothecombe. Today The estuary is now designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and an Erme Estuary Management Plan has been produced. The South West Coast Path crosses between the slipways on the Wonwell (eastern) and Mothecombe (western) sides of the estuary, but crossing is only possible at low tide - and even then walkers are very likely to get their knees wet. The alternative route by road is some 9 miles around the estuary. The 1947 Ordnance Survey map show this as a vehicular fordOrdnance Survey Sheet 20/64 Scale 1:25,000 1947 between the slipways. There is another ford marked on the 1947 map between Saltercrease and Efford, but this is now said to be too deep to cross. Looking across the mouth of the estuary towards Meadowsfoot Beach Flora and fauna Little egrets are now year-round residents. Curlews, oystercatchers and common shelducks are all regular visitors and kingfishers are often seen above Holbeton. Weaverfish bury themselves in the gravel in the low water. Beaches Mothecombe Beach (also called Meadowsfoot Beach) is only open on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. The building on the south side of the beach was a private tea room built in 1873-1875 by Mr H Mildmay for use during private picnics. It is built on the foundations of an early lime kiln. Other private tea houses were built elsewhere on the Flete estate. A little further to the south there is a small circular stone wall which fills with water as the tide comes in. This used to be a swimming pool, but no longer functions as such. A little further on is a WW2 pillbox. Coastguards Beach and Wonwell Beach are open every day. Coastguards Beach also has a pillbox although it is now almost covered by undergrowth, and the remains of yet another lie a little south of Coastguards beach, but this has been damaged by the sea.

Development studies is offered as a specialized master's degree in a number of reputed universities across the world, such as the Balsillie School of International Affairs, Graduate Institute Geneva, SOAS London, and University of Warwick, and less commonly, as an undergraduate degree, such as at the University of Toronto. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in developing countries and countries with a colonial history, such as the UK, where the discipline originated.Kothari, U. (ed), A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and Ideologies ‚Äì but see The Journal of Peasant Studies 34/1 (2007) for an alternative view. Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the United Nations, World Bank, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), media and journalism houses, private sector development consultancy firms, corporate social responsibility (CSR) bodies and research centers. Professional bodies Throughout the world, a number of professional bodies for development studies have been founded:About ICCDA * Europe: European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI) * Latin America: Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO) * Asia: Asian Political and International Studies Association (APISA) * Africa: Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) and Organization for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA) * Arabic world: Arab Institutes and Centers for Economic and Social Development Research (AICARDES) The common umbrella organisation of these association is the Inter-regional Coordinating Committee of Development Associations (ICCDA). In the UK and Ireland, the Development Studies Association is a major source of information for research on and studying in development studies. Its mission is to connect and promote those working on development research. Disciplines of development studies Development issues include: * Area studies * Anthropology * Community development * Demography * Development communication * Development theory * Diaspora studies * Ecology * Economic development * Economic History * Engineering * Environmental studies * Geography * Gender studies * Governance * Human rights * Queer studies * Human security * Indigenous rights * Industrial relations * Industrialization * International development * International relations * Journalism * Media Studies * Migration studies * Partnership * Peace and conflict studies * Pedagogy * Political philosophy * Population studies * Postcolonialism * Public administration * Public health * Rural development * Sociology * Social policy * Social development * Social work * Sustainable development * Urban studies * Women's studies History The emergence of development studies as an academic discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is in large part due to increasing concern about economic prospects for the third world after decolonisation. In the immediate post-war period, development economics, a branch of economics, arose out of previous studies in colonial economics. By the 1960s, an increasing number of development economists felt that economics alone could not fully address issues such as political effectiveness and educational provision.Kothari, U. (ed), A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and Ideologies Development studies arose as a result of this, initially aiming to integrate ideas of politics and economics. Since then, it has become an increasingly inter- and multi- disciplinary subject, encompassing a variety of social scientific fields.Abbott, Lewis F. (2003) Theories of Industrial Modernization and Enterprise Development: A Review. ISR/Google Books, Second revised edition In recent years the use of political economy analysis- the application of the analytical techniques of economics- to try and assess and explain political and social factors that either enhance or limit development has become increasingly widespread as a way of explaining the success or failure of reform processes. The era of modern development is commonly deemed to have commenced with the inauguration speech of Harry S. Truman in 1949.Rist, G., The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith In Point Four of his speech, with reference to Latin America and other poor nations, he said: > More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching > misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their > economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a > threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in > history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the > suffering of these people. But development studies has since also taken an interest in lessons of past development experiences of Western countries. More recently, the emergence of human security ‚Äì a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats ‚Äì has led to a growing recognition of a relationship between security and development. Human security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies.

Undead subculture, Duke University Press, 2007, , p. 47 In stark contrast to the original industrial culture, whose performers and heterogeneous audience were sometimes referred to as \\"industrialists\\", the rivethead scene is a coherent youth culture closely linked to a discernible fashion style. The scene emerged in the late 1980sSteele, Valerie (2008). Gothic: Dark Glamour. Yale University Press. p. 48. on the basis of electro-industrial, EBM, and industrial rock music. The associated dress style draws on military fashion and punk aestheticsLauren M. E. Goodlad, Michael Bibby: Goth. Undead subculture, Duke University Press, 2007, , p. 69 with hints of fetish wear, mainly inspired by the scene's musical protagonists.  Origins of the term  Initially, the term rivethead had been used since the 1940s as a nickname for North American automotive assembly line and steel construction workersKate Stevens: Freak Nation: A Field Guide to 101 of the most odd, extreme, and outrageous American subcultures, Adams Media, November 2010, , p. 108 and hit the mainstream through the publication of Ben Hamper's Rivethead: Tales From the Assembly Line, which is otherwise unrelated to the subculture. Glenn Chase, founder of San Diego label Re-Constriction Records, is responsible for the term's meaning in the 1990s. In 1993, he released Rivet Head Culture, a compilation that contains several electro-industrial and industrial rock acts from the American underground music scene. In the same year, industrial rock group Chemlab ‚àí whose members were close friends of Chase ‚àí had released their debut album Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar,Chemlab: Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar @ Discogs.com which includes a track called \\"Rivet Head\\". Chemlab singer Jared Louche said he did not remember where the term came from, although he stated that this song title was in his mind for years.  Music  The rivethead scene is remotely related but not directly connected to the industrial music culture. Industrial music is a genre of experimental and avantgardist music, intertwined with graphical visualization (mostly with disturbing graphical content). The absence of conventional song structures, such as rhythm and melody, is a main characteristic of the genre, whereas the music preferred by the rivethead scene includes several danceable and song-oriented styles that are sometimes considered \\"post-industrial\\".Partridge, Christopher; Moberg, Marcus: Industrial, Post-industrial and Neofolk music, The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music, Bloomsbury Academic 2017, , p. 206 \\"From the early 1980s onwards industrial music as represented by Throbbing Gristle influenced and was fused with other musical styles, resulting in what can be termed 'post-industrial styles'.\\" Like post-punk, the term post- industrial describes a musical genre that developed distinctly from its roots and turned into several strands of sound, namely electro-industrial, electronic body music, and industrial rock, often referred to as industrial dance music. Those styles differ from traditional industrial music regarding aesthetics, sound, and production techniques.Reed, Alexander: Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music, Oxford University Press, 2013, , p. 161  Aesthetics  The rivethead dress style has been inspired by military aesthetics, complemented by fashion \\"that mimics the grit and grime of industrial sectors in major metropolitan areas\\".The Fashion and Culture of the Industrial Music Scene Additionally, it borrows elements of punk fashion, such as a fanned and dyed Mohawk hairstyle, and fetish wear such as black leather and PVC tops, pants and shorts (primarily worn by females), partly supplemented with modern primitive body modifications such as tattoos and piercings. Occasionally, rivetheads emphasize a post-apocalyptic, dystopian influence, often inspired by movies, e.g. Mad Max (1979), Escape from New York (1981), Gunhed (1989), Death Machine (1994), and Strange Days (1995). Several movies, such as Hardware (1990), Strange Days and Johnny Mnemonic (1995), feature music tracks by Ministry, KMFDM, Diatribe, Stabbing Westward and other bands associated with the rivethead culture.Internet Movie Database (IMDb): Hardware / M.A.R.K. 13, OSTInternet Movie Database (IMDb): Strange Days, OSTInternet Movie Database (IMDb): Johnny Mnemonic, OST Other influences include sci-fi archetypes such as Lupus Yonderboy of the Panther Moderns and Razorgirl from the cyberpunk literature (characters from the Sprawl trilogy by William Gibson).

As a divergence from the extravagance of youth cultures such as New Romantic, goth, cyber, and steampunk, the idea is to make a statement with as few fashion components as possible. The rivethead look commonly is unadorned and epitomizes a direct reflection of the social environment (\\"street survival wear\\"Jonathan S. Epstein / David A. Locher: Youth Culture.

Sometimes long hair in combination with undercut or dreadlocks. * Accessories: Teashades and Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses. Battle Dress Uniform-style or military belts; bracelets and dog tags; fingerless leather gloves; sometimes jewelry that incorporates industrial elements such as nails, screws and cogs. Suspenders, or \\"braces\\", normally worn hanging off trousers or shorts. * Body modification: Primarily piercings and tattoos.  Female  Rivetgirls may dress along with the femme fatale look: sexuality as power. Common are fetish wear, such as black PVC and leather corsages, miniskirts, ankle-deep or knee-high stiletto heel boots; less makeup than Goths and 1980s New Wave fashion girls, who were also an influence on the late-1980s/early 1990s rivetgirl style (cf. fishnet tights, stilettos, Dr. Martens low boots). Often dyed hair (black, sometimes red or blonde) that is long, short, spiked, partially shaved (see Maria Azevedo of BatteryPhoto of Maria Azevedo (Battery) @ http://www.discogs.com; picture was taken in 1996/97 (COP International promotion picture) and Yone Dudas of Decoded FeedbackPhoto of Yone Dudas (Decoded Feedback); picture was taken in the mid-/late-1990s (Zoth Ommog promotion picture)) or dreadlocked (see Anna Christine of LuxtPhoto of Anna Christine (Luxt) @ http://www.discogs.com). On the other hand, the female rivethead fashion look may be and often is identical to the tough style of the male rivetheads (Tank Girl aesthetic; military wear such as tank tops, paratrooper pants and combat boots). Kim X, co-founder of California-based music label COP International, compared the female rivethead attitude to the Riot grrrl movement.Side-Line music magazine: Dossier. Diva X Machina, issue 1/1997, p. 45  Comparison with goth subculture  The rivethead scene of the 1980s and 1990s was different from the goth subculture in ideological and musical terms, as well as in their visual aesthetics.Liisa Ladouceur, Gary Pullin: Encyclopaedia Gothica, ECW Press, 2011, , p. 232f Confusion regarding the boundaries of those two youth cultures has heightened because of the late-1990s \\"multi-subcultural\\" cross-hybridization, which led people to incorrectly believe that rivetheads are an offshoot of the goth subculture.

The rivethead scene shows a provocative, insurgent as well as socio-critical approach. The Goth subculture is frequently devoid of any interest in ethical activism or political involvements.

The 5.6.7.8's first started performing as a quartet in Tokyo, and recruited guest performers during their Australian tour. They first officially became a trio in 1992, before touring Australia. The group made a brief appearance in the 2003 Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill Volume 1, where they were shown playing barefoot in an izakaya. In 2012, they appeared at the \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\" fest in St. Paul, MN alongside artists such as Ronnie Spector, The Muffs, Nikki Corvette and L'Assassins. Members The 5.6.7.8's formed when Sachiko and Yoshiko \\"Ronnie\\" Fujiyama, two sisters from Tokyo who both shared a passion for rock and roll, founded the band in 1986 with two other members. Originally, the line-up consisted of Yoshiko on vocals and guitar, Rico on second guitar, Yoshie on bass guitar and Sachiko on drums. After several line- up changes (including the bassist Yoshiko \\"Yama\\" Yamaguchi, who was the bassist featured in the Kill Bill movie), the band eventually became a trio after Rico's and Yoshie's departures. Yoshiko and Sachiko are still the main components in the band, and now Akiko Omo has rejoined the band as the bass guitarist (She originally joined the 5.6.7.8's in the early 1990s). Even though the group mostly sing their songs in Japanese, they do many covers of American rock and roll records from the 1950s to the 1980s. However, their official website and most of their fansites and fanclubs are in Japanese, as they have their biggest following in their home country. Yoshiko, who plays a Teisco guitar and sports a \\"Teenage Queen Delinquent\\" tattoo on her upper right arm, was initially the lead vocalist, but as the band performed more rock and roll songs originally performed by female groups, every member had equal parts in vocals and many songs are performed singing simultaneously. The 5.6.7.8's in the West The 5.6.7.8's became known in the West after their appearance in Kill Bill Vol. 1, in which they performed \\"I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield\\", \\"I'm Blue\\" (a cover of The Ikettes' song) and \\"Woo Hoo\\" in a Tokyo club, \\"The House Of Blue Leaves\\". On the Special Bonus Features of the Kill Bill Volume 1 DVD, one of the specials featured a live performance which shows the 5.6.7.8's singing \\"I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield\\" and \\"I'm Blue\\" during filming of the movie. The 5.6.7.8's song \\"The Barracuda\\" is featured in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift soundtrack. According to Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino, he discovered the music of the 5.6.7.8's after hearing it in an urban clothing store in Tokyo, hours before going to the airport. Tarantino asked if he could purchase the CD from the store, as he had no time to go to a music shop. When the shop assistant on duty refused, the manager was called. When Tarantino offered the manager double the retail price of the CD, he acquired it.Kill Bill Vol. 1 DVD Extras, Quentin Tarantino interview They also became renowned for the use of their cover of The Rock-A- Teens song, \\"Woo Hoo\\", in advertisements for Carling lager and Vonage VoIP service in 2004. The song reached No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart in 2004. The follow-up song was \\"I'm Blue\\"; it peaked at No. 71 on the same chart two months later.

The Super FX chip was designed by Argonaut Games, who also co-developed the 3D space rail shooter video game Star Fox with Nintendo to demonstrate the additional polygon rendering capabilities that the chip had introduced to the SNES. History The Super FX chip design team included engineers Ben Cheese, Rob Macaulay, and James Hakewill. While in development, the Super FX chip was codenamed \\"Super Mario FX\\" and \\"MARIO\\". \\"MARIO\\", a backronym for \\"Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation, & Input/Output\\", is printed on the face of the final production chip. Because of higher manufacturing costs and increased development time, few Super FX based games were made compared to the rest of the SNES library. Due to these increased costs, Super FX games often retailed at a higher MSRP compared to other SNES games. According to Argonaut Games founder Jez San, Argonaut had initially intended to develop the Super FX chip for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The team programmed a NES version of the first-person combat flight simulator Starglider, which Argonaut had developed for PC systems a few years earlier, and showed it to Nintendo in 1990. The prototype impressed the company, but they suggested that they develop games for the then-unreleased Super Famicom due to the NES's hardware which was becoming outdated in light of newer systems such as the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine. Shortly after the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show held in Chicago, Illinois, Argonaut ported the NES version of Starglider to the Super Famicom, a process which took roughly one week according to San. Function The Super FX chip is used to render 3D polygons and to assist the SNES in rendering advanced 2D effects. This custom- made RISC processor is typically programmed to act like a graphics accelerator chip that draws polygons to a frame buffer in the RAM that sits adjacent to it. The data in this frame buffer is periodically transferred to the main video memory inside of the console using DMA in order to show up on the television display. The first version of the chip, commonly referred to as simply \\"Super FX\\", is clocked with a 21.4 MHz signal, but an internal clock speed divider halves it to 10.7 MHz. Later on, the design was revised to become the Super FX GSU (Graphics Support Unit); this, unlike the first Super FX chip revision, is able to reach 21 MHz. All versions of the Super FX chip are functionally compatible in terms of their instruction set. The differences arise in how they are packaged, their pinout, and their internal clock speed. As a result of changing the package when creating the GSU-2, more external pins were available and assigned for addressing. As a result, a larger amount of external ROM or RAM can be accessed. Usage Star Fox uses the chip for the rendering of hundreds of simultaneous 3D polygons. It uses scaled 2D bitmaps for lasers, asteroids, and other obstacles, but other objects such as ships are rendered with 3D polygons. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island uses the chip for 2D graphics effects like sprite scaling and stretching. Game cartridges that contain a Super FX chip have additional contacts at the bottom of the cartridge that connect to the extra slots in the cartridge port that are not otherwise typically used. Therefore, Super FX games cannot be plugged into cartridge adapters which predate the release of Super FX games. This includes cheat devices, such as the Game Genie.

After the death of Septimius Severus, his sons Caracalla and Geta were initially joint emperors. Caracalla had Geta assassinated in 212; Geta's memorials were destroyed and all images or mentions of him were removed from public buildings and monuments. Accordingly, Geta's image and inscriptions referring to him were removed from the arch. Description The arch was raised on a travertine base originally approached by steps from the Forum's ancient level. The central archway, spanned by a richly coffered semicircular vault, has lateral openings to each side archway, a feature copied in many Early Modern triumphal arches. The Arch is about 23 meters in height, 25 meters in width. The arch bears two sets of reliefs. The first set includes four large panels on each face of the attic and the second set consists of eight panels that are set into the inner face of the four archways. The three archways rest on piers, in front of which are detached composite columns on pedestals. Winged Victories are carved in relief in the spandrels. A staircase in the south pier leads to the top of the monument, on which were statues of the emperor and his two sons in a four- horse chariot (quadriga), accompanied by soldiers.

A flight of steps originally led to the central opening, as one still does to the Arch of Trajan at Ancona. By the 4th century, erosion had raised the level of the Forum so much that a roadway was put through the Arch for the first time. So much debris and silt eroded from the surrounding hills that the arch was embedded to the base of the columns. The damage wrought by wheeled medieval and early modern traffic can still be seen on the column bases, above the bas-reliefs of the socles. During the Middle Ages repeated flooding of the low-lying Forum washed in so much additional sediment and debris that when Canaletto painted it in 1742, only the upper half of the Arch showed above ground. The well-preserved condition of the Arch owes a good deal to its having been incorporated into the structure of a Christian church, given 1199 by Pope Innocent III to the church of Ss. Sergio and Bacco. Half the Arch belonged to the Cimini family, who is also attributed for the preservation of the structure (Claustrum Cimini). The stronghold included a tower placed on top of the Arch itself. When the church was refounded elsewhere, the arch remained ecclesiastical property and was not demolished for other construction. Dedicatory inscription The dedicatory inscription on the arch reads: IMP ¬∑ CAES ¬∑ LVCIO ¬∑ SEPTIMIO ¬∑ M ¬∑ FIL ¬∑ SEVERO ¬∑ PIO ¬∑ PERTINACI ¬∑ AVG ¬∑ PATRI PATRIAE PARTHICO ¬∑ ARABICO ¬∑ ET PARTHICO ¬∑ ADIABENICO ¬∑ PONTIFIC ¬∑ MAXIMO ¬∑ TRIBUNIC ¬∑ POTEST ¬∑ XI ¬∑ IMP ¬∑ XI ¬∑ COS ¬∑ III ¬∑ PROCOS ¬∑ ET IMP ¬∑ CAES ¬∑ M ¬∑ AVRELIO ¬∑ L ¬∑ FIL ¬∑ ANTONINO ¬∑ AVG ¬∑ PIO ¬∑ FELICI ¬∑ TRIBUNIC ¬∑ POTEST ¬∑ VI ¬∑ COS ¬∑ PROCOS ¬∑ (P ¬∑ P ¬∑ OPTIMIS ¬∑ FORTISSIMISQVE ¬∑ PRINCIPIBUS) OB ¬∑ REM ¬∑ PVBLICAM ¬∑ RESTITVTAM ¬∑ IMPERIVMQVE ¬∑ POPVLI ¬∑ ROMANI ¬∑ PROPAGATVM ¬∑ INSIGNIBVS ¬∑ VIRTVTIBVS ¬∑ EORVM ¬∑ DOMI ¬∑ FORISQVE ¬∑ S ¬∑ P ¬∑ Q ¬∑ R Imp(eratori) Caes(ari) Lucio Septimio M(arci) fil(io) Severo Pio Pertinaci Aug(usto) patri patriae Parthico Arabico et Parthico Adiabenico pontific(i) maximo tribunic(ia) potest(ate) XI imp(eratori) XI, co(n)s(uli) III proco(n)s(uli) et imp(eratori) Caes(ari) M(arco) Aurelio L(ucii) fil(io) Antonino Aug(usto) Pio Felici tribunic(ia) potest(ate) VI co(n)s(uli) proco(n)s(uli) (p(atri) p(atriae) optimis fortissimisque principibus) ob rem publicam restitutam imperiumque populi Romani propagatum insignibus virtutibus eorum domi forisque S(enatus) P(opulus) Q(ue) R(omanus).

Susan Oliver portrayed the first Orion seen on screen, when her human character Vina was transformed into one, although it was Majel Barrett who underwent the original makeup test. The footage was subsequently used in the two-part episode \\"The Menagerie\\". Yvonne Craig, who was considered for the role of Vina, later played an Orion in \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\". Male Orions made their first appearance in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \\"The Pirates of Orion\\" but did not appear in live action until the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Borderland\\", which also featured female Orions. Orion women have also been seen in the films Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness. Females of the species have become known as Orion slave girls, who have become popular among fans as costumes. Development The first mention of the Orion was in Gene Roddenberry's first draft script for the initial pilot for Star Trek: The Original Series, \\"The Cage\\". At that stage, there was no further description given, except that they were to be alien in appearance.Cushman & Osborn (2013): p. 40 By the time that casting had been sought, it had been decided that the Orion character should be painted green, with the script stating that the character should be \\"Wild! Green skin, glistening as if oiled\\". Roddenberry had convinced the NBC executives to shoot in color to reduce scenery costs and so that the green skin of the character could be seen on screen.Westmore et al; (2000): p. 14 The costume for Vina was designed by William Ware Theiss, with Roddenberry pushing for it to be skimpier.Solow & Justman (1996): p. 39 Fred Phillips conducted makeup tests before the shooting began on the episode. As an actress had not yet been cast in the role of Vina, Majel Barrett instead stepped in. Several different shades of green greasepaint were applied to her, with different camera exposures and lighting settings tested. Those test shots were sent to be developed, and received back the following day.Westmore et al; (2000): p. 16 To the surprise of the production team, Barrett appeared normal flesh colored in all footage. They tried again, applying a much darker shade of green. Once again, when the results were received, she didn't appear green at all. They tried a third time and the same result was received. Roddenberry phoned the development lab out of frustration, only to hear their surprise that the character was supposed to be green. They had presumed that the cinematographer had set up the camera incorrectly and had spent a great deal of time correcting Barrett back to a normal color.Westmore et al; (2000): p. 17 A number of actresses were considered for the part, including Yvette Mimieux, Yvonne Craig, Barbara Eden and Anne Francis. Roddenberry's first choice was Susan Oliver, whose talent agency said she was an excellent dancer.Alexander (1995): p. 212 She was convinced to take the role by Oscar Katz,Cushman & Osborn (2013): p. 48 an executive at Desilu Productions.Cushman & Osborn (2013): p. 28 He didn't attend the set in an effort to avoid Oliver, since he had undersold the difficulty of the makeup in the role.Alexander (1995): p. 215 To prepare for the Orion scenes, Oliver took a week's worth of choreography instruction, later stating in an interview with Starlog magazine that she was not a skilled dancer. The shoot with Oliver in green paint took place on December 4, 1965, with the actress stating in a later interview that \\"Even before the dance began and I was standing demurely to the side, this feeling was in the air. Gene had touched on something dark in man's unconscious; one could imagine doing something with a green mate that he would never dare someone of his own color.\\"Cushman & Osborn (2013): p. 58 Phillips required an assistant to keep reapplying the green Max Factor greasepaint between shots, as due to Oliver's perspiration due to the heat from the studio lights and the dancing, it would become blotchy in patches and dry out in others.Block & Erdmann (2010): p. 10Solow & Justman (1996): p. 47 Portions of Oliver's dancing was cut as it was deemed as too sexy, along with a scene where she is whipped. The episode was subsequently rejected by NBC as a pilot,Cushman & Osborn (2013): p. 65 but the footage was later used in the two-part episode \\"The Menagerie\\".Cushman & Osborn (2013): p. 338 Unlike the other actors from \\"The Cage\\", Oliver's contract did not contain a clause to cover re-use of the footage, and so was not paid any additional fees.Alexander (1995): p. 529 The first appearance of a male Orion was shown in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \\"The Pirates of Orion\\". The Orion Syndicate was mentioned in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, but no actual Orions were seen, only members of other species.Erdmann & Block (2000): pp. 538-539 Star Trek: Enterprise and reboot films Writer Mike Sussman sought to introduce the Orions into Star Trek: Enterprise with the episode \\"Anomaly\\", but during rewrites this was changed into a new species called the Osaarians. During Manny Coto's tenure as show runner in the fourth season, the Orions were re-introduced on screen for the first time since The Original Series in the episode \\"Borderland\\" in 2004, which was the first time that an Orion male had appeared on-screen in live action. Bobbi Sue Luther was cast as the main Orion slave girl in the episode, and she researched the history of the race on the internet prior to her performance as she was not familiar with the series before. Four hours of make-up work was required for Luther to be ready, and she described the costume as slightly skimpier than she was used to as a lingerie and bikini model. Isopropyl alcohol was used to remove the majority of the green makeup, but Luther said that it took several days for the rest to come off. Professional wrestler Big Show was one of several actors portraying male Orions in \\"Borderland\\". A further Orion-centric episode was shown later in the fourth season. Entitled \\"Bound\\", there were three Orion slave girls central to the plot played by Cyia Batten, Crystal Allen and Menina Fortunato. In this case, the makeup was applied via spraying, but still took around four hours for the actresses to be ready for filming. Following the end of Enterprise, a reboot saw the franchise return to the era of The Original Series with the 2009 Star Trek remake. Rachel Nichols was cast as an Orion named Gaila, who was involved in a relationship with James T. Kirk (Chris Pine). Her hair and makeup process took up to six hours each day, and found that it would stain Pine's face green after they filmed a scene in which they kiss. She was disappointed not to be returning to the role for the following film, Star Trek Into Darkness. Scenes were also shot for Star Trek featuring Diora Baird as a second Orion woman, but these were cut and later included as a deleted scene on the home media releases. Roberto Orci, one of the writers of the reboot films, suggested in an interview with UGO Networks that these Orion women had been released from slavery through the means of an underground railroad. Appearances The official Star Trek website describes the Orion species as being organised into a \\"loose nation or empire\\", also described as the Orion Syndicate. They are known for their criminal activities, such as piracy, illegal mining and black market exploitation. The first appearance of them in the Star Trek chronology was in the Enterprise episode \\"Borderland\\", when the Enterprise (NX-01) under Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) travelled to an area of space known as the borderland, located between Klingon and Orion space. There they are attacked by two Orion ships, and several crew members are abducted. They track them down to an Orion slave market with the assistance of Arik Soong (Brent Spiner), and rescue them. In \\"Bound\\", the crew are contacted by an Orion vessel captained by Harrad-Sar (William Lucking), who offers to open relations between the Orion Syndicate and Starfleet. To celebrate the new venture, Archer is presented with three Orion women Navaar (Cyia Batten), D'Nesh (Crystal Allen) and Maras (Menina Fortunato). The pheromones of the women begin to affect the crew with the exception of Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) and Commander Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker III (Connor Trinneer), who successfully work together to prevent the Orions from stealing the ship. During a conversation between Archer and Harrad-Sar, the Orion admits that it is the three women who are in charge, and he is their slave. The Talosians seek to stimulate an attraction between Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter) and Vina (Susan Oliver) in \\"The Cage\\". She was a woman who survived the crash of a spacecraft on Talos IV, and the Talosians had been projecting a series of illusions first to present her as a healthy human, but in order to begin an attraction, first as a princess from the Middle Ages, then as an Orion slave girl, and finally as a personification of Pike's wife.Asherman (1986): pp. 13‚Äì14 These events are reviewed during a court martial against Spock (Leonard Nimoy) by Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) in \\"The Menagerie\\".Asherman (1986): pp. 47‚Äì48 In \\"Journey to Babel\\", the Orions attempt to disrupt a Federation conference by inserting an agent disguised as the leader of the Andorian delegation, Thelev (William O'Connell). The agent kills the leader of the Tellarite delegation, Gav (John Wheeler), implicating Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard). After the Orion injures Captain Kirk, his ruse is discovered and a pursuing Orion vessel is destroyed.Asherman (1986): p. 88 In \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\", when the USS Enterprise arrives at Elba II, a planet containing an underground mental asylum, they find Garth of Izar (Steve Ihnat) impersonating the Governor of the institution. He attempts to use an Orion woman, Marta (Yvonne Craig), to influence the Enterprise crew. When this fails, he exiles her to the planet's inhospitable surface, killing her.Asherman (1986): p.124 This episode was the first occasion in the franchise that the appearance of a true Orion was shown. The Orion Syndicate is mentioned in Deep Space Nine as a criminal organisation, such as in \\"Honor Among Thieves\\" in which Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) is placed undercover within the Syndicate by Starfleet Intelligence. In the 2009 Star Trek remake, an alternative universe is created after the Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) and his ship the Narada travel back in time seeking revenge after the destruction of their homeworld. While James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is attending Starfleet Academy, he is romantically involved with an Orion woman named Gaila (Rachel Nichols) who is the roommate of Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana). In the sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, an Orion is seen in a crowd shot of San Francisco. Star Trek: Lower Decks, an animated series first aired in 2020, features an Orion main character for the first time, D'Vana Tendi, a science officer voiced by No√´l Wells. Reception Fandom A Star Trek fan in an Orion costume Fans of Star Trek embraced the Orions, specifically the image of the Orion slave girl, making it a popular choice for cosplay at science fiction conventions. This includes an Orion themed dance troop called \\"Orion's Envy\\". Several fan-based Star Trek web series have been created since the end of Enterprise, including Star Trek Continues which follows on from the events of The Original Series. The second episode, \\"Lolani\\", focused on the events following the murder of three Tellarite crewmembers of a cargo vessel and the discovery that an Orion slave girl survived the incident. Lou Ferrigno, famous for his role as the Hulk in the 1978 The Incredible Hulk television series, appeared as a similarly green male Orion. Critical reception Justin Everett, in his essay \\"Fan Culture and the Recentering of Star Trek\\", described the appearance of the Orions in the fourth season of Enterprise as an attempt by Coto to bring viewers back to the series. However, he described the Orion women themselves as providing \\"softcore porn\\" to the viewer. Regarding those same appearances, David Greven wrote in his book Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek, that the attraction of the men on the Enterprise demonstrated the \\"extraordinary heterosexuality of all the Trek series\\" as none of them can resist them, nor do any of the women feel a similar attraction. Regarding their dancing, he found that it was \\"similar to the jerky movement of birds\\", referencing that the sirens of Greek mythology shared some features with humans and others with birds.Greven (2009): p. 133 In other media *The Green Girl is a 2014 biographical documentary film of Susan Oliver, so named for her role in \\"The Cage\\". *The 2015 parodic Henry Danger episode \\"Dream Busters\\" (which's title is a reference to Ghostbusters) is almost completely set in a world made of hallucinations, one of which is an almost mute character which another hallucination names \\"the Green Dancing Girl\\", clearly a reference to Star Trek's Orions. *In The Big Bang Theory, season 11 episode 4, Leonard complains that the drycleaner didn't get the stain out of his Star Fleet uniform. Penny remarks that he wouldn't have to dryclean it so much if he didn't make her wear the green body paint in bed, but Leonard decides that it's worth it.

He is known for his melodic approach to bass playing. Career Rourke's father was Irish while his mother was English. He received an acoustic guitar from his parents when he was seven years old. At the age of 11 he befriended the young John Maher (soon to be Johnny Marr) with whom he shared an interest in music. The pair spent lunch breaks in school jamming and playing on their guitars. When Marr and Rourke formed a band, he invited Rourke (still then a guitarist) to try on bass, which he fell in love with and has stuck with ever since.\\"Andy Rourke Interview\\", YouTube. Retrieved 1 September 2011. Rourke abandoned school when he was 15. He passed through a series of menial jobs and played guitar and bass in various rock bands, as well as in the short-lived funk band Freak Party, with his schoolfriend Johnny Marr. Marr later teamed up with Morrissey to form the Smiths. Rourke joined the band after its first gig, and remained through most of its existence. He was briefly sacked from the band, allegedly receiving the news in a note left under the windscreen wiper of his car: \\"Andy, you have left the Smiths. Good luck and goodbye, Morrissey\\". Morrissey has denied this. In May 1986, Rourke rejoined the Smiths, just before they recorded The Queen Is Dead. Marr described Rourke's contribution to that album as \\"something no other bass player could match\\". The Smiths released Strangeways, Here We Come in 1987 to critical acclaim, but split soon after. Immediately after the break-up, Rourke and Smiths drummer Mike Joyce played with Sin√©ad O'Connor ‚Äì Rourke (but not Joyce) appears on the album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (1990).

Rourke has also played and recorded with the Pretenders (appearing on some of the tracks on 1994's Last of the Independents); Killing Joke, Badly Drawn Boy (with whom Rourke toured for two years), Aziz Ibrahim (formerly of the Stone Roses), and ex-Oasis guitarist Bonehead as Moondog One, which also included Mike Joyce and Craig Gannon. Rourke also played bass for Ian Brown, both on tour and on Brown's album The World Is Yours. In March 1996, Rourke and Mike Joyce started legal proceedings against Morrissey and Marr over royalties. While Joyce continued with the action, Rourke settled out of court for ¬£83,000.\\"Can a New Film Heal the Smiths Rift?\\", Manchester Evening News, 29 August 2006. Retrieved 10 January 2012. Having spent the settlement, Rourke later found himself being declared bankrupt following a petition of the Inland Revenue on 25 January 1999. Rourke, his then-manager Nova Rehman, his production company, Great Northern Productions, and others organised Manchester v Cancer, a series of concerts to benefit cancer research, later known simply as Versus Cancer. The initiative was prompted when Rehman's father and sister were diagnosed with the disease. The first Manchester v Cancer concert took place in January 2006. It featured a reunion between Rourke and his former Smiths bandmate Johnny Marr, who performed one song together. The second Manchester v Cancer concert took place in March 2007. Rourke performed with former Oasis guitarist Bonehead's band Elektrik Milk. Rourke was less involved in organising the third concert in February 2008 or the fourth in December 2009. Rourke formed Freebass with bass players Mani (ex-the Stone Roses) and Peter Hook (ex-New Order) in 2007 and remained active in the group until August 2010.

He is a former lecturer, politician and anti-apartheid activist. He led South Africa's successful 2010 FIFA World Cup bid, the first successful one for Africa, as well as the country's unsuccessful bid four years earlier for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and was the Chief Executive Officer of the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. He is also the former Mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, having served from May 2015 until August 2016. He has served FIFA in numerous capacities, including, as a General Co-ordinator for the Youth World Cup (now FIFA U-20 World Cup), 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea/Japan. He was also a match commissioner for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and a member of the 2006 FIFA World Cup Organising Committee. He served on the 2010 FIFA World Cup Organising Committee and 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup Organising Committee. Jordaan is also a member of the International Marketing Council. Career Danny Jordaan was born in Port Elizabeth, a city on the southeast coast of South Africa, to Maxine and Alexandre Jordaan. He became involved in anti-apartheid activities by joining the South African Students' Organisation (SASO) in the early 1970s, an organisation founded by Steve Biko in order to defend the rights of black students. Later, Jordaan also became a member of the United Democratic Front and the African National Congress (ANC). Following his studies, Jordaan became a teacher in 1974. From 1970 to 1983 he was a provincial cricket and football player. In the latter sport, he achieved professional status for a brief period. His political and sport interests soon combined and he became an activist in various organizations fighting to break down racial barriers in sport. From 1983 to 1992 he served as the president or vice-president of various football boards. In 1993, he was appointed as a director of the Cape Town Olympic Bid Company. His political career also progressed; in 1990 he was elected as the chairperson of the ANC branch in Port Elizabeth North. After the first fully inclusive South African elections in 1994, he became a member of parliament for the ANC under the newly elected Nelson Mandela, a position he held until 1997. In 1997, he was elected as the Chief Executive Officer of SAFA. He subsequently headed South Africa's unsuccessful 2006 FIFA World Cup bid, narrowly losing to Germany but gaining great respect internationally for his work. As a consequence, he also led South Africa's 2010 FIFA World Cup bid, this time successfully. Jordaan has served on the marketing and television board of FIFA since 1998. On 28 September 2013, Jordaan was elected as the new president of South African Football Association (SAFA), succeeding Kirsten Nematandani. He was elected ahead of Mandla Mazibuko by 162 to 88 votes from 52 regions. In light of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Jordaan admitted to paying $10 Million to a football body led by Jack Warner in 2008, but denied that it was a bribe for hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Education Jordaan has a BA degree from the University of the Western Cape and an honours degree from the University of South Africa. Awards He received a special presidential award from President Nelson Mandela in 1994 as well as the presidential sport achievement award from President Thabo Mbeki in 2001. He won South Africa's marketing person of the year award in 2000. In 2004, he was voted 44th in the Top 100 Great South Africans and newsmaker of the year. He received a mayoral award from the mayor of Los Angeles, California on 24 October 2004. That same year, he won the Confederation of African Football's \\"most impressive Achiever\\" alongside Molefi Oliphant and Irvin Khosa. Jordaan has been given the freedom of the city of Maracaibo, Venezuela. He has also received numerous awards from other South African cities. He has received four honorary doctorates from: Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (D.Phil); the University of South Africa (D. Admin); his alma mater, the University of the Western Cape (D. Phil); and in May 2015 from the University of Fort Hare (D. Admin). Rape allegations In November 2017, Jordaan issued a statement through his attorney to deny allegations by singer and former parliamentarian Jennifer Ferguson that he had raped her 24 years before. Ferguson first posted her allegations on Facebook in October, saying she had been inspired to do so by the #MeToo campaign. Ferguson later accused lawyer Norman Arendse of fishing for information that could be used to discredit her, on Jordaan's behalf. Arendse denied both claims. An allegation that Jordaan had failed to act against an employee who had been accused of rape had been made in the week following Ferguson's allegation by an anonymous source but the claim was refuted by SAFA. Until Jordaan's statement, some South African publications refused to name him, even as others did. In April 2018 Jordaan through his attorney called on the South African Police Service to expedite their investigation so that the truth could be revealed. He again denied the allegations. Some media questioned whether the rape allegations were part of a political plot to discredit Jordaan ahead of the highly contested SAFA elections that were due to take place in March 2018. Jordaan was widely expected to be unanimously reelected President of the body that administers football in the country.

It covers ergonomics, quantification, evaluation, and navigation. Contents The book puts forward a large number of interface design suggestions, from fairly trivial ones to radical ones. The overriding theme is that current computer interfaces are often poor and set up users to fail, as a result of poor planning (or lack of planning) by programmers and a lack of understanding of how people actually use software. Raskin often refers to the computer he designed, the Canon Cat, as an example of a system that implemented the various measures he advocates; the Canon Cat is often considered the first information appliance. Many of the ideas presented in the Canon Cat and The Humane Interface were later adopted by Raskin in his Archy project, and later by his son Aza. Raskin includes a chapter demonstrating four models of quantifying the efficiency of a software interface: the GOMS keystroke model, Raskin's own efficiency measure, Fitts' law and Hick's law. All are intended to minimize the amount of time required for the user to perform any specific task.  Design rules  Raskin also advocates a number of changes to conventional interface design. Among them: * Modelessness - a mode is a state in which the computer produces a different output for the same input than it would have if it were another state; the classic example is the keyboard's \\"caps lock\\" key. Raskin advocates either getting rid of them entirely or using \\"quasimodes\\" (a term he invented in the book); a quasimode is a state in which the user must make some constant physical action in order to keep the computer in that state, so that they cannot forget that they are in that mode; an example is the keyboard's shift key. * Monotony of design - there should be only one way to accomplish a certain atomic task in an application (in many modern applications, there are at least three - one through a button on the screen, one through a menu dropdown, and one through a keyboard shortcut - and often more). * Every action should be undoable, even after a document or application has been closed and reopened. * Elimination of warning screens - modern software applications often ask the user \\"are you sure?\\" before some potentially harmful action; Raskin argues they are unhelpful because users tend to ignore them out of habit, and that having a universal undo eliminates the need for them. * Universal use of text - Raskin argues that graphic icons in software without any accompanying text are often cryptic to users. Habituation is an important concept driving Raskin's guidelines, intended to free the user's mind from attention to low-level interaction details. A modeless interface, monotony of design and elimination of blocking warnings are all intended to favor habit-forming reactions to interface handling.  Non-standard interaction architecture  Raskin also advocates a document- centered approach to computer interfaces that entails several radical changes to the current nature of operating systems and software: * An end to stand- alone applications - every software package should be structured as a set of tools available to users on any document. For example, in the middle of writing a text document, a user should be able to do a mathematical computation by writing out the computation in the document, then hitting some \\"calculate\\" function. * An end to directories and file names - \\"the content of a text file is its own best name.\\" Every document should be identifiable by its contents, so there should not be need for directories or names for user- generated documents; Raskin argues that these names tend to be cryptic and make files difficult to find afterwards. * Zooming user interface - Raskin advocates an interface he calls ZoomWorld, in which the user navigates around a two-dimensional plane containing a graphical representation of every document on the computer. The user can zoom out to see all the documents, or zoom in on any specific document in order to read and edit it. Raskin further asserts that interface design should be subject to regulation, analogous to building codes. This could be done by establishing legal safeguards to protect consumers from harm; and establishing professional guidelines and standards to evaluate good practice and interface quality.

The Kangi Famine (1229-1232) \\"Between 1229 and 1232, the Kanki famine struck. Possibly the worst famine in Japanese history, it was caused by unusually cold, damp weather related to world-wide volcanic activity. The weather was so severe that snow fell in central Japan in the summer of 1230, while aristocrats noted days when the sun did not shine and complained because they had to wear heavy clothing even in the spring and summer. The death toll was high‚Äîin 1231, in one estate in central Japan about twenty percent of cultivators died in less than a month. Both governments attempted to ameliorate the harsh conditions but to little avail. Law and order broke down; countermeasures against nocturnal marauders and ‚Äúevil monks‚Äù were largely ineffectual. Outlawry even affected relations with the Korean kingdom of Kory≈ç when hungry residents of Kyushu raided the neigh boring peninsula for food. The famine also led to numerous quarrels between on-site warrior landlords and urban proprietors, with many estates unable to pay taxes or organize labor gangs. When harvests were inadequate, warriors also pressured and abused hapless cultivators, driving them from their fields. Both Kyoto and Kamakura took steps to make more grain available to commoners, but the results of their actions were only modest. The most important countermeasure taken to try to reduce the impact of the lengthy crop failure was the legalization of the sale of human beings. When a family was faced with starvation, members might choose to sell children or other kin in return for grain, at the same time ensuring enough to eat for the sellers and the person to be sold. This behavior had been going on illegally for centuries, but its official authorization from 1231 to 1239 showed just how severe the Kangi famine was. The policy helped to spread starving victims around to people who could take care of them, but it also ripped more families asunder. ln addition, all those sold became members of a servile class, dwelling in small lean-tos or perhaps even in a room of their master's house. These conditions did not encourage large. stable families. The new policy may have saved some lives, but the creation of so many dependent, broken, and poor families helped lower fertility, making recovery from the famine even more difficult. After the famine in 1239, the bakufu tried to abrogate the more lenient laws, without success. The famine expanded the size of the servile class considerably; it was to remain a significant proportion of Japanese society for the next four hundred years[ ... ]\\" William Wayne Farris.

Raffles inhabits the formal world of the Victorian/Edwardian gentleman, but behaves as a 21st-century hooligan, though he always maintains his elegant style. The comic strip parodies British yob culture, placing Raffles in anachronistic modern situations which he usually employs extreme violence to resolve. Raffles is always accompanied by his loyal friend Bunny (Lord Bunniford) and has other acquaintances such as 'Dave, 6th Earl of Bermondsey' (a notorious section of South East London) and Clarence, 3rd Earl of Burberry (a reference to Burberry, stereotypically the fashion brand of choice for Britain's 'chavs'). Raffles' character is inspired by E. W. Hornung's Raffles the Thief. Language The Raffles strip is noted for its substitution of formal language in common slang phrases. For example: *'Kick the little bastard' becomes 'Lapidate the little illegitimate' *'Tits oot for the lads' (tag line of fellow Viz character Sid the Sexist) becomes 'Kindly remove thy decoll√©tage from its corsetry for the delectation of the gentlemen here assembled' *'Fanny magnet' (when describing his new car) becomes 'Vaginal lodestone' *'You big girl's blouse' becomes 'You sizable ladies chemise' *'Rat's cocks' (a frequent vulgarism used by Viz writers) becomes 'Rodents' penii' *'There's plenty more where that came from' becomes 'There's an elegant plenitude from whenceforth that originated' *'Run like fuck, it's the filth!' becomes 'Run like coitus, it's the putrescence!' *'Fuck my luck' (another frequent vulgarism used by Viz writers) becomes 'Fornicate my fortune' *'Stitch that' becomes 'Embroider that' *'Eat my dust' becomes 'Consume my pulverulence' *'You cheeky cunt' becomes 'You insolent vagina' *'Wanker!\\" becomes 'Ononist!\\" Historical references Raffles found himself in many situations featuring famous characters and events from the 19th century and early 20th century: * Playing cricket against the world-famous W. G. Grace, cheating him and then beating him up in the toilets. * Knocking out the Elephant Man, Joseph Merrick during a visit to a fairground freak show after accusing him of \\"looking at his bird\\". * Fighting in World War I, bullying war poet Rupert Brooke and acting like a football hooligan during the 1914 Christmas Truce. * Getting drunk at an 'At Home' and trying to pick a fight with Oscar Wilde, who at the end smashes his face in. Raffles is helped away by Bunny, and manages to say, \\"I wish I'd said that, Bunny\\" to which his friend replies, \\"You will, Raffles; you will\\"; a misquote of Wilde's wit.

While the territories of Further Austria west of the Rhine and south of Lake Constance (except Konstanz itself) were gradually lost to France and the Swiss Confederacy, those in Swabia and Vorarlberg remained under Habsburg control until the Napoleonic Era. Geography Further Austria mainly comprised the Alsatian County of Ferrette in the Sundgau, including the town of Belfort, and the adjacent Breisgau region east of the Rhine, including Freiburg im Breisgau after 1368. Also ruled from the Habsburg residence in Ensisheim near M√ºhlhausen were numerous scattered territories stretching from Upper Swabia to the Allg√§u region in the east, the largest being the margravate of Burgau between the cities of Augsburg and Ulm. During the Habsburg Monarchy they were humorously called \\"tail feathers of the Imperial Eagle\\". Some estates in Vorarlberg possessed by the Habsburgs were also considered part of Further Austria, though they were temporarily directly administered from Tyrol. History The original home territories of the Habsburgs, the Aargau with Habsburg Castle and much of the other original possessions south of the High Rhine and Lake Constance were already lost in the 14th century to the expanding Swiss Confederacy after the battles of Morgarten (1315) and Sempach (1386). These territories were never considered part of Further Austria - except for the Fricktal region around Rheinfelden and Laufenburg, which remained a Habsburg possession until 1797. From 1406 until 1490 Further Austria together with the Habsburg County of Tyrol was included in the definition of \\"Upper Austria\\" (Ober√∂sterreich, not to be confused with the modern Austrian state of Upper Austria). From 1469 to 1474 Archduke Sigismund gave large parts in pawn to the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold. At the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the Sundgau became part of France. After the Ottoman wars many inhabitants of Further Austria were encouraged to emigrate and settle in the newly acquired Transylvania region, people that later were referred as Danube Swabians. In the 18th century, the Habsburgs acquired a few minor new Swabian territories, such as Tettnang in 1780. In the reorganization of the Holy Roman Empire in the course of the French Revolutionary Wars, much of Further Austria, including the Breisgau, was by the 1801 Treaty of Lun√©ville granted as compensation to Ercole III d'Este, former duke of Modena and Reggio, who however died two years later. His heir as his son-in-law was Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, the uncle of Emperor Francis II. After the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz and the Peace of Pressburg in 1805, Further Austria was entirely dissolved and the former Habsburg territories were assigned to the Grand Duchy of Baden (Breisgau), the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg (Rottenburg and Horb) and the Kingdom of Bavaria (Weitnau G√ºnzburg, Wei√üenhorn), as rewards for their alliance with Napoleonic France. Minor estates passed to Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Fricktal had already become a French protectorate in 1799 and part of the Helvetic Republic in 1802, incorporated into the Swiss canton of Aargau the next year. After the defeat of Napoleon, there was some discussion at the Congress of Vienna of returning part of all of the Vorlande to Austria, but in the end only Vorarlberg returned to Austrian control, as Foreign Minister Klemens von Metternich did not want to offend the rulers of the South German states and hoped that removing Austria from its advanced position on the Rhine would reduce tensions with France. Administrative division As of 1790 Further Austria was subdivided into ten districts (Ober√§mter): *Breisgau (with Fricktal) at Freiburg *Offenburg: several localities in the present Ortenaukreis, the Imperial city of Offenburg not included *Hohenberg, present Ostalbkreis, former county, at Rottenburg am Neckar *Nellenburg, former landgraviate, at Stockach *Altdorf (former Vogtei Swabia), today Weingarten *Tettnang, former County of Montfort *G√ºnzburg, former Margraviate of Burgau *Winnweiler in the Palatinate, former County of Falkenstein *the former Imperial city of Konstanz *Bregenz, present-day Vorarlberg, then administrated from Tyrol. Habsburg rulers Politically, the Further Austrian territories were held by the Habsburg (Arch-)Dukes of Austria from 1278 onwards. Upon the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, they together with Carinthia, Styria, Carniola and Tyrol fell to the Leopoldian line: *Leopold III, until 1386 *William, son, 1386‚Äì1406 Further divided into Inner Austria proper (Styria, Carinthia and Carniola) and Upper Austria (Tyrol and Further Austria), ruled by: *Frederick IV, younger brother of William, 1406-1439 (regent in Further Austria since 1402) *Frederick V, nephew of William, ruler of Inner Austria, 1439-1446 (regent) *Sigismund, son of Frederick IV, 1446‚Äì1490 In 1490 all Habsburg possessions were re-unified under the rule of Frederick V, Holy Roman Emperor since 1452. Upon the death of Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg in 1564, Further Austria and Tyrol was inherited by his second son: *Ferdinand II, 1564‚Äì1595 *Matthias, 1595‚Äì1619, nephew, Holy Roman Emperor from 1612, with his younger brother **Maximilian III as regent, 1612‚Äì1618 In 1619 the Habsburg hereditary lands were re-unified under the rule of Emperor Ferdinand II. He gave Further Austria to his younger brother: *Leopold V, 1623‚Äì1632 *Ferdinand Charles, son, 1632‚Äì1662 **under the tutelage of his mother Claudia de' Medici, 1632‚Äì1646 *Sigismund Francis, brother 1662-1665 In 1665 the Habsburg lands were finally re-unified under the rule of Emperor Leopold I.

After the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party to power in January 1933, the KPO existed only as an illegal and underground organization. The group initially sought to modify, later to replace, the mainstream Communist Party of Germany (KPD) headed by Ernst Th√§lmann. The KPO was the first national section affiliated to the International Communist Opposition (ICO).  Organizational history   Background  The KPO represented the so-called Right Opposition in the KPD in distinction to the Trotskyist or Trotskyist-sympathising Left Opposition and the pro-Comintern centre faction. It was led by Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer who had led the KPD between 1921 and 1923. They were expelled from the KPD after organising a meeting to combat what they saw as corruption in their party after its central leader Ernst Th√§lmann defended a prot√©g√©, John Wittorf, from charges of theft despite his guilt. Th√§lmann was deposed by the Central Committee only to be reinstated by Joseph Stalin through the agency of the Comintern. The secretary of the Hamburg organization of the KPD was found to have embezzled 2,000 marks from the party treasury for his own use. When accountants from national party headquarters discovered the crime, they were threatened with expulsion from the party by party leader Th√§lmann if they exposed the theft. The Comintern got wind of the scandal which led to a crisis in the German party with the Central Committee acting to remove Th√§lmann, with Th√§lmann joining in the unanimous vote.Robert J. Alexander, The Right Opposition: The Lovestoneites and the International Communist Opposition of the 1930s. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1985; pg. 136. This presented a threat to the faction of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Joseph Stalin, who saw in Th√§lmann a reliable ally during a time of bitter factional warfare. As a result, the Presidium of the Comintern countermanded the German Central Committee's action, restoring Th√§lmann as secretary. In October 1928, Brandler returned to Germany against the KPD's wishes. The corruption of Th√§lmann's Hamburg organization and its protection by the Stalin faction in Moscow was used as a pretext for Brandler and Thalheimer to issue a call for a meeting of their followers on 11 November 1928.The gathering was to be held on December 30, 1928. Brandler, Thalheimer and their associates were bitterly criticized in an open letter from the Comintern on 19 December. Expulsion soon followed, with both Brandler and Thalheimer removed from the Communist Party of Germany in December 1928 and from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Comintern in January 1929.Klaus Sch√∂enhoven, \\"Heinrich Brandler,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: A-L. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 130-131.  Formation  Brandler and Thalheimer gathered their supporters into a new organization called the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) (KPO), a group which was founded at the 30 December 1928 meeting which had originally prompted the wave of expulsions. The group also launched a new communist opposition journal, Gegen den Strom (Against the Current).Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 42-43. Most of those who attended this conference were factional allies of Brandler and Thalheimer from previous years when they had headed the German Communist Party. The major exception was Paul Fr√∂lich, who had been allied with a third, so-called Conciliator faction which stood between the future KPO and the KPD leadership. Fr√∂lich and his partner Rosi Wolfstein, like Brandler and Thalheimer, had been allies and pupils of Rosa Luxemburg. Throughout 1929, the KPD expelled followers of Brandler and Thalheimer as well as the Conciliator faction, who sought a factional truce between the party's feuding left and right. Perhaps 1,000 members of the German Communist Party were affected.Alexander, The Right Opposition, pg. 140. These expulsions paralleled similar efforts to purge the Soviet Communist Party of followers of Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov and Mikhail Tomsky. The KPO initially conceived of itself as a factional influence group, attempting to change the political line of the Communist Party of Germany rather than a new party in competition with it. The organization held a second conference in November 1929 at which in the words of M. N. Roy it \\"declared unequivocally that between Social Democracy and Communism there is no half-way house\\".M.N. Roy in The Revolutionary Age [New York], December 1, 1929, pg. 16; cited in Alexander, The Right Opposition,\\" pg. 140. Roy claimed that the KPO had 6,000 dues-paying members and was publishing eight weekly and bi-monthly publications by the fall of 1929, with a combined circulation of 25,000. Brandler was named Secretary of the organization at this time. While the group never met with broad influence or electoral success, it nevertheless became the first as well as one of the most prominent parties to be identified with the so-called International Right Opposition. On 1 January 1930, the KPO attempted to expand its influence even further with the launch of a daily newspaper, Arbeiterpolitik. Financial problems led it a reduction of frequency and by 1932 the paper was being issued only once a week. Despite Roy's protestations that the KPO did not constitute an independent political party, it was not long before it had entered the field with its own candidates for office. It ran its own candidates in the 7 December 1929 provincial election in Thuringia, one of the organization's strongholds, although these garnered just 12,000 votes.Alexander, The Right Opposition, pg. 141. In other elections, it supported the slate of candidates of the official Communist Party of Germany, including the candidacy of Ernst Th√§lmann for President in the election of March 1932. The KPO counted approximately 1,000 members after its supporters had been expelled from the KPD, many of them local leaders of the party. In the years that followed, they failed to recruit any further adherents from outside the party and gradually decreased in number. The KPO backed the KPD on most public issues, but it did stand their own candidates in some elections and ran other campaigns. Their members were also active in the existing trade unions in contrast to the KPD which launched a policy of forming radical dual unions during the so-called Third Period between 1929 and 1934.  Drive for a united front against fascism  In the period when the KPD was denouncing the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as social fascists and retreating from joint anti-fascist work with non-Communists, Brandler and the KPO were strongly in favor of the establishment of a united front against the menace of Nazism and were particularly critical of the Communist Party's conception that \\"once the Nazis get into power, then will the united front of the proletariat rise and brush them aside\\".Statement in Rote Fahne (Red Flag), official organ of the KPD, October 16, 1931, cited in Alexander, The Right Opposition,\\" pg. 142. Instead, the KPO called for the immediate formation of a broad anti- fascist alliance including the Social Democratic-controlled trade union federation, the Social Democrats, Communists and the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAPD).Alexander, The Right Opposition,\\" pg. 143. Campaigning for a united front as a small group did not give the KPO more influence with the general public, but the threat of the Nazis did lead to a leftward movement within the SPD. This leftist tendency in the SPD left that party in 1931 and organised themselves as the SAPD which elements within the KPO felt they should join. After an internal struggle in which the majority of the KPO backed Brandler and Thalheimer, a minority led by Fr√∂lich and Jakob Walcher refused to accept the decisions of the fourth conference of the KPO held in January 1932. The leadership replied to this challenge by stating that the breach of discipline implied the minority had excluded itself from the organisation. The minority responded by joining the SAPD. On 10 August 1932, the KPO weekly Arbeiterpolitik was banned for 13 weeks for violating President Paul von Hindenburg's emergency decree \\"against political excesses\\" by the conservative German government headed by Chancellor Franz von Papen. The ban was to take effect immediately, continuing until 15 November.\\"Papen Issues Program of Capitalist Offensive; Arbeiterpolitik Suppressed!\\" Workers Age [New York], vol. 1, no. 28 (September 3, 1932), pg. 1. The ban, along with similar measures taken against other organs of the left-wing press, helped make coordinated action against German ultranationalism more difficult. Following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his ultranationalist National Socialist German Workers Party on 30 January 1933 and the wave of anti-radical repression which ensued, Brandler and most of the KPO leadership fled to France. Brandler lived in Paris until the beginning of World War II, where he continued to be involved in communist politics.  Underground period  The KPO was only able to work legally for one more year before the Nazis came to power in January 1933. However, it was to go underground immediately in order to avoid persecution as far as possible. They were able to hold a conference in Denmark in April 1934 and maintain a national structure. In 1935, the Nazis stepped up the repression of all communist groups and trials of KPO members were reported in Weimar, Jena and elsewhere. The organisation ceased to operate at a national level and was now confined to exile circles and the Saarland. In the Saarland, they were able to function legally for a little longer due to its status as a French occupation zone. When a plebiscite was held on the matter of the region being returned to Germany, the KPO called on its supporters to vote for a R√§terepublik (soviet) Saarland and to oppose unity with Nazi Germany. This was in contrast to the position of the KPD which supported the Saarland remaining under the control of France. In exile with the leadership in Paris, the KPO continued to publish Gegen den Strom. Politically, it continued the previous line of the KPO and was supportive of the Comintern and of the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union, its criticisms being reserved for the KPD. This began to change with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War and the deepening of the Great Purges in Russia. A number of KPO militants in exile were to travel to Spain and fought in the International Brigades that supported the Second Spanish Republic. Some were to find themselves persecuted by the Stalinists, a fate they shared with militants belonging to the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM).  Dissolution  There seems to have been a tendency within the KPO which wanted it to break more clearly from any support of Stalinism and in 1939 a Group of International Marxists appeared after its founders left the ranks of the KPO. This group signed a declaration of independent socialist parties, many associated with the International Workers' Front which had left the ICO and KPO. From this point on, there is little mention of either the new group or the KPO itself, with the fall of France, the leadership of the KPO had been forced to flee again and the organisation was effectively dissolved. Of the leading figures in the KPO, Brandler and Thalheimer were to spend the war exiled in Cuba, where the latter was to perish. Brandler returned to West Germany in 1949 and played a leading role in the Gruppe Arbeiterpolitik which stood in the tradition of the KPO, but he was never able to recover its former influence. Brandler died in 1967, but the group still exists and is based in Hamburg.

He gained notoriety as a privateer, making raids against Portuguese ships. He was killed in battle and memorialised in English and Scottish folk songs. Career Some of Andrew Barton's trading voyages to Flanders ports in the 1490s are recorded in the Ledger of Andrew Halyburton.Ledger of Andrew Halyburton, HM Register House (1867) He was the oldest of three brothers, a younger brother Robert Barton of Over Barnton became Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. Andrew became notorious in England and Portugal as a 'pirate', though as a seaman who operated under the aegis of a letter of marque on behalf of the Scottish crown, he may be described as a privateer. The letter of marque against Portuguese shipping was originally granted to his father John Barton by James III of Scotland before 1485. John's ships had been attacked by Portuguese vessels when he was trading at Sluis in Flanders.Murdoch, Steve, Scotland's Maritime Warfare, Brill (2010), p.81: Letters of James IV, SHS (1953), p.81 no.125 James IV revived the letters in July 1507.Hay, Denys, Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 401. When Andrew Barton, sailing in the Lion tried to take reprisals against Portuguese ships in 1508, he was detained by Dutch authorities at Veere. James IV had to write to Maximilian, the Holy Roman Emperor, and others to get him released in 1509. Andrew then took a Portuguese ship which carried an English cargo, leading to more difficulties, and James IV had to suspend the letter of marque for a year.Murdoch, Steve, Scotland's Maritime Warfare, Brill (2010), p.81 Andrew captured a ship of Antwerp in 1509, the Fasterinsevin (the Shrove Tuesday), which did not come within his letter of marque. James IV ordered him to recompense the captain Peter Lempson and his officers for her cargo of woad and canvas.Protocol Book of John Foular, 1503‚Äì1513, vol.1, SRS (1941) p.105 no.569, 19 July 1509 The Bartons were in demand to support John, King of Denmark, and were allowed by him to harass the shipping of L√ºbeck. In return for this service, John of Denmark sent James IV timber for the masts of his ships from Flensburg. Andrew joined John's service briefly in the spring of 1511, but sailed away without permission, also taking a ship that James IV had given to John.Hannay, Mackie, Spilman, ed., Letters of James IV, SHS (1953), p .xlii, pp. 212‚Äì3 no. 387, p. 226 no. 412 Last battle An 1887 illustration of Barton's last battle Later in 1511, Andrew Barton was cruising the English coast looking for Portuguese prizes when he and his ships the Lion and Jenny Pirwyn were captured after a fierce battle with Sir Edward Howard and his brother Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, off Kent at the Downs. According to the story told in ballads, Andrew was shot and killed by an English archer during the battle and subsequently beheaded, his head being taken to the English king as evidence of his death.Friedmann, A B; The Penguin Book of Folk Ballads of the English Speaking World, London, 1956 If true, such action would perhaps have been illegal because Barton possessed a letter of marque. Contemporary English and Scottish chronicle accounts, described below, agree that Andrew died of wounds received in the fight. The incident was recalled two years later in the exchange of rhetoric at the battle of Flodden.Calendar of State Papers Milan, vol.1 (1912), p. 406 no.660, Brian Tuke to Richard Pace, 22 September 1513 The story of the sea-battle was told by Raphael Holinshed and in other 16th-century English chronicles. In Holinshed's story the Howards at first pretended only to approach and salute Andrew Barton, but then engaged in battle, Barton's ship was the Unicorn and he died from his wounds. The Scottish survivors were taken to London and kept prisoner in the Bishop of York's lodging, York Place at Whitehall.Holinshed, Raphael, The Scottish Chronicle, vol. 2, Arbroath (1805), pp. 132‚Äì3 (double volume on googlebooks) Edward Hall wrote that Andrew encouraged his men during the fight with his whistle. Hall mentions that the two ships were brought to Blackwall on 2 August 1511, and the prisoners were freed after an interview with the Bishop of Winchester, after acknowledging their piracy.Hall, Edward, Chronicle of England, (1809), p. 525 The Scottish bishop John Lesley gave a similar account of the battle in his chronicle.Thomson, Thomas, ed., John Lesley's History of Scotland, from the death of King James I. in the year M.CCCC.XXXVI to the year M.D.LXI, Bannatyne Club (1830), pp. 82‚Äì83 George Buchanan has the detail that Andrew Barton continued fighting after his leg was broken by a gunshot, and encouraged his sailors by beating a drum before he died from his wounds. Buchanan emphasises that the Howards sailed on the instruction of Henry VIII following a representation by a Portuguese ambassador.Aikman, James, trans., George Buchanan's History of Scotland, vol.2 (1827), pp. 247‚Äì8, Hall wrote that Henry VIII was at Leicester when he ordered the Howards to chase the Scottish ships.Hall, Edward, Chronicle of England, (1809), p. 525 Ballads An 1873 illustration of Barton's death He is the subject of an English folk song entitled Sir Andrew Barton or Andrew Bartin, which is Child ballad number 167. In the ballad, \\"Sir Barton\\" says: His story is also told in a Scottish Child ballad called Henry Martyn (Child ballad number 250). Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story connected with Barton in his Puck of Pook's Hill series. Notable descendants The Stedman family of which there have been a number of notable members, such as Charles Stedman (1753‚Äì1812) and John Gabriel Stedman (1744‚Äì1797) have a tradition that Andrew Barton left an only son, Charles, who married Susan Stedman of Leith and took his wife's name. citing Another notable member was John Andrew Stedman (1778‚Äì1833) who was general in the Dutch army during the Napoleonic Wars (his father was a naturalised Dutchman who had been in the Scots Brigade in the service of the States-General of the Netherlands). His son Charles John William Stedman became a Prussian subject, settling at Besselich Abbey, near Coblentz. He was a member of the national assemblies of Frankfurt am Main and Erfurt, and received the title of freiherr (baron). He had a large family, of which nearly all the sons entered the Queen Augusta Regiment of Guards; they reverted to the original family name of Barton. References *Claire Jowitt. (ed.), Pirates?

The buildings are now occupied by Claremont Fan Court School, and its landscaped gardens are owned and managed by the National Trust. Claremont House is a Grade I listed building. Claremont estate The first house on the Claremont estate was built in 1708 by Sir John Vanbrugh, the Restoration playwright and architect of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard, for his own use. This \\"very small box\\", as he described it, stood on the level ground in front of the present mansion. At the same time, he built the stables and the walled gardens, also probably White Cottage, which is now the Sixth Form Centre of Claremont Fan Court School. In 1714 he sold the house to the wealthy Whig politician Thomas Pelham-Holles, Earl of Clare, who later became Duke of Newcastle and served twice as Prime Minister. The earl commissioned Vanbrugh to add two great wings to the house and to build a fortress-like turret on an adjoining knoll. From this so-called \\"prospect-house\\", or belvedere, he and his guests could admire the views of the Surrey countryside as they took refreshments and played hazard, a popular dice game. In the clear eighteenth- century air it was apparently possible to see Windsor Castle and St Paul's Cathedral. The Earl of Clare named his country seat Clare-mount, later contracted to Claremont. The two lodges at the Copsem Lane entrance were added at this time. Landscape garden Claremont landscape garden is one of the earliest surviving gardens of its kind of landscape design, the English Landscape Garden -- still featuring its original 18th century layout. The extensive landscaped grounds of Claremont represents the work of some of the best known landscape gardeners, Charles Bridgeman, Capability Brown, William Kent (with Thomas Greening) and Sir John Vanbrugh.Turner, Roger, Capability Brown and the Eighteenth Century English Landscape, 2nd ed. Phillimore, Chichester, 1999, pp. 115- 118. Work on the gardens began around 1715, and by 1727 they were described as \\"the noblest of any in Europe\\". Within the grounds, overlooking the lake, is an unusual turfed amphitheatre. A feature in the grounds is the Belvedere Tower, designed by Vanbrugh for the Duke of Newcastle. The tower is unusual in that what appear to be windows, are actually bricks painted black and white. It is now owned by Claremont Fan Court School, which is situated alongside the gardens. In 1949 the landscape garden was donated to the National Trust for stewardship and protection. A restoration programme was launched in 1975 following a significant donation by the Slater Foundation. The garden is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Capability Brown's mansion, built for Lord Clive of India When the Duke of Newcastle died in 1768, his widow sold the estate to Robert Clive, founder of Britain's Indian Empire. Although the great house was then little more than fifty years old, it was aesthetically and politically out of fashion. Lord Clive decided to demolish the house and commissioned Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown to build the present Palladian mansion on higher and dryer ground. Brown, more accomplished as a landscape designer than architect, took on his future son-in-law Henry Holland as a junior partner owing to the scale of the project. John Soane, later Sir John Soane, was employed in Holland's office at this time and worked on the project as a draftsman and junior designer.du Prey, Pierre de la Ruffiniere, 'John Soane: the making of an architect'. London, University of Chicago Press. 1982. pp29-37 Holland's interiors for Claremont owe much to the contemporary work of Robert Adam. Clive, by now a fabulously rich nabob, is reputed to have spent over ¬£100,000 on rebuilding the house and a complete remodelling of the celebrated pleasure grounds. However, Clive never lived here, as he died in 1774--the year that the house was finished. The estate then passed through a rapid succession of owners, being first sold 'for not more than one third of what the house and alterations had cost',Cromwell, T. 'An excursion into the County of Surrey',London, Longman et al, 1821 to Viscount Galway, then to the Earl of Tyrconnel and finally to Charles Rose Ellis. A large map now situated in \\"Clive's room\\" of the mansion is entitled \\"Claremont Palace\\"; the map shows the mansion and the surrounding grounds, giving a detailed overview of the campus. The map probably dates back to the 1860s when the mansion was frequently occupied by Queen Victoria, thus it being christened a palace; however, the exact date is still unknown. Royal residence In 1816 Claremont was bought by the British Nation by an Act of Parliament as a wedding present for George IV's daughter Princess Charlotte and her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. At that time the estate was valued to Parliament at 60,000 pounds: \\"Mr Huskisson stated that it had been agreed to purchase the house and demesnes of Clermont... The valuation of the farms, farm-houses, and park, including 350 acres of land, was 36,000/; the mansion, 19,000/; and the furniture, 6,000/; making together 60,000/. The mansion, which is in good repair, could not be built now for less than 91,000/.\\"Entry for Thurs June 20. The European Magazine, and London Review, Volume 70. London, James Asperne for The Philological Society, July to Dec 1816 To the nation's great sorrow, however, Princess Charlotte, who was second in line to the throne, was, after two miscarriages, to die there after giving birth to a stillborn son in November the following year. This sorrow is expressed in Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem published in Forget Me Not, 1824. Although Leopold retained ownership of Claremont until his death in 1865, he left the house in 1831 when he became the first King of the Belgians. Mausoleum of Princess Charlotte Claremont House, ca. 1860 Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor to Claremont both as a child and later as an adult when Leopold, her doting uncle, lent her the house. She, in turn, lent the house to the exiled French king and queen Louis-Philippe and Marie-Amelie (the parents-in-law of Leopold I of Belgium) after the revolutions of 1848. The exiled king died here in 1850. In 1857 Offenbach and his Bouffes company performed three of his op√©ras bouffes there for Marie Amelie and her sons during an eight-week tour of England.Lamb, Andrew. \\"Offenbach's conquest of London\\", About the House, Vol. 5, No. 12, Summer 1980, pp. 35‚Äì39. The article was originally published by the Offenbach 1980 Centenary Committee, London. In 1870, Queen Victoria commissioned Francis John Williamson to sculpt a marble memorial to Charlotte and Leopold which was erected inside the house. (The memorial was subsequently moved to St George's Church, Esher.) Victoria bought Claremont for her fourth and youngest son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, when he married Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1882. The Duke and Duchess of Albany had two children--Alice and Charles. In 1900, the latter became the Duke of Saxe- Coburg and a German citizen. Claremont should have passed to the Duke of Saxe- Coburg on his mother's death in 1922, but because he had served as a German general in the First World War, the British government disallowed the inheritance. Claremont was accordingly confiscated and sold by the Public Trustee to shipping magnate Sir William Corry, director of the Cunard Line. Two years after Sir William's death in 1926, it was bought by Eugen Spier, a wealthy German financier. In 1930 the Mansion stood empty and was marked for demolition when it was bought, together with the Belvedere, the stables and of parkland, by the Governors of a south London school, later renamed Claremont School and since 1978 known as Claremont Fan Court School. The National Trust The National Trust acquired of the Claremont estate in 1949. In 1975, with a grant from the Slater Foundation, it set about restoring the eighteenth-century landscape garden. Now the Claremont Landscape Garden displays the successive contributions of the great landscape gardeners who worked on it: Sir John Vanbrugh, Charles Bridgeman, William Kent and Capability Brown. In 1996 the school celebrated the National Trust's centenary by opening a feature of the grounds which had not previously been accessible to the garden's visitors: the 281-year-old Belvedere Tower.

He is best known for the 1986 Atari ST game Starglider and helping to design the Super FX chip used in Star Fox for the Super NES. Early career San received his first computer, a TRS-80, at the age of twelve in 1978 from his father, who had a career in exporting the belongings of immigrants at the time. San first became interested in video game development at a young age after playing a Multi-user dungeon (MUD) in the 1970s. Within a year he taught himself assembly language for several microprocessors. San founded Argonaut Software as a teenager in high school at JFS as a way to get software consulting jobs with large companies. He worked on security systems with British Telecom and Acorn. In 1984, he started developing his first game, Skyline Attack for the Commodore 64, and also co-wrote a book, Quantum Theory, about the Sinclair QL. He became a wizard (admin) at Essex MUD, the world's first multiplayer online role-playing game. San's late-1986 game Starglider for the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga sold hundreds of thousands of copies (earning him ¬£2 per copy in royalties). The money helped launch Argonaut as a larger company that started hiring other people in 1986. Argonaut growth and decline In the late 1980s, Argonaut signed a deal with Nintendo. San attracted Nintendo's attention because Argonaut was the first developer to successfully design 3D modelling on the NES and the Game Boy. X was published by Nintendo as the first 3D Game Boy game. San helped develop the first 3D graphics accelerator known as the Super FX chip that made Star Fox (released as Starwing in Europe) possible on the Super NES. In 1996, Argonaut received external funding from Apax Partners and was listed publicly on the London Stock Exchange in 2000. San's stake was reduced from 90% in 1996 to almost 50% post Argonaut Games' IPO in March 2000. San also helped found ARC International when it was spun out from Argonaut in 1998 and was its largest shareholder on IPO. San made substantial share sales during the flotation by Goldman Sachs and Warburg and in 2007 fully exited ARC. Between 1999 and 2002, San funded Codeplay and is currently the majority shareholder. San received an OBE in 2002, the first explicitly awarded for services to the video game industry. After announcing a substantial loss in August 2004, Argonaut Group PLC suspended trading of its shares in October and appointed administrators for Argonaut Software Ltd, Morpheme Ltd and Just Add Monsters Ltd‚Äîthe wholly owned subsidiaries of the PLC. The administrators sold Morpheme and Just Add Monsters back to Jez San and the other founders as ongoing businesses, while Argonaut Software Ltd was eventually liquidated. Post-Argonaut In November 2004, Just Add Monsters became Ninja Theory and continued the development of PlayStation 3 first-party game Heavenly Sword, which debuted three years later in September 2007. Also in 2004, Morpheme became Morpheme Wireless Ltd for a while before San left, was eventually consumed by Eidos/SCi before being shut down in 2009. After taking a hiatus from the video game industry in 2004, San founded Crunchy Frog Ltd, which in 2005 became online poker company PKR. San served as President, having hired his replacement with CEO Malcolm Graham, formerly of the Ritz Casino and AntFactory. PKR was a 3D online poker site that operated in legal territories in Europe, Asia, and Canada but did not operate in the US, where online gambling was a grey area. In May 2017, PKR went into administration. San was only an investor at the time of its collapse and expressed sorrow at seeing his creation fold. In 2008, San co-founded mobile application developer and publisher Origin8 with game industry colleague Foo Katan. The company produces iPhone and BlackBerry software, and has offices in London. San is a life member of BAFTA, and was an advisory board member of the GDC and TIGA for several years.

Biography  Galindo was the son of Aznar Gal√≠ndez I (and his wife, a woman of unknown name), who had been Count of Arag√≥n from 809 to 820, when a practical joke played by Galindo on his brother-in-law Garc√≠a Gal√≠ndez led the latter to enlist the support of the Pamplona in usurping the county. Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa Aznar was compensated by French king Louis the Pious with the counties of Urgell, Cerdanya, and Conflent. Galindo received these counties from his father sometime before 833, in which year he usurped the counties of Pallars and Ribagorza. For this action he was dispossessed of Urgell and Cerdagne by Louis in 834, and was subsequently ejected from Pallars and Ribagorza by the Counts of Toulouse. Upon the heirless death in 844 of count Galindo Garc√©s, son of his father's rival, Galindo was allowed to assume the countship of Arag√≥n in exchange for recognition of the suzerainty of Pamplona over the formerly-French county.  Personal life  Galindo Azn√°rez and an unknown woman had a son, Aznar Gal√≠ndez II, his successor. An 867 charter mentions a son-in-law, king Sancho, suggesting that a daughter of Galindo married Sancho Garc√©s, younger son of Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez of Pamplona, and by him became mother of his son, Aznar S√°nchez of Larraun.Ubieto Arteta, Antonio (1967). ¬øUn nuevo rey pamplon√©s para el siglo IX?

The architectural contest for the Palace of the Soviets (1931‚Äì1933) was won by Boris Iofan's neoclassical concept, subsequently revised by Iofan, Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Gelfreikh into a skyscraper. If built, it would have become the world's tallest structure of its time. Construction started in 1937, and was terminated by the German invasion in 1941. In 1941‚Äì1942, its steel frame was disassembled for use in fortifications and bridges. Construction was never resumed. In 1958, the foundations of the Palace were converted into what would become the world's largest open-air swimming pool, the Moskva Pool. The cathedral was rebuilt in 1995‚Äì2000.Russian: Cathedral of Christ the Savior, official site History page A nearby subway station, built in 1935 as Palace of the Soviets station, was renamed Kropotkinskaya in 1957. History of the concept Renaissance Revival: Doge's Palace concept, Vladimir Shchuko The Congress of Soviets officially established the Soviet Union in December 1922. Sergey Kirov, speaking at the Congress, proposed building a congress palace \\"on the sites of palaces once owned by bankers, landlords, and tsars\\". Very soon, Kirov said, existing halls would be too small to fit the delegates from new republics of the Union. The palace \\"will be just another push for the European proletariat, still dormant...to realize that we came for good and forever, that the ideas... of communism are as deeply rooted here as the wells drilled by Baku oilers\\".Russian: Kirov's speech transcript, December 30, 1922 Moscow Museum of Architecture, www.muar.ru quoting 1957 official edition In 1924 the death of Vladimir Lenin and the construction of the temporary Lenin's Mausoleum resulted in a national campaign to build Lenin memorials across the country. Viktor Balikhin, a graduate student at Vkhutemas, proposed to install Lenin's memorial on top of a Comintern building, on the site of Christ the Savior Cathedral. \\"Arc lamps will flood the villages, towns, parks and squares, calling everyone to honor Lenin even at night...\\"Russian: Extract from Balikhin's article, www.artchronica.ru, May 2002 Balikhin's concept, forgotten for a while, emerged later in Boris Iofan's design. Demolition of the cathedral Six years later, in February 1931, the State declared the first contest for the Palace of the Soviets, distributing preliminary proposals to 15 architectural workshops (avant-garde & traditional architects). This contest ended in May 1931, with no winners. On June 2, a conference of party elders identified the site of the future palace and condemned the cathedral. This was formally endorsed on July 16 by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union commission. July 18 (the day when Izvestia announced the 2nd, international contest), state commissioners started an inventory count of Cathedral properties. A small fraction of them were removed and stored at state expense and the expense of Donskoy Monastery; the rest perished. Demolition began on August 18; on December 5, the structure was finally destroyed in 2 rounds of explosions.Time Magazine, December 14, 1931, mentioned demolition by liquid air cartridges; this isn't corroborated by current Russian sources www.time.com Hauling out the rubble took more than a year.Russian: Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, official site Destruction page Public contest The second, public, international contest was declared on July 18, 1931. A total of 272 concepts were collected, including 160 architectural works (136 Soviet, 24 foreign). The contest attracted international architects like Le Corbusier, Joseph Urban, Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn, and Armando Brasini, Boris Iofan's Italian teacher;English: Brasini Exhibition brief, www.muar.ru American entries were coordinated by Albert Kahn.Russian: –ú. –ú–∞—Ä–∫—É—à–∞, –î. –•–º–µ–ª—å–Ω–∏—Ü–∫–∏–π, \\"–ö–æ–Ω–µ—Ü —É—Ç–æ–ø–∏–∏ ‚Äì –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä—Å –Ω–∞ –î–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤ –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ\\", www.archi.ru, July 2005 It was the foreigner Brasini who literally expressed the idea of \\"Lenin atop the skyscraper\\" in the most clear form.Brasini Exhibits: Palace of the Soviets www.muar.ru Enormous publicity followed the project.

Decision The international contest was followed by two more rounds of closed competition. The third contest (March‚ÄìJuly 1932) round invited 15 design teams, the fourth (July 1932‚ÄìFebruary 1933) invited only five. On May 10, 1933, Boris Iofan's draft was declared the winner. A duo of neoclassicist architects, Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Gelfreikh, were assigned to Iofan's team, and the design became known as the Iofan‚ÄìSchuko‚ÄìGelfreikh draft. Recently published correspondence between Joseph Stalin and Lazar Kaganovich, however, pinpoints the moment of selection as no later than August 1932. On August 7, Stalin wrote a memo to Kaganovich, Vyacheslav Molotov and Kliment Voroshilov, clearly naming Iofan's draft as the best, and proposing changes: *Drive the main tower upward, like a column (as Iofan did in his first entry) *Make it as tall as the Eiffel tower or even taller *Crown the column with a brightly lit Hammer and Sickle *Place monuments to Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in front of the buildingKhmelnitsky, ch.2, quoting Russian edition of \\"–°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω –∏ –ö–∞–≥–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á: –ü–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞, 1931‚Äì1936 –≥–≥.\\", M, 2001, p.259, Iofan‚ÄìSchuko‚ÄìGelfreikh design Iofan's original draft was crowned with a relatively small statue of \\"The Free Proletarian\\". In August 1932, as is clear from Stalin's memo, this statue disappeared from his draft, and Stalin personally intervened to correct the omission. A taller tower and Lenin's statue appeared after the fourth contest, in response to Stalin's public speech: \\"The Palace of the Soviets is a monument to Lenin. Don't be scared of height; go for it.\\"Khmelnitsky, ch.2, quotes a 1940 edition of \\"Palace of the Soviets\\" by N.Atarov In the process, the total height increased from to .

Foundation slab and frame Construction The foundation was completed in 1939. The builders drove a perimeter of steel piles, excavated the pit, demolished and hauled out the old cathedral foundations. The new foundation was a slightly concave concrete slab with concentric vertical rings, intended to carry the main hall columns. By June 1941, the steel frame for the lower levels was erected. Then World War II interfered: the steel frame was cut in 1941 and 1942 and used for Moscow's defense fortifications and railroad bridges. The empty foundation stood unused, filled with seepage water, but well guarded, until 1958. Meanwhile, Iofan's team, relocated to Sverdlovsk, continued perfecting the design. After the war, Iofan produced another iteration of the original concept, this time incorporating the Victory theme, literally: interior halls were decorated with Order of Victory motifs. These drafts remained unused; construction on the old site never resumed. Iofan bid for the design of the Sparrow Hills Skyscraper, but lost to Lev Rudnev. Rudnev and other post-war architects designed their towers as if the Palace existed, referencing all major projects to the Palace skyline. As an example, 1947 placement map for the Moscow Skyscrapers is centered on the Palace.

A nearby metro station, a 1935 award-winning design by Alexey Dushkin, was named Palace of the Soviets and renamed Kropotkinskaya in 1957. As soon as the 1934 Iofan-Shuko-Gelfreikh draft was published, the Palace became a symbol in Soviet art, appearing in propaganda pictures such as those by Alexander Deineka. The unbuilt Palace animation was inserted in films (including the 1944 Six o'clock after the war made when the Mosfilm studio was evacuated to Tashkent). Images of the unbuilt Palace were copied onto real buildings like the 1937 North River Terminal. From 1958 to 1960, the Palace foundations were cleared of rubble and converted to the open-air Moskva Pool. The one-of-a-kind circular pool had a diameter of . The rebuilt cathdral in 2011. In the 1970s, the State ran an architectural contest for the new V. I. Lenin Museum on a nearby site between the Pushkin Museum and the Kremlin.

It is sometimes described as \\"tiger-striped\\", although the brindle pattern is more subtle than that of a tiger's coat. The streaks of color are irregular and darker than the base color of the coat, although very dark markings can be seen on a coat that is only slightly lighter. When there are light colored stripes on a darker coat, it's referred to as a \\"reverse brindle\\". Dogs Brindle coloration is less distinct on longer-haired dogs, like the Akita Inu. The brindle pattern may also take the place of tan in tricolor coats of some dog breeds (such as Basenjis). This coloration looks very similar to tricolor, and can be distinguished only at close range. Dogs of this color are often described as \\"trindle\\". It can also occur in combination with merle in the points, or as a brindle merle, in breeds such as the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, although the latter is not acceptable in the show ring. The \\"dark\\" markings are black or the dilutions gray (called blue) or brown (sometimes called red). It is not uncommon for a brindled Cairn Terrier to become progressively more black or silver as it ages.  Cats  A European domestic short-haired, female, brindled cat. Brindled domestic cats are also known as tortoiseshell cats, and in some cases, tabby cat. A domestic brindled cat is almost exclusively female.  Guinea pigs  Brindle is an old variety in guinea pigs. They are difficult to breed to perfection, as the black and red hairs should intermingle evenly all over. Brindle guinea pigs' fur type is Abyssinian (rosetted).  Horses  A reverse brindle chestnut Brindle horse with dark bay base coat Brindle coloring in horses is extremely rare and in many cases is linked to spontaneous chimerism, resulting in an animal with two sets of DNA, with the brindle pattern being an expression of two different sets of equine coat color genes in one horse. This form is not heritable. In some horses the pattern seems to be inherited, indicating that one or more genes are responsible. One heritable brindle pattern in a family of American Quarter Horses was identified in 2016 and named Brindle1 (BR1). The Brindle1 phenotype has an X-linked, semidominant mode of inheritance. Female horses with this gene have a striped coat pattern, plus hairs from the stripes have a different texture as well as color, less straight and unrulier. Male horses have sparse manes and tails but do not show a striped coat texture pattern. A Brindle1 test is available. Brindle coloring consists of irregular stripes extending vertically over the horse's body and horizontally around the legs. Brindle horses can also have a dorsal stripe. It usually does not affect the head and legs as much as the body, with the heaviest concentrations of brindling being on the neck, shoulders and hindquarters. The coloring has been documented in the past. At the Zoological Museum of the Academy of Science in Leningrad, a Russian cab horse of brindle coloring from the early 19th century was mounted and put on display due to its rarity. in the Brindle Horses site  Description  The brindled pattern found in horses could be described as vertical stripes that are found along the neck, back, hindquarters, and upper legs. The horse's head is usually a solid color and is not affected by the striping. The brindled pattern has no effect on dark points on horses. Some brindle-colored horses are more eye-catching than others. With this rare coat pattern there is a base coat that covers the entire body of the horse. This base coat color can be any color. Recorded examples have been bay, chestnut, palomino, and dun. Earliest documented cases were said to have red dun or grulla as a base coat. Over top of the base color is either a lighter or darker color, giving the appearance of stripes. Other animals A brindled cow Brindle coloring exists in cattle. The Blue Wildebeest is a species of brindled gnu. Male brindled gnu at the Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa For crested geckos, the term \\"brindle\\" is used to describe a morph with darker stripes of color. Etymology and literature  The word brindle comes from brindled, originally , from an old Scandinavian word. The opening of Act Four, Scene One of William Shakespeare's Macbeth is often thought to refer to a brindled cat, because it contains the word \\"brinded\\": \\"Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.\\" However, in this context, the word \\"brinded\\" means branded, as if with fire. The Elizabethan word for \\"brindled\\" is \\"streaked.\\"Kenneth Muir, The Arden Shakespeare: Macbeth, 1962, p.108 *A brindle horse was mentioned in the book Riding Lessons by Sara Gruen. *\\"Jock of the Bushveld\\" was a brindle Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix and the companion of Percy FitzPatrick in their travels around the South African veldt in the 1880s. Fitzpatrick later collected tales of their adventures into a popular book of the same name. *Jack was a brindle bulldog featured in the Little House on the Prairie books by Laura Ingalls Wilder.

It is a part of the Mansfield Urban Area. The Head Offices of Ashfield District Council are located on Urban Road in the town centre. Overview Kirkby-in- Ashfield lies on the eastern edge of the Erewash Valley which separates Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Kirkby, as it is locally known, was originally a Danish settlement (Kirk-by translates as 'Church Town' in Danish) and is a collection of small villages including Old Kirkby, The Folly (East Kirkby), Nuncargate and Kirkby Woodhouse. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book and has two main churches: St Wilfrid's, a Norman church, which was gutted by fire on 6 January 1907 but quickly re-built; and St Thomas', built in the early 1910s in neo-gothic style. History Kirkby Castle Kirkby Castle is said to have dated back to at least the 13th Century. Its owner in 1284 Robert de Stuteville was fined by King Edward I for not attending the Royal summons. However in 1292 Robert clearly forgiven, hosted the king at the Castle to a nights stay.cite Web http://www.castlesfortsbattles.co.uk/midlands/kirkby_in_ashfield_castle.html created in 2019 retrieved on 3rd October 2020 Tudor times It was said that Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1530 travelled through Sutton in Ashfield having been recalled to London by King Henry VIII, before he stayed at nearby Kirkby Hardwick.Cite Web{{https://www.huthwaite- online.net/hucknall/historians/1978-clay-dove.php created on 23 January 2012 and retrieved on 21 August 2020 Railways and Coal mines Kirkby-in-Ashfield was once an important centre of coal mining and railways in west Nottinghamshire, with three active coal mines and several railway junctions.Railway Junction Diagrams 1914 page 143, Ian Allan Ltd reprint, The former Mansfield and Pinxton Railway from the Erewash Valley Line was joined here by the later Midland Railway line from Nottingham. The Great Central Railway main line passed to the south-west side of the town and had a double junction with the Great Northern Railway Leen Valley Extension line to Langwith Junction and the Mansfield Railway to Clipstone. The town rapidly expanded during the Victorian era. However the closure of the coal mines in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a major slump in the local economy, and the area then suffered a high level of socio-economic depression.

The railway tracks were re-opened to passengers in the 1990s as part of the Robin Hood Line, providing links to other North Nottinghamshire towns and to Nottingham where a transport interchange allows transfer to the trams of Nottingham Express Transit system.

Retrieved 21 September 2015 and is progressively changing from a traditional mining town to a commuter town for the surrounding areas, however the transition from industrial centre to dormitory town is in its infancy and will take some years to develop. Education The town has two large secondary schools, Ashfield School and Kirkby College. Politics Local politics have been dominated by the Labour Party for much of the 20th century; however, Ashfield attracted media attention in the late 1970s with a shock by-election win for the Conservatives. From the 2010 General Election until her stepping down in 2019, the MP was Gloria De Piero, best known for her work with GMTV. She took over from Geoff Hoon, one-time Secretary of State for Defence during the premiership of Tony Blair. She was elected with a very slim majority of 192 votes from the Liberal Democrats' Jason Zadrozny. In 2019, Conservative Lee Anderson won the seat. The town's most famous historical resident is Harold Larwood; the England cricketer who was born in Nuncargate in 1904, best known for his bodyline bowling in the Ashes Test series of 1932‚Äì33. The area around St Wilfrid's Church is designated a conservation area, and consists of former farm buildings built from local stone, some of which are listed. In the conservation area, at the junction of Church Street, Chapel Street and Sutton Road, is Kirkby Cross. This is the remains of a thirteenth-century village cross in dressed stone, and is a listed structure and designated ancient monument. It is thought the cross has been in place since 1218, some years before the village was granted a market and fair. It was nearly demolished by an articulated lorry in early December 1987, but has been restored. Leisure Portland Park On the edge of Kirkby is Portland Park (known to local people as \\"the quarries\\") a mixture of woodland and grassland areas which, together with a number of small ponds and streams, are home to a wide variety of wildlife. The visitor centre, which doubles up as local cafe The Wild Rabbit, was opened in October 1994, and is an environmentally friendly building and a centre of excellence for energy conservation. The building is also used as a popular venue for local live acts and other entertainment. The area surrounding The Wild Rabbit Cafe is a place of scientific interest due to the unique limestone outside to the rear of the cafe. In Popular Culture The 1981 series of TV programmes Shillingbury Tales were based on old Kirkby, as the writer Francis Essex's aunt lived nearby. The characters were based on locals who used to know his aunt. Filming was switched to Aldbury in Kent at the last minute because of costs and lack of space for filming. Notable people *The Rev.

One of the leading national issues during 1980 was the release of 66 Americans being held hostage in Iran since November 4, 1979.Abstract of pre-election news broadcast Reagan won the election. On the day of his inauguration‚Äîin fact, minutes after he concluded his 20 minute inaugural address‚Äîthe Islamic Republic of Iran announced the release of the hostages. The timing gave rise to an allegation that representatives of Reagan's presidential campaign had conspired with Iran to delay the release until after the election to thwart President Carter from pulling off an \\"October surprise\\". According to the allegation, the Reagan Administration subsequently rewarded Iran for its participation in the plot by supplying Iran with weapons via Israel and by unblocking Iranian government monetary assets in U.S. banks. After twelve years of varying media attention, both houses of the United States Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that the allegations lacked supporting documentation. Nevertheless, several individuals--most notably, former Iranian President Abulhassan Banisadr, former naval intelligence officer and U.S. National Security Council member Gary Sick, and Barbara Honegger, a former campaign staffer and White House analyst for Reagan and Bush--have stood by the allegation. Background In November 1979, a number of U.S. hostages were captured in Iran during the Iranian Revolution. The Iran hostage crisis continued into 1980; as the November 1980 presidential election approached, there were concerns in the Republican Party that a resolution of the crisis could constitute an \\"October surprise\\" which might give incumbent Jimmy Carter enough of an electoral boost to be re-elected. After the release of the hostages on 20 January 1981, mere minutes after Republican challenger Ronald Reagan's inauguration, some charged that the Reagan campaign had made a secret deal with the Iranian government whereby the Iranians would hold the hostages until after Reagan was elected and inaugurated. The issue of an \\"October Surprise\\" was brought up during an investigation by a House of Representatives Subcommittee into how the 1980 Reagan Campaign obtained debate briefing materials of then-President Carter. During that investigation, sometimes referred to as Debategate, the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee obtained access to Reagan Campaign documents. The documents included numerous references to a monitoring effort for any such October Surprise. The Subcommittee, chaired by former U.S. Rep. Donald Albosta (D‚ÄìMI), issued a comprehensive report on May 17, 1984, describing each type of information that was detected and its possible source. A section of the report was dedicated to the October Surprise issue. Origins The first printed instance of the October Surprise conspiracy theory has been attributed to a story in the December 2, 1980, issue of Executive Intelligence Review, a periodical published by followers of Lyndon LaRouche. Written by Robert Dreyfuss, the article cited \\"Iranian sources\\" in Paris as well as \\"Top level intelligence sources in Reagan's inner circle\\" as saying that Henry Kissinger met with representatives of Mohammad Beheshti during the week of November 12, 1980. The story claimed that \\"pro-Reagan British intelligence circles and the Kissinger faction\\" meeting with the Iranians six to eight weeks prior had interfered with \\"President Carter's efforts to secure an arms-for-hostage deal with Teheran.\\" The LaRouche movement returned to the story in the September 2, 1983 issue of New Solidarity, stating \\"The deal ... fell through when the hard-line mullahs boycotted the Majlis in late October.\\" The conspiracy theory garnered little attention until news of the Iran Contra affair broke in November 1986. John M. Barry of Newsweek has said that Iran-Contra \\"created fertile ground for the October Surprise theory\\". Scott D'Amico in Conspiracies and Conspiracy Theories in American History wrote that \\"[t]he arms-deal arrangement provided credence to those who believed Reagan was fulfilling his end of the October surprise pact with Khomeni.\\" In the November 24, 1986 issue of The New York Times, William Safire charged: \\"The geopolitical excuse offered now - that the ransom was a plan to influence post-Khomeini Iran - is a feeble cover-up. Robert McFarlane first approached the Reagan campaign in the summer of 1980 with an Iranian in tow who proposed to deliver our hostages to Mr. Reagan rather than President Carter, thereby swinging the U.S. election. The Reagan representatives properly recoiled, but Mr. McFarlane has had Iranian held hostages on the brain ever since.\\" Safire's piece was based upon information he solicited from Laurence Silberman in 1984 regarding a brief meeting four years earlier between Silberman, McFarlane, and Richard V. Allen with a Malaysian man who proposed a plan to contact someone who could influence Iran to delay the release of the hostages in order to embarrass the Carter administration.[32 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol'y 503. See also Dartmouth Alumni Magazine (Nov./Dec. 2008), at pp. 49-50.] Silberman later wrote: \\"Ironically, it was I who unwittingly initiated the so-called 'October Surprise' story, which grew into an utterly fantastic tale\\". An article by Bob Woodward and Walter Pincus a few days later in the November 29, 1986 The Washington Post said that United States officials tied to Reagan, well before the Iran Contra affair, considered an initiative to sell US-made military parts to Iran in exchange for the hostage held there. The House October Surprise Task Force credited the Woodward/Pincus article as raising \\"claims that would become keystones in the October Surprise theory.\\" The Miami Herald published an article by Alfonso Chardy on April 12, 1987 that McFarlane, Silberman, and Allen had met with a man claiming to represent the Iranian government and offering the release of the hostages. Chardy's article also quoted exiled former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr who said he had learned that Beheshti and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani were involved in negotiations with the Reagan campaign to delay the release of the hostages until Reagan became president. Chronology The House October Surprise Task Force outlined as \\"principal allegations\\" three supposed meetings between representatives of Reagan's campaign and Iranian government officials in the summer and fall of 1980 to delay the release of the hostages: 1) a meeting in Madrid during the summer, 2) a meeting at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington, D.C that autumn, and 3) a meeting in Paris in October. The Task Force characterized three other alleged meetings or contacts as \\"ancillary allegations\\": 1) a meeting at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. in early spring 1980, 2) a meeting at the Churchill Hotel in London in the summer of 1980, and 3) a meeting at the Sherry Netherlands Hotel in New York in January 1981. * March 1980: Jamshid Hashimi, international arms dealer, is visited by William Casey at Washington's Mayflower Hotel, who asks that a meeting be arranged with \\"someone in Iran who had authority to deal on the hostages\\".Joseph J. Trento, Prelude to Terror: Edwin P. Wilson and the Legacy of America's Private Intelligence Network (Carroll and Graf, 2005), 202‚Äì03. * March 21, 1980: Jamshid Hashimi and his brother Cyrus Hashimi meet at the latter's home.Trento, 203. * April 1980: Donald Gregg, a U.S. National Security Council aide with connections to George Bush, meets Cyrus Hashimi in New York's Shazam restaurant, near Hashimi's bank.Trento, 204. Former Iranian President Abolhassan Banisadr said in his 1991 book My Turn to Speak that he had \\"proof of contacts between Khomeini and the supporters of Ronald Reagan as early as the spring of 1980. ... Rafsanjani, Beheshti, and Ahmed Khomeini [the Ayatollah's son] played key roles.\\"Trento, 209. *Last week of July 1980: At a meeting in Madrid arranged by the Hashimi brothers that includes Robert Gray, a man identified as Donald Gregg, and Mahdi Karrubi, an Iranian politician, William Casey says that if Iran could assure that American hostages were well treated until their release and were released as a \\"gift\\" to the new administration, \\"the Republicans would be most grateful and 'would give Iran its strength back.'\\"Trento, 205, quoting Gary Sick, October Surprise (1991), 84. Karrubi says he has \\"no authority to make such a commitment.\\" * About August 12, 1980: Karrubi meets again with Casey, saying Khomeini has agreed to the proposal. Casey agrees the next day, naming Cyrus Hashimi as middleman to handle the arms transactions. More meetings are set for October. Cyrus Hashimi purchases a Greek ship and commences arms deliveries valued at $150 million from the Israeli port of Eilat to Bandar Abbas. According to CIA sources, Hashimi receives a $7 million commission. Casey is said to use an aide named Tom Carter in the negotiations.Trento, 205-07. * September 22, 1980: Iraq invades Iran. * Late September 1980: An expatriate Iranian arms dealer named Hushang Lavi claims he met with Richard V. Allen, the Reagan campaign's national security expert, Robert \\"Bud\\" McFarlane, and Lawrence Silberman, co- chairman of Ronald Reagan's foreign policy advisors during the campaign, and discussed the possible exchange of F-4 parts for American hostages, but Lavi says they asserted they \\"were already in touch with the Iranians themselves\\". *October 15‚Äì20: Meetings are held in Paris between emissaries of the Reagan/Bush campaign, with Casey as \\"key participant\\", and \\"high-level Iranian and Israeli representatives\\". *October 21: Iran, for reasons not explained, abruptly shifts its position in secret negotiations with the Carter administration and disclaims \\"further interest in receiving military equipment\\". (Congressional Record mirrored reprint) *October 21‚Äì23: Israel secretly ships F-4 fighter-aircraft tires to Iran, in violation of the U.S. arms embargo, and Iran disperses the hostages to different locations. *January 20, 1981: Hostages are formally released into United States custody after spending 444 days in captivity. The release takes place just minutes after Ronald Reagan is sworn in as president. Investigations Frontline The investigative journalism TV series Frontline produced a 1991 documentary which \\"investigate[d] startling new evidence about how both the Carter and Reagan camps may have tried to forge secret deals for [the Iranian] hostages during the 1980 presidential campaign. Gary Sick Gary Sick wrote an editorial for The New York Times in April 1991, and a book (October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan),Gary Sick. 1991. October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan. New York: Random House. published in November 1991, on the subject. Sick's credibility was boosted by the fact that he was a retired Naval Captain, served on Ford's, Carter's, and Reagan's National Security Council, and held high positions with many prominent organizations; moreover, he had authored a book recently on US-Iran relations (All Fall Down). Sick wrote that in October 1980, officials in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign, including future CIA Director William Casey, made a secret deal with Iran to delay the release of the American hostages until after the election; in return for this, the United States purportedly arranged for Israel to ship weapons to Iran. Sick admitted that \\"The story is tangled and murky, and it may never be fully unraveled.\\" He was unable to prove his claims, including that, in the days before the presidential election with daily press pools surrounding him and a public travel schedule, vice presidential candidate George H. W. Bush secretly left the country and met with Iranian officials in France to discuss the fate of the hostages. Danny Casolaro In August 1991, freelance writer Danny Casolaro (among others)Linsalata, Phil. The Octopus File, The Columbia Journalism Review, November/December 1991, accessed October 20, 2008. claimed to be almost ready to expose the alleged October surprise conspiracy, when he suddenly died a violent death in a hotel bathtub in Martinsburg, West Virginia, raising suspicions. He appeared to be traveling on leads for his investigation into the Inslaw Affair. His death was ruled a suicide. Newsweek Newsweek magazine also ran an investigation, reporting in November 1991 that most, if not all, of the charges made were groundless. Specifically, Newsweek found little evidence that the United States had transferred arms to Iran prior to Iran Contra, and was able to account for Bill Casey's whereabouts when he was allegedly at the Madrid meeting, saying that he was at a conference in London. Newsweek also alleged that the story was being heavily pushed within the LaRouche Movement.Making of a Myth, Newsweek; November 11, 1991 The New Republic Steven Emerson and Jesse Furman of The New Republic also looked into the allegations and reported, in November 1991, that \\"the conspiracy as currently postulated is a total fabrication\\". They were unable to verify any of the evidence presented by Sick and supporters, finding them to be inconsistent and contradictory in nature. They also pointed out that nearly every witness of Sick's had either been indicted or was under investigation by the Department of Justice. Like the Newsweek investigation, they had also debunked the claims of Reagan election campaign officials being in Paris during the timeframe that Sick specified, contradicting Sick's sources.The Conspiracy that Wasn't; Steven Emerson and Jesse Furman, The New Republic; November 18, 1991 An investigation by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting found that Emerson's evidence was incorrect, noting \\"Ironically, in media circles, it is Steve Emerson's dismissal of the October Surprise that turned out to be enduring ‚Äì even though much of his evidence turned out to be wrong.\\" Mark Ames noted that the article \\"relied on invented evidence later exposed as fake and disowned even by Emerson.\\" The Village Voice Retired CIA analyst and counter-intelligence officer Frank Snepp of The Village Voice reviewed Sick's allegations, publishing an article in February 1992. Snepp alleged that Sick had only interviewed half of the sources used in his book, and supposedly relied on hearsay from unreliable sources for large amounts of critical material. Snepp also discovered that Sick had sold the rights to his book to Oliver Stone in 1989. After going through evidence presented by Richard Brenneke, Snepp asserted that Brenneke's credit card receipts showed him to be in Portland, Oregon, during the time he claimed to be in Paris observing the secret meeting. Senate investigation The US Senate's November 1992 report concluded that \\"by any standard, the credible evidence now known falls far short of supporting the allegation of an agreement between the Reagan campaign and Iran to delay the release of the hostages.\\" House of Representatives investigation The House of Representatives' January 1993 report concluded \\"there is no credible evidence supporting any attempt by the Reagan presidential campaign‚Äîor persons associated with the campaign‚Äîto delay the release of the American hostages in Iran\\". The task force Chairman Lee H. Hamilton also added that the vast majority of the sources and material reviewed by the committee were \\"wholesale fabricators or were impeached by documentary evidence\\". The report also expressed the belief that several witnesses had committed perjury during their sworn statements to the committee, among them Richard Brenneke,search: i.e., Brenneke, (New York Times) who claimed to be a CIA agent.Emerson, Steve; \\"No October Surprise\\", American Journalism Review, University of Maryland, vol. 15, issue n2, ppg. 16‚Äì24, 1 March 1993 (fee) Allegations Former Iranian President Banisadr This accusation was made in Banisadr's 1989 memoir, which also claimed that Henry Kissinger plotted to set up a Palestinian state in the Iranian province of Khuzestan and that Zbigniew Brzezinski conspired with Saddam Hussein to plot Iraq's 1980 invasion of Iran. Foreign Affairs described the book as \\"a rambling, self-serving series of reminiscences\\" and \\"long on sensational allegations and devoid of documentation that might lend credence to Bani-Sadr's claims.\\"\\" Writing again in 2013 in the Christian Science Monitor, Banisadr reiterated and elaborated on his earlier statements: > I was deposed in June 1981 as a result of a coup against me.

While working for Reagan, she claims to have discovered information that made her believe that George H. W. Bush and William Casey had conspired to assure that Iran would not free the U.S. hostages until Jimmy Carter had been defeated in the 1980 presidential election, and she alleges that arms sales to Iran were a part of that bargain. In 1987, in the context of the Iran-Contra investigations, Honegger was reported as saying that shortly after 22 October 1980, when Iran abruptly changed the terms of its deal with Carter, a member of the Reagan campaign told her \\"We don't have to worry about an 'October surprise.' Dick cut a deal.\\", with \\"Dick\\" referring to Richard V. Allen. Kevin Phillips Political historian Kevin Phillips has been a proponent of the idea.

The primary function of these clocks is to awaken people from their night's sleep or short naps; they are sometimes used for other reminders as well. Most use sound; some use light or vibration. Some have sensors to identify when a person is in a light stage of sleep, in order to avoid waking someone who is deeply asleep, which causes tiredness, even if the person has had adequate sleep. To turn off the sound or light, a button or handle on the clock is pressed; most clocks automatically turn off the alarm if left unattended long enough. A classic analog alarm clock has an extra hand or inset dial that is used to specify the time at which the alarm will ring. Alarm clocks are also used in mobile phones, watches, and computers. Many alarm clocks have radio receivers that can be set to start playing at specified times, and are known as clock radios. Some alarm clocks can set multiple alarms. A progressive alarm clock can have different alarms for different times (see next-generation alarms) and play music of the user's choice. Most modern televisions, computers, mobile phones and digital watches have alarm functions that turn on or sound alerts at a specific time.  Types   Traditional analogue clocks  Traditional mechanical alarm clocks have one or two bells that ring by means of a mainspring that powers a gear to quickly move a hammer back and forth between the two bells or between the interior sides of a single bell. In some models, the metal cover at back of the clock itself also functions as the bell. In an electronically operated bell-style alarm clock, the bell is rung by an electromagnetic circuit and armature to turn the circuit on and off repeatedly.  Digital  Digital alarm clocks can make other noises. Simple battery-powered alarm clocks make a loud buzzing or beeping sound to wake a sleeper, while novelty alarm clocks can speak, laugh, sing, or play sounds from nature.  History  The Obelisk of Theodosius, detail of the pedestal: Theodosius I offers laurels of victory; we can see the water organ of Ctesibius, in the lower right-hand corner. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato (428‚Äì348 BC) was said to possess a large water clock with an unspecified alarm signal similar to the sound of a water organ; he used it at night, possibly for signaling the beginning of his lectures at dawn (Athenaeus 4.174c).; The Hellenistic engineer and inventor Ctesibius (fl. 285‚Äì222 BC) fitted his clepsydras with dial and pointer for indicating the time, and added elaborate \\"alarm systems, which could be made to drop pebbles on a gong, or blow trumpets (by forcing bell-jars down into water and taking the compressed air through a beating reed) at pre-set times\\" (Vitruv 11.11). The late Roman statesman Cassiodorus (c. 485‚Äì585) advocated in his rulebook for monastic life the water clock as a useful alarm for the 'soldiers of Christ' (Cassiod. Inst. 30.4 f.). The Christian rhetorician Procopius described in detail prior to 529 a complex public striking clock in his home town Gaza which featured an hourly gong and figures moving mechanically day and night.Dohrn-van Rossum, Gerhard, \\"Clocks\\", Brill's New Pauly, edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider, 2009 In China, a striking clock was devised by the Buddhist monk and inventor Yi Xing (683‚Äì727).Joseph Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, pp. 473‚Äì5 The Chinese engineers Zhang Sixun and Su Song integrated striking clock mechanisms in astronomical clocks in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively.Joseph Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, p. 165 A striking clock outside of China was the water-powered clock tower near the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria, which struck once every hour. It was constructed by the Arab engineer al-Kaysarani in 1154. In 1235, an early monumental water-powered alarm clock that \\"announced the appointed hours of prayer and the time both by day and by night\\" was completed in the entrance hall of the Mustansiriya Madrasah in Baghdad. From the 14th century, some clock towers in Western Europe were also capable of chiming at a fixed time every day; the earliest of these was described by the Florentine writer Dante Alighieri in 1319.Joseph Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, p. 445 The most famous original striking clock tower still standing is possibly the one in St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square, Venice. The St Mark's Clock was assembled in 1493, by the famous clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia, where his father Gian Paolo Rainieri had already constructed another famous device in 1481. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell (h. 1,56 m., diameter m. 1,27), which was put on the top of the tower where it was alternatively beaten by the Due Mori (Two Moors), two bronze statues (h. 2,60) handling a hammer. User-settable mechanical alarm clocks date back at least to 15th-century Europe. These early alarm clocks had a ring of holes in the clock dial and were set by placing a pin in the appropriate hole.p. 249, The Grove encyclopedia of decorative arts, Gordon Campbell, vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2006, .\\"Monastic Alarm Clocks, Italian\\" , entry, Clock Dictionary. The first American alarm clock was created in 1787 by Levi Hutchins in Concord, New Hampshire. This device he made only for himself however, and it only rang at 4 AM, in order to wake him for his job. The French inventor Antoine Redier was the first to patent an adjustable mechanical alarm clock, in 1847. Alarm clocks, like almost all other consumer goods in the United States, ceased production in the spring of 1942, as the factories which made them were converted over to war work during World War II, but they were one of the first consumer items to resume manufacture for civilian use, in November 1944. By that time, a critical shortage of alarm clocks had developed due to older clocks wearing out or breaking down. Workers were late for, or missed completely, their scheduled shifts in jobs critical to the war effort. In a pooling arrangement overseen by the Office of Price Administration, several clock companies were allowed to start producing new clocks, some of which were continuations of pre-war designs, and some of which were new designs, thus becoming among the first \\"postwar\\" consumer goods to be made, before the war had even ended. The price of these \\"emergency\\" clocks was, however, still strictly regulated by the Office of Price Administration. The first radio alarm clock was invented by James F. Reynolds, in the 1940s and another design was also invented by Paul L. Schroth Sr.  Clock radio  A mid 1940s alarm clock radio with AM radio stations only. A clock radio is an alarm clock and radio receiver integrated in one device. The clock may turn on the radio at a designated time to wake the user, and usually includes a buzzer alarm. Typically, clock radios are placed on the bedside stand. Some models offer dual alarm for awakening at different times and \\"snooze\\", usually a large button on the top that silences the alarm and sets it to resume sounding a few minutes later. Some clock radios also have a \\"sleep\\" timer, which turns the radio on for a set amount of time (usually around one hour). This is useful for people who like to fall asleep while listening to the radio. Newer clock radios are available with other music sources such as iPod, iPhone, and/or audio CD. When the alarm is triggered, it can play a set radio station or the music from a selected music source to awaken the sleeper. Some models come with a dock for iPod/iPhone that also charges the device while it is docked. They can play AM/FM radio, iPod/iPhone or CD like a typical music player as well (without being triggered by the alarm function). A few popular models offer \\"nature sounds\\" like rain, forest, wind, sea, waterfall etc., in place of the buzzer. A modern clock radio features a radio/iPod/buzzer as alarms. Clock radios are powered by AC power from the wall socket. In the event of a power interruption, older electronic digital models used to reset the time to midnight (00:00) and lose alarm settings. This would cause failure to trigger the alarm even if the power is restored. Many newer clock radios feature a battery backup to maintain the time and alarm settings. Some advanced radio clocks (not to be confused with clocks with AM/FM radios) have a feature which sets the time automatically using signals from atomic clock-synced time signal radio stations such as WWV, making the clock accurate and immune to time reset due to power interruptions.  Alarms in technology   Computer alarms Alarm clock software programs have been developed for personal computers. There are Web-based alarm clocks, some of which may allow a virtually unlimited number of alarm times (i.e. Personal information manager) and personalized tones. However, unlike mobile phone alarms, they have some limitations. They do not work when the computer is shut off or in sleep mode.  Mobile phone alarms  Many modern mobile phones feature built-in alarm clocks that do not need the phone to be switched on for the alarm to ring off. Some of these mobile phones feature the ability for the user to set the alarm's ringtone, and in some cases music can be downloaded to the phone and then chosen to play for waking.  Next-generation alarms  Sleeptracker, an alarm clock that tracks sleep phases Scientific studies on sleep having shown that sleep stage at awakening is an important factor in amplifying sleep inertia. Alarm clocks involving sleep stage monitoring appeared on the market in 2005. The alarm clocks use sensing technologies such as EEG electrodes and accelerometers to wake people from sleep. Dawn simulators are another technology meant to mediate these effects. Sleepers can become accustomed to the sound of their alarm clock if it has been used for a period of time, making it less effective. Due to progressive alarm clocks' complex waking procedure, they can deter this adaptation due to the body needing to adapt to more stimuli than just a simple sound alert.  Alarm signals for impaired hearing  The deaf and hard of hearing are often unable to perceive auditory alarms when asleep. They may use specialized alarms, including alarms with flashing lights instead of or in addition to noise. Alarms which can connect to vibrating devices (small ones inserted into pillows, or larger ones placed under bedposts to shake the bed) also exist.  Time switches  Time switches can be used to turn on anything that will awaken a sleeper, and can therefore be used as alarms. Lights, bells, and radio and TV sets can easily be used.Walter T. Grondzik, Alison G. Kwok, Benjamin Stein Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings, John Wiley and Sons, 2009 page 1201 More elaborate devices have also been used, such as machines that automatically prepare tea or coffee. A sound is produced when the drink is ready, so the sleeper awakes to find the freshly brewed drink waiting. An alarm clock as the emblem of the Nationalist Congress Party in India.

The hall was demolished to make way for Ascot Drive industrial estate in 1938, whilst the chapel managed to survive until 1952. Looking west along Osmaston Park Road from the Spider Bridge The area was called The Osmaston Triangle, an area of Derby bounded by a railway line, Osmaston Road and Osmaston Park Road, with the two roads joining at the \\"Spider Bridge\\" in Allenton. In 2003 a major project called the 'Osmaston Housing Improvement Zone' was approved, designed to improve the condition of the local housing. This work included much of the older, privately owned terraced houses in the area with 20 empty properties brought back into use and 93 low-income families helped with essential repairs.

He wrote under the Gaelic form of his name Seosamh Mac Cathmhaoil (also Seosamh MacCathmhaoil) Campbell being a common anglicization of the old Irish name MacCathmhaoil. He is now remembered best for words he supplied to traditional airs, such as My Lagan Love and Gartan Mother's Lullaby; his verse was also set to music by Arnold Bax and Ivor Gurney. Life He was born in Belfast, into a Catholic and Irish nationalist family from County Down. He was educated at St Malachy's College, Belfast. After working for his father he taught for a while. He travelled to Dublin in 1902, meeting leading nationalist figures. His literary activities began with songs, as a collector in Antrim and working with the composer Herbert Hughes. He was then a founder of the Ulster Literary Theatre in 1904. He contributed a play, The Little Cowherd of Slainge, and several articles to its journal Uladh edited by Bulmer Hobson. The Little Cowherd of Slainge was performed by the ULT at the Clarence Place Hall in Belfast on May 4, 1905, along with Lewis Purcell's The Enthusiast. He moved to Dublin in 1905, failed to find work and the following year (1906) he moved to London where he was involved in Irish literary activities while working as a teacher.Saunders, Norah & A.A.Kelly, Joseph Campbell Poet and Nationalist 1879-1944, Dublin, Wolfhound Press, 1988. p.38 He married in 1910 Nancy Maude, and they moved shortly to Dublin, and then County Wicklow. His play Judgement was performed at the Abbey Theatre in April, 1912. He took part as a supporter in the Easter Rising of 1916, doing rescue work. The following year he published a translation from Irish of the short stories of Patrick Pearse, one of the leaders of the Rising. He became a Sinn F√©in Councillor in Wicklow in 1921. Later in the Irish Civil War he was on the Republican side, and was interned in 1922/3. His marriage broke up, and he emigrated to the United States in 1925. There he lived in New York City. He lectured at Fordham University, and worked in academic Irish studies, founding the University's School of Irish Studies in 1928, which lasted four years. He was the editor of The Irish Review, a short lived (April, May and July 1934) \\"magazine of Irish expression\\". Business manager was George G. Lennon, former Officer Commanding of the Co.

Two subspecies are known: the western Hermann's tortoise (T. h. hermanni ) and the eastern Hermann's tortoise (T. h. boettgeri ). Sometimes mentioned as a subspecies, T. h. peleponnesica is not yet confirmed to be genetically different from T. h. boettgeri. Etymology The specific epithet, hermanni, honors French naturalist Johann Hermann.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Testudo hermanni, p. 121; T. h. boettgeri, p. 29). The subspecific name, boettgeri, honors German herpetologist Oskar Boettger. Geographic range Testudo hermanni can be found throughout southern Europe. The western population (T. h. hermanni) is found in eastern Spain, southern France, the Balearic islands, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, south and central Italy (Tuscany). The eastern population (T. h. boettgeri ) inhabits Serbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Turkey and Greece, while T. h. hercegovinensis populates the coasts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Montenegro. Description and systematics Hermann's tortoises are small to medium-sized tortoises from southern Europe. Young animals and some adults have attractive black and yellow-patterned carapaces, although the brightness may fade with age to a less distinct gray, straw, or yellow coloration. They have slightly hooked upper jaws and, like other tortoises, possess no teeth, just strong, horny beaks. Their scaly limbs are greyish to brown, with some yellow markings, and their tails bear a spur (a horny spike) at the tip. Adult males have particularly long and thick tails, and well-developed spurs, distinguishing them from females. The eastern subspecies T. h. boettgeri is much larger than the western T. h. hermanni, reaching sizes up to in length. A specimen of this size may weigh . T. h. hermanni rarely grows larger than .

Though some factors indicate this might be correct,Fritz et al. (2005). the data at hand are not unequivocally in support and the relationships between Hermann's and the Russian tortoise among each other and to the other species placed in Testudo are not robustly determined. Hence, it seems doubtful that the new genus will be accepted for now. The elevation of the subspecies to full species was tentatively rejected under the biological species concept at least, as there still seems significant gene flow.Fritz et al. (2006). Of note, the rate of evolution as measured by mutations accumulating in the mtDNA differs markedly, with the eastern populations have evolved faster. This is apparently due to stronger fragmentation of the population on the mountainous Balkans during the last ice age. While this has no profound implications for taxonomy of this species, apart from suggesting that two other proposed subspecies are actually just local forms at present, it renders the use of molecular clocks in Testudo even more dubious and unreliable than they are for turtles in general.Avise et al. (1992).van der Kuyl et al. (2005). T. h. hermanni The subspecies T. h. hermanni includes the former subspecies T. h. robertmertensi and has a number of local forms. It has a highly arched shell with an intensive coloration, with its yellow coloration making a strong contrast to the dark patches. The colors wash out somewhat in older animals, but the intense yellow is often maintained. The underside has two connected black bands along the central seam. The coloration of the head ranges from dark green to yellowish, with isolated dark patches. A particular characteristic is a yellow fleck on the cheek found in most specimens, although not in all; T. h. robertmertensi is the name of a morph with very prominent cheek spots. Generally, the forelegs have no black pigmentation on their undersides. The base of the claws is often lightly colored. The tail in males is larger than in females and possesses a spike. Generally, the shell protecting the tail is divided. A few specimens can be found with undivided shells, similar to the Greek tortoise. Image:Varoises1.jpg|Var colouring Image:Pugliese.jpg|Apulian colouring Image:Rosella2.JPG|Sardinian colouring T. h. boettgeri The subspecies T. h. hercegovinensis, known as the Dalmatian tortoise, (Balkans coast) and the local T. h. peloponnesica (southwestern Peloponnesus coast) are now included here; they constitute local forms that are not yet geographically or in other ways reproductively isolated and apparently, derive from relict populations of the last ice age. The eastern Hermann's tortoises also have arched, almost round carapaces, but some are notably flatter and more oblong. The coloration is brownish with a yellow or greenish hue and with isolated black flecks. The coloring tends to wash out quite strongly in older animals. The underside is almost always solid horn color and has separate black patches on either side of the central seam. The head is brown to black, with fine scales. The forelegs similarly possess fine scales. The limbs generally have five claws, which are darkly colored at their base. The hind legs are noticeably thicker than the forelegs, almost plump. The particularly strong tail ends in a spike, which may be very large in older male specimens. Females have noticeably smaller tail spikes, which are slightly bent toward the body. They can vary in size, but don't grow a huge amount.

They then roam about the Mediterranean meadows of their habitat in search of food. They determine which plants to eat by the sense of smell. In captivity, they eat a variety of wildflowers, however care must be taken regarding which are made available, as some flowers such as buttercups are toxic to them. Certain plants such as dandelion and kale are high in oxcilic acid, which can build up over time causing renal failure, it is therefore important to carefully monitor their diet and give a varied selection of wildflower leaves. All pre prepared food pellets are bad for herman tortoises, proving addictive, often resulting in unnatural growth rates and the refusal to eat natural foods. Certain foods may prove toxic despite the tortoises enjoyment of them, including legums, tomatoes and cabbage. The animals eat small amounts of fruits as supplementary nutrition, however this should only be given occasionally Around midday, the sun becomes too hot for the tortoises, so they return to their hiding places. They have a good sense of direction to enable them to return. In the late afternoon, they leave their shelters again and return to feeding. In late February, Hermann's tortoises emerge from under bushes or old rotting wood, where they spend the winter months hibernating, buried in a bed of dead leaves. Immediately after surfacing from their winter resting place, Hermann's tortoises commence courtship and mating. Courtship is a rough affair for the female, which is pursued, rammed, and bitten by the male, before being mounted. Aggression is also seen between rival males during the breeding season, which can result in ramming contests. Between May and July, female Hermann's tortoises deposit between two and 12 eggs into flask-shaped nests dug into the soil, up to deep. Most females lay more than one clutch each season. The pinkish-white eggs are incubated for around 90 days and, like many reptiles, the temperature at which the eggs are incubated determines the hatchlings sex. At 26 ¬∞C, only males will be produced, while at 30 ¬∞C, all the hatchlings will be female. Young Hermann's tortoises emerge just after the start of the heavy autumn rains in early September and spend the first four or five years of their lives within just a few metres of their nests. If the rains do not come, or if nesting took place late in the year, the eggs will still hatch, but the young will remain underground and not emerge until the following spring. Until the age of six or eight, when the hard shell becomes fully developed, the young tortoises are very vulnerable to predators and may fall prey to rats, badgers, magpies, foxes, wild boar, and many other animals. If they survive these threats, the longevity of Hermann's tortoises is around 30 years. One rare record of longevity is 31.7 years.Reptiles and amphibians in captivity - Longevity. Compared to other tortoises (e.g. Testudo graeca), the longevity might be underestimated and many sources are reporting they might live 90 yearsCastanet J (1994). \\"Age estimation and longevity in reptiles\\". Gerontology 40 (2-4): 174-192. or more. Breeding A female of T. h. boettgeri subspecies laying eggs in soil pit A hatchling of T. h. hermanni Breeding and upbringing of Hermann's tortoises are quite easy if kept in species-appropriate environments. The European Studbook Foundation maintains stud books for both subspecies. With the help of ultraviolet light-emitting bulbs (UVa and UVb, such as Repti Glo and Creature World), the correct environment for breeding can be created and bring tortoises into breeding condition. In captivity Sanctuaries Several tortoise sanctuaries are located in Europe, such as Carapax in southern Tuscany, and Le Village Des Tortues in the south of France (near Gonfaron). These sanctuaries rescue injured tortoises whilst also taking in unwanted pets, and specialize in Hermann's tortoises. The UK, with its large captive population, also has many specialist centers providing rescue facilities. Hibernation In nature, Hermann tortoise dig their nightly shelters out and spend the relatively mild Mediterranean winters there. During this time, their heart and breathing rates drop notably. Domestic animals can be kept in the basement in a roomy rodent-proof box with a thick layer of dry leaves. The temperature should be around 5 ¬∞C. As an alternative, the box can be stored in a refrigerator. For this method to be used, the refrigerator should be in regular day-to-day use, to permit air flow. During hibernation, the ambient temperature must not fall below zero. Full-grown specimens may sleep four to five months at a time. Reproduction Hermann's tortoises can mate at any time of the year. Females dig flask-shaped holes to lay their eggs in, and eggs take 90‚Äì120 days to hatch. The sex of the hatchlings is determined by the incubation temperature.How to Care for a Hermann's tortoise.

The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is an executive non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government. The Edinburgh site is the main garden and the headquarters of the public body, which is led by Regius Keeper, Simon Milne. History The Edinburgh botanic garden was founded in 1670 at St. Anne's Yard, near Holyrood Palace, by Dr. Robert Sibbald and Dr. Andrew Balfour. It is the second oldest botanic garden in the UK after Oxford's. The plant collection used as the basis of the garden was the private collection of Sir Patrick Murray, 2nd Lord Elibank, moved from his home at Livingston Peel in 1672 following his death in September 1671. The original site was \\"obtained of John Brown, gardener of the North Yardes in the Holyrood Abby, ane inclosure of some 40 foot of measure every way. By what we procured from Levingstone and other gardens, we made a collection of eight or nine hundred plants yr.\\" This site proved too small, and in 1676 grounds belonging to Trinity Hospital were leased by Balfour from the City Council: this second garden was sited just to the east of the Nor Loch, down from the High Street. John Ainslie's 1804 map shows it as the \\"Old Physick Garden\\" to the east of the North Bridge. The site was subsequently occupied by tracks of the North British Railway, and a plaque at platform 11 of the Waverley railway station marks its location. In 1763, the garden's collections were moved away from the city's pollution to a larger (five acre) \\"Physick Garden\\" on the west side of Leith Walk, covering the area now called Bellevue, all under the control of Prof John Hope. This site is shown in Ainslie's 1804 map. Some time prior to Hope's death (1786) he was brought Turkish rhubarb seeds by Bruce of Kinnaird and this was the first rhubarb grown in Scotland. As this proved successful over 3000 plants were grown as rhubarb was previously an expensive import (used as a medicine). A cottage from the garden's original site remained on Leith Walk for over one hundred years. In 2008, the building was moved brick by brick to a site within the current gardens. The project was completed in 2016. The garden was a popular destination for botanists and supplied plants to other gardens such as Kew. Hope erected a monument to Carl Linnaeus on the site in 1778.Grants Old and New Edinburgh In the early 1820s under the direction of the Curator, William McNab, the garden moved west to its present location (adjacent to Inverleith Row), and the Leith Walk site was built over between Hopetoun Crescent and Haddington Place. The Temperate Palm House, which remains the tallest in Scotland, was built in 1858. In 1877 the city acquired Inverleith House from the estate of Cosmo Innes and added it to the existing gardens, opening the remodelled grounds to the public in 1881.City of Edinburgh Council: Inverleith Conservation Area Character Appraisal p.8 The botanic garden at Benmore became the first Regional Garden of the RBGE in 1929.

Located one mile from the city centre it covers . The RBGE is actively involved in, and coordinates numerous in situ and ex situ conservation projects both in the UK and internationally. The three main cross-cutting themes of scientific work at the RBGE are: Scottish Biodiversity, Plants & Climate Change, and Conservation. In addition to the RBGE's scientific activities the garden remains a popular destination for both tourists and locals. Locally known as \\"The Botanics\\", the garden is a popular place to go for a walk, particularly with young families. Entrance to the botanic garden is free, although a small entry charge exists for the glasshouses. During the year the garden hosts many events including live performances, guided tours and exhibitions. The RBGE is also an important centre for education, offering taught courses across all levels. In 2009, the John Hope Gateway was opened. John Hope was the first Regius Keeper of RBGE. Living collection Nymphaea in the Royal Botanic Garden Waterfall in the rock garden Nearly 273,000 individual plants are grown at the Botanics in Edinburgh or its three smaller satellite gardens (known as Regional Gardens) located in other parts of Scotland. These represent around 13,300 species from all over the world, or about 4% of all known plant species. The RBGE Living Collection catalogue is available here and is updated nightly. Some notable collections at the botanic garden Edinburgh include: *Alpine Plants *Chinese Hillside *Cryptogamic Garden *The Glasshouses **Palmhouse ***Temperate Palms ***Tropical Palms **Orchids and Cycads **Ferns and Fossils **Plants and people (including Giant Water Lily pond) **Temperate lands **Rainforest Riches **Arid Lands **Montane tropical house (including Carnivorous plants) **Wet Tropical House *Peat Walls *The Queen Mother's memorial garden. *Rock Garden *Scottish Heath Garden *Woodland Garden Herbarium The RBGE Herbarium (situated in a purpose built facility at the Edinburgh site) is considered a world-leading botanical collection, housing in excess of 3 million specimens. Prior to the formation of the Herbarium, plant collections tended to be the private property of the Regius Keeper. The Herbarium in its present form came with the fusion of the collections of the University of Edinburgh and the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1839‚Äì40. RBGE's Herbarium moved into its present, purpose-built home in 1964. Over the years, a large number of collections have been added, belonging to individuals such as R.K. Greville and John Hutton Balfour, and institutions including the Universities of Glasgow, St Andrews and Hull. The most important historical collection is that of George Walker Arnott, which came with the University of Glasgow's foreign herbarium deposited on permanent loan in 1965. This collection contains specimens from all the major mid-19th century collectors, especially from India, North and South America, and South Africa, including type material of species described by ‚ÄòHooker & Arnott'. From the early 20th century, collections have been made by members of staff. The approx 33% of the Herbarium that has been databased is searchable here. Library RBGE's Library is Scotland's national reference collection for specialist botanical and horticultural resources. Housing around 70,000 books and 150,000 periodicals the research library is one of the country's largest . It has been built up to support the specific subject fields researched and taught at RBGE - Garden staff and students are its main users, along with visiting researchers. However, as a national reference collection, the Library is also open to members of the public, either in person or by telephone or e-mail. Inverleith House Inverleith House is an 18th-century building, located centrally in the modern botanic gardens. From 1960 to 1984 it was the original base of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, with exhibits in the house and in the gardens, before it moved to larger premises in Belford Road. Since then, Inverleith House has functioned as a contemporary art gallery, showing a programme of temporary exhibitions by invited artists. Its spring programmes feature works and specimens from the historical collections of the Botanics, together with exhibitions by modern and contemporary artists. The gallery is curated by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Regional specialist gardens Benmore View of Benmore Botanic Garden Tree ferns at Logan Botanic Garden Situated on the West Coast of Scotland, Benmore Botanic Garden experiences a wetter and milder oceanic climate than the main site in Edinburgh. Benmore grows trees and shrubs from high rainfall areas, especially conifers and rhododendrons. Highlights of the collection include an avenue of Sequoiadendron and a recently refurbished Fernery, exhibiting rare ferns from both Britain and abroad. Dawyck Situated to the south of the Scottish Border town of Peebles, Dawyck Botanic Garden is particularly suitable for hardy plants from the world's cooler, drier areas. Dawyck is also renowned for its high diversity of fungi and cryptogamics. Logan Logan, Scotland's most exotic garden, has an almost sub-tropical climate, and provides ideal growing conditions for southern hemisphere plants. Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Medal The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Medal, instituted in 2010, is awarded from time to time to recognise an outstanding individual contribution in any field related to the work of the RBGE (either by a member of staff or by any other person). The medal, struck in silver, has a sibbaldia motif on one face and a portrait of Robert Sibbald on the other. *2010: Edward Kemp *2011: Sir Tim Smit *2013: Vernon H. Heywood *2015: Peter H.

G. Wells and first published in book form in 1909. It has been called \\"arguably his most artistic book\\".David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 174. It had been serialised before book publication, both in the United States, in The Popular Magazine, beginning in the issue of September 1908, and in Britain, in The English Review, beginning in the magazine's first issue in December 1908..H. G. Wells, footnote in the instalment of ‚ÄúTono-Bungay‚Äù in The Popular Magazine, December 1908. Plot Tono-Bungay is narrated by George Ponderevo, who is persuaded to help develop the business of selling Tono-Bungay, a patent medicine created by his uncle Edward. George devotes seven years to organising the production and manufacture of the product, even though he believes it is \\"a damned swindle\\".H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book II, Ch. 2, ¬ß2 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), p. 154. He then quits day-to-day involvement with the enterprise in favour of aeronautics, but he remains associated with his uncle, who becomes a financier of the first order and is on the verge of achieving social as well as economic dominance when his business empire collapses. George tries to rescue his uncle's failing finances by stealing quantities of a radioactive compound called \\"quap\\" from an island off the coast of West Africa, but the expedition is unsuccessful. George then engineers his uncle's escape from England in an experimental aircraft he has built, but the ruined entrepreneur turned financier catches pneumonia on the flight and dies in a village near Bordeaux, despite George's efforts to save him. The novel ends with George finding a new occupation: designing destroyers for the highest bidder. Themes Scepticism about religion George's resolve to struggle against \\"the whole scheme of revealed religion\\" is strengthened by his experience with his evangelical cousin at Chatham, Nicodemus Frapp, a baker to whom he is briefly \\"a fully indentured apprentice\\".H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book I, Ch. 2 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), pp. 45‚Äì55. Socialism George is influenced by Bob Ewart, a childhood friend and the son of an artist who becomes an artist himself, struggling against a system in which \\"[n]obody wants to do and be the things people are\\".H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book II, Ch. 3, ¬ß2 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), p. 181. It is Ewart who first interests George in socialism, but Ewart's socialism is detached, cynical and merely \\"discursive\\". (Here Wells was probably satirising the Fabian Society, which Wells had tried and failed to reorient between 1903 and 1906.H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book II, Ch. 1, ¬ß3 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), pp. 130‚Äì31. Ewart is important to George in that he \\"kept my fundamental absurdity illuminated for me during all this astonishing time [of working for the success of Tono- Bungay].\\"H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book II, Ch. 3, ¬ß2 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), p. 181. Ennui George struggles with ennui after breaking with Marion: \\"I suffered, I suppose, from a sort of ennui of the imagination. I found myself without an object to hold my will together. I sought. I read restlessly and discursively. . . . it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims I discovered myself for the first time. Before that I had seen only the world and things in it, had sought them self-forgetful of all but my impulse. Now I found myself GROUPED with a system of appetites and satisfactions, with much work to do‚Äîand no desire, it seemed, left in me. There were moments when I thought of suicide\\". George only partially resolves this moral crisis by, as he says, \\"idealis[ing] Science\\".H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book II, Ch. 4, ¬ß10 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), pp. 233‚Äì34. English society The protagonist of the novel is George Ponderevo, whose most intimate life the reader shares. His uncle Edward, on the other hand, remains a somewhat flat character whose chief function is to symbolise the \\"wasting aimless fever of trade and money-making and pleasure-seeking\\"H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book IV, Ch. 3, ¬ß1 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), p. 450. that became, in Wells's view, the most important social force in late-Victorian and Edwardian England. England is interpreted in the novel as a \\"social organism\\". The country estate of Bladesover, \\"up on the Kentish Downs,\\" epitomises a \\"seventeenth-century system\\" which offers \\"the clue to all England. . . . There have been no revolutions, no deliberate restatements or abandonments of opinion in England since the days of the fine gentry, since 1688 or thereabouts, the days when Bladesover was built; there have been changes, dissolving forces, replacing forces, if you will; but then it was that the broad lines of the English system set firmly. . . . The fine gentry may have gone; they have indeed largely gone, I think; rich merchants may have replaced them, financial adventurers or what not. That does not matter; the shape is still Bladesover\\".H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book II, Ch. 1, ¬ß1 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), pp. 114, 112. This society has fallen prey to shabby forces of greed and acquisition that are embodied by Edward Ponderevo, who idealises Napoleon and who muses superficially about \\"[t]his Overman idee, Nietzsche‚Äîall that stuff.\\"H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book III, Ch. 2, ¬ß9 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), p. 309. The trashy emptiness of Edward's ideal of life is expressed in his absurd attempt to build a vast mansion at Crest Hill. The character may have been based on the fraudster Whitaker Wright. A drawing by H. G. Wells from the novel As a Bildungsroman Tono-Bungay also explores the development of the narrator's emotional life. Three sexual relationships are analysed: his unsuccessful marriage to Marion; his affair with the liberated Effie; and his doomed relationship with Beatrice Normandy, a belle dame sans merci whom he has known since childhood and who loves but refuses to marry him. George also tells of his frustrated love for his stern, austere mother, who was a domestic servant, and his powerful attachment to his aunt Susan, a character whose depiction may be, in part, a portrait of Wells's second wife, Amy Catherine Robbins (better known as Jane).David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 202. Metaphysics So powerful have corrupting social forces become that they overcome and denature George's life, for while in his youth he was capable of virtue, love and creativity, he finds no ideal he can devote himself to. Instead he becomes the fabricator of powerful machines whose destructive potential can only be guessed at. The concluding chapter, \\"Night and the Open Sea\\", depicts a test run of the X2, a destroyer that George has designed and built. The vessel becomes a symbol of a metaphysical \\"something\\" that \\"drives\\", that \\"is at once human achievement and the most inhuman of all existing things\\".H. G. Wells, Tono-Bungay, Book IV, Ch. 3, ¬ß3 (New York: Modern Library, n.d. [1937]), p. 458. The narrator himself calls attention to \\"the symbol of my destroyer\\" and comments: \\"Sometimes I call this reality Science, sometimes I call it Truth. But it is something we draw by pain and effort out of the heart of life, that we disentangle and make clear. Other men serve it, I know in art, in literature, in social invention, and see it in a thousand different figures, under a hundred names. I see it always as austerity, as beauty. This thing we make clear is the heart of life. It is the one enduring thing. Men and nations, epochs and civilisation pass, each making its contribution. I do not know what it is, this something, except that it is supreme\\". Northrop Frye commented on this symbol in his Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton University Press, 1971 [orig. 1957], p. 155), and David C. Smith called the conclusion of Tono-Bungay \\"one of the finer endings in all English fiction\\" (H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal, p. 202). Reception and criticism Initial reviews were mixed. The novel was criticised by Hubert Bland and Robertson Nicoll, but the Daily Telegraph praised it as \\"a masterpiece\\". Gilbert Murray praised the book in three separate letters to the author, comparing Wells to Leo Tolstoy.David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 203‚Äì04. Biographer Vincent Brome has written that \\"Tono-Bungay came fresh and vivid to men and women of Wells's generation. These great questionings, the challenge to one eternal verity after another, shook their world and their way of life, and it was all tremendously exciting\\".Vincent Brome, H. G. Wells: A Biography (London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green, 1951), p. 107. Wells himself was \\"disposed to regard Tono-Bungay as the finest and most finished novel upon the accepted lines\\" that he had \\"written or was ever likely to write\\".David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 203. In the view of one of Wells's biographers, David C. Smith, Kipps, The History of Mr Polly and Tono-Bungay together make it possible for Wells \\"to claim a permanent place in English fiction, close to Dickens because of the extraordinary humanity of some of his characters, but also because of his ability to invoke a place, a class, a social scene. These novels are very personal as well, treating aspects of Wells's own life, matters which would come under attack later, but only after he added his sexual and extramarital views to the personal side of his work.\\"David C.

Sens () is a commune in the Yonne department in Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© in north-central France, 120 km from Paris. Sens is a sub-prefecture and the second city of the department, the sixth in the region. It is crossed by the Yonne and the Vanne, which empties into the Yonne here. History The city is said to have been one of the oppida of the Senones, one of the oldest Celtic tribes living in Gaul. It is mentioned as Agedincum by Julius CaesarThe manuscripts of the Gallic War also give varied readings of Agendicum and Agetincum (William Smith, ed. A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography); the gilded statue of \\"Brennus\\" (\\"leader\\") surmounts the h√¥tel de ville. several times in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico. The Roman city was built during the first century BC and surrounded by walls during the third. It still retains today the skeleton of its Roman street plan.Its Cardo (rue de la R√©publique) and Decumanus Maximus (Grande Rue) still meet at near right angles. The site was referred to by Ammianus Marcellinus as Senones (oppidum Senonas), where the future emperor Julian faced an Alamannic siege for a few months, but it did not become an administrative center until after the reorganization of the Roman Empire in 375, when it was the chief town of Lugdunensis Quarta. During the Middle Ages its archbishopsThe bishop of Sens perhaps became an archbishop as early as the mid-5th century, but the cult of the traditional founders Savinian and Potentian, not mentioned by Gregory of Tours, did not appear until the 8th century, when they were added to the local recension of the Seventy Apostles.

The Archdiocese of Sens ruled over the dioceses of Chartres, Auxerre, Meaux, Paris, Orl√©ans, Nevers and Troyes, summarized by the acronym CAMPONT . Starting from 1135, the cathedral of Sens, dedicated to Saint Stephen, was rebuilt as one of the first Gothic cathedrals. There, in 1234, Louis IX of France celebrated his wedding to Marguerite of Provence. Sens witnessed the trial of Peter Abelard. Pope Alexander III sojourned for some time in the city, and there also Thomas Becket spent part of his exile between 1162 and 1165. The Archdiocese of Sens hosted a number of church councils and the first Archbishop of Uppsala was consecrated there. William of Sens was the principal architect of Canterbury Cathedral. Sens experienced troublesome times during the Wars of Religion. In 1562 100 of the towns Huguenot Population would be Massacred. The city declined after Paris was elevated to archdiocese in 1622. Since 2002 Sens remains an archbishopric (though the incumbent resides in Auxerre since 1929?) but with no metropolitical function (no pallium or marriage appeals). Despite the creation of new regions, Sens remains subject to the Paris cour d'appel.

Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh, Scotland, a sill partially exposed during the Quaternary glaciation Mid-Carboniferous dolerite sill cutting Lower Carboniferous shales and sandstones, Horton Bluff, Minas Basin South Shore, Nova Scotia In geology, a sill is a tabular sheet intrusion that has intruded between older layers of sedimentary rock, beds of volcanic lava or tuff, or along the direction of foliation in metamorphic rock. A sill is a concordant intrusive sheet, meaning that a sill does not cut across preexisting rock beds. Stacking of sills builds a sill complex . and a large magma chamber at high magma flux. In contrast, a dike is a discordant intrusive sheet, which does cut across older rocks. Sills are fed by dikes, except in unusual locations where they form in nearly vertical beds attached directly to a magma source. The rocks must be brittle and fracture to create the planes along which the magma intrudes the parent rock bodies, whether this occurs along preexisting planes between sedimentary or volcanic beds or weakened planes related to foliation in metamorphic rock. These planes or weakened areas allow the intrusion of a thin sheet-like body of magma paralleling the existing bedding planes, concordant fracture zone, or foliations. Sills parallel beds (layers) and foliations in the surrounding country rock. They can be originally emplaced in a horizontal orientation, although tectonic processes may cause subsequent rotation of horizontal sills into near vertical orientations. Sills can be confused with solidified lava flows; however, there are several differences between them. Intruded sills will show partial melting and incorporation of the surrounding country rock. On both contact surfaces of the country rock into which the sill has intruded, evidence of heating will be observed (contact metamorphism). Lava flows will show this evidence only on the lower side of the flow. In addition, lava flows will typically show evidence of vesicles (bubbles) where gases escaped into the atmosphere. Because sills generally form at shallow depths (up to many kilometers) below the surface, the pressure of overlying rock prevents this from happening much, if at all. Lava flows will also typically show evidence of weathering on their upper surface, whereas sills, if still covered by country rock, typically do not. Associated ore deposits Certain layered intrusions are a variety of sill that often contain important ore deposits. Precambrian examples include the Bushveld, Insizwa and the Great Dyke complexes of southern Africa, the Duluth intrusive complex of the Superior District, and the Stillwater igneous complex of the United States. Phanerozoic examples are usually smaller and include the R√πm peridotite complex of Scotland and the Skaergaard igneous complex of east Greenland. These intrusions often contain concentrations of gold, platinum, chromium and other rare elements. Transgressive sills Seismic expression of basaltic sills from the Rockall Trough. Data courtesy UK OGA. Despite their concordant nature, many large sills change stratigraphic level within the intruded sequence, with each concordant part of the intrusion linked by relatively short dike-like segments. Such sills are known as transgressive, examples include the Whin Sill and sills within the Karoo basin. The geometry of large sill complexes in sedimentary basins has become clearer with the availability of 3D seismic reflection data. Such data has shown that many sills have an overall saucer shape and that many others are at least in part transgressive.

Programs  The school is a member of the Canadian Coalition of Self-Directed Learning. Westmount also offers gifted classes, special education classes, as well as an ESL program. Since 1990, Westmount has operated under a self-directed learning program; more commonly referred to as a self-paced environment. This allows students to be able to complete work at their own pace, by enabling them with the abilities to carry over unfinished courses into the next semester, or fast-track them and finish earlier. It is one of the only schools with this program in Canada, and often plays host to international visitors wishing to view the teaching process in person. It is also home to a \\"sports academy\\", in which students looking to gain a career in professional sports may hone their skills. Because of the self pacing program, these students are able to be absent from school, without falling behind in their classes. Westmount is also home to a newly instituted Advanced Placement program, and one of Hamilton's best gifted programs. It also has a growing Media Arts and Animation program, and owns a Macintosh computer lab with a separate Macintosh network. Approximately 35% of computers used at Westmount are Apple Mac computers.

Greenough's and McTavish's contributions to developing the shortboards resulted in a wave of new advancements in surfing technology and shapes used to design boards. Personal life George Greenough was born 1941 in Santa Barbara, California to a wealthy family that had connections to the railroad industry; he was a nephew by way of marriage to the opera star Beverly Sills, and also a direct descendant of the sculptor Horatio Greenough, who sculpted a massive marble statue of George Washington which was placed in the capitol Rotunda.Warshaw, M. (2010). The History of Surfing Book (pp. 239-242). Chronicle Books. He had undergone open heart surgery at age ten and became known as an unconventional \\"character\\", \\"‚Ä¶ a thin-faced, narrow shouldered scion‚Ä¶ always shoeless, often shirt-less, resin- stained Levis clamped onto his nonexistent hips with a length of rope, stringy blonde hair cut straight across at eyebrow level and flapping down over his ears.\\"Warshaw, M. (2010). The History of Surfing Book (pp. 239-242). Chronicle Books. Greenough was not known to surf at crowded surf breaks; instead he preferred the solitude of northern Hollister Ranch or surfing Rincon at dusk to avoid the crowds. In 1964 Greenough went to Australia and would travel back and forth between Santa Barbara and his new home for some time.Westwick, P., Neushul P. (2013). The World in the Curl: An Unconventional History of Surfing Book (pp. 137-138). Crown. He now resides in Byron Bay in New South Wales, Australia. Surfing influence Greenough is credited for the design of the modern surf fin as well as with influencing modern surfing's more radical maneuvers. The newer shortboards were built specifically to copy the same style of banking turns and fast down the line attitude that Greenough was known for.Warshaw, M. (2010). The History of Surfing Book (pp. 239-242). Chronicle Books. Greenough started to shape his first boards out of balsa wood in his high school wood shop. He started out as a stand-up surfer in the 1950s but began switching between kneeboarding and an air inflated mattress in 1961; according to Greenough, these gave him a heightened sense of speed that came from a lowered body position. The famous 'spoon' board was created in 1961, \\"a blunt-nosed balsa kneeboard, 5 feet long and 23 inches wide, with a dished-out midsection and tail that slimmed down to a mere half-inch thickness.\\" He replaced the normal fin of the day, a massive 10 inch protrusion, with a smaller (almost by a third) flexible swept-back model he had copied from the shape of the rear dorsal fin of a tuna. This design had the effect of reducing drag and increasing the handling capabilities of the board; the new surfboard fin, which Greenough called a \\"high aspect ratio fin\\", was an elegantly functional piece of equipment, but took around three years to become popular.Warshaw, M. (2010). The History of Surfing Book (pp. 239-242). Chronicle Books. In 1964 Greenough traveled to Australia, where he showed the local surfers his wave riding style of sharp bottom turns and deep barrel rides. He influenced Nat Young, who used Greenough's fin design and won the 1966 world surfing championships in San Diego, California, thus ushering in an era in surfing history in which the Australians emerged as a dominant force.Westwick, P., Neushul P. (2013). The World in the Curl: An Unconventional History of Surfing Book (pp. 137-138). Crown. Young described Greenough as \\"The greatest surfer in the world today,\\"Westwick, P., Neushul P. (2013). The World in the Curl: An Unconventional History of Surfing Book (pp. 137-138). Crown. After this first visit to Australia, Greenough shaped a board which he explained as the next step in the progression of surfing, \\"a fish moves when he swims‚Ä¶ so why not make a whole board that moves when it's on a wave?\\" The board he created had multiple layers of fiberglass shaped like the old balsa kneeboards he rode, a glued on ridge of polyurethane foam on top of the deck near the rails and nose with the back end of the board made entirely of fiberglass; the final piece to the board was his signature \\"flex-fin\\". The board was so small and light that it was not very good to ride in small surf; only in big surf did the board reveal its performance abilities and allow Greenough to maneuver on waves with more power and speed than with previous designs‚Äî\\"Greenough was riding like a visitor from ten years in surfing's future. He cranked out bottom turns where his board tilted up almost 90 degrees‚Ä¶\\" In 1966 Greenough made his second board which he nicknamed the 'velo' for velocity. Movies Greenough has made multiple films in his career; he would swim out into the surf with fins and take pictures looking out from the inside of the barrel. This \\"barrel-vision\\" was regarded as a major progression in surf photography.Warshaw, M. (2010). The History of Surfing Book (pp. 239-242). Chronicle Books. His film, The Innermost Limits of Pure Fun, was shot using a massive 28 pound camera with a water-proof housing strapped onto his shoulder which he used to show the inside of a wave. His film was considered so inspiring by surfers that entire audiences of them would yell and shout for the duration of the movie. The film caught the attention of a new band called Pink Floyd who donated music for the loosely biographical following film, Crystal Voyager, which Greenough wrote and narrated; Pink Floyd also used the film as a backdrop for their concerts.Boyd, D., Divine, J., Pezman, S.(2014). Legends of Surfing: The Greatest Surfriders from Duke Kahanamoku to Kelly Slater (pp. 49-50). MVP Books. Coca-Cola used some of Greenough's videos of wave barrels in a television advertisement in 1975. Part of Crystal Voyager was shot at ten times normal speed, creating a continuous flow of intensely detailed images of water droplets hitting the lens, all moving in dance-like synchronization with the motion of the wave.Edwards, A., Skinner, J., Gilbert, K. (2003). Some Like it Hot: The Beach as a Cultural Dimension Book. (Sport, Culture & Society ed., Vol. 3, pp. 139-140). Meyer & Meyer Verlag. Greenough has worked in recent decades on Dolphin Glide, an experimental underwater photo series which captures images of dolphins riding waves, using a special ski he invented.fbo.gov, internet Greenough is also featured in an early scene in Bruce Brown's surf film The Endless Summer. Boats While tinkering with board designs, Greenough also experimented in boat hull design. While filming Dolphin Glide he had made a jet-ski type watercraft which he used as a platform for filming. His second variation, known as a GARC (Greenough Advanced Rescue Craft), was a product of this experimenting. The GARC was based on a rescue boat hull designed by Greenough, and is currently manufactured by MAPC (Maritime Applied Physics Corporation), which holds the patents for the craft. The jet-ski look-alike is a more rugged and stable version that can be launched in the waves or by an aircraft. The development of the open transom and the stern tongue make it possible for rescues without having to actually lift the person in trouble out of the water. The GARC holds four people and will be used by the United States Navy, Coast Guard, and National Guard. References Bibliography * Warshaw, M. (2010). The History of Surfing Book (pp. 239‚Äì242).

The village is served by Skewen railway station. Skewen supports its own rugby club. History Skewen was once an industrial village. There were a number of collieries around the village (see link below). The Crown and Mines Royal Copper Works and the Cheadle and Neath Abbey Ironworks were once important industrial sites which stood close by. Old top-loading blast furnaces can also be seen at Neath Abbey. To the south of Skewen lies the village of Llandarcy, the site of the country's first oil refinery. The site of this former oil refinery is now being developed as an urban village called Coed Darcy, a development which was promoted at its start by the Prince of Wales's Foundation for the Built Environment.

He appeared in the wake of the French New Wave alongside contemporaries like Jean-Luc Godard and Fran√ßois Truffaut. Demy's films are celebrated for their visual style. Demy's style drew upon diverse sources such as classic Hollywood musicals, the documentary realism of his New Wave colleagues, fairy tales, jazz, Japanese manga, and the opera. His films contain overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by Michel Legrand) and motifs like teenage love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality. He is best known for the two musicals he directed in the mid-1960s: The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) and The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967). Career After working with the animator Paul Grimault and the filmmaker Georges Rouquier, Demy directed Lola, his first feature film, in 1961, with Anouk Aim√©e playing the eponymous cabaret singer. The Demy universe emerges here: Characters burst into song (courtesy of composer and lifelong Demy-collaborator Michel Legrand); iconic Hollywood imagery is appropriated, as in the opening scene with the man in a white Stetson in the Cadillac; plot is dictated by the director's fascination with fate and stock themes of chance encounters and long-lost love; and the setting, as with many of Demy's films, is the French Atlantic coast of his childhood, specifically the seaport town of Nantes. La Baie des Anges (The Bay of Angels, 1963), starring Jeanne Moreau, took the theme of fate further, with its story of love at the roulette tables. Demy is perhaps best known for his original musical Les Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, 1964), with a score by Legrand. The whimsical concept of singing all the dialogue sets the tone for this tragedy of the everyday. The film also sees the emergence of Demy's trademark visual style, shot in saturated supercolour, with every detail‚Äîneckties, wallpaper, Catherine Deneuve's bleached-blonde hair‚Äîselected for visual impact. Roland Cassard, the young man from Lola (Marc Michel) reappears here, marrying Deneuve's character. Such reappearances are typical of Demy's work. Kurt Vonnegut was a huge fan of Les Parapluies, writing in private correspondence: \\"I saw The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That's all right. I like to have my heart broken.\\" Demy's subsequent films never quite captured audience and critical acclaim the way Les Parapluies did, although he continued to make ambitious and original dramas and musicals. Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (1967), another whimsical-yet-melancholic musical, features Deneuve and her sister Fran√ßoise Dorl√©ac as sisters living in the seaside town of Rochefort, daughters of Danielle Darrieux. It was shot in color widescreen CinemaScope and featured an Oscar-nominated musical score as well as dance appearances by Gene Kelly and West Side Story's George Chakiris. In 1968, after Columbia Pictures gave Demy a lucrative offer to shoot his first film in America, he and his wife, film director Agn√®s Varda, moved to Los Angeles briefly. Demy's movie was a naturalistic drama: 1969's Model Shop. Lola (Anouk Aim√©e) reappears, her dreams shattered, her life having taken a turn for the worse. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre (Jeanne Moreau's character from Bay of Angels), Lola is scrounging to make enough money to return to France and her child by working as a nude model in a backdoor model-shop on the Sunset Strip. She runs into an aimless, young architect (Gary Lockwood), who navigates the streets of Los Angeles; like Lola, he is looking for love and meaning in life. Model Shop is a time capsule of late-1960s Los Angeles and documents the death of the hippie movement, the Vietnam draft, and the ennui and misery that results from broken relationships. This bleakness and decided lack of whimsy‚Äîuncharacteristic for Demy‚Äîhad a large amount to do with Model Shop's critical and commercial failure. Peau d'√Çne (Donkey Skin, 1970) was a step in the opposite direction as a visually extravagant musical interpretation of a classic French fairy tale which highlights the tale's incestuous overtones, starring Deneuve, Jean Marais, and Delphine Seyrig. It was Demy's first foray into the world of fairy tales and historical fantasia, which he explored in The Pied Piper and Lady Oscar. Although none of Demy's subsequent films captured the contemporary success of his earlier work, some have been reappraised: David Thomson wrote about \\"the fascinating application of the operatic technique to an unusually dark story\\" in Une chambre en ville (A Room in Town, 1982). L'√©v√©nement le plus important depuis que l'homme a march√© sur la lune (1973) (\\"A Slightly Pregnant Man\\") is a look back at the pressures of second-wave feminism in France and the fears it elicited in men. Lady Oscar (1979), based on the Japanese manga series The Rose of Versailles, has been discussed and analyzed for its queer and political subtext (the title character is born female, her father raises her as a male so she can get ahead in 18th-century French aristocracy, and she eventually falls in love with her surrogate brother, a working-class revolutionary). Parapluies de Cherbourg has been color-restored twice from original prints by Demy. In 2014, The Criterion Collection released a boxed set of Demy's \\"essential\\" work, with hours of supplements, essays, and restored image and sound. The films include Lola, Bay of Angels, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The Young Girls of Rochefort, Donkey Skin, and Une Chambre en Ville as well as most of Demy's early short films. Personal life As a student, Demy did not learn any foreign languages. In the 1960s, with the help of some classes, internships, and spending some time in the United States, he learned English. At the time of the Anouchka project, which took many years to complete, he also learned Russian.T√©moignage d'H√©l√®ne Demy dans L'Univers de Jacques Demy. He admired his sister because she had become an English professor. In the early 1970s, taking after the example of Michel Legrand, he earned his private pilot‚Äôs license for passenger planes.His pilot‚Äôs license is presented in L'Univers de Jacques Demy. In 1958, Jacques Demy and Agn√®s Varda met at a short film festival in Tours. The two married in 1962. They had a son together, Mathieu Demy (born 1972), and Demy also adopted Varda‚Äôs daughter, Rosalie Varda (born 1958), whom she had with Antoine Bourseiller in a previous relationship.Mathilde Blotti√®re, ‚ÄúLes films de Jacques Demy enfin √©dit√©s en DVD‚Äù, T√©l√©rama, 15 November 2008. Together, Demy and Varda owned a home in Paris and another property with an old mill on the Noirmoutier Island in Vend√©e, where the shots of Demy on a beach in Jacquot de Nantes (1991) were taken. The film is a version of Demy's autobiographical notebooks, an account of Demy's childhood and his lifelong love of theatre and cinema. Varda paid homage to her husband in Jacquot de Nantes, Les demoiselles ont eu 25 ans (1993), and L‚ÄôUnivers de Jacques Demy (1995).

In addition to working with Wizards of the Coast on the creation of Eberron, he has also contributed material for Goodman Games, Paizo Publishing and Green Ronin Publishing.  Personal life  Baker lives in Portland, Oregon. He has a tattoo of the Greater Mark of Making on his right arm. Career Prior to working in the role-playing game industry, he worked in the video game industry with Magnet Interactive Studios and a Colorado company, VR1. In 2002, Keith Baker was a freelancer best known for his thematic work at Atlas Games. His Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting of Eberron was chosen as the winner among the 11,000 submissions to the Wizards of the Coast Fantasy Setting Search in 2002.Wizards of the Coast Announcement GamingReport.com. Retrieved on August 28, 2008. Baker produced the Eberron Campaign Setting (2004) alongside James Wyatt and Bill Slavicsek, the first of many background books focused on the setting. For the 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, Baker was a designer on the Eberron Campaign Guide (July 2009) and a consultant on the Eberron Player's Guide (June 2009). In 2017, Baker joined the podcast Manifest Zone which explores the world of Eberron including lore and official products. His co-hosts are Wayne Chang and Kristian Serrano. For the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, Baker was the lead designer of Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron (July 2018) which was an official Wizards of the Coast supplement published as a PDF on the Dungeon Masters Guild. The Dungeon Masters Guild, owned by OneBookShelf, is an online store that hosts official Wizards of the Coast products and acts as \\"a platform for players to publish lore, maps, character designs and adventures based on Dungeons & Dragons intellectual property\\". Utilizing the Dungeon Masters Guild, Baker published two non- official Eberron themed adventures in 2018 and a non-official 5th edition Eberron supplement in 2019. Baker was also one of the lead designers of the first hardcover 5th edition Eberron sourcebook: Eberron: Rising From The Last War (November 2019). In July 2020, Baker released a new non-official 5th Edition Eberron campaign guide, Exploring Eberron, on the Dungeon Masters Guild. Baker has been a role-playing game designer across multiple systems besides Dungeons & Dragons, including systems such as Pathfinder, 13th Age (2012) and Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana (2015). Essays by Baker on role- playing design and other game features have been published in the Kobold Guides series - including Adventures (2008), Complete Kobold Guide to Game Design (2012), The Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding (2012), and Kobold Guide to Gamemastering (2017).  Twogether Studios  In 2014, Baker co-founded a new an indie tabletop game studio with his wife, Jennifer Ellis. In April 2015, Twogether Studios launched their first game, Phoenix: Dawn Command, on Kickstarter and raised $67,284. Phoenix: Dawn Command is a card-based roleplaying game where players become \\"more powerful each time they fall in battle\\". In October 2016, Twogether Studios launched their second game, Illimat, on Kickstarter and raised $418,628. This set collection game was designed in partnership with the band The Decemberists and illustrated by Carson Ellis. Steve Haske, for Inverse, wrote: \\"Last year, the band‚Äôs Chris Funk got in touch with Portland-based Twogether Studios, in order to bring Illimat into the real world via a Kickstarter campaign. With game designer Keith Baker (co-founder of Twogether), the two designed a relatively simple game played with cards, a few tokens, and a rotating box ‚Äî the Illimat itself, that changes the 'seasons' of the gameplay ‚Äî so appropriate to The Decemberists‚Äôs old-world aesthetic that it has a fascinating sense of authenticity\\". Twogether Studios has launched two more successfully funded card games on Kickstarter: Action Cats! (July 2017, raised $17,086) and Action Pups! (February 2019, raised $7,273). Both games feature photos of pets that Kickstarter backers submitted. In September 2019, it was announced that Twogether Studios are working with the McElroy family to create a cooperative storytelling card game adaptation of The Adventure Zone called TAZ: Bureau of Balance.  Awards  Baker has won an Origins Award twice, first in 2004 for Best Roleplaying Game Supplement as part of the team for the Eberron campaign setting, then alone in 2005 for Traditional Card Game of the Year for Gloom, published by Atlas Games.

Premise Buber's main proposition is that we may address existence in two ways: # The attitude of the \\"I\\" towards an \\"It\\", towards an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience. # The attitude of the \\"I\\" towards \\"Thou\\", in a relationship in which the other is not separated by discrete bounds. One of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in relationships. In Buber's view, all of our relationships bring us ultimately into relationship with God, who is the Eternal Thou. Buber explains that humans are defined by two word pairs: I‚ÄìIt and I‚ÄìThou. The \\"It\\" of I‚ÄìIt refers to the world of experience and sensation. I‚ÄìIt describes entities as discrete objects drawn from a defined set (e.g., he, she or any other objective entity defined by what makes it measurably different from other entities). It can be said that \\"I\\" have as many distinct and different relationships with each \\"It\\" as there are \\"Its\\" in one's life. Fundamentally, \\"It\\" refers to the world as we experience it. By contrast, the word pair I‚ÄìThou describes the world of relations. This is the \\"I\\" that does not objectify any \\"It\\" but rather acknowledges a living relationship. I‚ÄìThou relationships are sustained in the spirit and mind of an \\"I\\" for however long the feeling or idea of relationship is the dominant mode of perception. A person sitting next to a complete stranger on a park bench may enter into an \\"I‚ÄìThou\\" relationship with the stranger merely by beginning to think positively about people in general. The stranger is a person as well, and gets instantaneously drawn into a mental or spiritual relationship with the person whose positive thoughts necessarily include the stranger as a member of the set of persons about whom positive thoughts are directed. It is not necessary for the stranger to have any idea that he is being drawn into an \\"I‚ÄìThou\\" relationship for such a relationship to arise. But what is crucial to understand is the word pair \\"I‚ÄìThou\\" can refer to a relationship with a tree, the sky, or the park bench itself as much as it can refer to the relationship between two individuals. The essential character of \\"I‚ÄìThou\\" is the abandonment of the world of sensation, the melting of the between, so that the relationship with another \\"I\\" is foremost. Buber's two notions of \\"I\\" require attachment of the word \\"I\\" to a word partner. The splitting into the individual terms \\"I\\" and \\"it\\" and \\"thou\\" is only for the purposes of analysis. Despite the separation of \\"I\\" from the \\"It\\" and \\"Thou\\" in this very sentence describing the relationship, there is to Buber's mind either an I‚ÄìThou or an I‚ÄìIt relationship. Every sentence that a person uses with \\"I\\" refers to the two pairs: \\"I‚ÄìThou\\" and \\"I‚ÄìIt\\", and likewise \\"I\\" is implicit in every sentence with \\"Thou\\" or \\"It\\". Each It is bounded by others and It can only exist through this attachment because for every object there is another object. Thou, on the other hand, has no limitations. When \\"Thou\\" is spoken, the speaker has no thing (has nothing), hence, Thou is abstract; yet the speaker ‚Äútakes his stand in relation‚Äù. What does it mean to experience the world? One goes around the world extracting knowledge from the world in experiences betokened by \\"He\\", \\"She\\", and \\"It\\". One also has I‚ÄìThou relationships. Experience is all physical, but these relationships involve a great deal of spirituality. The twofold nature of the world means that our being in the world has two aspects: the aspect of experience, which is perceived as I‚ÄìIt, and the aspect of relation, which is perceived as I‚ÄìThou. Examples Buber uses an example of a tree and presents five separate relations: # Looking at the tree as a picture with the color and detail through the aesthetic perception. # Identifying the tree as movement. The movement includes the flow of the juices through the veins of the tree, the breathing of the leaves, the roots sucking the water, the never-ending activities between the tree and earth and air, and the growth of the tree. # Categorizing the tree by its type; in other words, studying it. # Exercising the ability to look at something from a different perspective. ‚ÄúI can subdue its actual presence and form so sternly that I recognize it only as an expression of law‚Äù. # Interpreting the experience of the tree in mathematical terms. Through all of these relations, the tree is still an object that occupies time and space and still has the characteristics that make it what it is.Kaufman's translation, Touchstone edition, 1996, pp. 47‚Äì58. If \\"Thou\\" is used in the context of an encounter with a human being, the human being is not He, She, or bound by anything. You do not experience the human being; rather you can only relate to him or her in the sacredness of the I‚ÄìThou relation. The I‚ÄìThou relationship cannot be explained; it simply is. Nothing can intervene in the I‚ÄìThou relationship. I‚ÄìThou is not a means to some object or goal, but a definitive relationship involving the whole being of each subject. Like the I‚ÄìThou relation, love is a subject-to-subject relationship. Love is not a relation of subject to object, but rather a relation in which both members in the relationship are subjects and share the unity of being. The ultimate Thou is God. In the I‚ÄìThou relation there are no barriers. This enables us to relate directly to God. God is ever-present in human consciousness, manifesting in music, literature, and other forms of culture. Inevitably, Thou is addressed as It, and the I‚ÄìThou relation becomes the being of the I‚ÄìThou relation. God is now spoken to directly, not spoken about. There is no world that disconnects one from God, a world of It alone, when I‚ÄìThou guides one's actions. \\"One who truly meets the world goes out also to God.\\" God is the worldwide relation to all relations.

Equivalent terms include , , , , , , and . The predecessor of the modern bassoon, it flourished between 1550 and 1700, but was probably invented earlier. Towards the end of this period it co-existed with, and was then superseded by, the baroque bassoon. It was played in both secular and sacred contexts, throughout northern and western Europe, as well as in the New World. Construction The dulcian is generally made from a single piece of maple, with the bores being drilled and reamed first, and then the outside planed to shape. The reed is attached to the end of a metal bocal, inserted into the top of the small bore. Unlike the bassoon it normally has a flared bell, sometimes made from a separate piece of timber. This bell can sometimes be muted, the mute being either detachable, or built into the instrument. The outside of the instrument can also be covered in leather, like the cornett. Although the bass in F is the most common size, the dulcian comes in many other sizes: tenor (in C), alto (in F or G) and soprano (in C). There are also examples of a \\"quart bass\\" dulcian in C and contrabass in F. The range of each instrument is two and a half octaves, centred on the range of the corresponding singing voice: for example, the bass ranges from C2 (two octaves below middle C), to G4 (the G above middle C). Evolution Soprano, alto, alto, tenor and bass dulcians from the Brussels collection The reed on the dulcian is fully exposed, allowing the player to control the sound and intonation by embouchure. At the time it first appeared, other double reed instruments either had the reed fully enclosed, like the crumhorn or the bagpipe, or partially enclosed by a pirouette, like the shawm. It has been argued the dulcian displaced the bass shawm, on account of its more convenient size, but it has also been argued that the two co-existed and that the bass shawm appeared at about the same time as the bass dulcian. The instrument seems to have been in wide use by the middle of the sixteenth century. A set of instruments in various sizes exist in Brussels: these have a maker's mark of \\"Melchor\\" and are thought to be Spanish. Another well known example is a slightly later instrument in Linz, leather covered and with a built-in mute. The latest commonly copied example is by Denner, 1700, which also has a built in mute. Modern copies of the Linz instrument have a smoother sound and reach the high notes more easily, this is even more the case for modern copies of the Denner instrument. Function and repertoire The dulcian is a flexible instrument, capable of being loud enough to play in outdoor bands, quiet enough for chamber music, and expressive enough to join in with the choir. Its uses would have included playing dance music with the shawms and sackbuts of the city watch, chamber music, and the grand polychoral repertoire from Venice and Germany, such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Heinrich Sch√ºtz. There are explicit dulcian parts in the sonatas by Dario Castello. References *Waterhouse, William (2003). The Bassoon. Kahn and Averill. .

In the course of his life he was an ornithologist, explorer, journalist, broadcaster, soldier, guerrilla, ethnologist, museum curator, archaeologist, documentarian, film-maker, conservationist and writer. Although often described as an anthropologist, and sometimes referred to as the \\"Barefoot Anthropologist\\", his degree studies at University of Cambridge, before he left to live in Oxford, were in natural sciences. He was a founder of the social observation organisation Mass- Observation. He conducted ornithological and anthropological research in Sarawak (1932) and the New Hebrides (1933‚Äì35), spent much of his life in Borneo (mainly Sarawak) and finished up in the US, the UK and France, before dying in a road accident in Thailand. Early life and education Harrisson was born on 26 September 1911 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of Geoffry Harnett Harrisson (1881‚Äì1939), an engineer, and Marie Ellen Cole (1886‚Äì1961). Another son, William Damer Harrisson, was born in 1913. The family lived in Concordia, Entre R√≠os where his father had been working as a railway engineer and then manager since 1907. In 1914, at the start of the First World War, the family sailed to the United Kingdom where Geoffry Harrisson joined the British army. He was highly decorated for his service and eventually rose to the rank of Brigadier-General. Harrisson was socially isolated throughout these early years, with no friends apart from his brother.Judith M. Heimann, 'Harrisson, Tom Harnett (1911‚Äì1976)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2010 accessed 27 July 2013 His father was away in the army, and his mother showed little interest in her children. The family moved frequently, and Harrisson later recalled no \\"lived in, loved place\\". With no toys to occupy them, their nanny Kitty Asbury entertained her charges with long country walks, which stimulated a great interest in nature. Harrisson had learnt to read by the age of five by studying Asbury's books on natural history. In 1919, Harrisson's parents moved back to Argentina, \\"dumping\\" ‚Äì as Harrisson later described it ‚Äì their sons at Eastacre preparatory school and later Winton House preparatory school, Winchester.BBC4 TV, (2007) Harrisson: The Barefoot Anthropologist. School holidays were spent unhappily as paying guests at various vicarages.BBC4 TV, (2007) Harrisson: The Barefoot Anthropologist. There was a brief interlude during 1922 and 1923, when Harrisson and his brother were taken back to Argentina by their father. It was to be the best year of his childhood. With his father as teacher, he learnt to hunt, fly-fish and climb. He became interested in birds: he built an aviary and studied their behaviour. Socially and linguistically isolated in Argentina, he also felt a stranger in England, even more so after his year in South America. In a 1960 radio interview, he reflected on this period, and stated that \\"this feeling both of belonging intensely, emotionally, sentimentally with England and yet of not belonging to it and finding its habits and its people and its voices and its faces strange keeps on producing sensations even to this day of strangeness wherever I go\\". Harrisson attended Harrow School from 1925 to 1930, a boarder in the house of his sympathetic godfather, Rev. D. B. Kittermaster, who was particularly supportive of boys such as Harrisson who were rebellious and did not fit in. Harrisson had little interest in interacting with his fellow schoolboys, but nevertheless took an intense interest in them, keeping a card index on every boy. He was also fascinated by issues of hierarchy and status at the school. He continued his interest in ornithology, and supported by his housemaster, who allowed him to roam beyond the school grounds, he wrote and published a book on birds of the area. After participating in several bird censuses, at the age of 19 he organized 1300 other birdwatchers in a pioneering census of the Great Crested Grebe. The census later became a fixture of British birdwatching, and brought him in contact with many of the leading figures of natural sciences when he continued his education at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Harrisson enjoyed friendship with such as Malcolm Lowry but abandoned his studies at Cambridge for the ambience of Oxford, whence he participated in expeditions organised with Oxford University Exploration Club - notably a 6 month long expedition to northern Sarawak in 1932, and then a longer one to the New Hebrides from 1934-1936. In 1937, Harrisson, with Humphrey Jennings and Charles Madge, founded Mass-Observation, a project to study the everyday lives of ordinary people in Britain. An early project, Worktown, was based in Bolton. His cousin, BBC World Service broadcaster Anne Symonds (mother of the journalist Matthew Symonds by John Beavan, Baron Ardwick), worked with him at Mass- Observation for a time.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2017/03/06/anne- symonds-broadcaster-obituary Personal life Harrisson married three times. In 1939 he was named as corespondent in the divorce of Bertha Clayton (1908-1961); they had a son, Maxwell Barr (1940-2002), in 1940, but divorced in 1954. He met Barbara Brunig when she worked at his Sarawak Museum; they married in London in 1956, but divorced in 1970 after he had met Christine Forani (1916-1976),Forani turtle collection a Belgian sculptor; they married in 1971. The couple were killed in Thailand when the bus they were travelling in collided with a truck. They were cremated in Bangkok following Thai customs. Military service During the Second World War Harrisson continued directing Mass-Observation and was radio critic for The Observer from May 1942 until June 1944. For much of this time he was in the army and gave up reviewing on leaving the UK. After service in the ranks he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Reconnaissance Corps on 21 November 1943. He had been recruited (some sources say by a confusion of names, despite his apparent suitability) for a plan to use the native peoples of Borneo against the Japanese. He was attached to Z Special Unit (also known as Z Force), part of the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD: a branch of the combined Allied Intelligence Bureau in the South West Pacific theatre). On 25 March 1945, he was parachuted with seven Z Force operatives from a Consolidated Liberator onto a high plateau occupied by the Kelabit people. An autobiographical account of this operation (SEMUT I, one of four SEMUT operations in the area) is given in World Within (Cresset Press, 1959); there are also reports ‚Äì not always flattering ‚Äì from some of his comrades. His efforts to rescue stranded American airmen shot down over Borneo are a central part of \\"The Airmen and the Headhunters\\", an episode of the PBS television series Secrets of the Dead. The recommendation for his Distinguished Service Order which was gazetted on 6 March 1947 (and dated 2 November 1946) describes how from his insertion until 15 August 1945 the forces under his command protected the flank of Allied advances, and caused severe disruption to Japanese operations. Ethnological work Following the war, he was Curator of the Sarawak Museum 1947‚Äì1966 (although he did not relinquish his commission until 14 March 1951). In the 1950s and 1960s Tom and Barbara Harrisson undertook pioneering excavations in the West Mouth of the Great Cave at Niah, Sarawak. Their most important discovery was a human skull in deposits dated by radiocarbon to about 40,000 years ago, the earliest date for modern humans in Borneo. The results of their excavations were never published in an appropriate manner leading to uncertainty and doubts as to their results; however, they are largely vindicated by results of excavations carried out by the Niah Cave Project from 2000‚Äì2003. Three films (amongst more made for British TV) record the Niah workThe Borneo Story series, Vimeo. At the start of the Brunei Revolt in 1962, Resident John Fisher of the 4th Division of Sarawak called on the Dayak tribes for help by sending a boat with the traditional Red Feather of War up the Baram River. Tom Harrisson also arrived in Brunei. He summoned the Kelabits from the highlands around Bario in the 5th Division, the centre of his wartime resistance. Hundreds of Dayaks responded, and formed into companies led by British civilians all commanded by Harrisson. This force reached some 2,000 strong, and with excellent knowledge of the tracks through the interior (there were no roads), helped contain the rebels. and cut off their escape route to Indonesia.Pocock, Tom (1973).

Legacy The title of his biography, The Most Offending Soul Alive, gives a flavour of the strong feelings he engendered, but he also had many admirers and is recognised as a pioneer in several areas. Harrisson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 New Year Honours, for his work as curator. Harrisson's series The Borneo Story was broadcast by BBC television in 1957; a subsequent series was produced by ITV in 1962/3. 1st series: 'Borneo from the Beginning'; 'Birds Nest Soup'; 'Peoples of the Tinjar River'; 'The Dyaks'; 'Fishermen of the Coast'; 2nd series: 'Cavemen of Today'; 'The Rainforest'; 'Highlanders of the Equator'; 'The Swamp'; A documentary Tom Harrisson ‚Äì The Barefoot Anthropologist, hosted by David Attenborough, was first broadcast on BBC4 early in 2007.Anthropology season, BBC Press Office.

In a web browser, the address bar (also location bar or URL bar) is a GUI widget that shows the current URL. The user can type a URL into the bar to navigate to a chosen website; in most modern browsers, non-URLs are automatically sent to a search engine. In a file browser, it serves the same purpose of navigation, but through the file-system hierarchy. Many address bars offer features like autocomplete and a list of suggestions while the address is being typed in. This auto-completion feature bases its suggestions on the browser's history. Some browsers have keyboard shortcuts to auto- complete an address. These are generally configured by the user on a case-by- case basis. Address bars have been a feature of web browsers since NCSA Mosaic.  Features  In addition to the URL, some address bars feature icons showing features or information about the site. For websites using a favicon (a small icon that represents the website), a small icon may be present within the address bar, a generic icon appearing if the website does not specify one. The address bar is also used to show the security status of a web page; various designs are used to distinguish between insecure HTTP and encrypted HTTPS, alongside use of an Extended Validation Certificate, which some websites use to verify their identity. Most web browsers allow for the use of a search engine if the term typed in is not clearly a URL.

It is situated on the south bank of the River Ewenny and the east bank of the River Ogmore. Its construction might have begun in 1106. Ogmore was one of three castles built in the area in the early 12th century, the others being Coity Castle and Newcastle Castle. It was in use until the 19th century for a range of purposes, including a court of justice and a prison, but is now a substantial set of remains and a local landmark. It is managed by local authorities.Hull, p. 203 Etymology When John Leland wrote his Itinerary, he referred to this fortress as \\"Ogor Castelle\\". The name comes from the nearby river, the River Ogmore (). History Ogmore Castle, 1987 Construction of Ogmore Castle might have started around 1106, its foundation predating the Norman conquest. In Caradoc of Llancarfan's The historie of Cambria, now called Wales: a part of the most famous yland of Brytaine, Caradoc wrote that the manor and castle were given to William de Londres, one of the legendary Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, by Robert Fitzhamon, the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan. In 1116, William de Londres was forced to abandon the castle when the Welsh appeared in force. His butler, Arnold, is credited with protecting the castle from the Welsh attack during the absence of William de Londres, and for this, he was knighted Sir Arnold Butler, also receiving the castle and manor of Dunraven as reward.Nicholson, p. 131 According to the custom of the times, the founding of a religious institution followed the acquisition of power. William de Londres, or his descendant John, built Ewenny Abbey from the castle. Also nearby was a religious place appended to Ogmore Castle by Morris de Londres or his descendant John, in 1141; Ewenny Priory is from Ogmore Castle. When Thomas' heiress married into the Chaworth family of Kidwelly, the lands passed in 1298 to the first Duke of Lancaster, and ownership remains in the hands of the Duchy of Lancaster to this day. Architecture The earthworks were steeply banked and oval in shape, enclosing an area of in length by in width. The inner ward was flat and constructed of timber structures. After completion of the ringwork, the building material was stone. The windows were round-headed with Sutton stone ashlar. The first-floor great hall had an ornate fireplace. William's son Maurice is credited with building the oblong keep; it is perhaps the oldest Norman keep in Glamorgan. Situated north of the main gateway, the keep was the first masonry building and was probably built in the 1120s. It is both the castle's tallest surviving building, and one of the oldest buildings in South Wales. Though only three of the original walls survive, their structure is characterized by irregularly shaped field stones, glacial pebbles, Lias limestone slabs, and brown mortar. Thomas de Londres replaced a timber palisade with a stone wall in around 1200. In the early 13th century, a second storey was added that housed private apartments. Garderobes were featured on two levels and a latrine tower was part of the exterior. A well- preserved lime kiln was built over an indeterminate 13th-century structure. Subsequently, a courthouse dating to the 14th century and rebuilt in the mid-15th century, was probably the third building to occupy the same spot. The building was rectangular in shape with a simple doorway and was flanked by two chambers. Having sustained damage during Owain Glynd≈µr's revolt, a new courthouse, situated in the castle's outer bailey, was built in 1454 and was in use until at least 1631. The present-day castle remains consist of the keep and some outer walls. Grounds Stepping Stones A deep, rock-cut ditch surrounded the castle grounds, which were dry except when the River Ewenny flooded the area during high tide. While the ditch that enclosed the castle's inner bailey filled at high tide, the flow was regulated by an embedded stone wall that blocked rising waters so that the interior of the castle did not flood. Looking towards the sea from the castle ruins, the view includes sandhills that proceed up the coast nearly as far as the town of Briton Ferry. Opposite from Ogmore Castle is Merthyr Mawr, where there are two sculptured crosses; the village can be reached by a footpath from the castle. Also near the castle are a popular set of stepping stones across the river which are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. A short distance to the southeast are several shallows filled with water that are said to have sunk spontaneously. One of them is circular, measuring approximately in diameter. Y Ladi Wen The ghost Y Ladi Wen (\\"the White Lady\\") is said to guard the castle's hidden treasure. In the story, a spirit was long said to wander the wider area until a man finally had the courage to approach her. When such a man eventually did so, the spirit led him to a treasure (a cauldron filled with gold) hidden under a heavy stone within the old castle tower, and allowed the man to take half the treasure for himself. However, the man later returned and took the more of the treasure. This angered the spirit, who, with her fingers turning into claws, attacked the man as he returned home. The man became gravely ill, but only died once he had confessed his greed. After that, an ailment known as Y Ladi Wen's revenge was said to befall any person who died prior to disclosing hidden treasure. The Ladi Wen stories associated with the castle, are likely related to a tradition that the River Ogmore itself contains the spirits of those who died without disclosing the location of hidden treasures. The tradition states that these spirits may only rest when their treasures are found and thrown downstream into the river (throwing treasures upstream would not help the spirits).

She was the first Hispanic woman to be elected to the Supreme Court of any state.Michigan Supreme Court-Dorothy Comstock Riley Life and career Riley was born in Detroit, where she attended public schools, graduating from Northwestern High School. She attended Wayne State University, where she earned a B.A. in 1946. She received an LL.B. degree from Wayne State University Law School in 1949. Female lawyers were not common at the time and reportedly, when she interviewed at several law firms after graduation, the qualification they were most interested in was her typing ability. Instead of working at such firms, she began her own practice in the Detroit area. In 1972, Riley became a Wayne County Circuit Judge and in 1976, she became the first woman to serve on the Michigan Court of Appeals. She ran for the Supreme Court in 1982 and lost. On December 9, 1982, Republican Governor William Milliken nevertheless appointed Riley to the Court to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Justice Blair Moody on November 26. This appointment became the subject of a bitter partisan controversy. Not only had Riley been rejected by the voters, but Milliken was also leaving office in less than a month, and newly elected Democratic Governor James Blanchard argued he should be allowed to make the appointment to replace Moody rather than Milliken. In February 1983, the other Supreme Court Justices voted 4-2 to remove Riley from the court. Blanchard replaced her with U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Boyle. However, Riley won election to the Supreme Court in 1984 and was re-elected in 1992. She served as chief justice from 1987 to 1991. She retired from the Court on September 1, 1997 due to the onset of Parkinson's disease. Riley had been a partner in the law firm of Riley and Roumell and was also the founder and Honorary Chair of the Michigan Supreme Court Historical Society. In 1991 she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, and the State Bar of Michigan presented Riley with its Distinguished Public Servant Award in 2000. Riley married Wallace D. Riley, a former President of the American Bar Association in 1967. They had one son, Peter Comstock Riley. She died in Grosse Pointe Farms, aged 79.

Los Angeles County Museum of Art M.2007.211.399 A bustle is a padded undergarment used to add fullness, or support the drapery, at the back of women's dresses in the mid-to-late 19th century. Bustles were worn under the skirt in the back, just below the waist, to keep the skirt from dragging. Heavy fabric tended to pull the back of a skirt down and flatten it. As a result a woman's petticoated skirt would lose its shape during everyday wear (from merely sitting down or moving about). A US patent illustration of a concept crinoline/bustle. 1867 History In the early stages of the fashion for the bustle, the fullness to the back of the skirts was carried quite low and often fanned out to create a train. The transition from the voluminous crinoline-enhanced skirts of the 1850s and 1860s can be seen in the loops and gathers of fabric and trimmings worn during this period. The bustle later evolved into a much more pronounced humped shape on the back of the skirt immediately below the waist, with the fabric of the skirts falling quite sharply to the floor, changing the shape of the silhouette. Transition from crinoline (1867‚Äì1872) As the fashion for crinolines wore on, their shape changed. Instead of the large bell-like silhouette previously in vogue, they began to flatten out at the front and sides, creating more fullness at the back of the skirts. One type of crinoline, the crinolette, created a shape very similar to the one produced by a bustle. Crinolettes were more restrictive than traditional crinolines, as the flat front and bulk created around the posterior made sitting down more difficult for the wearer. The excess skirt fabric created by this alteration in shape was looped around to the back, again creating increased fullness Early bustle (1869‚Äì1876) The bustle later developed into a feature of fashion on its own after the overskirt of the late 1860s was draped up toward the back and some kind of support was needed for the new draped shape. Fullness of some sort was still considered necessary to make the waist look smaller and the bustle eventually replaced the crinoline completely. The bustle was worn in different shapes for most of the 1870s and 1880s, with a short period of non-bustled, flat-backed dresses from 1878 to 1882. Late bustle (1881‚Äì1889) English bustle supports worn as undergarments, from 1875 to 1885. Woman wearing a dress with a bustle, USA, about mid. 1880s The bustle reappeared in late 1881,Punch; December 6; 1881 and was exaggerated to become a major fashion feature in the mid and late 1880s, in 1885 reaching preposterous proportions to modern eyes, as used in the play Arms and the Man by George Bernard Shaw. The fashion for large bustles ended in 1889.Corsets and Crinolines by Norah Waugh, 1990, p. 127ff 1889‚Äì1913 The bustle then survived into the 1890s and early 20th century, as a skirt support was still needed and the stylish shape dictated a curve in the back of the skirt to balance the curve of the bust in front. The bustle had completely disappeared by 1905, as the long corset of the early 20th century was now successful in shaping the body to protrude behind. Fashion Bustles and bustle gowns are rarely worn in contemporary society. Notable exceptions occur in the realm of haute couture, bridal fashion and Lolita Fashion. A dress in the bustle style may be worn as a costume. For example, in 1993 Eiko Ishioka won an Academy Award for her costume designs from Bram Stoker's Dracula. The film features several extravagant bustle gowns created for female leads Winona Ryder and Sadie Frost. (though the film states it is 1897, a time when the large bustles depicted would have disappeared years ago. Films like \\"The Bostonians\\", \\"Topsy Turvy\\" or \\"Age of Innocence\\" depict a more realistic fashion) Other usage * Bustle was also the term used for an additional external space at the rear of a tank's turret used for storing extra equipment, a notable usage being the added box at the rear of the turret on the Sherman Firefly variant. Its positioning on the vehicle resembling the similar placement of the bustle as used on the dress item. * In sailboat design, a bustle stern refers to any kind of stern that has a large \\"bustle\\" or blister at the waterline below the stern to prevent the stern from \\"squatting\\" when getting underway, or to a similar shape produced by the IOR measuring system in the late '70, '80 and early '90s. * The term bustleback was used to describe cars styled with an additional rear protrusion that were produced in the early 1980s, such as the Cadillac Bustleback Seville.

It features gameplay similar to Midway's earlier Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In the game, players battle the oppressive New Order Nation regime and their leader Helga, who have abducted Aerosmith. Players use a mounted gun to control onscreen crosshairs and shoot enemies using compact discs. The members of Aerosmith are hidden throughout the game's international locales and must be found in order to receive the game's true ending. The game was a critical and commercial success, and was ported to various consoles as well as MS-DOS computers. These ports were negatively received and reportedly dissuaded Midway from making a sequel.  Plot  In a dystopian version of 1996, an alliance of corrupt government and corporate military forces have taken control of the world in the guise of the \\"New Order Nation\\" (NON). The NON, with their vampish commander Head Mistress Helga (portrayed by Kerri Hoskins)), have declared war on youth culture (anyone aged from 13 to 30) and have banned all forms of music, television, magazines, and video games. The player travels to \\"Club X\\" in Los Angeles to see Aerosmith perform live, but the band is captured by NON troops and hustled off the stage in the middle of their show. After escaping from the club, the player steals a helicopter and flies across the city to find the band's car. From here, the player must destroy three NON installations in the Middle East, Amazon Jungle, and Pacific Rim(in whatever order they choose), then travel to London to defeat Helga and her remaining forces at Wembley Stadium. Gameplay Revolution X is a rail shooter in which the players must shoot targets including NON soldiers and vehicles, with the ultimate goal of rescuing the band. Players start the game at Club X in Los Angeles, first fighting the NON troops inside and then stealing a helicopter to fly across the city and find Aerosmith's car. They must then destroy three NON facilities in the Amazon jungle, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. These three stages may be played in any order; however, failing to complete the Middle East stage within a set time limit will send the players back to its start for another attempt. Finally, the players advance to Wembley Stadium for the final battle with the surviving NON forces and Head Mistress Helga. Throughout the game, objects can be shot that may reveal power-ups like health-replenishing shakes, CDs, powerful laserdiscs and Super Guns, Skull Bombs and shields. Players can also find hostages and free them throughout the game for extra points. At the end of each stage, the players receive bonus points based on the number of enemies killed and hostages rescued, as well as the amount of damage done. The five members of Aerosmith are hidden in secret locations throughout the game. When found, each member presents the player with a set of Aerosmith wings that increase the end-of-stage bonus. All members must be found in order to unlock the best ending and bonus level, in which the players go backstage after blowing up Helga, and can collect high-value Mammy Awards, as well as party with the band. Development and release Mortal Kombat II features an advertisement with the old Revolution X logo that arcade operators could toggle on and off. Occasionally after a large in-game explosion, Steven Tyler can be heard saying \\"Toasty!\\" in a high-pitched voice in reference to an easter egg in Mortal Kombat II. The game was originally developed as a title based on the film Jurassic Park. However, Sega acquired the rights instead and eventually released its own arcade game based on the film. Midway then retooled its concept to revolve around Aerosmith. The first release labeled Proto 5.0 (5/23/1994) is lacking several speech samples spoken by members of Aerosmith which can be heard after collecting power-ups and has a shorter Pacific Rim level. Revision 1.0 (6/16/1994) restored the missing speech samples and has the complete Pacific Rim level and completed two new crosshairs in P2 and P3. Revolution X was released as upright two player and deluxe three player arcade units and as a conversion kit for existing gun games such as Terminator 2: The Arcade Game. Another Revolution X featuring the hip-hop group Public Enemy was considered, but reportedly scrapped after the negative reception that the home versions of the original Revolution X received.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack consists of several Aerosmith songs continuously looped, including \\"Eat The Rich\\", \\"Sweet Emotion\\", \\"Toys in the Attic\\" and \\"Walk This Way\\".. Accessed March 5, 2013. A Muzak version of \\"Love in an Elevator\\" plays in the elevator part of the Amazon Jungle level. The soundtrack was featured in the CD Offer after playing or during attract mode. The console versions included loops of \\"Rag Doll\\" for the attract screen, main menu, and score, \\"Fever\\" for the Middle East level, and \\"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\\" for the ending. Ports The game was later ported by Rage Software and Software Creations, and released by Acclaim for DOS computers, the Super NES, Sega Mega Drive, PlayStation, Sega Saturn. A Sega 32X version was demonstrated at the 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo, but was never released, and possibly never completed. An Atari Jaguar conversion was also in development and slated to be published around the fourth quarter of 1995, but it was never released. None of the home versions are light gun compatible. The Super NES and Sega Mega Drive ports tone down the blood and the exotic dancers (also played by Kerri Hoskins) who were showing off their thongs have been turned around so they are facing the screen. CD-based console versions feature more blood, but the dancers are still facing the screen. Reception GamePro gave the arcade version a rave review, praising the ability to choose from multiple paths, the numerous secret items, the sharp graphics, and the Aerosmith soundtrack. They concluded \\"Rev X is not a revolution in gun games, but it's definitely the best one yet.\\" In a retrospective review, Allgame said it \\"can be quite a bit of fun\\", citing the tongue-in-cheek silliness and the ability to choose one's path at certain junctures. The home versions of the game, however, were thoroughly condemned by critics. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly highly praised the digitized voices and music of the SNES version, with two of them going so far as to say they were the best they'd heard on any 16-bit console, but nonetheless concluded it to be an inexcusably poor conversion. They particularly noted the absence of many graphical details from the arcade version and the awkward, sluggish movement of the control cursor. GamePros The Axe Grinder also criticized the graphics and controls, remarking that \\"Moving your target sight is a breeze, but accurately pinpointing small targets is difficult.\\" He disagreed with EGM on the audio, describing the music as dull and the sound effects as infrequent and muted. In the same issue, Air Hendrix found the same targeting problems in the Genesis version, and said it \\"desperately needs\\" light gun support. He also found the graphics to be grainy and choppy and the sounds to be static- ridden. Reviewers for Next Generation ridiculed the \\"laughable graphics, indistinguishable digitized voices, and awful music\\", and added that the game is overly repetitive and simply not fun. Scary Larry of GamePro panned the PlayStation version. Citing prominent slowdown, mediocre graphics, and a bland soundtrack, he assessed that \\"With standard shooting that doesn't live up to its arcade counterpart, Rev X seems like an old game wheezing through on its past reputation\\".

Its duration on a filling is 30 to 40 minutes. It was very common in Britain during World War II and for a long time afterwards. Underwater the Salvus is very compact and can be used where a diver with a bigger breathing set cannot get in, such as inside cockpits of ditched aircraft. It was made by Siebe Gorman & Company, LTD in London, England.NBCD - Air Raid Precautions It was designed in the early 1900s. Function Its arrangement can be seen from the image. It is a pendulum-type system with one breathing tube. This type is the Neck Salvus:therebreathersite.nl: English Salvus there was another type, for use on land only, where the counterlung (= breathing bag) hung by his left hip from the cylinder and canister pack. That pack is a metal plate (probably aluminium), with a webbing sheet stuck to one side to protect its user's diving suit or overall. The absorbent canister and the cylinder are fastened to it by a strap that can be unbuckled. It has no plastic in its construction. The mask has an inner orinasal mask to cut down on dead-space. It does not have a shutoff valve. It has a wooden plug fastened to it by a light chain; that plug fits into the breathing tube entry inside the mask to stop debris from entering, but is not a watertight seal. The mask and its tube unscrews from the canister and can be replaced by a tube ending in a mouthpiece. The mouthpiece tube has a shutoff valve at the mouthpiece. The Salvus mouthpiece also has an attached noseclip. A pair of industrial-type eyes-only goggles was included with the set when it came. That mouthpiece has an outer flap that goes outside the lips and is extended into straps fastened behind the neck. (That makes the mouthpiece much securer against coming out or leaking. In a test when diving with an open-circuit aqualung that had that sort of strapped- in mouthpiece, the diver went limp as if unconscious, to test the mouthpiece, and as a result he rolled belly-up, and his cheeks inflated, and the mouthpiece tried to float out, but its strap and outer flap kept it in and watertight.) The breathing bag makes the diver very stern-heavy, but that can be cured by putting 6 pounds of diver's weights (e.g. a pair of lead-shot- filled anklets) inside the wetsuit chest. The Salvus has no provision to connect to a buoyancy device; but the Salvus can be worn with a separate diver's lifejacket (not a stab jacket) which has its own small inflation cylinder. There is a small water catchment sump and drain on the underside of the canister. Its cylinder pressure gauge is on a flexible metal tube and fits in a circular webbing pouch threaded on the waist harness strap. The bag tube unscrews from the canister pack. The diagonal strap clips onto a corner of the side-pack. The cylinder has a constant-flow valve and a bypass. The thread on top of the cylinder is the same as on an oxy-gas torch oxygen cylinder but the opposite gender, for easy refilling by decanting. History CGI image. 2 workmen with Siebe Gorman Salvus rebreathers set off to clean up a building after fumigation. Early versions were originally designed for use in bad breathing conditions such as in underground mines and other enclosed spaces, where heavy concentrations of noxious gases could build up and affect the workers. During World War I, Salvuses were used by machine gunner units on the Western Front (1915) as an interim protection against enemy gas weapons. During World War II the Salvus Mk.VI model was used by British troops. Mk. VI's were also used by the National Fire Service: their cooler boxes were marked with the letters 'NFS'. War-surplus Salvuses were much used by early sport divers in Britain and Australia in the 1950s before aqualungs became readily affordably available. At the coalmine rescue on 7‚Äì9 September 1950 at Knockshinnoch Castle Colliery near New Cumnock, Ayrshire, Scotland, 115 trapped miners were equipped with Salvuses borrowed from fire stations around to bring them out through a gas-filled mine passage.

A wide variety of topics from entertainment (e.g. music, radio television, films) to jobs to politics to bereavement and to personal relationships are widely discussed, mostly from an Irish perspective. Participation in the forums only requires free registration. History In 1998, John \\"Cloud\\" Breslin created a single forum to enable discussion amongst Irish users of the id Software game Quake, while he was a postgraduate student at the National University of Ireland, Galway. This forum was part of the Irish Games Network's quake.ie site, and utilized \\"Matt's WWWBoard\\" software. The site gained in popularity until the size of its threads exceeded the capacity of the software. Breslin came into contact with Tom Murphy, who had been administrating a Quake-related forum called Quakapalooza, utilizing Murphy's ASP software. Some non-gaming related forums were added to the service, and the retitled \\"Cloud Boards\\" began using the Ultimate Bulletin Board software. Murphy proposed a more general (not just Quake-related) forum, dedicated to general Irish issues in 1999, and considered the name boards.ie to be a more useful and desired domain. In 2000, Cloud Boards was then rebranded for a more general audience. Limitations in what organizations could register prevented private individuals from registering vanity or custom domains. Breslin had previously been unsuccessful in registering the domain cloud.ie with the Irish domain registry. Murphy entered a bet with Breslin that he could successfully register a domain for a rebranded web forum. Murphy renamed his company Spin Solutions to Boards for a day in order to trick the system, registered the paperwork with the Irish domain registrar for boards.ie, and was granted the domain. In 2003, boards.ie achieved one million posts to its forums. In 2007, the boards.ie Ltd. company acquired the rights to boards.us and other domains from Breslin. In 2008, boards.ie hired its first full-time developer. For the 10th anniversary of boards.ie's first historic post, the complete data set of its discussions with semantic markup (see SIOC) was made available to researchers, and a competition looking for interesting creations based on this data was launched. Later that year in August, boards.ie saw its first shareholding investment from Daft Media Ltd. Structure The site is majority owned by Distilled Media Ltd with a minority stake held by some of the original company founders, who delegate administrative and editorial control over the site to hundreds of unpaid moderators. Currently, Tom Murphy is operating as acting Managing Director after the departure of the previous Managing Director, Gerry Shanahan, in February 2009. There are over 1,350 forums, public and private. It is operated by Boards.ie Limited, an Irish Commercial Company, more specifically in the same headquarters of Daft.ie (DAFT MEDIA LIMITED), in Golden Lane, Dublin 8 which are both owned by the Distilled Media Group Boards.ie Limited is considered a small company, since its balance sheet total does not exceed 4.4million euro, and is registered as a commercial company involved in \\"computer and related activities.\\". Boards.ie Ltd was set up on Mon the 24th of Jan 2000 in Dublin 8. The company's current directors Paul Kenny, Eamonn Fallon, Odhran Ginnity, John Breslin and Thomas G Murphy have been the director of 24 other Irish companies between them; 6 of which are now closed. Boards.Ie Limited has 3 shareholders. Boards.ie started life as a forum for the computer game ‚ÄòQuake‚Äô in 1998. It was registered as a company two years later. In 2008, it was considered one of the largest indigenous Irish websites online. However, its latest accounts show it had accumulated losses of ‚Ç¨445,000 and rising, dropping more than ‚Ç¨100,000 in those 12 months alone. It also had a hole of ‚Ç¨65,000 in its balance sheet, a full four years after Daft got involved. A new forum can be proposed by anyone, but requires a certain amount of support from other members. Most users do not pay any usage fees, although subscription is offered with benefits such as custom avatars and a change of username, amongst other features. Expansion The boards.ie site expanded into a number of other countries including boards.org.uk (United Kingdom), boards.us (United States), boards.jp (Japan), boards.com.cn (China), and boards.co.nz (New Zealand), but all have since closed. Sites associated with classified advertising (adverts.ie) and group coupons (boardsdeals.ie) have also been established. Cyber-attacks On January 21, 2010 at 11:20 GMT, boards.ie director Tom Murphy took the site offline after an attack on the forum's database. The attack originated from a source outside Ireland. A portion of the database, including usernames, encrypted passwords and email addresses were accessed. The site advised all users who used the same password on other websites to change it there too. A DDoS attack in January 2016 disabled boards.ie for a few days. Starting on 17 January, the sustained attack brought the site down on 18 January; the site resumed service on 20 January. Other major Irish sites also experienced attacks in the same timeframe. Awards boards.ie was awarded a Zeddy Award in 2001. (The Zeddy Awards have since been discontinued.) It also won a Golden Spider Award in the same year. For his contribution to Irish society, Tom Murphy was awarded a Net Visionary Award by the Irish Internet Association in 2004 in the \\"Social Contribution\\" category. John Breslin was awarded Net Visionary Awards by the Irish Internet Association in 2005 and 2006. boards.ie won two awards in the Irish Web Awards 2008, \\"Best Website in Ireland\\" and \\"Best Discussion Forum\\".

At the time of release, it was the most advanced product ever launched by Nokia,Nokia unveils the 6600 By J√∏rgen Sundgot, infoSync World, Monday 16 June 2003. and it runs on Symbian OS 7.0s (Series 60 2nd Edition). It also featured a VGA camera, a music player and video player, Bluetooth and extended storage by memory card, being the second non-Communicator to do so (after the Nokia 3650). The model is still in use in many parts of the world and has proved to be a durable product. By many users it is considered as the trend setter phone which proved to be a bright milestone for its manufacturer. The phone was intended to replace the popular 6310i as the predominant business class model in the Nokia range. It should not be confused with the newer Nokia 6600 fold, Nokia 6600 slide and Nokia 6600i phones which have little resemblance to the original 6600. A variant of the Nokia 6600 was launched in the U.S. market as the Nokia 6620. During its lifespan, the 6600 sold 150 million units, making it one of the most successful phones to date.

The natural habitat of Cibotium is among the dripping trees and stream gullies of the rainforests on Hawaii's windward volcanic slopes. The fossil record indicates that the genus was once a part of the boreotropical flora found in Europe, eastern North America, and western Asia. Fossilized Cibotium oregonense was found near Medford, Oregon, and fossilized Cibotium iwatense was found in Iwate, Japan.Barrington, D. (1993). Ecological and Historical Factors in Fern Biogeography. Journal of Biogeography, 20(3), 275-279. doi:10.2307/2845635 No publicly accessible Cibotium collections are growing outdoors in the United Kingdom, but two glasshouse collections are kept at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the RBG Edinburgh in Scotland. Specimens of Cibotium regale in the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken are visible to the public when the glasshouses open in May. Uses Cibotium glaucum, from Hawai'i, is the most frequently encountered Cibotium species in the horticultural trade, along with its sibling species Cibotium chamissoi and the large-growing Cibotium menziesii. They are sometimes seen in California garden designs. Cibotium barometz is best known for its role in ancient medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is used as an anti- inflammatory and an anodyne; its rhizome hairs are used in Malaysia and China as a styptic for wounds. It is still exported from Malaysia for this purpose. Hair-covered pieces of the rhizome, with bud stalks imitating legs, were used to lend credence to the medieval legend of the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, a half-sheep, half-plant hybrid. Historically, women in Hawai'i have used the furry part of the Cibotium as a tampon.Who invented tampons? June 6, 2006 The Straight Dope Threats Pressure on Hawaiian Cibotium habitats comes from development encroaching on the forested areas, especially the more accessible, lower-lying areas which are commercially attractive for land clearance. A less obvious threat comes from an invasive introduced tree fern species: Cyathea cooperi (the most popular garden tree fern in the United States), which has escaped from the islands' suburban gardens and now outcompetes the endemic flora. Wind-blown spores from this rapidly growing Australian import can migrate many miles into pristine Cibotium forests. This is a fairly recent phenomenon, but one which may eventually have grave consequences for the tree fern ecosystem in Hawaii. References *Smith, A.R., K.M. Pryer, E. Schuettpelz, P. Korall, H.

The Hoyts Group of companies in Australia and New Zealand includes Hoyts Cinemas and Val Morgan. Hoyts operates more than 450 cinema screens and 55,000 seats, making it Australia's second largest movie exhibitor after Event Hospitality and Entertainment. Val Morgan sells advertising on cinema screens and digital billboards. In 2015, the majority of Hoyts was acquired by a Chinese conglomerate, the Wanda Group. In Argentina by Cinemark. In Chile it was acquired by Cin√©polis, and in Uruguay by Life Cinemas. History 1909 - 1930: At the start of the 20th century, dentist Arthur Russell bought a share in a small touring tent show incorporating magic and moving pictures. Russell also performed shows at St George's Hall in Bourke Street, Melbourne, and in 1909 moving pictures was the only attraction. Russell eventually negotiated a long lease for St George's Hall with the purpose of opening a Picture Palace called Hoyt's Pictures. By the time he died at the end of World War I, Hoyts had expanded into the suburbs of Melbourne and into Sydney. In 1926, Hoyts and two other companies, Electric Theatres Pty. Ltd. and Associated Theatres Pty. Ltd., merged to become Hoyts Theatres Limited. In 1930, the Fox Film Corp. (now Twentieth Century Fox) acquired a majority of shares in Hoyts Theatres Ltd. 1980s: In 1982, Twentieth Century Fox sold Hoyts to Stardawn Investments, a group of four Melbourne businessmen. In 1985, the Fink family subsequently bought out the other partners to become the sole owner. In 1987, the corporation was restructured and two of the companies in the corporation were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange: Hoyts Media and Hoyts Entertainment. However, the company that owned the cinemas, Hoyts Cinemas, was not floated until 1996. The years between 1987 and 1996 saw Hoyts expand in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. 1990s: Following Leon Fink's death in 1993, the Hoyts organisation was sold to Hellman & Friedman and Lend-Lease. The company eventually went public in 1995. In 1999, Hoyts celebrated its 90th anniversary and was ranked the seventh largest cinema exhibitor in the world. In the same year, the late Kerry Packer's private family company, Consolidated Press Holdings, bought the chain for $620 million. After that, Hoyts began to sell off international cinemas except for some New Zealand cinemas. 2000s: In 2004, Hoyts joined forces with Village Roadshow and Amalgamated Holdings Limited to bail out Val Morgan Cinema Advertising, eventually taking their stake to 100% in 2005. In December that year, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited and West Australian Newspapers purchased the company from Consolidated Press. In 2007, Hoyts was sold to Sydney-based private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners. The sale valued the company at A$440 million. 2010s: In 2010, Hoyts acquired Australian Multiplex Cinemas in Queensland and the Berkeley Cinema Group in New Zealand. In 2014, plans were shelved to start a video streaming service. In 2014, Damian Keogh was appointed chief executive officer, and Hoyts was bought by Chinese billionaire Sun Xishuang through his investment company ID Leisure Ventures. In 2015, Wanda Cinema Line, a subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group, purchased Hoyts from ID Leisure Ventures. In 2018, Hoyts Kiosk DVD vending machines were rebranded as Video Ezy after the group sold its subsidiary. Cinemas Features available at many Hoyts Cinemas include reclining chairs, large high-resolution screens under the _Xtremescreen_ brand, and dine-in menus under the _Hoyts Lux_ brand. Seats that move and vibrate in synchronisation with on-screen action have been introduced at some cinemas using D-Box technology. Hoyts Cinema Technology Group (CTG) was established in 2008 and helps other exhibitors such as Palace Cinemas install and operate digital cinema. Hoyts CTG also supports one-off screenings such as festivals or corporate events. Val Morgan Current logo of Val Morgan. Val Morgan was created by Valentine (Val) Morgan and specialises in advertising on cinema screens. Val Morgan's sister company, Val Morgan Outdoor (VMO), operates advertising screens in shopping centres, gyms, service stations and office towers, as well as outdoor digital billboards. In 2019, a joint venture was formed to advertise on cinema screens in Saudi Arabia, as part of the group's expansion across the Middle East.  Hoyts Distribution  Hoyts Distribution was the film distribution arm of the Group until 2012, when it was sold to StudioCanal.

The Marwats are also known as Spin Lohani (White faction of Lohanis), and their most closely related kin are other Lohani tribes like Miankhel, Daulat Khel and Tatur. The Marwats were named for their ancestor Marwat Khan Lodi.Mohmand, Sher Muhammad, The Marwats. p. 50-53 History :See also Bannu Marwats, as well as other branches of Lohanis, lived in Zarghun Shar (located in the Paktika province) as well as Wana valley of South Waziristan. They had a long-standing dispute with Sulaiman Khels and other Ghilzais, who had already forced other Lodi tribes to migrate en masse to India. In one of the decisive battles, in the mid-15th century, Lohanis were thoroughly defeated by the Ghilzais, and had to leave Katawaz to the latter. Lohanis and their Dotani cousins had to be content with just Wana valley and surroundings. The Marwat and other Lohanis expanded from Waziristan further east, occupying large tracts of present-day Dera Ismail Khan and Tank, by defeating Prangi, Suri and Sarwani tribes. Marwats stayed in Waziristan while Daulat Khels and Taturs migrated to newly conquered Daman. The headman of Kati Khel (branch of Daulat Khel), then the chief of all Lohanis, agreed to give shares in the income from the lands of Daman to Marwats and Miankhels. In the late 16th century, or in the beginning of the 17th century, Wazirs issued from their homeland Birmal and encroached upon the territories of Marwats in the nowadays South Waziristan (present day abodes of Ahmadzai Wazirs). Wazirs, with the aid of Mehsuds, defeated Marwats and Dotanis, the former were expelled while the latter was allowed to retain some lands in Wana. When the Marwats arrived in Daman to take possession of their lands, the Daulat Khel Lohanis opposed that. In the subsequent battle, the Daulat Khels were defeated by Marwats, and were expelled from Daman. The Daulat Khels sought the help of Gandapurs, Babars and Bhittanis, and this alliance was able to defeat the Marwats.\\"The Marwats\\" by Sher Muhammad MohmandBannu Gazetterr The defeated Marwats stayed in Dara Pezu and surroundings for some time, until they got the invitation from a section of Niazis, who were settled in present-day Lakki Marwat, to assist them in defeating the rival clan. Marwats turned against the Niazis. The Niazi clan first defeated the Marwat clan against whom they were hired and slaughtered them in great numbers. After the friendship with their brothers Marwats, Niazis fled towards Mianwali. Some where between 1601 and 1607, Marwats had taken possession of all the 'Tal' tract. Marwats were nominally part of Mughal empire. After decline of Mughals, the area came under Durranis. Ahmad Shah Abdali didn't enforce taxes on Marwats but put the condition of providing contingents of Marwat warriors for his military campaigns. In the most important military campaign of Abdali, 120 Marwat horsemen accompanied him under their chief Begu Khan to India. Ahmad Shah's successor, Timur Shah Durrani, enforced Tax on Marwats. After the battle of Panipat, Marwats split into two factions, White and Black and fought each other for next 60 years. Taking advantage of their internal rift, Wazirs conquered some area from Marwats in the sandy tracts of the present day Bannu district. In 1819, Nawab of Mankera interested in the civil war of Marwats on the invitation of one party and later occupied the area for themselves. The weakened Marwats were unable to resist the occupation and thus Marwats lost the independence. Soon after, Sikhs conquered Lakki Marwat and built a fort on the bank of river Gambila near Present day Lakki city. In 1847 Marwats rose in rebellion against the Sikhs but it was successfully suppressed by the latter.Marwat uprising against the Sikh In Anglo-Sikh Wars, Marwats provided great deal of help to British against the Sikhs.

It is located 6 miles south east of Dartford and the same distance south-west of Gravesend. History The place in Kent is recorded as Langanfelda in the Saxon Charters of 964-995, and as Langafel in the Domesday Book of 1086. It had been proposed by town planner Patrick Abercrombie as part of the Greater London Plan in the mid-1940s to build a new town in the Longfield area, however other satellite areas around London were selected instead. Localities Longfield and New Barn is a civil parish named after the adjacent villages it covers, the eastern part being New Barn, it also covers the smaller settlement, the neighbourhood of Longfield Hill. Longfield is the ancient village, situated on the road between Dartford and Meopham; the historic church there is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. New Barn is larger in population than Longfield, although has little in the way of services, being a comparatively recent development and purely residential in nature. Topography Longfield is four miles south east of Dartford and near Gravesend. It is a linear development that is partly contiguous with the village of Hartley immediately to the south. The whole civil parish gently slopes from southeast and south to north. Elevations range from 92m AOD in the southwest of the developed area of New Barn in the east which is on a wide rise, to 45m AOD in and around the chalk pit just west of Longfield across the largely disused HS1 south-of-London link railway line towards Southfleet (just north of the village). Just above this is the tiny settlement, a farmed area named Pinden, to the south, however before this on the road towards London is another named community, no more than a row of cottages on the road named Whitehill. The villages of New Barn and Longfield are within and give their names to the civil parish of Longfield and New Barn which also covers the settlement of Longfield Hill. Longfield is the ancient village, situated on the road between Dartford and Meopham. New Barn is larger in population than Longfield, although has little in the way of services, being a recent development and purely a residential location. Governance Longfield fell within the Hundred of Axtane and its successor Dartford Rural District. The Local Government Act 1972 made the village part of the Sevenoaks district of Kent on 1 April 1974. It was transferred to the borough of Dartford on 1 April 1987 where it has remained since. It has been in the Dartford parliamentary constituency since 1983. Dr Howard Stoate (Labour), who had been the MP since 1997, decided not to stand again as a candidate at the 2010 general election. \\"MP to quit over second job rules\\" His successor candidate was defeated by Gareth Johnson (Conservative) at that election. Economy The village has a shopping area consisting of a local baker and butcher, two local supermarkets, a post office, chemist, estate agents, hair-dressers, an antiques shop, various restaurants and take-aways, a pet supply store, an undertakers and a country market on Fridays. Culture There is one pub in Longfield, the Railway Tavern. The Wheatsheaf, a 15th-century thatched pub, outside the village on the B255 road to Bluewater, closed down in 2011. The Long Valley Club and the Hartley Country Club are club-based venues restricted to paid membership. Other pubs in the area include the Green Man on Longfield Hill, the White Swan near Ash and the Rising Sun in Fawkham. The church is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, and was built in 1343. It is a Grade II* listed building Transport Rail Longfield railway station connects the village with Southeastern services to London Victoria via Bromley South, Ramsgate via Chatham and Dover Priory via Chatham and Canterbury East. Buses Longfield is served by Arriva Kent Thameside routes 423, 433 and 489 and Go Coach routes 474 and 475. These connect it with Bluewater, Dartford and Gravesend.

Formed in 1993 in the Cleveland Warehouse District, the band is known for their avant- garde sound which includes influence from metal, art rock and electro- industrial and their imagery which features masks and costumes as well as their unique live shows usually performed at smaller venues. Mushroomhead has sold over 2 million media units worldwide, and has released 8 full-length albums and 15 music videos. Over their lifetime, Mushroomhead has gone through many changes in band lineups, with drummer Steve Felton being the only consistent member. Currently, the group comprises 8 members. History  Debut album, Superbuick and M3 (1993‚Äì2000)  In 1993, Mushroomhead was established as a side project. To differentiate itself from the members' existing bands and to dispel any misconceptions about the group's sound and musical content, Mushroomhead used costumes, masks, and pseudonyms. Mushroomhead played its first show in 1993. Days later, the octet found itself on stage alongside established metal band GWAR. \\"We played our first show on a Saturday\\" said the band's drummer, Skinny, in an article for Mushroomhead's official website. ‚ÄúThree days later, we got a call to play with GWAR at the Cleveland Agora in front of 2,000 people ‚Äì our second show ever!‚Äù. In 1995, Mushroomhead released a self-financed debut album, Mushroomhead, with their own record label, Filthy Hands Co. (previously known as Shroomco Records and later on, MRH Records). For the members, Mushroomhead became a priority with their original bands breaking-up. Although the line-up saw many changes throughout the 1990s, the band stayed active, steadily releasing music and gaining followers. In 1996, they released Superbuick. In 1999, Mushroomhead released M3, which was the final album self-financed and self-released by the band. XX and XIII (2000‚Äì2005) In 2001, Mushroomhead released a compilation album titled XX on the independent label Eclipse Records. Later in the year, after quickly selling almost 40,000 copies in just 2‚Äì3 months,Verified through use of Nielsen Soundscan the band signed with major label Universal Records and the compilation was remastered and re-released internationally. The release of the album led Mushroomhead to major national and international tours including Ozzfest 2002; as well as television exposure via their first music video \\"Solitaire/Unraveling\\". Also in 2001, guitarist J.J. Righteous was replaced by one of the band's previous stage dancers & then current sampler, Marko Vukcevich. 2003 saw the release of XIII, their first album with new material for Universal Records. The album produced the single \\"Sun Doesn't Rise\\" which was featured on MTV: Headbangers Ball and the Freddy vs Jason soundtrack. Also featuring the hidden track \\"Crazy\\", a song originally by Seal. The album debuted at no. 40 on the Billboard Top 200 charts and sold 400,000 copies worldwide. After an extensive world tour, vocalist J Mann announced he was leaving the band in August 2004, citing exhaustion and to take care of his sick father. He was replaced by Three Quarters Dead singer, Waylon. In August 2005, Mushroomhead self-released its first DVD on its own Filthy Hands label ‚Äì \\"Volume 1\\". Produced, directed, shot, and edited by the band, Volume 1 covers the band's rise in the 2000s with live performances, music videos, and behind the scenes footage. While on the road in 2005, Mushroomhead began the process of writing new material and recording a new album. In December 2005, Mushroomhead signed with Megaforce Records, ensuring the new album's availability nationally and internationally. On June 6, 2006, Mushroomhead launched Mushroom Kombat ‚Äì an interactive flash feature as a part of the band's official website. The mini-game pits band members against each other in a Mortal Kombat-style environment, with each member having a unique fatality. Mushroomhead headlined with Dope, Nocturne, and New Orleans locals Invain on the Music For Freedom Tour sponsored by J√§germeister at the House of Blues in New Orleans, Louisiana on Tuesday, August 16, 2005. This show was one of the last big acts to play in New Orleans for a long time due to Hurricane Katrina striking New Orleans on August 29, 2005. Savior Sorrow and Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children (2005‚Äì2012) Savior Sorrow was released on September 19, 2006, and debuted at No. 45 on the Billboard 200 charts with sales exceeding 12,000. The band's label stated that sales were closer to 25,000 with the inclusion of sales made while on tour. As a result, SoundScan issued an apology the day following the release of sales data due to mistakes made in estimates. The primary reason given was the lack of inclusion of sales from the Best Buy retailer chain. Sales of Savior Sorrow were roughly 26,000 and the chart entry place was closer to the No. 30 spot than No. 73\\\\. Savior Sorrow's chart position was later officially adjusted to No. 50\\\\. \\"Simple Survival\\", the pre-released single to Savior Sorrow, was placed at No. 39 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart one week after the release. Also in 2006, Daniel Fox (Lil' Dan) joined the band as a touring drummer. The band has performed three shows on the Mayhem Festival tour, filling in for Bullet for My Valentine. Live footage was compiled into the band's second DVD, titled \\"Volume 2\\". On December 29, 2007, Mushroomhead won Video of the Year 2007 on the MTV2 Headbanger's Ball for \\"12 Hundred\\" from the Savior Sorrow record. On September 17, 2008, it was announced that the band will release the \\"Volume 2\\" DVD on October 28 through Filthy Hands/Megaforce Records. The disc features two and a half hours of content, including live footage from the three-year Savior Sorrow tour, music videos including \\"12 Hundred\\", \\"Simple Survival\\", \\"Burn\\", the short video for \\"Tattoo\\", \\"Save Us\\" and \\"Embrace the Ending\\", video commentary and behind the scenes footage. To support the DVD, Mushroomhead hit the road with The Autumn Offering, XFactor1, and Human Factors Lab from October 3 in Findlay, Ohio, until November 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the tour, Mushroomhead returned to the studio to record their next album. They released Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children in September 2010. Within the first week of its release, it became the No. 1 best selling metal album on iTunes. A new song, \\"Your Soul Is Mine,\\" appeared on the Saw VI Soundtrack. On October 1, 2010, a music video for \\"Come On\\" debuted on Headbangers Ball on MTV. The video has since been barred from airing on MTV and other television outlets after being deemed too graphic by network censors. On October 28, 2010, the band's founding guitarist, JJ Righteous, died of unknown reasons at the age of 41. In October 2010, following the death of ex bandmate JJ Righteous, J Mann appeared on stage with the band during their Halloween show, performing vocals for two songs alongside both Jeffrey Nothing and Waylon. Both he and Waylon made a point of announcing that there were no hard feelings between the two of them, and that they are in fact on good terms with each other. On October 5, 2010, the Professional Wrestling Promotion known as TNA (Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) (Now called \\"Impact Wrestling\\") used their hit single \\"Come On\\" as the theme song to promote a match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley, a confrontation that was 20 years in the making. The promotional video can be seen on the TNA Wrestling official YouTube Channel. It is said that a longtime fan of the band put that together for them. In February 2012, it was announced that guitarist Gravy and bassist Pig Benis would be replaced by Tommy Church and Ryan Farrell respectively. In April 2012, Dave \\"Gravy\\" Felton stated publicly on his Facebook fan page that he was \\"kicked out of the band.\\" In May 2012, Daniel \\"Lil Dan\\" Fox left Mushroomhead to work for another band. It was rumored that he is working as a drum technician for Marilyn Manson. On May 22, Dave Felton posted on his fan page an interview about his latest band. In the interview, he was asked about the Mushroomhead split. He said that he was kicked out via email and that it was the third time he had been told to leave. He said that he thought one of the reasons was because he did not have a party mentality (drinking and smoking) and that he thought it sometimes got in the way of band progress. The interview was on Uncensored Net Noise on the Msc Radio Network LLC. Drum tech Jeremiah Stratton (also known from Hed PE) had taken over Fox's percussion parts in the Hed 2 Head Tour 3. After the Hed 2 Head Tour ended, drum tech Elliot Mapes took over Fox's drum parts for live shows. People have jokingly called him \\"Tall E\\" in reference to Fox's nickname being \\"Lil Dan\\". On Thursday, August 16, 2012, Mushroomhead stated on their official Facebook fan page that former member Bronson would return on guitar for their 2012 \\"Old School Show\\". The Righteous & the Butterfly, return of J Mann and departure of Waylon Reavis and Jeffrey Nothing (2012‚Äì2019) In September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page. It was said by Mushroomhead frontman Jeff Hatrix that former Slipknot and current Painface vocalist Anders Colsefni is in the works to do a recording together in their upcoming studio sessions. The band entered their own Filthy Hands Studio in December 2012 to begin writing and recording their next studio album. Their eighth album was the only one to showcase all three vocalists. Drummer Steve Felton described it as \\"very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This is the first record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it's going to go. For the old school fans there's a lot of flavorful elements in it so they will definitely enjoy it.\\" A 2014 performance depicting three past and present Mushroomhead vocalists; Waylon Reavis, Jeffrey Hatrix, and Jason \\"J Mann\\" Popson. On August 16, Jason Popson confirmed his return to the band via Facebook. Mushroomhead toured Australia for the first time as part of the Soundwave Festival 2014. On February 14, 2014, Mushroomhead released the date and name of their new album which will be released May 13, 2014 and the name of the new album is The Righteous & the Butterfly. This album marks the return of J Mann. On April 15, 2014, Frontman Jeffrey Nothing released the band's first unofficial single \\"Qwerty\\" on YouTube from his personal Facebook account. This marks the first song featuring J Mann since rejoining the band. The album received mostly positive reviews and is Mushroomhead's first album to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Top 200 chart in the United States, reaching #20, selling around 11,000 copies the first week. The album also, reached #1 in the Billboard Indie chart, their first album to do so. The Righteous & the Butterfly reached #5 in the Top Rock Albums and #1 in the Top Hard Rock Albums. Mushroomhead have released an official music video for the album's second single \\"Out Of My Mind\\". The band will be co-headlining the 2014 Shockfest Tour with Insane Clown Posse. As of October 5, 2015, vocalist Waylon Reavis announced via his Facebook page that he had parted ways with Mushroomhead, citing \\"irreconcilable differences with band ownership\\" and stating he had \\"severed all ties with Mushroomhead and Filthy Hands Company.\\" Mushroomhead went on a headlining UK tour in 2016, the first since 2002. American Head Charge was supposed to be their main support, but they ultimately decided to drop off the tour. A full European tour followed the next year. On March 7, 2018, it was announced that vocalist and founding member Jeffrey \\"Nothing\\" Hatrix had parted ways with the band. Two days later, guitarist Tommy Church announced that he had also quit the band. On March 17, Popson's Pitch Black Forecast bandmates and the band's roadies Steve Rauckhorst and Tommy \\"Tankx\\" Shaffner were revealed as the new vocalist and guitarist respectively. Rauckhorst was a longtime friend, former neighbor and influence of the former vocalist. On April 4, 2019, Mushroomhead announced that they had signed with Napalm Records. In an interview during their UK tour in July 2019, drummer Felton and his wife, vocalist Jackie LaPonza revealed more information about the then forthcoming album, mentioning that during the tour they had recorded vocals at Abbey Road Studios and that the new album was 80% finished, with a tentative release date of April 2020. They confirmed that the new album cycle would also include new masks. A Wonderful Life (2020‚Äìpresent)  On April 21, 2020, it was announced the band's new album was titled A Wonderful Life and would be released on June 19. It was also revealed that touring vocalist Jackie LaPonza (who has toured with the band since 2014) has officially joined the band on a full-time basis, adopting the alias, Ms. Jackie. The second single, \\"The Heresy\\" was released on May 26, 2020. Musical style and influences Mushroomhead's sound combines elements of heavy metal, hip hop, experimental music, industrial music and techno. The band has been categorized as industrial metal, alternative metal, nu metal, experimental metal and electro-industrial. They are influenced by bands such as Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Pink Floyd, Pantera, Nine Inch Nails, and KMFDM. In a 2014 interview with music journalist Greg Prato, Jason Popson reflected on the band's musical influences, stating \\"When you're talking about a band with nine guys, you're talking about tons of influences. I know when we started the band, we were really into a lot of the stuff Mike Patton was doing - Faith No More or Mr. Bungle, things like that. But we also liked heavier bands like Meshuggah, Pantera. Then there's electronic stuff. So it's really all over the map. It's everything from hard rock to punk rock to hip-hop to electronica. It's pretty vast.\\" Artistry Steve \\"Skinny\\" Felton\\" performing the water drums. Image and visuals The members of Mushroomhead have identified themselves by wearing masks and by its distinct ‚ÄúX Face‚Äù logo ‚Äì commonly worn on the masks of most members, as well as clothing and merchandise. The band originally adopted masks and stage names to not conflict with their original bands. The band's look has evolved over the years, featuring alterations to bring them up to date and freshen up the image for new albums and tours. In January 2013, Mushroomhead Video Director, Maskmaker and Make-up artist Dave Henson Greathouse competed in Season 4 of original SyFy series \\"Face Off\\", a special effects prosthetic makeup reality show competition. Another common visual trait that Mushroomhead is known for, are the use of water drums, which are performed by all the percussionists in the band. Relationship with Slipknot In the band's early days, the group repeatedly saw accusations of plagiarism due to sharing a similar distinct visual performance to Iowan metal band Slipknot, but the Mushroomhead band members have heavily denied the claims of \\"ripping off\\" Slipknot and insist that they were instead the first to adopt the masked aesthetic. As a result of the comparisons, Mushroomhead has had an on-and-off rivalry with Slipknot since at least 1999. The feud erupted mostly among fans of both bands. Before signing Slipknot, Roadrunner Records was interested in signing Mushroomhead, but Mushroomhead passed on the deal. As of 2009, the drama has ended and both bands currently maintain a close friendship. Following the death of Slipknot member Paul Gray in 2010, Mushroomhead posted on their official Myspace page: \\"R.I.P. Paul Gray, This feud needs to end. Much Love and Respect to the guys in Slipknot\\". In 2012, Slipknot singer Corey Taylor has stated that he never had a problem with the band, he only had a problem with the behavior of their fans due to a situation Slipknot faced when they played in Mushroomhead's home town in Cleveland, OH and said there was never a real feud between bands but the feud was between Mushroomhead fans and Slipknot fans. He stated that doing a tour with Mushroomhead, Gwar, and Mudvayne ‚Äúwould be beautiful!‚Äù. The same year, Mushroomhead members joined Slipknot's Sid Wilson on stage in an impromptu performance during Wilson's DJ set. In 2014, singer Jeffrey \\"Nothing\\" Hatrix stated about the feud between the two bands: \\"Fans are very loyal to the bands they like. Members of both sides have said they are over it and that it was never really between the bands. Let‚Äôs all move on\\".Interview with Jeffrey Nothing, by Grande-Rock.com retrieved on August 31, 2014.

He is best known for his plays Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe (1967), GhƒÅshirƒÅm KotwƒÅl (1972), and SakhƒÅrƒÅm Binder (1972). Many of Tendulkar's plays derived inspiration from real-life incidents or social upheavals, which provides clear light on harsh realities. He has provided guidance to students studying \\"play writing\\" in US universities. Tendulkar had been a highly influential dramatist and theatre personality in MahƒÅrƒÅshtra for over five decades. Early life Vijay Dhondopant Tendulkar was born on 6 January 1928 in Girgaon, Mumbai, Maharashtra, where his father held a clerical job and ran a small publishing business. The literary environment at home prompted young Vijay to take up writing. He wrote his first story at age six. He grew up watching western plays and felt inspired to write plays himself. At age eleven, he wrote, directed, and acted in his first play.Vijay Tendulkar profile at indiaclub At age 14, he participated in the 1942 Indian freedom movement,The Frontline , Dec. 2005 leaving his studies. The latter alienated him from his family and friends. Writing then became his outlet, though most of his early writings were of a personal nature, and not intended for publication. During this period, he participated in the activities of Nabajiban Sanghatana, a splinter communist group. He said that he liked sense of sacrifice and discipline of the communists. Early career Tendulkar began his career writing for newspapers. He had already written a play, ƒÄmcyƒÅvar Ko·πá Pre·πÉ Kar·πáƒÅr (‡§Ü‡§Æ‡•ç‡§ö‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡§± ‡§ï‡•ã‡§£ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§£‡§æ‡§∞?; Who is going to love me?), and he wrote the play, G·πõhastha (The Householder), in his early 20s. The latter did not receive much recognition from the audience, and he vowed never to write again.The Hindu, 2 February 2003 Breaking the vow, in 1956 he wrote ≈örƒ´mant, which established him as a good writer. ≈örƒ´mant jolted the conservative audience of the times with its radical storyline, wherein an unmarried young woman decides to keep her unborn child while her rich father tries to \\"buy\\" her a husband in an attempt to save his social prestige. Tendulkar's early struggle for survival and living for some time in tenements (\\"cƒÅ·∏∑/chawls\\") in Mumbai provided him first-hand experience about the life of urban lower middle class. He thus brought new authenticity to their depiction in Marathi theatre.The Tribune, 3 October 2004 Tendulkar's writings rapidly changed the storyline of modern Marathi theatre in the 1950s and the 60s, with experimental presentations by theatre groups like Rangayan. Actors in these theatre groups like Shriram Lagoo, Mohan Agashe, and Sulabha Deshpande brought new authenticity and power to Tendulkar's stories while introducing new sensibilities in Marathi theatre.Shanta Gokhale, Theatre critic and writer Tendulkar wrote the play GidhƒÅ·∏çe (The Vultures) in 1961, but it was not produced until 1970. The play was set in a morally collapsed family structure and explored the theme of violence. In his following creations, Tendulkar explored violence in its various forms: domestic, sexual, communal, and political. Thus, GidhƒÅ·∏çe proved to be a turning point in Tendulkar's writings with regard to establishment of his own unique writing style.Violence 'Gidhade' and beyond Based on a 1956 short story, Die Panne (\\"Traps\\") by Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, Tendulkar wrote the play, ≈öƒÅntatƒÅ! Court CƒÅl≈´ ƒÄhe (\\"Silence! The Court Is in Session\\"). It was presented on the stage for the first time in 1967 and proved as one of his finest works. Satyadev Dubey presented it in movie form in 1971 with Tendulkar's collaboration as the screenplay writer. 1970s and 1980s In his 1972 play, SakhƒÅrƒÅm Binder (SakhƒÅrƒÅm, the Binder), Tendulkar dealt with the topic of domination of the male gender over the female. The main character, SakhƒÅrƒÅm, is a man devoid of ethics and morality, and professes not to believe in \\"outdated\\" social codes and conventional marriage. He accordingly uses the society for his own pleasure. He regularly gives \\"shelter\\" to abandoned wives and uses them for his sexual gratification while remaining oblivious to the emotional and moral implications of his exploits. He justifies all his acts through claims of modern, unconventional thinking, and comes up with hollow arguments meant in fact to enslave women. Paradoxically, some of the women which SakhƒÅrƒÅm had enslaved buy into his arguments and simultaneously badly want freedom from their enslavement.THEATER REVIEW, 'SAKHARAM BINDER', New York Times In 1972, Tendulkar wrote another, even much more acclaimed play, GhƒÅshirƒÅm KotwƒÅl (\\"Officer GhƒÅshirƒÅm\\"), which dealt with political violence. The play is a political satire created as a musical drama set in 18th century Pune. It combined traditional Marathi folk music and drama with contemporary theatre techniques, creating a new paradigm for Marathi theatre. The play demonstrates Tendulkar's deep study of group psychology,Lokvani, 07/30/2003 and it brought him a Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship (1974‚Äì75) for a project titled, \\"An Enquiry into the Pattern of Growing Violence in Society and Its Relevance to Contemporary Theatre\\". With over 6,000 performances thus far in its original and translated versions, GhƒÅshirƒÅm KotwƒÅl remains one of the longest-running plays in the history of Indian theatre. Tendulkar wrote screenplays for the movies NishƒÅnt (1974), ƒÄkrosh (The Cry) (1980), and Ardh Satya (The Half-Truth) (1984) which established him as an important \\"Chronicler of Violence\\" of the present.Ashis Nandy on Violence in Vijay Tendulkar's works He has written eleven movies in Hindi and eight movies in Marathi. The latter include SƒÅmanƒÅ (\\"Confrontation\\") (1975), SimhƒÅasan (\\"Throne\\") (1979), and Umbartha (\\"The Threshold\\") (1981). The last one is a groundbreaking feature film on women's activism in India. It was directed by Jabbar Patel and stars SmitƒÅ PƒÅtil and Girish KarnƒÅd. 1990s and beyond In 1991, Tendulkar wrote a metaphorical play, Safar,An Introduction to 'The Cyclist', 2001 and in 2001 he wrote the play, The Masseur. He next wrote two novels ‚Äî KƒÅdambari: Ek and KƒÅdambari: Don ‚Äî about sexual fantasies of an ageing man. In 2004, he wrote a single-act play, His Fifth Woman ‚Äî his first play in the English language ‚Äî as a sequel to his earlier exploration of the plight of women in SakhƒÅrƒÅm Binder. This play was first performed at the Vijay Tendulkar Festival in New York in October 2004.Indo-American Arts Council (IAAC), Vijay Tendulkar Festival, New York City, October 2004 In the 1990s, Tendulkar wrote an acclaimed TV series, SwayamSiddha, in which his daughter PriyƒÅ Tendulkar, noted Television actress of 'Rajani' fame,Priya Tendulkar performed in the lead role. His last screenplay was for Eashwar Mime Co. (2005), an adaptation of Dibyendu Palit's story, Mukhabhinoy, and directed by theatre director, Shyamanand Jalan and with Ashish Vidyarthi and Pawan Malhotra as leads. Family He was the brother of acclaimed cartoonist and humourist Mangesh Tendulkar. Death Vijay Tendulkar in late 2007 on a visit to Princeton, New Jersey, USA Tendulkar died in Pune on 19 May 2008, battling the effects of the rare autoimmune disease of myasthenia gravis. Tendulkar's son Raja and wife Nirmala had died in 2001; his daughter Priya Tendulkar died the next year (2002) of a heart attack following a long battle with breast cancer. Comment on Post-Godhra communal carnage Following the post-Godhra communal carnage in Gujarat2002 Gujarat violence in 2002, Tendulkar reacted by saying that \\"If I had a pistol, I would shoot [Gujarat Chief Minister] Narendra Modi\\". This reaction of Tendulkar had evoked mixed reactions, local Modi supporters burning his effigies while others lauding his remark. Later, when he was asked if it was not strange that he, who was known as a strong voice against death penalty, had a death wish for Modi, Tendulkar had said that \\"it was spontaneous anger, which I never see as a solution for anything. Anger doesn't solve problems.\\" Political views Society and politics are strongly highlighted in Tendulkar's plays. Tendulkar had Leftist views. In particular, he was against Hindu social groups, especially against Brahmins; most of his dramas show Brahmins in a bad light. Legacy In his writing career spanning more than five decades, Tendulkar has written 27 full-length plays and 25 one-act plays. Several of his plays have proven to be Marathi theatre classics.Profile at Oxford University Press His plays have been translated and performed in many Indian languages.The Indian Express, 20 October 1999 By providing insight into major social events and political upheavals during his adult life, Tendulkar became one of the strongest radical political voices in Maharashtra in recent times. While contemporary writers were cautiously exploring the limits of social realism, he jumped into the cauldron of political radicalism and courageously exposed political hegemony of the powerful and the hypocrisies in the Indian social mindset. His powerful expression of human angst has resulted in his simultaneously receiving wide public acclaim and high censure from the orthodox and the political bigwigs.Vijay Tendulkar speaks to NDTV Many of Tendulkar's plays derived inspiration from real-life incidents or social upheavals. Thus, the rise of Shiv Sena in Maharashtra in the 1970s was reflected in Tendulkar's GhƒÅshirƒÅm KotwƒÅl. The true story of a journalist who purchased of a woman from the rural sex industry to reveal police and political involvement in this trade, only to abandon the woman once he had no further need for her, is detailed in Tendulkar's KamalƒÅ.Kamala story 1981Kamala at salaamtheatre The play was later made into a film Kamla (film). The real-life story of an actress whose acting career got ruined after her same-sex affair became public knowledge inspired Tendulkar to write MitrƒÅchi Goshta.A study of the play and book, Mitrachi Goshta: A Friend's Story Tendulkar has translated nine novels, two biographies, and five plays by other authors into Marathi. Besides the foregoing, Tendulkar's oeuvre includes a biography; two novels; five anthologies of short stories; 16 plays for children, including BƒÅle MiltƒÅt (1960) and PƒÅtlƒÅchyƒÅ Poriche Lagin (1965); and five volumes of literary essays and social criticism, including Ratrani (1971), Kowali Unhe (1971), and Phuge SobƒÅnche (1974). All in all, Tendulkar's writings have contributed to a significant transformation of the modern literary landscape in Marathi and other Indian languages. In 2005, a documentary titled Tendulkar ƒÄni HimsƒÅ: KƒÅl ƒÄni ƒÄj (\\"Tendulkar and Violence: Then and Now\\") with English subtitlesThe Times of India, Jan 2007 (produced by California Arts Association - CalAA -California Arts Association (CalAA) directed by Atul Pethe) was released. In 2007, a short film about Tendulkar, Ankahin, (director Santosh Ayachit) was released.The Hindu, 20 January 2007 Awards Tendulkar won Maharashtra State government awards in 1969 and 1972; and MahƒÅrƒÅshtra Gaurav PuraskƒÅr in 1999. He was honoured with the Sangeet NƒÅtak Akademi Award in 1970, and again in 1998 with the Academy's highest award for \\"lifetime contribution\\", the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship (\\"Ratna Sadasya\\").Sangeet Natak Akademi Award In 1984, he received the Padma Bhushan award from the Government of India for his literary accomplishments. In 1977, Tendulkar won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay for his screenplay of ShyƒÅm Benegal's movie, Manthan (1976). He has written screenplays for many significant art movies, such as NishƒÅnt, ƒÄkrosh, and Ardh Satya.

Proponents argue that the availability of abortion resulted in fewer births of children at the highest risk of committing crime. The earliest research suggesting such an effect was a 1966 study in Sweden. In 2001, Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago and John Donohue of Yale University argued, citing their research and earlier studies, that children who are unwanted or whose parents cannot support them are likelier to become criminals. This idea was further popularized by its inclusion in the book Freakonomics, which Levitt co-wrote. Critics have argued that Donohue and Levitt's methodologies are flawed and that no statistically significant relationship between abortion and later crime rates can be proven. Criticisms include the assumption in the Donohue-Levitt study that abortion rates increased substantially since 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade eliminated many restrictions in the United States; critics use census data to show that the changes in the overall abortion rate could not account for the decrease in crime claimed by the study's methodology (legal abortions had been permitted under limited circumstances in many states prior). Other critics state that the correlations between births and crime found by Donohue‚ÄìLevitt do not adequately account for confounding factors such as reduced drug use, changes in demographics and population densities, or other contemporary cultural changes. 1972 Rockefeller Commission 12.16 The 1972 Rockefeller Commission on \\"Population and the American Future\\" cites a 1966 study which found that children born to women who had been denied an abortion \\"turned out to have been registered more often with psychiatric services, engaged in more antisocial and criminal behavior, and have been more dependent on public assistance.\\"Rockefeller Commission on Population and the American Future In particular, the study looked at the children of 188 women who were denied abortions from 1939 to 1941 at the hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. They compared these unwanted children to another group ‚Äì the next child born after each of the unwanted children at the hospital. The unwanted children were more likely to grow up in adverse conditions, such as having divorced parents or being raised in foster homes and were more likely to become delinquents and engaged in crime.Hans Forssman and Inga Thuwe, \\"One hundred and twenty children born after application for therapeutic abortion refused,\\" Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 1966, 71‚Äì78, doi:https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1966.tb01915.x 2001 Donohue and Levitt study Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago and John Donohue of Yale University revived discussion of this claim with their 2001 paper \\"The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime\\". Donohue and Levitt point to the fact that males aged 18 to 24 are most likely to commit crimes. Data indicates that crime in the United States started to decline in 1992. Donohue and Levitt suggest that the absence of unwanted children, following legalization in 1973, led to a reduction in crime 18 years later, starting in 1992 and dropping sharply in 1995. These would have been the peak crime-committing years of the unborn children. According to Donohue and Levitt, states that had abortion legalized earlier should have the earliest reductions in crime. Donohue and Levitt's study indicates that this indeed has happened: Alaska, California, Hawaii, New York, Oregon and Washington experienced steeper drops in crime, and had legalized abortion before Roe v. Wade. Further, states with a high abortion rate have experienced a greater reduction in crime, when corrected for factors like average income.Levitt, Steven D., Freakonomics, Chapter 4 (excerpt) , Where Did All the Criminals Go? Finally, studies in Canada and Australia claim to have established a correlation between legalized abortion and overall crime reduction. 2001 criticism by Lott and Whitley The study was criticized by various authors, including a 2001 article by John Lott and John Whitley where they argued that Donohue and Levitt assume that states which completely legalized abortion had higher abortion rates than states where abortion was only legal under certain conditions (many states allowed abortion only under certain conditions prior to Roe) and that CDC statistics do not substantiate this claim. In addition, if abortion rates cause crime rates to fall, crime rates should start to fall among the youngest people first and then gradually be seen lowering the crime rate for older and older people. In fact, they argue, the murder rates first start to fall among the oldest criminals and then the next oldest criminals and so on until it last falls among the youngest individuals. Lott and Whitley argue that if Donohue and Levitt are right that 80 percent of the drop in murder rates during the 1990s is due solely to the legalization of abortion, their results should be seen in some graphs without anything being controlled for, and that in fact the opposite is true. In addition, Lott and Whitley pointed out that using arrest rate data to proxy crime rates is flawed because arrest for murder can take place many months or even years after the crime occurred. Lott and Whitley claim that using the Supplemental Homicide Report, which links murder data for when the crime occurred with later arrest rate data, reverses Donohue and Levitt's regression results.John R. Lott Jr. and John E. Whitley, \\"Abortion and Crime: Unwanted Children and Out-of-Wedlock Births\\", (2001) SSRN Yale Law & Economics Research Paper No. 254 working paper and Economic Inquiry, Vol. 45, No. 2, pp. 304-324, April 2007 published article. In 2004, Ted Joyce published a study concluding that the negative association between legalized abortion and crime rates reported in Donohue and Levitt's study was actually due to unmeasured period effects from, among other factors, changes in crack cocaine use. In 2009, Joyce reported similar, negative results after analyzing age-specific homicide and murder arrest rates in relation to the legalization of abortion across U.S. states and cohorts. In 2005 Levitt posted a rebuttal to these criticisms on the Freakanomics weblog, in which he re-ran his numbers to address the shortcomings and variables missing from the original study. The new results are nearly identical to those of the original study. Levitt posits that any reasonable use of the data available reinforces the results of the original 2001 paper.Levitt, Steven D., \\"Abortion and crime: who should you believe?\\" Freakanomics Weblog, 2005 2005 criticism by Foote and Goetz Later in 2005, Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz claimed that a computer error in Levitt and Donahue's statistical analysis led to an artificially inflated relationship between legalized abortion and crime reduction. Once other crime-associated factors were properly controlled for, they claimed that the effect of abortion on arrests was reduced by about half. Foote and Goetz also criticize Levitt and Donahue's use of arrest totals rather than arrests per capita, which takes population size into account. Using Census Bureau population estimates, Foote and Goetz repeated the analysis using arrest rates in place of simple arrest totals, and found that the effect of abortion disappeared entirely.Oops-onomics, The Economist, Dec 1st 2005 Donohue and Levitt subsequently published a response to the Foote and Goetz paper.Donohue and Levitt, \\"Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz (2005)\\", 2006 The response acknowledged the mistake, but showed that with different methodology, the effect of legalized abortion on crime rates still existed. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and showed that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion. 2007 Reyes leaded gasoline theory A 2007 studyReyes, Jessica, \\"The Impact of Childhood Lead Exposure on Crime\\", The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy, Volume 7, Issue 1 2007 Article 51 by Jessica Reyes at Amherst College stated: \\"This implies that, between 1992 and 2002, the phase-out of lead from gasoline was responsible for approximately a 56% decline in violent crime. Sensitivity testing confirms the strength of these results. Results for murder are not robust if New York and the District of Columbia are included, but suggest a substantial elasticity as well. No significant effects are found for property crime. The effect of legalized abortion reported by Donohue and Levitt (2001) is largely unaffected, so that abortion accounts for a 29% decline in violent crime (elasticity 0.23), and similar declines in murder and property crime. Overall, the phase-out of lead and the legalization of abortion appear to have been responsible for significant reductions in violent crime rates.\\" 2009 review by Shah and Ahman A 2009 review by authors from the World Health Organization concludes that laws against abortion do not reduce the incidence of abortion.Shah and Ahman, \\"Unsafe Abortion:Global and Regional Incidence, Trends, Consequences, and Challenges\\", Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada, December 2009, pp. 1149-58. If this conclusion is correct, it challenges the Donohue‚ÄìLevitt hypothesis because it suggests that potentially delinquent offspring would still be aborted regardless of legal prohibitions. 2014 study by Francois validates original hypothesis In 2014 a study by Abel Francois was published in the International Review of Law and Economics which provides evidence on the subject through a panel data analysis of 16 countries in western Europe for 1990-2007. It finds that abortion caused a significant decrease in crime rates. 2019 Updated paper by Donohue and Levitt An updated paper was published in 2019 to review the predictions of the original 2001 paper: NBER Working Paper No. 25863 Overall the authors concluded that the predictions did hold up with strong effects. \\"We estimate that crime fell roughly 20% between 1997 and 2014 due to legalized abortion. The cumulative impact of legalized abortion on crime is roughly 45%, accounting for a very substantial portion of the roughly 50-55% overall decline from the peak of crime in the early 1990s.\\" Levitt discusses this paper and the background and history of the original paper (including its criticisms) in an episode of the Freakonomics podcast.

It is the hydrogen sulfate (HSO4‚àí) salt of the protonated derivative of N-methylaminophenol. This colourless salt is a popular photographic developer used in black & white photography.Gerd L√∂bbert \\"Photography\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. Synthesis Several methods exist for the preparation of N-methylaminophenol. It arises by decarboxylation of N-4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Glycin). It can be obtained by reaction of hydroquinone with methylamine. Application Metol is an excellent developing agent for most continuous tone developer applications, and it has been widely used in published developer formulas as well as commercial products. However, it is difficult to produce highly concentrated developer solutions using Metol, and therefore most Metol developers are supplied in dry chemical mix. A developer containing both Metol and hydroquinone is called an MQ developer. This combination of agents provides greater developer activity since the rate of development by both agents together is greater than the sum of rates of development by each agent used alone (superadditivity). This combination is very versatile; by varying the quantities of Metol, hydroquinone, and restrainer, and adjusting the pH, the entire range of continuous tone developers can be made. Therefore, this form of Metol replaced most other developing agents except for hydroquinone, Phenidone (which is more recent than Metol), and derivatives of Phenidone. Notable formulas include Eastman Kodak D-76 film developer, D-72 print developer, and D-96 motion picture negative developer. History Alfred Bogisch, working for a chemical company owned by Julius Hauff, discovered in 1891 that methylated p-aminophenol has more vigorous developing action than p-aminophenol. Hauff introduced this compound as a developing agent. The exact composition of Bogisch and Hauff's early Metol is unknown, but it was most likely methylated at the ortho position of the benzene ring (p-amino-o-methylphenol), rather than at the amino group. Some time later, Metol came to mean the N-methylated variety, and the o-methylated variety fell out of use. Aktien-Gesellschaft f√ºr Anilinfabrikation (AGFA) sold this compound under the trade name Metol, which became by far the most common name, followed by Eastman Kodak's trade name Elon. Because it has been in use for this purpose for over 100 years, and often by amateur photographers, there is a substantial body of evidence regarding the health problems that contact with Metol can cause. These are principally local dermatitis of the hands and forearms. There is also some evidence of sensitization dermatitis, in which repeated exposure triggers a chronic condition that is resistant to medication. The use of Metol in highly caustic solutions and the presence of other materials in darkrooms that have been implicated in dermatitis--such as hexavalent chromium salts--may exacerbate some health impacts.

For people who are illiterate, or members of pre- literate societies, CBS presents the Bible as oral literature in a narrative format in an attempt to make it easier to understand and remember. The stories are presented in what is regarded as Biblical chronological order in an attempt to allow the listener to connect the stories together to form one frame of reference regarding the Bible rather than just a series of unrelated stories. CBS has its roots in Chronological Bible Teaching (CBT), which involves telling Biblical stories intermixed with teaching about the themes, significance, and message of the story. This form was popularized by Trevor McIlwain and used extensively by New Tribes Mission since the 1970s. McIlwain's influence on John R. Cross led him to write \\"The Stranger on the Road to Emmaus\\", which presented the Bible in a chronological format. CBT proponentes argue that the Bible and biblical theology is best understood when one studies the content beginning in Genesis, studying stories, events, and themes in the order and context in which they took place. CBT is closely related to Biblical Theology, and is often encouraged as an alternative, or complement to Systematic Theology. CBS is unlike CBT in that it explicitly avoids mixing the stories with teaching. Instead CBS seeks to present Biblical stories as directly as from scripture as possible with minimal explanation. Theological truths are better understood in oral cultures within the concrete example of a story rather than abstract principles present in literate teaching styles. CBS attempts to present a comprehensive overview of the Bible that provides the necessary background pre-literate people with no previous exposure to the Christianity need to understand Jesus Christ and the gospel. CBS is often used for evangelization, discipleship, and church planting as a way to establish an organized church within illiterate cultures, generally with the long-term goal of promoting literacy and translating The Bible into a language the group can be taught to read.

Parking is available for walking along the old railway path (see Cromford and High Peak Railway) and up to the top of the crag, and there is a picnic area. The area has been a well-known rock climbing venue since the 1890s. Many hard lines were put up by some of the best climbers of the 1980s and 1990s. The two best-known climbs are featured in the documentary Hard Grit. These are Gaia (climbing grade E8 6b), up the groove in the massive nose that one sees first on the walk to the top, and Meshuga (grade E9 6c), on the main overhanging Promontory. The first ascent of the former was made in 1986 by British climber Johnny Dawes. The Black Rocks also has easier climbing, but this is not for the faint of heart; larger crags offer a far better selection of similar climbs. There are also short but well-worn 'boulder problems' such as the 'Railway Slab'.

Background  Coat of Arms of Maury Maverick Maverick was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Albert and Jane Lewis (Maury) Maverick. His grandparents were Samuel Maverick, one of the signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence and the source of the word maverick, and Mary Ann Adams Maverick. He studied at Texas Military Institute, the Virginia Military Institute, and the University of Texas. Career Early years Maverick was admitted to the bar in 1916 and practiced law in San Antonio. He was a first lieutenant in the infantry in World War I and earned the Silver Star and the Purple Heart. In the 1920s, he was involved in the lumber and mortgage businesses. Government service From 1929 to 1931, he was the elected tax collector for Bexar County. He was elected to the Seventy-fourth Congress in 1934, with support from the Hispanic population of his district, and re- elected to the Seventy-fifth. During his 1934 campaign, Maverick enlisted Lyndon Johnson, a then little-known congressional secretary, to work for him during the Democratic primary.Caro, Robert A. The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to Power. Vintage Books, 1981. p. 276 In the House, he was an ardent champion of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. He angered the conservative Democrats running the party back in Texas, including John Nance Garner. He was defeated in the primary for a third term in 1938. He returned to Texas where he was elected Mayor of San Antonio, again with support from minority voters, serving from 1939 to 1941, when he was labeled a Communist and defeated. During World War II, he worked for the Office of Price Administration and the Office of Personnel Management, and served on the War Production Board and the Smaller War Plants Corporation. Later years After the war, he practiced law in San Antonio. Personal and death Maverick was a cousin of congressmen Abram Poindexter Maury and John W. Fishburne of Virginia and nephew of congressman James Luther Slayden of Texas, who married Ellen (Maury) at a Maury home called Piedmont in Charlottesville, Virginia, now part of the University of Virginia. They are related to Matthew Fontaine Maury, Dabney Herndon Maury, and the early and prominent Fontaine, Dabney, Brooke, Minor, Mercer, Herndon, Slaughter, and Slayden families of Virginia, Tennessee, and Texas. He married Terrell Louise Dobbs and had a daughter and a son, San Antonio newspaper editorialist Maury Maverick, Jr. (who died in 2003 at the age of 82). Maverick died on June 7, 1954.

In composition it is closely related to dolomite, but differs from this in having magnesium replaced by varying amounts of iron(II) and manganese. It forms a series with dolomite and kutnohorite. The crystallographic and physical characters resemble those of dolomite and siderite. The angle between the perfect rhombohedral cleavages is 73¬∞ 48', the hardness is 3.5 to 4, and the specific gravity is 2.9 to 3.1. The color is white, grey or reddish to yellowish brown. Ankerite occurs with siderite in metamorphosed ironstones and sedimentary banded iron formations. It also occurs in carbonatites. In sediments it occurs as authigenic, diagenetic minerals and as a product of hydrothermal deposition. It is one of the minerals of the dolomite-siderite series, to which the terms brown-spar, pearl-spar and bitter-spar have been historically loosely applied. It was first recognized as a distinct species by W. von Haidinger in 1825, and named for Matthias Joseph Anker (1771‚Äì1843) of Styria, an Austrian mineralogist. It has been found in Western Tasmania, in mines in Dundas, Tasmania.

Since the end of World War II, U.S. and Allied military aircraft have used AM radios in the NATO harmonised 225-400 MHz UHF band (part of NATO B band) for short range air-to- air and ground-to-air communications. During development and the procurement of UHF radios, military planners did not require features to secure communications for aircraft and helicopters from jamming until the post- Vietnam War era. Progress in electronics in the 1970s reached a point where anyone with an inexpensive radio frequency scanner or receiver set could intercept military communications. Once the target frequencies were identified, radio frequency jamming could easily be employed to degrade or completely disable communications. The HAVE QUICK program was a response to this problem. Engineers recognized that newer aircraft radios already included all-channel frequency synthesizers along with keyboards and displays for data entry. The only other system requirements to achieve the desired anti-jam functionality were an accurate clock (for timed synchronization) and a microprocessor to add frequency hopping to existing radios. Aircraft and ground radios that employ HAVE QUICK must be initialized with accurate Time Of Day (TOD) (usually from a GPS receiver), a Word Of the Day (WOD), and a NET number (providing mode selection and multiple networks to use the same word of the day). A word of the day is a transmission security variable that consists of six segments of six digits each. The word of the day is loaded into the radio or its control unit to key the HAVE QUICK system to the proper hopping pattern, rate, and dwell time.Navy Training System Plan for the AN/ARC-182(V) Radio Set, N88-NTSP-A-50-8115D/A, March 2000, Section G.1.a.(3) The word of the day, time of day and net number are input to a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator that controls the frequency changes. HAVE QUICK is not an encryption system, though many HAVE QUICK radios can be used with encryption, e.g. the KY-58 VINSON system. HAVE QUICK is not compatible with SINCGARS, the VHF - FM radios used by ground forces, which operate in a different radio band and use a different frequency hopping method; however some newer radios support both.  Particularities  *A national Air Force operates generally in a closed common user group. However, deviation to this regulation existed on German territory until 1990. E.g. the HQ-user of the German Air Force in the North of Germany, operational subordinated to 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force used HQ net-group 1, whereas the southern units, subordinated to 4th Allied Tactical Air Force, used HQ net-group 2. *The co-ordination of HQ radio frequency channels in the NATO-harmonised UHF-band, the design of the so- called HQ hop-sets, is provided in NATO-Europe in responsibility of the NATO Allied Radio Frequency Agency (ARFA) in Brussels. *For training and exercises, HQ operates in peacetime mode with limited frequency access. Four net-numbers may be used overlapping in net-group 1 and 2. However, in tactical operation mode this limitation might be lifted. *Some HQ-features are compatible to encryption hardware, e.g. to the KY-58 VINSON-family.  Utilisation in the US and NATO  HAVE QUICK was well adopted, and as of 2007 is used on nearly all U.S. military and NATO aircraft. Improvements include HAVE QUICK II Phase 2, and a \\"Second generation Anti-Jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO\\" called SATURN. The latter features more complex frequency hopping.

The syndrome is named after the long-haired girl Rapunzel in the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Trichophagia is sometimes associated with the hair-pulling disorder trichotillomania. This syndrome is a rare and unusual form of trichobezoar. Signs and symptoms The use of the Rapunzel syndrome first appeared in the literature in 1968. Characteristics of the syndrome include: * The body of a trichobezoar (hairball) located in the stomach, and its tail (hence the reference to Rapunzel in the syndrome's name) in the small bowel and/or in the right colon * Small or large bowel obstruction * Occurring in psychiatric patients * Trichotillomania Cause Rapunzel Syndrome is caused by the ingestion of hair. Diagnosis  Trichobezoar can be preoperatively diagnosed. However, the diagnosis of the Rapunzel syndrome has to consider several aspects such as the patient's history with disorders like Trichophagia and Trichotillomania. The diagnosis of the syndrome is also done by endoscopy. A CT scan is recommended to determine the size and the extension of the trichobezoar.  Treatment  Because the human gastrointestinal tract is unable to digest human hair, the trichobezoar may have to be treated surgically. Patients usually also require psychiatric evaluation and treatment due to the association with impulse control disorders, especially trichotillomania.

Independence Although it is an independent agency, established under Victoria's Electoral Act 2002, the VEC falls under the umbrella of the Department of Premier and Cabinet. The VEC head office is located on level 11, 530 Collins Street, Melbourne, although during the state election there may be as many as 88 offices established throughout Victoria. The VEC is subject to oversight by the Victorian Parliament's Electoral Matters CommitteeVictorian State Parliament Electoral Matters Committee which regularly holds inquiries into the conduct of public elections and associated matters in Victoria. The Committee was established under the Parliamentary Committees Act 2003Section 9A, Parliamentary Committees Act 2003 and has members from both the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. In the 57th Parliament of Victoria, elected on 27 November 2010, its members were appointed in the sitting week commencing Tuesday 8 February 2011. In the 59th Parliament, elected on 24 November 2018, members are yet to be appointed. Functions State elections The primary function of the VEC is to conduct Victorian state elections, the last of which was the 2018 state election, which was held on Saturday, 24 November 2018. Prior to 2006, Victorian parliamentary elections could be held any time at the discretion of the government in the last year of their four-year term of office. This has meant that, in practice, the average period between elections had been somewhat less than the maximum four years. From 2006 the Victorian Parliament has fixed terms with the election being held every fourth year on the last Saturday in November. The next Victorian state election is scheduled to be held on Saturday, 26 November 2022. Municipal elections Municipal, or local government, elections are also conducted by the VEC in Victoria. Previously there was a system of competitive tendering between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the VEC, but the AEC withdrew. The VEC still submits tenders to each council to run the municipal elections. Municipal elections take place in October every four years. The most recent municipal elections took place in October 2016 and the next elections will be in October 2020.https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Voting/LocalCouncilElections.html Non- government elections Private organisations may hire the VEC to conduct elections for them. These may include board elections. Liquor licensing polls In some municipalities (e.g. City of Whitehorse, City of Boroondara) there are areas which require approval of residents for a liquor licence to be granted. In such circumstances the VEC conducts these polls. Electoral enrolment The VEC‚Äôs Electoral Enrolment Branch maintains the State electoral roll. Unlike all other states (with the exception of Western Australia), the VEC maintains its own roll rather than depending on the Commonwealth roll which is maintained by the AEC. The VEC still receives updates from the AEC to ensure that the Commonwealth and Victorian rolls mirror each other. The VEC conducts several promotional programs to ensure that electors update their information when their enrolment details change. Boundary redistributions The VEC assists the Electoral Boundaries Commission in redistributing state electoral boundaries from time to time. It also performs similar tasks in relation to local government.

Built as a response to the Italian , the Richelieus were based on their immediate predecessors of the with the same unconventional arrangement that grouped their main battery forward in two quadruple gun turrets. They were scaled up to accommodate a much more powerful main battery of eight guns (compared to the guns of the Dunkerques), with increased armor to protect them from guns of the same caliber. Jean Bart was laid down in 1936 and was launched in 1940, following the outbreak of World War II in Europe. The ship was not complete by the time Germany won the Battle of France, and Jean Bart was rushed to Casablanca to escape advancing German troops. She had only one of her main turrets installed, along with a handful of anti-aircraft guns. While in Casablanca, the French attempted to prepare the ship for action as much as was possible in light of limited infrastructure and the necessary parts to complete the vessel. Her anti-aircraft armament was slowly strengthened as guns became available and a search radar was fitted in 1942. In November, American and British forces invaded French North Africa in Operation Torch; Jean Bart initially helped to resist the attack, engaging in a gunnery duel with the battleship before being badly damaged by American dive bombers. Following the defection of French forces in the region to the Allied side, the French attempted to have the ship completed in the United States, but the requests came to nothing as the US Navy had no interest in the project. Jean Bart was accordingly repaired as much as possible in Casablanca, thereafter spending the rest of the war as a training ship there. In 1945, discussions as to the fate of the ship considered converting her into an aircraft carrier, finishing her as a battleship, or discarding her altogether. The decision was ultimately made to finish her as a battleship, a process that took several years. Most work on the ship was completed by 1955, when she formally entered active service, and she conducted two overseas cruises to visit Denmark and the United States shortly thereafter. She took part in the French intervention in the Suez Crisis in November 1956, including a brief four-shot bombardment of Port Said. Reduced to reserve in August 1957, she was used as a barracks ship until 1961. She remained, unused, in the French Navy's inventory until 1970 when she was struck from the naval register and sold for scrap.  Design Recognition drawing of Jean Barts sister in her designed configuration When in 1934 Italy announced that it would begin building two s armed with guns, the French Navy immediately began preparations to counter them. The small s that had been ordered provided the template for the next French battleship design, but it needed to be scaled up to match the new Italian vessels, both in terms of offensive and defensive characteristics. The design staff considered 380 and guns, but the latter could not be incorporated in a design that remained within the limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty and was quickly discarded. The Dunkerques carried their armament in two quadruple gun turrets arrayed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure, and the designers experimented with other arrangements, including combinations of triple and twin turrets, but the need to minimize the length of the armor belt (and thus its weight) necessitated a repetition of the Dunkerque layout. Jean Bart displaced standard and fully loaded, with an overall length of , a beam of and a maximum draft of . She was powered by four Parsons geared steam turbines and six oil-fired Sural water-tube boilers, which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of . At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for . Her crew numbered 1,569 officers and men. The ship carried four Loire 130 seaplanes on the fantail, and the aircraft facilities consisted of a steam catapult and a crane to handle the floatplanes. She was armed with eight 380 mm/45 Mod√®le (Mle) 1935 guns arranged in two quadruple gun turrets, both of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of nine /55 Mle 1930 guns mounted in three triple turrets, arranged on the rear superstructure. Heavy anti-aircraft (AA) defense consisted of twelve /45 Mle 1930 anti-aircraft guns in twin turrets. Close range anti- aircraft defense was provided by a battery of eight guns in twin mounts and twenty machine guns in four quadruple and two twin mounts. The ship's belt armor was thick amidships, and the main battery turrets were protected by of armor plate on the faces. The main armored deck was thick, and the conning tower had thick sides.  Service history   Construction and escape to Casablanca  The French Navy awarded the contract for Jean Bart on 27 May 1936 to the Chantiers de Penho√´t shipyard in Saint-Nazaire. The keel for Jean Bart was laid down on 12 December, less than three weeks before the Washington Treaty expired. The construction of Jean Bart and her sister ship placed France in violation of the terms of the treaty, which had limited the country to build of battleships during the ten-year building moratorium. The two Richelieus and the two Dunkerque-class battleships totaled of battleship tonnage. France used the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which Britain had unilaterally signed with Nazi Germany (and in the process effectively nullified the naval disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles) in June 1935 to dismiss British objections to the new ships. Serious work on the ship was nevertheless delayed owing to the shortage of dockyard workers and the need to complete the hull of the Dunkerque-class battleship so she could be launched later that month. The dry dock used to build the ship was the newly completed Caquot dock, named for its designer, Albert Caquot, though it was commonly referred to as the \\"Jean Bart dock\\". Work on the ship initially proceeded slowly, though the increase in tensions with Germany in early 1939 leading to the German invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II led to greater emphasis being placed on completing the ship. She was launched on 6 March 1940, but following the initial German successes in the Battle of France in May, the builders realized that the normal process of fitting-out would have to be abandoned in favor of preparing the vessel to be moved from the port. Work on the ship's propulsion system was greatly accelerated: some 3,500 workers were assigned to the project, and in the span of a month, three of her boilers, two sets of turbines, two turbo generators, and two pumps had been installed, along with critical internal communications systems. The outer shaft screws were installed on 6 and 7 June, and her three aft boilers had fires lit for the first time from 12 to 14 June. Her rudder and anchor chains were installed, and her double bottom was sealed. At this time, the ship's armament was mostly incomplete; the forward main battery turret had its guns and armor plate installed, but it lacked necessary shell handling equipment and fire control systems. The superfiring turret was without its guns or armor and none of the secondary turrets had been installed. During the rush to prepare the ship to depart, a pair of twin-mount Mle 1930 anti-aircraft guns, taken from the net layer , was installed on 18 June in place of the 100 mm guns, construction of which had been delayed, but they had no ammunition or directors at the time. Three of the 37 mm guns and six of the 13.2 mm mounts were installed, and these were the only usable weapons aboard the ship at the time of her departure, albeit only under local control as their director systems were also still incomplete. While work was still being completed, the ship's commander, Capitaine de vaisseau (CV‚ÄîShip-of-the-line captain) Pierre- Jean Ronarc'h received orders on 11 June to depart for Casablanca in French Morocco as soon as was practical. He estimated that 19 June would be the best opportunity based on the tides, and early that morning Jean Bart was towed out of the fitting-out dock by three tugboats at 03:30 and into a channel that had been quickly but not sufficiently dredged to allow her escape. The ship accidentally grounded in the darkness, bending one of her screw blades, but the tugs pulled her free and at 04:45, the crew got Jean Barts engines started. Shortly thereafter, three German Heinkel 111 bombers arrived at a height of to attack the ship. One of the aircraft scored a hit with a bomb that struck between the main battery turrets but did insignificant damage. Jean Bart increased speed to and at 06:30, rendezvoused with the destroyers and , which were to escort her to Casablanca. The British destroyer and two tugs met the ship at sea, offering to tow Jean Bart to Britain, but Ronarc'h declined the offer. Jean Bart took on fuel oil at sea from a pair of tankers and at 18:00, she left the area with the two destroyers. While cruising off Lorient the next day, the destroyer relieved Le Hardi and the three ships continued on at a speed of . They arrived in Casablanca at 17:00 on 22 June. At Casablanca Jean Bart incomplete in Casablanca harbor, taken from an airplane of After arriving in Casablanca, Jean Bart had most of her anti- aircraft guns removed to strengthen the defenses of the port: the 90 mm and 37 mm guns were moved to the jetties protecting the harbor and two of the six 13.2 mm guns were put on trucks. Following their defeat in the Battle of France, the French signed the Armistice of 22 June 1940, ending their participation in the conflict. During the peace negotiations, the French proposed neutralizing Jean Bart and several other ships in Oran, French Algeria, but they ultimately agreed to take Jean Bart and Richelieu to Toulon to be demobilized. The Germans later decided against permitting the move, as they feared the British would try to seize the ship during the passage through the Strait of Gibraltar; the British, meanwhile, were under the mistaken impression that the Germans sought to seize the French fleet for their own use. This led to Operation Catapult, a series of attacks on French warships to neutralize vessels that would not defect to the Free French. The attacks prompted Ronarc'h to take precautions to protect his ship. He ordered the open barbettes for the secondary turrets and the incomplete superfiring turret covered with concrete, and much of the hull was sealed. He moved the ship to shallow water on 11 August. Eleven days later, CV √âmile Barthes replaced Ronarc'h. In September work to ready the ship for combat as much as could be done with the limited material in Casablanca began. On 7 September, the ship received sixteen 13.2 mm guns and seventeen machine guns, though only one of the latter was actually installed as the light machine guns were of limited use. In 1941, an improvised director was fabricated using a torpedo tube platform removed from the old destroyer as a base for a rangefinder. For navigational purposes, a rangefinder was installed on the conning tower and two more were added to the bridge wings in October. The ship's anti-aircraft battery was strengthened in April 1942 with the addition of four 37 mm guns in single mounts and a pair of new twin 90 mm guns. By May, the forward main battery turret had been rendered fully operational and on 19 May, Jean Bart conducted test firing. The makeshift director did not work particularly well, so a triangulation system using observers aboard the ship and in two points at Dar Bouazza and Sidi Abderrahman to direct the ship's guns was improvised. Four 37 mm guns in twin mounts were installed in June, along with another pair of 90 mm twin mounts, but three of the four 37 mm single guns were removed. A DEM radar was installed and tests over the following months demonstrated that the set was able to detect aircraft at ranges as far as , but owing to the cluttered harbor facilities around the ship, its abilities to detect surface ships could not be examined. The radar was pronounced ready for service on 6 October. In early November, the ship received a fifth 90 mm twin mount, with a sixth planned; at that time, the anti-aircraft battery consisted of five 90 mm twin mounts, five 37 mm guns (two in twins and one in a single mount), eighteen 13.2 mm guns (two twin and fourteen individual mounts) and one 8 mm machine gun. Operation Torch Jean Bart attacked by planes of USS Ranger American and British forces embarked on Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, on 8 November. An American covering force that included the battleship (armed with nine guns), the aircraft carriers and , and three heavy cruisers led the invasion fleet that landed near Casablanca; the Americans hoped the French defenders would quickly surrender and defect to the Free French. A French reconnaissance aircraft detected the fleet at 07:00 that morning, and to oppose the landing, the French had one light cruiser, nine destroyers, and several submarines, in addition to the coastal battery at El Hank and Jean Bart, which would be employed as a floating battery. Before the French vessels could mount a significant challenge to the invasion, Massachusetts and two of the cruisers began bombarding the port while a group of SBD Dauntless dive bombers armed with bombs from Ranger struck the ships in the harbor. Jean Bart received a pair of bomb hits at 07:18; the first damaged the port catapult, started a fire, and caused the manual steering compartment to flood. The second struck the quay and exploded, the blast causing significant deformation to the hull plating on the starboard side. In return, Jean Bart fired four two-gun salvos between 07:08 and 07:19, but when the French cruiser and destroyers attempted to sortie, they laid a smoke screen that drifted and blocked observation of the American cruisers. Massachusetts then engaged Jean Bart and at 07:25, scored a hit that penetrated both of the French ship's armor decks and exploded in the empty magazines for the missing 152 mm guns. Another salvo landed close to Jean Barts bow at 07:35 and deformed the hull plating. Another shell struck the quay a minute later, hurling fragments of concrete that injured anti-aircraft gunners and caused additional flooding. At 07:37, another 406 mm shell hit the ship, passing through the funnel and striking the edge of the armor deck. Another shell struck the edge of the quay, punched the outer plating, and was deflected down by the armor belt. It then passed through the bottom of the hull, burying itself in the sea floor, where it failed to explode. At 08:06, another salvo struck the ship with a pair of shells. The first struck the operational main battery turret, pushing the front glacis down and jamming the turret, and the second hit the superfiring barbette. This shell broke up on impact, but fragments nevertheless damaged the armor deck. One more shell from Massachusetts struck the ship at 08:10 on the quarterdeck, where it penetrated the sloped armor deck and exploded in the ballast compartment, causing additional flooding in the steering compartment. Damage to Jean Barts stern from the second bomb hit, photographed in Casablanca on November 16, 1942 Despite the numerous shell and bomb hits, Jean Bart had not been seriously damaged, though this was unknown to the Americans. Workers quickly cut away the deformed steel that jammed the main battery turret and it was back in operation at 17:24. Only one of the 406 mm shells could have threatened the ship's survival, as an explosion in the 152 mm magazine could have destroyed the vessel had it been full of propellant charges. The next day, the ship's 90 mm guns were used to fire on advancing ground troops, and on 10 November, Jean Barts forward turret engaged the heavy cruiser between 11:41 and 11:51, nearly hitting with her second salvo. Three of her nine two-gun salvos straddled Augusta, forcing the cruiser to withdraw at high speed and prompting Ranger to launch a second air strike on the ship. Nine Dauntlesses, this time armed with bombs, and eight F4F Wildcat fighters attacked the ship at 15:00. The fighters strafed Jean Barts anti-aircraft batteries to suppress them for the Dauntless attacks. Two of the bombers scored hits; the first caused extensive damage to the forecastle and the second destroyed a substantial part of the hull toward the stern. Both bombs caused serious fires that were suppressed by 20:00. Extensive flooding led the ship to settle by the stern and submerged the turbo generator room, while shock from the bomb explosions disabled the main diesel generators, leaving the backup diesels as the only source of electrical power. In the course of the engagements with American forces, 22 men had been killed and the same number had been wounded. She had fired just 25 shells from her main battery, but despite the significant damage from the bomb hits on 10 November, her turret remained operational, as were the 90 mm guns, though both batteries were without power. With the Free French French forces in North Africa signed an armistice on 11 November, prompting the Germans to invade the rest of Vichy France, which in turn led Fran√ßois Darlan, the former Chief of Staff of the French Navy, to defect to the Allies with the rest of the fleet. Repair work to make the ship seaworthy had already begun on 11 November, and by 15 February 1943, the outboard turbines were in service and manual steering controls had been repaired. Admiral Raymond Fenard, the head of the French naval mission to the US, requested that the US Navy take the ship to the United States to be repaired and completed, as they had begun to do with Richelieu. Fenard issued a report to the US Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Frederick J. Horne, on 15 April detailing the status of Jean Bart, but Horne replied on 1 May that the ship could not be completed to her original specifications. Five days later, the US Navy agreed that the ship would be taken to the United States in September, which necessitated repairs to the steering motors. Jean Bart under repair in Casablanca, January 1943 The Free French Service Central des Constructions et Armes Navales (Central Naval Technical Department) created two proposals to complete the ship with as few alterations from her current state as possible; both involved replacing the 380 mm guns with guns from the old battleship , since Jean Barts guns were needed to replace the damaged guns aboard Richelieu. The first variant called for the quarterdeck to be modified to carry two large catapults capable of launching American TBF Avenger or British Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers and F6F Hellcat or Supermarine Seafire fighters. The total complement was to be six aircraft. In place of the superfiring main turret, three secondary turrets, and the 90 mm mounts, she would receive thirty /38 caliber dual- purpose guns in fifteen twin turrets. These would be supplemented by sixty- four Bofors guns in quadruple mounts and fifty Oerlikon cannon in single mounts. New fire control equipment was to be installed, including US-built directors and a Mk 4 fire control radar. The second proposal was less ambitious; the aircraft facilities were abandoned in favor of seventeen twin 5 in turrets, while the 40 mm battery would be increased to twenty quadruple mounts. Horne rejected both proposals on 18 August and Fenard responded with a proposal to complete the ship as an aircraft carrier, which Horne also refused. On 8 December, Fenard appealed directly to Horne's superior, Admiral Ernest King, the Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations, but King informed Fenard in March 1944 that the US Navy had no interest in diverting critical wartime resources to complete the ship. By that time in the war, the US Navy had more than enough battleships and aircraft carriers to fulfill its operational needs and moreover, American shipyards could not easily reproduce the parts necessary to complete the ship according to any of the proposals; the US had only agreed to repair and modernize Richelieu, which had been in a more complete state than Jean Bart, after significant pressure from Britain. Jean Bart instead remained in Casablanca, where Free French authorities had already set about readying the ship for sea. Options to complete the ship without US assistance were limited; the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon in November 1942 wrecked much of the shipyard facilities, and Brest would not be liberated until September 1944. The French inquired about the possibility of taking the ship to Gibraltar, but the shipyard there was overwhelmed with more critical projects. Nevertheless, the shipyard workers in Casablanca had readied the ship for sea trials by September 1943. During these operations, she was accompanied by the destroyers and and three US destroyers. Though her hull was still badly deformed from the damage incurred during Operation Torch and had not been cleaned of biofouling, she reached a speed of . For the remainder of the war, the vessel was used as a training ship. Completion With the end of the war in sight by early 1945, the French naval command began to make plans for the postwar fleet. On 22 February, they decided that Jean Bart would be completed, but there was no consensus as to how the ship was to be finished. One faction, including Fenard as well as Admirals Pierre Barjot and Louis Kahn (the latter being the Chief of Naval Construction), advocated converting the ship into an aircraft carrier, while others argued that the ship should be completed as a battleship. A third group suggested scrapping the ship and focusing on other projects. In July, Kahn prepared a proposal that would have produced a carrier with a capacity of forty aircraft (and fourteen spares), armed with a battery of sixteen anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts, and protected with an armored flight deck that was 90 mm thick. Displacement was fixed at . The project would have cost 5 billion francs and taken five years to complete, which caused considerable opposition in the naval command, including Fenard. They objected to the cost and delays, along with the fact that the number of aircraft was half that of contemporary American and British carriers. With the fate of the ship still in question, she left Casablanca on 25 August, bound for Cherbourg, which she reached four days later. At a meeting on 21 September, the naval command ruled out discarding the vessel. Given the objections to the aircraft carrier conversion, the construction department drew up estimates for how long it would take to manufacture the necessary 380 mm gun barrels, rebuild the superfiring turret, and stockpile the necessary munitions for the guns; the resulting figures projected that it would take four years to complete the vessel and another year to manufacture the shells and charges. The decision was made to finish Jean Bart along the same lines as Richelieu, albeit with improved anti-aircraft defenses. The naval historians John Jordan and Robert Dumas note that despite criticisms from officers of the French naval air arm, \\"there can be no doubt that the decision against a carrier conversion was correct in that it would have resulted in a ship which was poor value for the effort and expenditure involved.\\" Jean Bart was then moved to Brest, where she was dry-docked for repairs to her hull that began on 11 March 1946. During this period, her propulsion system was also completed, her main and secondary turrets were installed, and her superstructure was modified for the new radar and fire control equipment that would be later installed. Work on the hull was completed on 26 November 1947, which allowed her to be moved from the dry dock to the fitting-out quay. There, further modifications were made to the superstructure and the guns for her primary and secondary turrets were installed. Thereafter followed another stint in the dry dock from 20 March to 9 October 1948, which involved the installation of bulges to the lower hull and her propeller shafts were repaired. Initial testing of her propulsion machinery began on 4 December, followed by full tests that began in January 1949. She then conducted gunnery tests, and in May, she was assigned to the Groupe des b√¢timents de ligne (Battleship Group) with Richelieu, though the unit was disbanded in 1950.  Post war active service  Jean Bart passing through the Suez Canal in 1956 Jean Bart participated in training exercises with the fleet off the coast of North Africa in May and June 1950. She spent the next several months in Brest, and in early 1951 resumed initial training. She went to Le Havre in May to have a degaussing system installed, followed by further training cruises and tests to determine fuel consumption in June. By 7 July, she had returned to the fitting-out quay in Brest for additional work. The ship's main and secondary batteries were by now operational, and her propulsion system was complete, though she still lacked her anti-aircraft battery and fire control equipment. Beginning in November the shipyard embarked on the next phase modernization program, which included the installation of the anti-aircraft guns, modifying the 152 mm turrets to convert them to dual-purpose guns, and the fitting of fire control equipment. The new anti-aircraft battery consisted of twelve 100 mm guns in twin mounts and twenty-eight guns. At the same time, her main battery turrets were deactivated for preservation while work continued on the ship. Work on the ship's anti-aircraft battery proceeded very slowly. The 100 mm guns were installed by mid-1952, but the directors for the 100 mm guns were not installed until May 1953, permitting test firings of the guns in July. The tests revealed the need for extensive modifications to the systems that were finally complete in October 1954. The 57 mm guns were even more delayed, with the guns not ready for tests until September 1955, though their optical directors were not fitted until August 1956. The period of work between 1951 and 1956 was interrupted by numerous sea trials to evaluate the vessel as each new type of equipment was installed. By the time work on the ship was completed, she had been fitted with a variety of radar sets, including a DRBV 11 air/surface search radar, a DRBV 20 air search radar, and a DRBV 30 navigational radar. Fire control radars included a DRBC 10A set for the main battery, six ACAE sets for the heavy anti-aircraft battery and five DRBC 30B sets for the light anti-aircraft guns. Her normal displacement had risen to , with full-load displacement at . With the greater weight of the ship, draft increased to . Jean Bart moored in Toulon in 1963 She was finally pronounced complete on 1 May 1955, and that month she embarked President Ren√© Coty for a visit to Denmark, escorted by the destroyer . After returning from the cruise, which also included a visit to Oslo, Norway, she left in July to represent France at a celebration in New York of the 175th anniversary of the landing of French soldiers led by the Comte de Rochambeau during the American Revolutionary War. She thereafter conducted a series of training cruises off the coast of Brittany in August and September before transferring to the Mediterranean in October. She arrived in Toulon on 17 October, and four days later, Jean Bart replaced Richelieu as the flagship of the training squadron. The ship spent late 1955 and early 1956 in port and conducting gunnery training in Les Salins d'Hy√®res. In June 1956, Jean Bart went on a tour of French North Africa. As tensions with Egypt over the control of the Suez Canal flared in 1956, the decision was made on 8 July to deploy the ship to Egypt. Jean Barts superfiring turret was reactivated in August and on 7 September, she conducted shooting practice with the turret in company with the cruiser off the coast of North Africa. She thereafter deployed with the French Naval Intervention Force during the Suez Crisis, Operation Mousquetaire, though with only her superfiring turret in operation. During the operations off the canal zone, she carried a complement of 1,280 officers and men, despite the fact that her projected wartime crew amounted to 2,220. This meant that only half of her anti-aircraft guns could be manned. The ship departed Toulon on 26 October and steamed first to Algiers, French Algeria, where from 29 to 31 October, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment and Commando Hubert frogmen unit came aboard the ship. Jean Bart then joined the rest of the intervention force, which included the carriers and , Georges Leygues, the destroyers Surcouf, , , and , and an anti-submarine warfare group. The ships left on 1 November and reached Limassol, Cyprus on the 4th, where the paratroopers and frogmen transferred to amphibious assault ships. On 5 November, Jean Bart steamed south to bombard Port Said, but she fired only four rounds from her main battery before the landing was cancelled. She remained off the city for two more days before departing on the 7th and returning to Toulon by way of Limassol on 13 November. On 1 December, Jean Bart returned to the training squadron. Her last period at sea took place from 11 to 19 July 1957; this was also the last time she fired her main battery. On 1 August, she was reduced to reserve status, despite the reluctance of many in the naval command to see the funds and effort expended in completing the ship be wasted. By this time, a new generation of post-war cruisers and destroyers were beginning to enter service, leading to significant crew shortages. Coupled with the cost of maintaining Jean Bart in service, the need to release the manpower tied up in the ship for more useful vessels led to her withdrawal from active service after just two years. The navy considered a number of modernization proposals to improve the ship's anti-aircraft battery or add guided missiles. The latter concept involved five different variants that ranged from adding missile launchers with 24‚Äì44 missiles to the quarterdeck to removing the main battery turrets and reconstructing the forward part of the ship to house a large missile battery with as many as 325 missiles. Alternatively, an air-defense missile armament for testing purposes was considered; this would have involved removing the centerline 152 mm turret and replacing it with a launcher for the American RIM-2 Terrier missile. The 152 mm turret would be retained for re- installation once the evaluation period was over. An anchor from Jean Bart on display in Saint Nazaire None of the modernization or conversion projects came to fruition, and the missile batteries that involved removing the 380 mm turrets were not even seriously considered by the high command. In August 1957, the vessel was reduced to a barracks ship, and on 1 January 1961 her reserve status was downgraded. Some consideration was given in 1964 to reactivate the vessel for use as a command ship during a series of nuclear experiments in the Pacific Ocean, but it was determined that the cost would have been too high, thus the cruiser was used instead. The ship remained laid up until 10 February 1970 when she was struck from the naval register, renamed Q466, and placed for sale. The vessel was sold to ship breakers on 21 May, towed to Br√©gaillon, and dismantled for scrap. Though she never became fully operational, Jean Bart nevertheless proved to be a useful test bed for a variety of new French anti-aircraft guns and radars.

Campbell (born July 24, 1931) is a retired British petroleum geologist who predicted that oil production would peak by 2007. He claims the consequences of this are uncertain but drastic, due to the world's dependency on fossil fuels for the vast majority of its energy. His theories have received wide attention but are disputed and have not significantly changed governmental energy policies at this time. To deal with declining global oil production, he has proposed the Rimini protocol. Influential papers by Campbell include The Coming Oil Crisis, written with Jean Laherr√®re in 1998 and credited with convincing the International Energy Agency of the coming peak; and The End of Cheap Oil, published the same year in Scientific American. He was referred to as a \\"doomsayer\\" in The Wall Street Journal in 2004.. The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, founded by Campbell in 2000, has been gaining recognition in the recent years. The association has organised yearly international conferences since 2002. The most recent conference of the USA chapter (ASPO-USA) was at the University of Texas in Austin, TX on 30 November and 1 December 2012. Remarks The most famous peak oil petrogeologist is M. King Hubbert, who predicted in 1956 that oil production would peak in the United States between 1965 and 1970. US oil production peaked in 1970. Hubbert's theories, particularly his evaluation of oil availability in any given area reaching a peak, to be followed by inevitable and sometimes rapid decline, were expounded in his Hubbert peak theory, and became popular during the 1973 energy crisis, and during the 1979 energy crisis when even the United States Secretary of Energy, James Schlesinger announced, as he left his post that year, that 'Mid-East production is unlikely to expand much, if at all, and is unlikely to drop below current levels'. (Wall Street Journal 1979).National Research Council, Long-range environmental outlook: proceedings of a workshop, 14‚Äì16 November 1979, p.20. In December 2000 Colin Campbell warned in a public lecture held at the Clausthal University of Technology that > 'There is, I think, a strong danger of some ill-considered military > intervention to try to secure oil. A stock market crash seems inevitable, as > some investment managers are now telling us. The global market may collapse > because of high transport costs and global recession. Self-sufficiency will > become a priority.' C.J. Campbell, Presentation at the Technical University > of Clausthal, December 2000  Current debate  Global oil discovery peaked in 1964,Feasta.org Peak oil timeline and since the early 1980s oil production has outpaced new discoveries. The world currently consumes oil at the rate of 84 million barrel per day (31 billion barrels/year, or 151 m¬≥/s), and consumption is rising, particularly in China. According to Campbell: * There are no new potential oil fields sufficiently large to reduce this future energy crisis. * The reported oil reserves of many OPEC countries are inflated, to increase their quotas, or improve their chance of getting a loan from the World Bank. * The practice of gradually adding new discoveries to a country's list of proven reserves, instead of all at once, artificially inflates the current rate of discovery. In 1989 Campbell claimed that there would be a shortage towards the late 1990s. In 1990 he claimed that 1998 would represent a \\"depletion midpoint.\\"C.J. Campbell, Evolution of oil assessments. These early assessments were, however, according to Campbell himself, \\"based on public domain data, before the degree of misreporting by industry and governments was appreciated.\\" Since that time, Campbell has been predicting that the peak of oil production will cause a catastrophic worldwide economic depression. A 2007 study of oil depletion by the UK Energy Research Centre pointed out what it considered weaknesses in Campbell's methodology. The authors note that Campbell fails to take into account future reserve growth in existing fields. The authors concluded that curve-fitting techniques, such as Campbell's, tend to underestimate ultimate recoverable reserves. The report cited Campbell's record of premature peak predictions, systematically shifting forward over time, as evidence that his methodology is flawed.Steven Sorrell and Jaimie Speirs, Global Oil Depletion, UK Energy Research Centre, Aug. 2009, p.86-87, 111-112. The US Department of Energy report Peaking of World Oil Production: Impacts, Mitigation, and Risk Management, often referred to as the Hirsch Report, proposes an urgent mitigation approach to deal with the possibility of oil production going into decline in the immediate future. It states: \\"The peaking of world oil production presents the US and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem. As peaking is approached, liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically, and, without timely mitigation, the economic, social, and political costs will be unprecedented. Viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides, but to have substantial impact, they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking.\\" The current debate in the US revolves around energy policy, and whether to shift funding to increasing conservation measures, fuel efficiency, and other energy sources such as wind power, solar power, hydropower, and nuclear power. Personal Life Campbell resides in Ballydehob, a small town in South West Cork, Ireland with his wife Bobbins. Activities Campbell has over 40 years of experience in the oil industry. He was educated at St Paul's School and Wadham College, Oxford (BA Geology 1954, MA and DPhil 1957), and has worked as a petroleum geologist in the field, as a manager, and as a consultant. He has been employed by Oxford University, Texaco, British Petroleum, Amoco, Shenandoah Oil, Norsk Hydro, and Petrofina, and has worked with the Bulgarian and Swedish governments. His writing includes two books and more than 150 papers. More recently, he founded the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, is affiliated with Petroconsultants in Geneva, is a trustee of the Oil Depletion Analysis Centre in London. He conducts research on the oil peak, and he also tries to build public awareness of the issue, which includes lecturing extensively.

Sarver was a court decision that was the first in a series of American common law cases that have found entire state prison systems in violation of prisoners' constitutional rights by inflicting cruel and unusual punishment. The Arkansas prison system, which had no written standards, was found to violate the US Constitution. The cases significantly altered the American prison system, specifically with regard to prisoners' rights under the Eighth Amendment. Arkansas cases In 1969 in Holt v. Sarver I, 300 F. Supp. 825, Judge J. Smith Henley ruled several aspects of Arkansas' existing prison system unconstitutional. He issued guidelines to follow for correcting the problems, and ordered administrators to report on the progress of the implementation of these guidelines. In 1970 in Holt v. Sarver II, 309 F. Supp. 362, Judge Henley ruled the entire Arkansas prison system unconstitutional and ordered the State Correction Board to devise a plan of action. In that same case in 1971, Judge Henley enjoined the Arkansas prison from preventing the inmates' access to court and from inflicting cruel and unusual punishment upon them. Prior history The Supreme Court ruled in Jones v. Cunningham in 1963 that inmates in state institutions could file a writ of habeas corpus challenging the conditions of their imprisonment as well as its legality. This ruling reversed the Supreme Court's \\"hands off\\" policy regarding federal interference in state penal issues first clearly stated in 1866 in Pervear v. Massachusetts. Subsequently, in a series of cases starting with Gates v. Collier the federal government began whole scale intervention in the constitutionality of the operation of state prison systems.

Early life Caunt was born on 22 March 1815 in Hucknall Torkard, in Nottinghamshire, England. Caunt stood tall and weighed 18 stone. He was said to be strong, durable, and willing yet also slow and clumsy. His early boxing career is not well known, but he did defeat several minor local opponents at the age of 18. Boxing career In 1834 he beat George Graham (of Lincolnshire). On 21 July 1835, Caunt boxed William \\"Bendigo\\" Thompson and was disqualified for an alleged foul striking Thompson while he was sitting in his corner. On 17 August 1837, Caunt fought and beat William Butler at Stoneyford in Derbyshire, and on 4 November Bill Boniford at Sunrise Hill. On 3 April 1838, Caunt again fought William Thompson on Skipworth Common, and after 76 rounds Thompson was disqualified for going down without being struck; Caunt claimed the Heavyweight Championship of England but this was not generally accepted. On 24 June of the same year, Caunt was scheduled to again fight William Thompson but the bout was cancelled. On 26 October 1840, Caunt defeated Bill Brassey at Six Mile Bottom in 101 rounds. On 2 February 1841, Caunt fought Nick Ward on Crookham Common for the Heavyweight Championship of England where the crowd forced the referee to disqualify Caunt for an alleged blow striking Ward while he was down. Caunt avenged this defeat on 11 May of the same year, defeating Ward in 35 rounds at Long Marston to become the Heavyweight Champion of England. On 10 September 1841 Caunt sailed to America to challenge Tom Hyer to a world championship bout, but Hyer never replied. Caunt returned to England on 10 March 1842 with the \\"American Giant\\" Charles Freeman. Memorial to Ben Caunt in St Mary Magdalene churchyard, HucknallIn 1845 he was challenged for the English heavyweight title by William Thompson. On 9 September Caunt lost at Stony Stratford, with a disputable decision after 93 rounds where it was alleged that Caunt went down without a blow striking him. Caunt denied this accusation and announced his retirement, only to return for a final attempt at the heavyweight crown 12 years later. Retirement and attempted comeback Between 1845 and 1851, Caunt worked as farm labourer and then became the landlord of the Coach and Horses pub at St Martin's Lane, a business that made him very prosperous until the premises were destroyed in a fire that killed two of his children. In his final fight on 21 September 1857, Caunt fought Nat Langham at Home Circuit, where after 60 rounds both men were too exhausted to continue and a draw was declared. Death and legacy Caunt died of pneumonia on 10 September 1861 at an address in St Martin's Lane in London. He is buried outside the north transept of the Parish Church of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall close to the grave of his two children who died in the Coach and Horses fire. It is said that Big Ben, the hour bell of the clock-tower of the Palace of Westminster, is named after this English Heavyweight Champion. The origin of the name is contested with Westminster's Chief Lord of the Woods and Forests, Sir Benjamin Hall. A large and ponderous man known affectionately in the House as \\"Big Ben\\", he is said to have given an impressively long speech on the subject. When, at the end of this oratorical marathon, Sir Benjamin sank back into his seat, a wag in the chamber shouted out: \\"Why not call him Big Ben and have done with it?\\" The house erupted in laughter; Big Ben had been named. This, at least, is the most commonly accepted story.

It stands in contrast to exclusivism, which asserts that only one way is true and all others are in error. It is a particular form of religious pluralism, though that term may also assert that all beliefs are equally valid within a believer's particular context. Broadly speaking, there are two schools of Inclusivist thought: * Traditional Inclusivism, which asserts that the believer's own views are true only in their particular context, and believers of other traditions have their own validity. * Relativistic Inclusivism, which asserts that an unknown set of assertions are Absolutely True, that no human being currently living has yet ascertained Absolute Truth, but that all human beings have partially ascertained Absolute Truth. Strands of both types of Inclusivist thought run through inclusivistic faiths. Ancient Greece Interpretatio graeca the common tendency of ancient Greek writers to equate foreign divinities to members of their own pantheon. Herodotus, for example, refers to the ancient Egyptian gods Amon, Osiris and Ptah as \\"Zeus,\\" \\"Dionysus\\" and \\"Hephaestus.\\" This could be seen an example of inclusivism, as could syncretism. Syncretism functionized as an essential feature of Ancient Greek religion. Later on, Hellenism, a consequence of Alexander the Great's belief that he was the son of a god, only to be reinforced upon personally consulting the Oracle of Zeus-Ammon at Siwa in Egypt, itself showed syncretist features, essentially blending Persian, Anatolian, Egyptian (and eventually Etruscan-Roman) elements within Hellenic formulations. After the Hellenization of the Egyptian culture initiated by Ptolemy I Soter, Isis became known as \\"Queen of Heaven\\" and worshipped in many aspects and by many names besides that of Hera. Bah√° º√≠ Faith Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the first half of the 20th century, states: Christianity *Jesus said, \\"for whoever is not against us is for us.\\" (NIV) Gospel of Mark 9:40. * The Apostle Peter wrote of God: \\"He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.\\" 2 Peter 3:9 (NIV) * \\"That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.\\" John 1:9 Similarly Titus 2:11 says, \\"The grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.\\" * God loved the entire world and Jesus came to save it, not condemn it (John 3:16, 17.) * An aphorism common in some Christian circles: \\"All Truth is God's Truth.\\" Compare: \\"If there is something more excellent than the truth, then that is God; if not, then truth itself is God\\" - Saint Augustine * Some Evangelical scholars believe that God judges all people based on their response to the Holy Spirit, and that just as Romans 2:14-15 shows that God is righteous by condemning people who violate natural law as they understand it, it also shows His mercy in forgiving those who have lived up to all the light they have had. Thus, it is possible for people to be saved through hearing the Gospel message of forgiveness of sins by Christ, even if they have not been instructed by Christian missionaries. * Psalm 19 presents general revelation, as exemplified by the sky and sun, in parallel with conversion. Verses 1-6 show the transcending of the barriers of language and geography. Verses 7-8 declare that the internalizing of the perfect law of the LORD can be efficacious in \\"converting the soul‚Ä¶making wise the simple‚Ä¶rejoicing the heart‚Ä¶enlightening the eyes.\\" * Melchizedek (Genesis 14:18), Balaam (Numbers) and the Wise Men (Matthew 2:1-13) are examples of people who believed in God even though they were not part of the covenant people. * Cornelius already believed in God before Peter came and preached to him (Acts 10:1-48.) \\"Then Peter opened his mouth and said: 'In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality, But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him.\\" Acts 10:34-35 * The Parable of the Sheep and the Goats (Matthew 25:31-46) portrays the judgment of the nations as being based on each individual's compassion on others, not on their religious background. The blessings pronounced upon the poor in spirit, the meek, the merciful, the peacemakers, those hungering for righteousness, etc. (Matthew 5:3-10) can also be understood as applying without reference to religion. Similarly, James 1:27 says, \\"Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.\\" * Paul said that the Greeks had been worshiping God without knowing it. He said that in their semi-enlightened condition, they might grope for God and find Him, since He was not far from each one of us. Their own poets had declared that they were God's offspring. This shows that He was somewhat known to them. Acts 17:23-28 * Jesus, speaking to a Samaritan woman (traditionally known as Photina) in (John 4:22), said, \\"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews,\\" implying, inclusivists believe, that it is possible to worship the true God without explicitly knowing it. Later, when an expositor of the Jewish laws asked him, ‚ÄúWhat shall I do to inherit eternal life?,‚Äù Jesus told the Parable of the Good Samaritan and said, ‚ÄúGo and do likewise.‚Äù Luke 10:25-37 * And he said, \\"Therefore, as through one man's offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man's righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life.\\" Romans 5:18 * Supporters of inclusivism include Saint Julian of Norwich, Augustus Hopkins Strong, C. S. Lewis,Lewis, Mere Christianity (New York: Macmillan, 1967), 65. For a study of Lewis on this topic see John Sanders, No Other Name: An Investigation into the Destiny of the Unevangelized (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1992), 251-257.

Tiessen (Reformed) and Robert Brush (contributor to The Arminian Magazine). While Billy Graham faithfully preached \\"salvation by faith in Christ alone\\" throughout his 60-year ministry as an evangelist, he later made controversial comments that border on inclusivism (but he did not like to refer to it by the term, because he was concerned that many people mean universalism when they refer to inclusivism). Graham said, ‚ÄúI used to play God but I can‚Äôt do that any more. I used to believe that pagans in far- off countries were lost and were going to hell‚Äîif they did not have the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them. I no longer believe that,‚Äù he said carefully. ‚ÄúI believe that there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God‚Äîthrough nature, for instance‚Äîand plenty of other opportunities, therefore, of saying ‚Äôyes‚Äô to God.‚Äù\\"I Can't Play God Anymore\\" interview with James M. Beam, McCall's Magazine, (January 1978), pp. 154-158 * The doctrine of inclusivism is held by Roman Catholics and Seventh-day Adventists, asserting that while Christianity is the one true faith, other faiths are at least partially true, and therefore are valid ways of reaching salvation until the Gospels can be preached to them.. A standard passage cited in the debate over this question is found in Jesus' words in John 14:6: \\"No one comes to the Father except through me\\" (NIV). If this is taken to mean that a person is saved only by conscious faith in Jesus, the verse appears to contradict Lewis' position. However, another reading is that Jesus is solely responsible for making salvation possible (i.e. he \\"instituted\\" it by his death and resurrection). In this reading there may be room for the position that some might come to the Father through this salvation not knowing (at least originally) its connection to Jesus. Hinduism *A well-known Rig Vedic hymn stemming from Hinduism claims that \\"Truth is One, though the sages know it variously.\\", thus proclaiming a pluralistic view of religion. *Krishna, incarnation or Avatar of Vishnu, the supreme God in Hinduism, said in the Gita: In whatever way men identify with Me, in the same way do I carry out their desires; men pursue My path, O Arjuna, in all ways. (Gita:4:11); *Krishna said: \\"Whatever deity or form a devotee worships, I make his faith steady. However, their wishes are only granted by Me.\\" (Gita: 7:21-22) *Another quote in the Gita states: \\"O Arjuna, even those devotees who worship other lesser deities (e.g., Devas, for example) with faith, they also worship Me, but in an improper way because I am the Supreme Being. I alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services (Seva, Yajna) and Lord of the universe.\\" (Gita: 9:23) See also *Inclusive Christianity References Category:Religious pluralism ","title":"Inclusivism"},{"id":"1105624","text":"Ricardo Araujo Pereira Jos√© Diogo Quintela Gato Fedorento ( \\"Smelly Cat\\") is a Portuguese surreal comedy group, known for their subjective and absurd satire centering both on the Portuguese language and the Portuguese social reality. The group is composed of the four comedians Jos√© Diogo Quintela, Miguel G√≥is, Ricardo Ara√∫jo Pereira and Tiago Dores. They started their comedy career as screenwriters, writing for other comedians, which later developed into their own television shows, radio programs, a talk show and several advertising campaigns. They have been credited with introducing and popularizing the surreal humour genre in Portugal and are one of the most important influences in the modern Portuguese comedy. Their humour is heavily influenced by Monty Python. Gato Fedorento, their homonym television show, ran for nine seasons. In its original unique surreal humour, the group is known for overusing Portuguese idioms, especially in indirect speech, within current discourse on their sketches, turning apparently objective quotidian situations into subjective and often illogical ones. Season names during the first four seasons were meant to satirically represent typical Portuguese surnames and are used as a last name for every single character in every episode of the show within their respective seasons. They also use satirical fictional city names that sound like realistic traditional Portuguese villages, often by including altered forms of Portuguese slang, in the same fashion as in the case of the surnames that give the name to the different seasons. Currently, they have an exclusivity advertisement agreement with Portugal Telecom of unspecified duration, that spans multiple mediums, being the brand ambassadors. History The four screenwriters worked at the Portuguese production company Produ√ß√µes Fict√≠cias, where they worked with some of the big names in the Portuguese comedy, like Herman Jos√© and Maria Rueff. In 2002, they started delivering their own material in the show O Perfeito Anormal (The Perfect Dork) on SIC Radical. Their success in that role led the then director of SIC Radical, Francisco Penim, to invite them to create their own show. Meanwhile, in 2003, they created an homonym weblog where they regularly presented some of their material. When they were deciding how to name the group, they chose it after the song \\"Smelly Cat\\", from the soundtrack of Friends, which translates as \\"Gato Fedorento\\" in Portuguese. In the same year, Gato Fedorento, their homonym television show, premiered on SIC Radical, running for three seasons, the Fonseca Series, the Meireles Series and the Barbosa Series. In 2006, after moving their show to RTP1, the fourth season, Lopes da Silva, premiered with moderate success. The fifth season, titled Diz que √© uma Esp√©cie de Magazine (lit. It's a sort of talk show), a talk show with live audience, brought a significant change in the show's format, with sketches now spoofing current events and news, instead of relying on subjective and surreal gags. In this new format, they also do impressions of Portuguese politicians and celebrities, mostly played by Ricardo Ara√∫jo Pereira, with the most spoofed being Jos√© S√≥crates, Valentim Loureiro, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and Paulo Bento. The sixth and seventh seasons were the last television shows made by Gato Fedorento on RTP1. After returning to SIC in 2008, now on the flagship channel, the group kept the new format and made their eighth season, Z√© Carlos. Their ninth and last season, Gato Fedorento Esmi√∫√ßa Os Sufr√°gios, ran for 30 episodes, broadcast live from Monday to Friday, covering the 2009 Portuguese elections, featuring guests from the world of politics. The group has released a DVD with the Fonseca season and performed live all over Portugal, being a huge success and breaking all DVD sale records in the country. In late 2005, they released another DVD with the Meireles season. The first three seasons still air on SIC Radical, as reruns. Gato Fedorento are Portugal Telecom's brand ambassadors since 2007. They have an exclusivity advertisement agreement of unspecified duration, that spans multiple mediums, including TV, radio, press, Internet and billboards, featuring a sketch-like comedy similar to their television programs.

Luna Park was located on a site bounded by Surf Avenue to the south, West 8th Street to the east, Neptune Avenue to the north, and West 12th Street to the west. Luna Park opened in 1903 and operated until 1944. Luna Park was located partly on the grounds of Sea Lion Park, which operated between 1895 and 1902. It was the second of the three original iconic large parks built on Coney Island, the other two being Steeplechase Park (1897) and Dreamland (1904).David Goldfield, Encyclopedia of American Urban History, SAGE Publications ‚Äì 2006, page 185 The park was mostly destroyed by a fire in 1944, never reopened, and was demolished two years later. Though another amusement park named Luna Park opened nearby in 2010, it has no connection to the 1903 park. History Opening In 1901 the park's creators, Frederic Thompson and Elmer \\"Skip\\" Dundy, had created a wildly successful ride called \\"A Trip To The Moon\\", as part of the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, New York. The name of the fanciful \\"airship\\" (complete with flapping wings) that was the main part of the ride was Luna, the Latin word for the moon. The airship, and the later park built around it may have been named after Dundy's sister in Des Moines, Luna Dundy Newman.Pilat, Oliver and Jo Ranson, Sodom By the Sea: An Affectionate History of Coney Island, Garden City: Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1941, p. 146 Topsy the elephant (standing in the middle of this image). At the invitation of Steeplechase Park owner George C. Tilyou, Thompson and Dundy moved their show to Steeplechase, a Coney Island amusement park, for the 1902 season. The deal ended at the end of the summer after Thompson and Dundy rejected Tilyou's contract renewal offer that cut their take of the profits by 20%. At the end of the 1902 season, Thompson and Dundy signed a long-term lease for Paul Boyton's Sea Lion Park. Sea Lion, the first large scale enclosed park at Coney island, had opened 7 years before. The park had several centerpiece rides but a bad summer season and competition with Steeplechase Park made Boyton decide to get out of the amusement park business. Besides the 16-acre (6.5 ha) Sea Lion Park Thompson and Dundy also leased the adjacent land where the Elephantine Colossus Hotel had stood until it burned down in 1896. This gave them , all the land north of Surf Avenue and south of Neptune Avenue and between W. 8th and W. 12th Street, to build a much larger park. Thompson and Dundy spent $700,000 (although they advertised it as $1 million) totally rebuilding the park and expanding its attractions. The park's architectural style was an Oriental theme with buildings built on a grand scale and over 1,000 red and white painted spires, minarets and domes. At night all the domes, spires and towers were lit with over 250,000 electric lights. At the center of the park in the middle of a lake was the 200-foot- tall (61 m) Electric Tower that was decorated with twenty thousand incandescent lamps, a smaller version of the Electric Tower that was the crowning feature of the Pan-American Exposition two years earlier. At the base of the tower was a series of cascading fountains. Eventually two circus rings were suspended over the central lagoon to keep customers entertained between rides. Calling itself \\"The heart of Coney Island\\", Luna Park turned on its lights and opened its gates to a crowd of 60,000 spectators precisely at 8:05pm on May 16, 1903, coinciding with the timing of sunset on that Saturday night. Admission to the park was ten cents with rides costing extra, up to 25 cents for the most elaborate rides. The park was accessible from Culver Depot, the terminals of the West End and Sea Beach railroad lines. Operations Interior of Luna Park at night, 1905 with its centerpiece, the \\"Electric Tower\\" in the foreground. Although Luna Park was a success, competition for visitors ramped up on Coney Island. The next year a third large-scale park called Dreamland opened up. Dreamland featured 4 times as many lights as Luna Park, an even bigger central Tower, and attractions such as \\"The End of the World\\", \\"Feast of Belshazzar and the Destruction of Babylon\\", and Lilliputia, a miniature village populated by little people. At Coney Island's peak in the middle of the 20th century's first decade, the three amusement parks competed with each other and with many independent amusements. In 1907, Dundy died leaving Frederic Thompson to run Luna Park until 1912 when he went bankrupt and lost the park to creditors, although he continued as manager. Luna Park would continue under different management over the years with rides constantly being changed and updated. The Great Depression saw the park go into bankruptcy several times starting in 1933; owners came and went but none seemed to be able to make a profit. Many of the exhibits, rides and shows from the 1939 New York World's Fair moved to Luna Park after the Fair closed and Luna was billed as the New York World's Fair of 1941. With the US entry into World War II Luna was allowed to stay open as a morale booster but had to keep its lights dimmed for wartime security. Demise A fire on August 13, 1944 destroyed much of Luna Park, causing $800,000 in damage. The park never reopened after the 1944 fire due to legal disputes over the park's insurance money. In August 1946, the park was sold to a company who announced they were going to tear down what was left of Luna Park and build Quonset huts for military veterans and their families. That October, the park was destroyed in another fire.

Fleming is currently First Team Assistant Coach at Premier League club Southampton, a position he has held since 2018. Playing career Fleming began his professional career with his hometown club Halifax Town (69 appearances, no goals) where he made his debut aged 16. He also picked up the Barclays Player of the Month award at the same age. In the summer of 1991 he moved to Oldham Athletic, where he made 192 appearances, scoring one goal. His spell at Oldham included three seasons in the top division in the early 1990s. In this period, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson described Fleming as \\"the best man-to-man marker in the country\\" after playing some memorable games against a young Ryan Giggs. In 1993, he was involved in Oldham Athletic's great escape when they narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League on goal difference. He became captain of the Latics in 1997 which was also the season when he left Boundary Park for Carrow Road, the home of Norwich City for a fee of ¬£600,000. In his first season with the Canaries he suffered some injury setbacks but this was soon behind him and he became a first team regular for nearly 10 seasons. In this time he also had spells of captaining his team and was a well-respected member of the squad. In 2003, Fleming was voted into the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. On 23 October 2004, he made his 300th senior appearance for Norwich City in their home match against Everton. Fleming was a key figure in the Norwich side that won the first division championship in the 2003‚Äì2004 season, and the supporters recognised his outstanding contribution ‚Äì not just during that season but over several years ‚Äì by voting him Norwich City player of the year ahead of Darren Huckerby (2nd) and Robert Green (3rd). During Norwich's Premiership season Fleming played every minute of every game, spending the most minutes on the pitch of any top flight player. To mark the fact that the 2006‚Äì07 season was his tenth with the club, Norwich City granted Fleming a testimonial match against Newcastle United which took place at Carrow Road on 26 July 2006. This game finished 2‚Äì1 to Newcastle with Fleming playing for the majority of the game. In January 2007 Fleming joined Wolverhampton wanderers on a one-month loan deal and played once against Cardiff City. There was increasing speculation that Bournemouth would attempt to sign Fleming during the January transfer window in 2007, but Rotherham United were the club to snap him up on a free transfer on 31 January. Fleming signed for non-league King's Lynn shortly after the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season, where he was under the management of former coach Keith Webb. On 12 March 2008, however. Fleming announced his retirement due to a persistent ankle injury.The Pink'un Fleming ended his Norwich City career finishing 11th in the all-time appearance list after clocking up 382 appearances. Coaching career In 2008, Fleming joined Lowestoft Town as first-team coach guiding them to two successful promotion seasons. In the 2009‚Äì10 season they were promoted from Isthmian League Division One North to Isthmian League Premier Division. Subsequently, in 2014 Lowestoft were play off champions and promoted to the Conference league. Fleming has finished studying his UEFA 'A' licence. In March 2015, he left Lowestoft Town and joined the Southampton F.C. Academy as under-18 coach. After a very successful stint at the u.18s lead coach, Craig Fleming was promoted to the u.23s. Hoping Southampton can bounce back to the top division in the Premier League 2, the season started brightly for his team. Due to circumstances in the 1st team with Mark Hughes being sacked, Craig got the opportunity in Southampton's first team at an away game vs Tottenham. Since the new manager has joined Southampton (Ralph Hasenh√ºttl) he's been impressed with Craig and has kept him in Southampton's first team. Career outside football During his time at Norwich, Fleming became patron of two charities, The Matthew Project and Radio Broadland Kidz. During his testimonial season he held events to raise money for both charities, including a hike 'n' bike around Norfolk in which he raised in excess of ¬£23,000. In January 2009, Fleming became an Ambassador for Sport in Norfolk. In this role he visits schools and other youth organisations to help encourage young people to achieve through hard work and dedication.

He is the longest-lived man ever recorded from the United Kingdom, a First World War veteran, and, for one month, the verified oldest living man in the world. He is also the second-oldest military veteran ever, and, at the time of his death, he was the 12th-verified oldest man of all time. Allingham was the oldest-ever surviving member of any of the British Armed Forces, and one of the oldest surviving veterans of the First World War. He was the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the last-surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), and the last-surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force (RAF). In 2001, he became the face of the First World War veterans' association, and made frequent public appearances to ensure that awareness of the sacrifices of the First World War was not lost to modern generations. He received many honours and awards for his First World War service and his longevity. Early life Allingham as an infant in the 1890s Allingham was born in 1896 in Clapton, County of London. When he was 14 months old, his father, Henry Thomas Allingham (1868‚Äì1897), died at age 29 of tuberculosis.See General Register Office indices for quarter ending September 1899, Henry is recorded in the 1901 census with his widowed mother Amy Jane Allingham (n√©e Foster) (1873‚Äì1915), a laundress forewoman, living with her parents and brother at 23 Verulam Avenue, Walthamstow.Piece details RG 13/1623‚ÄîGeneral Register Office: 1901 Census Returns‚ÄîRegistration Sub- District: Walthamstow‚ÄîCivil Parish, Township or Place: Walthamstow (part), The Catalogue, The National Archives.

Allingham remembered seeing the City Imperial Volunteers return from the Second Boer War, and also recalled watching W. G. Grace play cricket. On leaving school, Allingham started work as a trainee surgical instrument maker at St Bartholomew's Hospital. He did not find this job very interesting, and so left to work for a coachbuilder specialising in car bodies. First World War Allingham in RNAS uniform in 1916 Allingham wanted to join the war effort in August 1914 as a despatch rider, but his critically ill mother managed to persuade him to stay at home and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, aged 42,Amy J. Higgs. General Register Office, Bethnal Green: Q/E June 1915, Volume 1c, p. 226. Allingham enlisted with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). He became formally rated as an Air Mechanic Second Class on 21 September 1915, and was posted to Chingford before completing his training at Sheerness, Kent. His RNAS serial number was RNAS F8317. After graduation, Allingham was posted to the RNAS Air Station at Great Yarmouth where he worked in aircraft maintenance. On 13 April 1916, King George V inspected the air station and its aircraft. Allingham later reported disappointment at narrowly missing an opportunity to speak to the king. Allingham also worked in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night- flying was conducted and was later involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols. A typical patrol would last two or three days and would involve hoisting a seaplane in and out of the water by means of a deck-mounted derrick. During the preparations for the Battle of Jutland, Allingham was ordered to join the naval trawler HMT Kingfisher. Onboard was a Sopwith Schneider seaplane that was used to patrol the surrounding waters for the German High Seas Fleet. Kingsfisher had been the first trawler to be equipped with a seaplane, in May 1915., citing Gamble went on to be Publicity Manager for Imperial Airways. Allingham's responsibilities included helping to launch this aircraft. Although the Kingfisher was not directly involved in the battle (she shadowed the Grand Fleet and then the High Seas Fleet), Allingham still rightfully claimed to be the last known survivor of that battle and could recall \\"seeing shells ricocheting across the sea.\\" In September 1917, Allingham, by then an Air Mechanic First Class, was posted to the Western Front to join No. 12 Squadron RNAS. This unit acted as a training squadron for other RNAS squadrons based on the Western Front. There is also some evidence that the squadron was involved in combat operations. When Allingham arrived at Petite-Synthe, both the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the RNAS were involved in the Ypres offensive. On 3 November 1917, he was posted to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk, France where he remained for the rest of the war, on aircraft repair and recovery duties. He recalls being bombed from the air and shelled from both the land and the sea. Sopwith Schneider He transferred to the Royal Air Force when the RNAS and the RFC were merged on 1 April 1918. The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially have a big impact on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man.Allingham and Goodwin, p. 113 In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Speaking with Dennis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association, Allingham said, \\"It is a shock as well as a privilege to think that I am the only man alive from that original reorganisation when the RAF was formed.\\" Inter-war years Career In addition to his military service as a mechanic, Allingham spent the vast majority of his professional life as an engineer. His employers included Thorns Car Body Makers, Vickers General Motors and H.J.M. Car Body Builders.Allingham and Goodwin, pp. 133‚Äì137 He started his longest stretch of employment in 1934 designing new car bodies for the Ford Motor Company at their Dagenham plantAllingham and Goodwin, p. 137 which had opened only a few years previously in 1931. Family life Allingham met Dorothy Cator (1895‚Äì1970) in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk in 1918. They married the same year in Romford, when she was 23 and he was 22. They moved to Eastbourne, Sussex in 1961 and remained married until she died there from acute and chronic lymphatic leukaemia. They had two daughters, Betty (born 1920) and Jean (1923‚Äì2001). Jean emigrated to the United States after she married an American WWII veteran soldier and died aged 78 in 2001. At the time of his death Allingham believed that Betty had died. He had lost touch with her in the 1970s following a family rift after the death of his wife in 1970; however she was still alive aged 89 when her father died, and living in Stroud, Gloucestershire. In addition to Betty, at the time of his death Allingham had: 7 grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, 14 great-great- grandchildren and 1 great-great-great-grandchild. Second World War During the Second World War, Allingham was in a reserved occupation and worked on a number of projects. Perhaps his most significant contribution was the design of an effective counter-measure to the German magnetic mines. During his Christmas lunch in 1939 he was called away to help design a system that would neutralise the mines and open the port of Harwich, Essex. Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task. Later life The Cenotaph in London at which Allingham attended ceremonies on 4 August 2004 and 11 November 2008, marking the 90th anniversary of the start and end of World War I respectively After the Second World War Allingham continued to work for Ford until he retired in 1961. After Denis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association tracked him down in 2001, Allingham took a prominent role in telling his story so that later generations would not forget. On 16 October 2003, he helped launch the 2003 Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal with model Nell McAndrew aboard the cruiser . He was quoted as saying \\"[The veterans] have given all they have got for the country ... I owe them ... we all owe them.\\" A ceremony at The Cenotaph in Whitehall, London on 4 August 2004, marked the 90th anniversary of Britain's entry into the First World War. Allingham attended, together with three other First World War veterans, William Stone, Fred Lloyd and John Oborne. Allingham also marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 2005 and laid wreaths at memorials in Saint- Omer on Armistice Day. That was the last time a First World War veteran marched past the Cenotaph and it marked the end of an era. No First World War veterans were present at the Cenotaph for the 2006 Remembrance Sunday Parade. As the last surviving member of the RNAS, and the last living founding member of the RAF, Allingham was an honoured guest when the British Air Services Memorial was unveiled at Saint-Omer on 11 September 2004. During the ceremony Allingham was given the Gold Medal of Saint-Omer, which marked the award of the Freedom of the Town.Allingham and Goodwin, p. 165 The group of RAF technical trainees that joined him at this ceremony continued to visit Allingham at his retirement home in Eastbourne. In November 2005 Allingham accepted an invitation from the International Holographic Portrait Archive to have his holographic portrait taken. His image was recorded for posterity in December 2005. At the same time, an exhibition was being planned for London's floating naval museum on board HMS Belfast, entitled the Ghosts of Jutland. A copy of this portrait was donated to the museum and the Duchess of Gloucester unveiled the portrait to mark the opening of the exhibition. Allingham was awarded the freedom of his home town of Eastbourne by the mayor on 21 April 2006. He lived on his own until May 2006 when, one month before his 110th birthday and with failing eyesight, he moved to Blind Veterans UK (formally known as St Dunstan's), a charity for blind ex-service personnel, at Ovingdean, near Brighton. Aside from his poor eyesight, he was reportedly in good health. Allingham attended the 1 July 2006 commemorations at the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing. He did not attend the 2006 Remembrance Day parade on 11 November at the Cenotaph as he was in France at a wreath-laying ceremony and to receive the Freedom of The Town of Saint-Omer. He did, however, launch the Eastbourne Poppy Appeal before leaving for this trip. On 18 April 2007 Allingham visited Wilnecote High School in Tamworth, Staffordshire to answer students' questions about the First World War, after they wrote to veterans asking them about their experiences. In October 2007 he was honoured at the Pride of Britain Awards. Between his 110th and 111th birthdays Allingham made over 60 public appearances, including a visit to The Oval on 5 June 2007, the day before his 111th birthday, where he was wheeled around the boundary in front of the spectators. On his 111th birthday, a Royal Marines band played to Allingham on board before he returned with friends and relatives to the Queen's Hotel on the Portsmouth seafront for afternoon tea. Asked how it felt, Allingham replied, \\"I'm pleased to be seeing another tomorrow. It's just the same as it was as at any age, it's no different. I'm happy to be alive and I'm looking forward to the celebrations. I never imagined I'd get to 111.\\" On 1 April 2008, the 90th anniversary of the establishment of the Royal Air Force, Allingham was guest of honour at the celebratory events at RAF Odiham in Hampshire. By then, Allingham was the only surviving founder member of the RAF. Allingham celebrated his 112th birthday with members of his family at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire as the guest of honour at a luncheon at the college. During the day the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight performed a flypast which was followed by an aerobatic display from two Tutor aircraft. In June 2008, at his personal request, Allingham was taken on a guided tour of the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft at BAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire, as part of the National Veterans' Day celebrations. On 23 September 2008, Allingham launched a book about his life, co-written by Denis Goodwin, with an event at the RAF Club in London. On 11 November 2008, marking the 90th anniversary of the end of the First World War, together with Harry Patch and Bill Stone, Allingham laid a commemorative wreath for the Act of Remembrance at The Cenotaph in London. Allingham was invested as a Scout on 18 November 2008, 100 years after he first joined as a youth. He said he was only able to spend six weeks with his local group as a boy. Allingham celebrated his 113th birthday on , at an event hosted by the Royal Navy. He received a signed birthday card from First Sea Lord Sir Jonathon Band and saw a Mark 8 Royal Navy Lynx flying overhead while he was sitting outside in his wheelchair. When asked the secret of his long life, Allingham said, \\"I don't know, but I would say, be as good as you possibly can.\\" Oldest living man Allingham credited \\"cigarettes, whisky and wild, wild women ‚Äì and a good sense of humour\\" for his longevity. Allingham overtook George Frederick Ives as the longest lived member of the British Armed Forces on 2 November 2007. He was therefore the longest lived British First World War veteran to date. Following the death of Tomoji Tanabe on 19 June 2009, Allingham became the oldest living man. At his death, he was the oldest living veteran of the First World War, but not the longest lived member of any armed force in any conflict; this record is held by Emiliano Mercado del Toro of Puerto Rico, who also served during the First World War. (As of 19 July 2009, archive appears empty and current link obviously omits Allingham). Allingham was the oldest living man in England for several years. Official recognition by Guinness World Records came in January 2007. On 8 February 2007, when 110-year-old Antonio Pierro died, Allingham became the oldest known living veteran of the First World War, and the third-oldest living man in the world. With the death of Tomoji Tanabe on 19 June 2009, he became the oldest living man in the world. He was also the first ever British man to reach the verified age of 113. On 18 July 2009, Allingham died of natural causes aged 113 years and 42 days. As the number of First World War veterans dwindled, calls grew to give the last remaining veteran a state funeral. The calls resulted in Her Majesty's Government approving on 27 June 2006 a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey to take place after the death of the last known British First World War veteran. Before this announcement Allingham often said that he tried not to think about the prospect, but has also been quoted as saying \\"I don't mind ‚Äî as long as it's not me.\\" Allingham received a letter from Member of Parliament Tom Watson on 14 July 2006 explaining the reasoning for a national memorial service rather than a state funeral, as the intention is to commemorate the entire generation that fought in the war rather than single out an individual.Allingham and Goodwin, p. 172 In Harry Patch's book The Last Fighting Tommy, the author claims that Allingham planned to leave his body to medical science. In his own book, Kitchener's Last Volunteer, Allingham confirmed that he was intending to leave his body to medical science.Allingham and Goodwin, p. 171 However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he became a symbol of World War I to remind people of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation. Awards War medals and awards The Officier L√©gion d'honneur. Awarded to Allingham in 2009. Allingham was awarded four medals, two of which were medals from the First World War. The Gold Medal of Saint-Omer was awarded to Allingham on 11 September 2004 when he was given the Freedom of the Town of Saint-Omer. He was also awarded France's highest military honour, the L√©gion d'honneur, in which he was appointed a chevalier in 2003 and promoted to officier in 2009. The remaining two medals are British Campaign Medals from the First World War: the British War Medal and the Victory Medal; those two medals are colloquially known as \\"Mutt and Jeff\\". These two medals are replacement medals supplied by the Ministry of Defence after discovering at a recent cenotaph parade that Allingham's original campaign medals were destroyed during the Blitz of the Second World War. Honorary awards As well as the above-mentioned decorations, Allingham won several awards and honorary memberships. Examples include the Pride of Britain award, and a position as an honorary member of the Fleet Air Arm Association. Although not formally qualified he was recognised by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) who presented him with a Chartered Engineer award on 19 December 2008. Allingham had the following to say about the award: This was followed on 22 May 2009 with the award of an honorary doctorate in engineering at the Southampton Solent University by the university's chancellor, the former First Sea Lord Alan West, for his contribution to Britain and its allies during two world wars and his continuing charity work, especially connected with veteran servicemen and women. Death and funeral Henry Allingham's funeral cort√®ge leaving St Dunstan's en route to St Nicholas' Church Allingham died of natural causes in his sleep at 3:10 am on 18 July 2009 at his care home, Blind Veterans UK centre in Ovingdean near Brighton, aged 113 years and 42 days. After his death, Walter Breuning succeeded him as the world's oldest man. Allingham's funeral took place at St Nicholas' Church, Brighton at noon on 30 July 2009, with full military honours. His coffin was carried by three Royal Navy seamen and three RAF airmen. The service was preceded by a half-muffled quarter peal on the church's bells, rung by local ringers and members of the RAF and Royal Navy change ringing associations. Among the mourners were the Duchess of Gloucester, representing the Queen, and Veterans' Minister Kevan Jones. Senior Royal Navy and Royal Air Force officers, including Vice-Admiral Sir Adrian Johns and Air Vice-Marshal Peter Dye, represented the two services of which Allingham had been a member. Allingham's surviving daughter, Betty Hankin, 89, attended the funeral, with several members of her family. The funeral was followed by a flypast of five replica First World War aircraft; British and French buglers played the Last Post and Reveille; and a bell was tolled 113 times, once for each year of his life. The BBC commissioned Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate, to write a poem to mark the deaths of Allingham and Harry Patch, who died one week after Allingham on 25 July 2009. The result, Last Post, was read by Duffy on the BBC Radio 4 programme Today on the day of Allingham's funeral. A tree was planted, and a commemorative plaque unveiled, at the Eastbourne Redoubt on 22 May 2010 to mark Allingham's residence in the town.

It is the seat of the Vermont General Assembly. The current Greek Revival structure is the third building on the same site to be used as the State House. Designed by Thomas Silloway in 1857 and 1858, it was occupied in 1859. A careful restoration of the Vermont State House began in the early 1980s led by curator David Sch√ºtz and the Friends of the Vermont State House, a citizens' advisory committee. The general style of the building is Neoclassical and Greek Revival and is furnished in American Empire, Renaissance Revival, and Rococo Revival styles. Some rooms have been restored to represent latter-19th-century styles including the \\"Aesthetic Movement\\" style. Since 1994, Buildings and General Services Architect, Tricia Harper has been responsible for design and construction for the restoration and renovation project of the building and its grounds. The Vermont State House is located on State Street on the western edge of downtown Montpelier, a block north of the Winooski River. Set against a wooded hillside (which was open pasture land earlier during much of its history), the building and its distinctive gold leaf dome are easily visible while approaching Montpelier, the smallest city to serve as capital of a U.S. state. History and architecture Exterior facade and dome The Doric portico of the Vermont State House dates to Ammi B. Young's second 1833 state house. The current structure was designed by architect Thomas Silloway (1828‚Äì1910) amplifying the design of an earlier structure designed by Ammi B. Young, (1798‚Äì1874) later supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury. The first State House built in 1808 by Sylvanus Baldwin was replaced by the current Vermont Supreme Court Building completed in 1918. The prior edifice, known as the \\"Second State House\\", was constructed on the same site between 1833 and 1838. Young's structure was of a more reserved Greek Revival design based upon the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens. Gray Barre granite is used for the two-story cruciform design with a Doric portico and a low saucer dome echoing William Thornton's earliest design for the United States Capitol. Young's structure was almost entirely destroyed by a fire in January 1857. Silloway was able to salvage the Doric portico, as well as portions of the granite walls. Silloway added an additional bay of windows on each side of the central portico and increased the height of the dome (copper on a wood substructure) to its current level. This may have been done to imitate the increased height of the new Capitol dome in Washington designed by Thomas U. Walter which was being constructed during the same time. The bust of Abraham Lincoln within the Hall of Inscriptions was a study by Larkin Goldsmith Mead for a larger statue installed at the Lincoln Tomb. The dome and roofs were originally painted a dark terracotta red to suggest Tuscan tile. The dome was not gilded until the early 20th century, when many states did so as a part of the Colonial Revival style. The dome is topped by a statue named Agriculture, a representation of Ceres, an ancient Roman goddess of agriculture. The original statue was carved by Vermont artist Larkin Goldsmith Mead, who also carved the large bust of Lincoln in the Hall of Inscriptions on the State House's ground floor. This statue was installed in 1858. When the first statue rotted out a replacement based on Mead's original was carved in 1938 by then 87-year-old Dwight Dwinell, Sergeant-at-Arms (in Vermont this official position is similar in nature to the White House Chief Usher). In April 2018 the second statue was removed. The current statue was carved by Chris Miller out of a laminated block of mahogany and was based on a one-quarter scale model created by Jerry Williams which was also based on the original 1858 statue. https://www.vpr.org/post/ceres-statue-once-again-adorns-vermont-statehouses- golden-dome#stream/0 The Doric portico, the main ceremonial entrance, houses a granite statue of Ethan Allen. Ethan Allen was a founder of Vermont and commander of the Green Mountain Boys, an early Vermont military infantry active during the Vermont Republic, (1777‚Äì1791). The statue was carved by Aristide Piccini in 1941, to replace the original marble version carved by Larkin Goldsmith Mead in 1858. The architect Stanford White (1853‚Äì1906) considered Silloway's Vermont State House to be the finest example of the Greek Revival style in the United States. Interiors, furnishings, and decorative arts In the well of Representatives Hall, with the rescued portrait of George Washington above the speaker's chair The State House contains two primary floors accessible by a pair of circular stairways opening into the ground-floor Cross Hall. An elevator is also available. The Entrance Hall is of the Greek Ionic order and flanked by portraits of Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Chester A. Arthur, both native to Vermont. The tall double front doors were painted and then coated with a metallic powder to appear as bronze in 1859. The Entrance Hall contains a portrait of Montpelier native Admiral George Dewey on the bridge of his flagship during the Battle of Manila Bay. The Vermont State House does not have a rotunda, the dome being located almost directly above the ceiling of Representatives Hall on the second floor. The principal public room is the Hall of Inscriptions, a Doric pilastered corridor featuring eight monumental marble tablets incised with quotations about the distinct nature of Vermont's culture and heritage. The tablets quote the Vermont Constitution, Ethan Allen, Calvin Coolidge, George Aiken, Warren Austin, and Dorothy Canfield Fisher among others. Each tablet features fourteen gilded stars, representing Vermont's fourteen counties, the state's fourteen years as an independent republic, and being the fourteenth state to join the federal Union. The four corners of each tablet feature a sheath of grain, a detail found in the Great Seal of Vermont, designed by Ira Allen. The ceremonial office of the Governor of Vermont, used during legislative sessions for meetings and bill-signings, is located in the second-floor west wing of the building. The Executive Chamber has been restored to its 1859 appearance with pediment hooded windows supported by Italianate-style brackets, and gilded Rococo Revival drapery cornices. A Wilton style carpet colored crimson, azure blue and gold was rewoven as part of the restoration. The Vermont Governor's working office and private apartments are located nearby at The Pavilion, built in Second Empire style and located just east of the Vermont Supreme Court. Portraits of Vermont governors (including Howard Dean, who is shown in an idiosyncratic pose in a canoe amid a natural setting) are displayed through the first and second floors of the State House, the corridors of which are a sort of state portrait gallery, commemorating famous Vermonters. The two chambers of the Vermont General Assembly are on the second floor. While both chambers have overhead visitors' galleries accessible on a third-floor mezzanine, visitors are welcome to quietly enter and sit in the main floor of the chambers. Contrary to the tradition of decorating the upper house in red and the lower house in green, established by the House of Lords and House of Commons in the United Kingdom, Vermont reserves the state colors of green and gold for its upper house, the Vermont Senate. Red and gold is used for the Vermont House of Representatives which meets in Representatives Hall. A large plaster ceiling medallion in the center of the chamber in the form of a lotus with a center rosette of acanthus leaves hold a two-tiered electrified gasolier manufactured in Philadelphia by Cornelius and Baker. Each petal of the rosette weighs approximately 500 pounds. Brilliant axminster carpets have been recreated for both chambers based on old stereoscope views and small scraps found in an attic. On either side of the rostrum in Representatives Hall, are a series of connected elliptical-backed seats designed to fill the north wall of the chamber. The seats are upholstered and tufted in crimson and are used to seat members of the Vermont Senate during joint sessions of the General Assembly. The seats also accommodate the justices of the State's supreme court for the Governor's State of the State address and the inauguration of governors. Citizens frequently occupy these seats when the House is in separate session, or for large public hearings. The state coat-of-arms is illustrated in one of two stained glass skylights In the Cedar Creek Room, a reception room in the west wing. The second floor of the west wing includes the Cedar Creek Room, a large reception room featuring a mural painted by Julian Scott in 1874. The mural nearly fills the south wall and depicts the Battle of Cedar Creek during the American Civil War. The painting highlights the contributions of Vermont troops in the battle. The room is illuminated by two stained glass skylights in the deeply coffered ceiling dating to 1859 when the room housed the State Library. At some time the skylight was broken, and the opening closed. In 1970, while doing renovation work, workers discovered the broken pieces neatly stacked in the attic above the room. The pieces were reassembled, conserved, and reinstalled during the mid-1980s. One window (shown at left) depicts the obverse of the coat of arms of Vermont, which is a more painterly armorial representation of the Great Seal of Vermont (reserved solely for embossing documents), the arms are topped by the head of a buck white-tailed deer and circled by branches of Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus). Pine badges were worn as an expression of Vermont identity by citizens while the state was a republic, and again during the American Civil War by Vermont's military regiments. The other skylight features the rarely seen reverse of the state coat of arms, a female personification of the state referred to as \\"Vermontannia.\\" The wall stencils in the Cedar Creek Room are the original patterns, recreated based upon old photographs, and the colors were matched by paint analysis. It is seated among sheaths of corn and wheat, representing Vermont's agricultural history. This room is restored to its 1888 appearance when the room was converted from the State Library to use as a governor's reception room. The walls, and 20-foot ceilings are polychrome painted in a complex palette of tertiary colors: burnished copper, russet, salmon, and a deep blue-green with overlays of metallic stencilling. The style is largely of the Aesthetic Movement. Most of the furnishings in the building date to the 1859 reconstruction of the State House, including the 30 black walnut chairs in the Vermont Senate chamber, still used for the same purpose today. Several American Empire-style sofas, a set of klismos chairs, carved black walnut Renaissance Revival-style chairs for the Senate President and House Speaker, and suites of Rococo Revival sett√©es and chairs also date to the completion of Silloway's reconstruction. The majority of the lighting fixtures in the building are original, restored and electrified ormolu gas chandeliers and wall sconces manufactured in Philadelphia by Cornelius and Baker during the 1850s. The large two-tiered, 26-light chandelier in Representatives Hall features sculptures of mythological figures, including a copy of Vermont sculptor Hiram Powers' The Greek Slave, which became an abolitionist icon. Only the large portrait of George Washington, painted c. 1837 by George Gassner after Gilbert Stuart, which hangs above the speaker's chair in Representatives Hall, survived the fire of 1857. Use of the Vermont State House Vermont's reputation for popular government is represented by the State House's nickname \\"the People's House.\\" While its primary use is as the house of the legislative branch of Vermont government, it has from its beginnings also functioned as a living museum and state cultural facility. The building is open to visitors with remarkably few restrictions whether the legislature is in session or not. The large Representatives Hall is used for evening concerts named \\"Farmers Nights\\" during winter months. During warmer weather, the public lawn on the south side is used for concerts by the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, municipal bands from around the state, marching regimental bagpipe tattoos, modern dance concerts, as well as to provide space for local residents to sit, eat, and play sports. Quilts, ceramics, photography and paintings by citizens periodically hang in the building's corridors, committee and caucus rooms, and dining room. In recent years, each February 14 the columns of the portico and lawn are bedecked with red paper hearts by the so-called Valentine Phantom. Additionally, the public lawn and steps of the portico serve as a well-used platform for peaceful demonstrations, press conferences by various official and non-official groups, and for formally welcoming official visitors to the State of Vermont.

Integrative psychotherapy may also refer to the psychotherapeutic process of integrating the personality: uniting the \\"affective, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological systems within a person\\". Background Initially, Sigmund Freud developed a talking cure called psychoanalysis; then he wrote about his therapy and popularized psychoanalysis. After Freud, many different disciplines splintered off. Some of the more common therapies include: psychodynamic psychotherapy, transactional analysis, cognitive behavioral therapy, gestalt therapy, body psychotherapy, family systems therapy, person- centered psychotherapy, and existential therapy. Hundreds of different theories of psychotherapy are practiced (Norcross, 2005, p. 5). A new therapy is born in several stages. After being trained in an existing school of psychotherapy, the therapist begins to practice. Then, after follow up training in other schools, the therapist may combine the different theories as a basis of a new practice. Then, some practitioners write about their new approach and label this approach with a new name. A pragmatic or a theoretical approach can be taken when fusing schools of psychotherapy. Pragmatic practitioners blend a few strands of theory from a few schools as well as various techniques; such practitioners are sometimes called eclectic psychotherapists and are primarily concerned with what works. Alternatively, other therapists consider themselves to be more theoretically grounded as they blend their theories; they are called integrative psychotherapists and are not only concerned with what works, but why it works (Norcross, 2005, p. 8). For example, an eclectic therapist might experience a change in their client after administering a particular technique and be satisfied with a positive result. In contrast, an integrative therapist is curious about the \\"why and how\\" of the change as well. A theoretical emphasis is important: for example, the client may only have been trying to please the therapist and was adapting to the therapist rather than becoming more fully empowered in themselves. Different routes to integration The most recent edition of the Handbook of Psychotherapy Integration (Norcross & Goldfried, 2005) recognized four general routes to integration: common factors, technical eclecticism, theoretical integration, and assimilative integration (Norcross, 2005). Common factors The first route to integration is called common factors and \\"seeks to determine the core ingredients that different therapies share in common\\" (Norcross, 2005, p. 9). The advantage of a common factors approach is the emphasis on therapeutic actions that have been demonstrated to be effective. The disadvantage is that common factors may overlook specific techniques that have been developed within particular theories. Common factors have been described by Jerome Frank (Frank & Frank, 1991), Bruce Wampold (Wampold & Imel, 2015), and Miller, Duncan and Hubble (2005). Common factors theory asserts it is precisely the factors common to the most psychotherapies that make any psychotherapy successful. Some psychologists have converged on the conclusion that a wide variety of different psychotherapies can be integrated via their common ability to trigger the neurobiological mechanism of memory reconsolidation in such a way as to lead to deconsolidation (Ecker, Ticic & Hulley 2012; Lane et al. 2015; Welling 2012‚Äîbut for a more hesitant view of the role of memory reconsolidation in psychotherapy see the objections in some of the invited comments in: Lane et al. 2015). Technical eclecticism The second route to integration is technical eclecticism which is designed \\"to improve our ability to select the best treatment for the person and the problem‚Ä¶guided primarily by data on what has worked best for others in the past\\" (Norcross, 2005, p. 8). The advantage of technical eclecticism is that it encourages the use of diverse strategies without being hindered by theoretical differences. A disadvantage is that there may not be a clear conceptual framework describing how techniques drawn from divergent theories might fit together. The most well known model of technical eclectic psychotherapy is Arnold Lazarus' (2005) multimodal therapy. Another model of technical eclecticism is Larry E. Beutler and colleagues' systematic treatment selection (Beutler, Consoli, & Lane, 2005). Theoretical integration The third route to integration commonly recognized in the literature is theoretical integration in which \\"two or more therapies are integrated in the hope that the result will be better than the constituent therapies alone\\" (Norcross, 2005, p. 8). Some models of theoretical integration focus on combining and synthesizing a small number of theories at a deep level, whereas others describe the relationship between several systems of psychotherapy. One prominent example of theoretical synthesis is Paul Wachtel's model of cyclical psychodynamics that integrates psychodynamic, behavioral, and family systems theories (Wachtel, Kruk, & McKinney, 2005). Another example of synthesis is Anthony Ryle's model of cognitive analytic therapy, integrating ideas from psychoanalytic object relations theory and cognitive psychotherapy (Ryle, 2005). Another model of theoretical integration is specifically called integral psychotherapy (Forman, 2010; Ingersoll & Zeitler, 2010). The most notable model describing the relationship between several different theories is the transtheoretical model (Prochaska & DiClemente, 2005). Assimilative integration Assimilative integration is the fourth route and acknowledges that most psychotherapists select a theoretical orientation that serves as their foundation but, with experience, incorporate ideas and strategies from other sources into their practice. \\"This mode of integration favors a firm grounding in any one system of psychotherapy, but with a willingness to incorporate or assimilate, in a considered fashion, perspectives or practices from other schools\\" (Messer, 1992, p. 151). Some counselors may prefer the security of one foundational theory as they begin the process of integrative exploration. Formal models of assimilative integration have been described based on a psychodynamic foundation (Frank, 1999; Stricker & Gold, 2005) and based on cognitive behavioral therapy (Castonguay, Newman, Borkovec, Holtforth, & Maramba, 2005). Govrin (2015) pointed out a form of integration, which he called \\"integration by conversion\\", whereby theorists import into their own system of psychotherapy a foreign and quite alien concept, but they give the concept a new meaning that allows them to claim that the newly imported concept was really an integral part of their original system of psychotherapy, even if the imported concept significantly changes the original system. Govrin gave as two examples Heinz Kohut's novel emphasis on empathy in psychoanalysis in the 1970s and the novel emphasis on mindfulness and acceptance in \\"third-wave\\" cognitive behavioral therapy in the 1990s to 2000s. Other models that combine routes In addition to well-established approaches that fit into the five routes mentioned above, there are newer models that combine aspects of the traditional routes. Clara E. Hill's (2014) three-stage model of helping skills encourages counselors to emphasize skills from different theories during different stages of helping. Hill's model might be considered a combination of theoretical integration and technical eclecticism. The first stage is the exploration stage. This is based on client-centered therapy. The second stage is entitled insight. Interventions used in this stage are based on psychoanalytic therapy. The last stage, the action stage, is based on behavioral therapy. Good and Beitman (2006) described an integrative approach highlighting both core components of effective therapy and specific techniques designed to target clients' particular areas of concern. This approach can be described as an integration of common factors and technical eclecticism. Multitheoretical psychotherapy (Brooks-Harris, 2008) is an integrative model that combines elements of technical eclecticism and theoretical integration. Therapists are encouraged to make intentional choices about combining theories and intervention strategies. An approach called integral psychotherapy (Forman, 2010; Ingersoll & Zeitler, 2010) is grounded in the work of theoretical psychologist and philosopher Ken Wilber (2000), who integrates insights from contemplative and meditative traditions. Integral theory is a meta-theory that recognizes that reality can be organized from four major perspectives: subjective, intersubjective, objective, and interobjective. Various psychotherapies typically ground themselves in one these four foundational perspectives, often minimizing the others. Integral psychotherapy includes all four. For example, psychotherapeutic integration using this model would include subjective approaches (cognitive, existential), intersubjective approaches (interpersonal, object relations, multicultural), objective approaches (behavioral, pharmacological), and interobjective approaches (systems science). By understanding that each of these four basic perspectives all simultaneously co-occur, each can be seen as essential to a comprehensive view of the life of the client. Integral theory also includes a stage model that suggests that various psychotherapies seek to address issues arising from different stages of psychological development (Wilber, 2000). The generic term, integrative psychotherapy, can be used to describe any multi-modal approach which combines therapies. For example, an effective form of treatment for some clients is psychodynamic psychotherapy combined with hypnotherapy. Kraft & Kraft (2007) gave a detailed account of this treatment with a 54-year- old female client with refractory IBS in a setting of a phobic anxiety state. The client made a full recovery and this was maintained at the follow-up a year later. Comparison with eclecticism In Integrative and Eclectic Counselling and Psychotherapy (Woolfe & Palmer, 2000, pp. 55, 256), the authors make clear the distinction between integrative and eclectic psychotherapy approaches: \\"Integration suggests that the elements are part of one combined approach to theory and practice, as opposed to eclecticism which draws ad hoc from several approaches in the approach to a particular case.\\" Psychotherapy's eclectic practitioners are not bound by the theories, dogma, conventions or methodology of any one particular school. Instead, they may use what they believe or feel or experience tells them will work best, either in general or suiting the often immediate needs of individual clients; and working within their own preferences and capabilities as practitioners (Norcross & Goldfried, 2005, pp. 3‚Äì23).

The story is about a 10th-century Muslim Arab who travels with a group of Vikings to their settlement. Crichton explains in an appendix that the book was based on two sources. The first three chapters are a retelling of Ahmad ibn Fadlan's personal account of his actual journey north and his experiences with and observations of Varangians. The remainder is based upon the story of Beowulf. Plot summary The novel is set in the 10th century. The Caliph of Baghdad, Al-Muqtadir, sends his ambassador, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, on a mission to assist the king of the Volga Bulgars. Ahmad ibn Fadlan never arrives, as he is conscripted by a group of Vikings to take part in a hero's quest to the north; he is taken along as the thirteenth member of their group to comply with a soothsayer's requirement for success. In the north, the group battles with the 'mist-monsters', or 'wendol', a tribe of vicious savages (suggested by the narrator to have been possibly relict Neanderthals) who go to battle wearing bear skins. Eaters of the Dead is narrated as a scientific commentary on an old manuscript. The narrator describes the story as a composite of extant commentaries and translations of the original story teller's manuscript. The narration makes several references to a possible change or mistranslation of the original story by later copiers. The story is told by several different voices: the editor/narrator, the translators of the script, and the original author, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, who also relates stories told by others. A sense of authenticity is supported by occasional explanatory footnotes with references to a mixture of factual and fictitious sources. Sources and inspiration In the afterword, Crichton gives a few comments on the book's origin. A good friend of Crichton's was giving a lecture on the \\"Bores of Literature\\". Included in his lecture was an argument on Beowulf and why it was simply uninteresting. Crichton opined that the story was not a bore but was, in fact, a very interesting work. The argument escalated until Crichton stated that he would prove to him that the story could be interesting if presented in the correct way. \\"When he [Crichton] discovered that a friend was using Beowulf as a springboard for a new college course entitled, 'The Great Bores'‚Ä¶ Crichton pointed out that Beowulf contains all of the aspects of today's best action adventure stories. Subsequently, he set out on a mission to prove his point. In 1976, Crichton's answer, Eaters of the Dead, hit bookstore shelves.\\" Abdul Al·∏•a·∫ìred's Necronomicon (of H. P. Lovecraft fame) is mentioned in passing as a reference. Reception The critic from the New York Times called it \\"diverting but disappointing\\". The Chicago Tribune said it was \\"funny, fascinating and informative\\". Film adaptation In 1979, it was announced the movie version of the novel would be made by the newly formed Orion Pictures with Crichton as director. This did not occur. The novel was adapted into film as The 13th Warrior (1999), directed by John McTiernan and released by Walt Disney Pictures through its Touchstone Pictures banner. Crichton did some uncredited directing for a reshoot after Disney fired McTiernan for various reasons, one of which was going far over budget. Antonio Banderas played Ibn Fadlan. Crichton writes that he was \\"quite pleased\\" with the film, although it received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office, earning about $62 million worldwide; the film's budget was more than $100 million.Dirks, T. 2010.

Characteristics The maned rat's body can grow up to long, or from head to tail. The coat consists of long, silver and black-tipped guard hairs over a dense, woolly, grey and white undercoat, with the face and limbs having short, black fur. A mane of longer, coarser black-and-white banded hairs extends from the top of the animal's head to just beyond the base of the tail. This mane is bordered by a broad, white-bordered strip of hairs covering an area of glandular skin. The forelimbs and hind limbs have short black fur. The forefeet are large and digit 1 of the forefeet does not have a claw while digits 2-5 have a well developed claw.Jonathan Kingdon, David Happold, Thomas Butynski, Michael Hoffmann, Meredith Happold, Jan Kalina, , Mammals of Africa When the animal is threatened or excited, the mane erects and this strip parts, exposing the glandular area. The hairs in this area are, at the tips, like ordinary hair, but are otherwise spongy, fibrous, and absorbent. The rat is known to deliberately smear these hairs with poison from the bark of the Acokanthera schimperi, on which it chews, thus creating a defense mechanism that can sicken or even kill predators which attempt to bite it. L. imhausi differs from typical Muridae in having the temporal fossa roofed over a thin plate of bone, rudimentary clavicles, and an opposable hallux. The dorsal surface of the skull is covered with small bony projections which gives it a pebbled look. The projections are 0.3mm across and are separated every 0.3mm. On these grounds, it has been made the type of a family; its dentition, however, is typical Cricetine. The dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 0/0, 3/3, giving it a total of 16 teeth. The cusps of the molars are arranged biserially and connected medially by longitudinal enamel crests.Jonathan Kingdon, David Happold, Thomas Butynski, Michael Hoffmann, Meredith Happold, Jan Kalina, , Mammals of Africa Diet Its diet in the wild consists largely of leaves, fruit, and other plant material, but it has been known to eat meat, cereals, root vegetables, and insects in captivity. Food is eaten by sitting on its haunches and using its forepaws to bring food items to its mouth. It is the only species in the super family Muroidea whose stomach is highly compartmentalized. The stomach contains five anatomically discrete sections that superficially resemble the sacculated configuration characteristic of ruminant artiodactyls. By virtue of its large size and biomass, L. imhausi may be one of the few muroid rodents that can harbor a symbiotic microflora in the foregut and profit metabolically from gastric fermentation of cellulose.Jonathan Kingdon, David Happold, Thomas Butynski, Michael Hoffmann, Meredith Happold, Jan Kalina, , Mammals of Africa Habitat The habitat of the maned rat ranges from nearly sea level, in Ethiopia and Somalia, to more typically the drier, highland forests and woodlands of Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. Fossil remains have been found as far north as Israel, however. They are often found in rocky areas or in hollow tree trunks and holes along the tops of ravines, and have also been found nesting among rocks on cliff-faces. Reproduction Since the maned rat is a solitary creature, not much is known about the reproductive practices of the species. The litter size is 1‚Äì3. The young are slightly haired at birth and white markings and black stripes on the body are visible after 9 days. By day 13, the eyes open. The hair is sufficiently long that the crest can be erectile by day 20. The newborns become mobile by day 23 and are weaned by day 40.Jonathan Kingdon, , The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals Notes References * Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is of least concern *Jansa, S.

In 2016 it was set alight by ISIL and burned for seven days. Fires In June 2003, it was the site of the largest human-made release of sulfur dioxide ever recorded when a fire (thought to have been deliberately started) gained control and burned for about three weeks. At its height, the fire was putting 21,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a day into the atmosphere. The pollution in Mosul, which is about 45 kilometres from Mishraq, reached a catastrophic level. For over 48 hours the white smoke from sulfur dioxide could be seen in the air. Many people were taken into hospitals and most vegetation was killed. On 22 October 2016 the plant was set alight by ISIL militants as part of the Battle of Mosul. Two civilians died and nearly 1,000 people were treated for toxic gas inhalation. Shifting winds sent the gas to Qayyarah Airfield West, where U.S. and coalition forces were forced to use gas masks. The total mass of the released sulfur dioxide was estimated to approximately 161,000 tons distributed over seven days, equivalent to a small volcanic eruption.

Typically, two conventional bicycle frames are connected, by welding, brazing, or other means, one atop the other. The drive train is reconfigured to connect to the upper set of pedals, and the controls are moved to the upper handlebar area. Alternatively, a bicycle can be built by inverting the frame, and inserting the fork from the 'wrong side', flipping the rear wheel, and adding a long gooseneck and tall handlebars, then welding a long seatpost tube to the 'bottom' (now the top) of the frame. This type of tall bike is made with only one bike frame, and is often called an upside-down bike rather than a tall bike, though the seat can be quite high, depending on the frame shape used. This type can be somewhat safer, as there is less tubing between the rider's legs and dismounting in a hurry can be easily accomplished. Finally, a tall bike frame can be made from scratch.  Practical uses  A cyclist on a tall bike Tall bikes are usually used for recreation and entertainment, but can be used for general transportation also. Regular tall-bike commuters note that both their increased visibility and the simple 'wow factor' give them a safety advantage in automobile traffic over 'short bikes.'Chicago Magazine, July 2006, page 58Chicago Tribune, May 19, 2005, At Play section, page 1 However, there are issues with mounting and dismounting similar to those presented by penny-farthings.  History  A man on a tall bicycle in rural New Zealand, 1949 Historically, one of the first practical uses of the tall bike was as a late 19th-century lamp lighting system, by which a worker would mount a specialized tall bicycle while equipped with a torch for lighting gas lamps. As the worker rode to each lamp, they would lean against the lamp post, light the lamp, and then ride to the next. Upon completing the circuit of lamps, an assistant would help the rider dismount. The term 'lamplighter' is still sometimes used to refer to a very tall bicycle, for this reason.  Sporting  Tall bike jousting is a popular sport among tall bike owners, and is commonly considered to have been introduced by Jake Houle and Lil' Bob of the Hard Times/Black Label Bike Club.\\"Unstoppable\\". New York Times. April 29, 2007 Combatants arm themselves with lances and attempt to score points by dislodging the other rider. Rules vary by area and with the mood of the combatants. Like all jousting games, participants consider it a sport in which honor plays a role and dishonorable wins are frowned upon. Jousters create lances that vary from simple PVC pipe and foam devices that are flexible, soft, and relatively safe, up to wooden or metal lances that may be quite dangerous. Regional rules vary, some specifying flaming lances for effect, or glass containers attached to the end, the goal being to break the glass container in order to score points. A tall bike during the 10th Bourges' Critical Mass in 2018  Design considerations  Tall bikes present some interesting design considerations, and different localities tend to have different methods of dealing with them. One consistent issue is that the seat tends to end up in line with, or behind, the rear axle, which creates a powerful tendency to lift the front wheel of the bicycle on acceleration. Some bicycle builders simply accept this tendency, but others solve the problem by moving the seat post forward, lowering the handlebars, or by using a smaller wheel in front, typically a 24\\" instead of a 26\\". Stability can also be negatively affected, and enhancements such as extended wheelbase by welding extensions on the front and rear dropouts can benefit stability. Contest holders often place restrictions on such modification to prevent unfair advantages. See the bicycle and motorcycle geometry and bicycle and motorcycle dynamics articles for more on these issues. Clubs Tall bikes are a popular mode of transportation for such notable modern 'bicycle clubs' as Midnight Ridazz, SCUL, Zoobomb, Rat Patrol, Black Label Bicycle Club, The Winking Circle, C.h.u.n.k. 666, Cyclecide), and activist groups. They are also a mainstay among builders of clown bikes, art bikes, clown alleys and parade groups.

His novel Staying On won the Booker Prize for 1977. Early life Paul Scott was born in Palmers Green, in Southgate, London, growing up there and later in Middlesex, the younger of two sons. His father, Thomas (1870‚Äì1958), was a Yorkshireman who moved to London in the 1920s as a commercial artist specializing in furs and lingerie. His mother, Frances, n√©e Mark (1886‚Äì1969), the daughter of a labourer from south London, had artistic and social ambitions. In later life Scott differentiated between his mother‚Äôs creative drive and his father's down-to-earth practicality. He was educated at the private Winchmore Hill Collegiate School, but was forced to leave suddenly at the age of 14, without any qualifications, when his father's business met financial difficulties. He worked as an accounts clerk for C. T. Payne and took evening classes in book-keeping, but started writing poetry in his spare time. It was in this environment that he came to understand the rigid social divisions of suburban London, so that when he went to British India, he felt an instinctive familiarity with the interactions of caste and class in an imperial colony. Military service Scott was conscripted into the British Army as a private early in 1940 and assigned to the Intelligence Corps. He met and married his wife Penny (born Nancy Edith Avery in 1914) in Torquay in 1941. She also became a novelist. They had two daughters, Carol and Sally. In 1943 Scott was posted as an officer cadet to India, where he was commissioned. He ended the war as a captain in the Indian Army Service Corps, helping to organize the logistic support for the Fourteenth Army's reconquest of Burma, which had fallen to the Japanese in 1942. Despite being initially appalled by the attitudes of the British, by the heat and dust, by the disease and poverty and by the sheer numbers of people, he, like many others, fell deeply in love with India. Publishing After demobilisation in 1946, Scott was employed as an accountant for the two small publishing houses: Falcon Press and Grey Walls Press, headed by Conservative MP Peter Baker. Scott's two daughters, Carol and Sally, were born in 1947 and 1948. In 1950, Scott joined the literary agents Pearn, Pollinger & Higham (later to split into Pollinger Limited and David Higham Associates) and subsequently became a director. Whilst there, the authors he covered included Arthur C Clarke, Morris West, M. M. Kaye, Elizabeth David, Mervyn Peake and Muriel Spark. Writing career Scott published a collection of three religious poems entitled I, Gerontius in 1941, but his writing career began in earnest with his first novel Johnny Sahib in 1952. Despite 17 rejections from publishers, it met with modest success. He continued to work as a literary agent to support his family, but managed to publish regularly. The Alien Sky (US title, Six Days in Marapore) appeared in 1953, and was followed by A Male Child (1956), The Mark of the Warrior (1958), and The Chinese Love Pavilion (1960). He also wrote two radio plays for the BBC: Lines of Communication (1952) and Sahibs and Memsahibs (1958). All the novels were respectfully received. Sales were moderate, but Scott decided in 1960 to try becoming a full-time author. Scott's novels persistently draw on his experiences of India and service in the armed forces with strong subtexts of uneasy relationships between male friends or brothers; both the social privilege and the oppressive class and racial strata of the empire are represented, and novel by novel the canvas broadens. The Alien Sky remains the principal fictional exploration of a very light-skinned, mixed race, British- Indian woman who has married a white man by pretending to be white. A Male Child is set principally in London and deals with the domestic effects of losing a family member to imperial service. The Chinese Love Pavilion, after an Indian opening, is largely concerned with events in Malaya under Japanese occupation. These novels can be seen in retrospect as studies leading up to The Raj Quartet, one of whose minor characters is named in The Birds of Paradise (1962), but the lack of commercial impact forced Scott to broaden his range. His next two novels, The Bender (1963), a satirical comedy, and The Corrida at San Feliu (1964), comprising multiple linked texts and drawing extensively on family holidays in the Costa Brava, are a clear attempt to experiment with new forms and locales. Again, these were well received critically, but neither was especially successful either financially or artistically, and Scott decided that he had either to write the great novel of the Raj of which he believed himself capable, or return to salaried work. Scott flew to India in 1964 to see old friends, both Indian and Anglo-Indian, make new acquaintances in independent India, and refresh himself by confronting again the place that still obsessed him. Artistically he felt drained and a failure, feelings that were reinforced by financial straits and physical weakness. Since serving in India, Scott had been suffering from undiagnosed amoebic dysentery, which can seriously affect sufferers' mood as well as digestion, and had managed to handle it by consuming what his biographer, Hilary Spurling, describes as \\"alarming\\" quantities of alcohol. The condition was exacerbated by the visit to India, and on his return he had to undergo painful treatment, but afterwards felt better than he had for many years. In June 1964, Scott began to write The Jewel in the Crown, the first novel of what was to become The Raj Quartet. It was published in 1966 to minor and muted enthusiasm. The remaining novels in the sequence were published over the next nine years: The Day of the Scorpion (1968), The Towers of Silence (1971) and A Division of the Spoils (1974). Scott wrote in relative isolation and only visited India twice more during the genesis of The Raj Quartet, in 1968 and in 1971, latterly for the British Council. He worked in an upstairs room at his home in Hampstead overlooking the garden and Hampstead Garden Suburb woodland ‚Äì a far cry from the archetypal administrative province, between the Ganges and the foothills of the Himalaya, in which the novels were set. He supplemented his earnings from his books with reviews for The Times, the Times Literary Supplement, New Statesman and Country Life. The Jewel in the Crown engages with and rewrites E. M. Forster's A Passage to India (1924), and so is necessarily set in a small, Hindu-majority rural town with an army garrison, but the wider province is implicit, and the later novels spread out to the cold-weather capital on the plains, the hot-weather capital in the hills, a neighbouring Muslim-ruled princely state, and the railway lines that bind them together ‚Äì as well as Calcutta, Bombay, and the Burmese theatre of war. The cast also expands to include at least 24 principals, more than 300 named fictional characters, and a number of historical figures including Churchill, Gandhi, Jinnah, Wavell, and Slim. The story is initially that of the gang-rape of a young British woman in 1942, but follows the ripples of the event as they spread out through the relatives and friends of the victim, the child of the rape, those arrested for it but never charged and subsequently interned for political reasons, and the man who arrested them. It also charts events from the Quit India riots of August 1942 to the violence accompanying the Partition of India and creation of Pakistan in 1946‚Äì47, and so represents the collapse of imperial dominance, a process Scott describes in the early pages of The Day of the Scorpion as the time when \\"the British came to the end of themselves as they were.\\" Scott's wife Penny had supported him throughout the writing of The Raj Quartet, despite his heavy drinking and sometimes violent behaviour, but once it was complete she left him and filed for divorce. Forced to reassess his life and options he turned to teaching, and in 1976 and 1977 he was a visiting professor at the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma. His coda to The Raj Quartet, Staying On, was published in 1977, just before his second visit there. Soon after its publication and while he was in Tulsa, Scott was diagnosed with colon cancer. The novels of The Raj Quartet were, individually and collectively, received with little enthusiasm on first publication. Only The Towers of Silence and Staying On achieved some success with the award of the Yorkshire Post Fiction Award and the Booker Prize in 1971 and 1977 respectively. Scott was too ill to attend the Booker presentation in November 1977. He died at the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 1 March 1978. Scott stated, \\"For me, the British Raj is an extended metaphor [and] I don't think a writer chooses his metaphors. They choose him.\\" From his earliest experiences in North London, he felt himself an outsider in his own country. As his biographer comments, > Probably only an outsider could have commanded the long, lucid perspectives > he brought to bear on the end of the British raj, exploring with passionate, > concentrated attention a subject still generally treated as taboo, or fit > only for historical romance and adventure stories. However Scott saw things > other people would sooner not see, and he looked too close for comfort. His > was a bleak, stern, prophetic vision and, like E. M. Forster's, it has come > to seem steadily more accurate with time. The Jewel in the Crown has at its heart the confrontation between Hari Kumar, the young, English public-school educated Indian liberal and the grammar- school scholarship boy turned police superintendent Ronald Merrick. Merrick both hates and is attracted to Kumar and seeks to destroy him, after Daphne Manners, the English girl who is in love with Kumar and has been courted by Merrick, is raped. Critics have seen this conflict as one fundamentally influenced by Scott's own bisexuality,Spurling, Hilary, Paul Scott: A Life (London, Hutchinson, 1990). with Kumar representing everything young, bright, and forward-looking that had been brutally crushed in Scott's own youth. At the same time Merrick, probably a repressed homosexual, with authoritarian leanings and an arrogant sense of his own racial standing, is partly a self- portrait, in which Scott confronted his own and his compatriots' defensive impulse to racial and personal self-aggrandisement, and to moral and political pretence. The result is widely seen as a substantial and to date definitive fictional exploration of the underbelly of the Raj in India and of its workings. Adaptations In 1980, Granada Television filmed Staying On, with Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson as Tusker Smalley and his wife Lucy, famously advertised at the time as \\"Reunited for the first time since Brief Encounter\\". The success of its first showing in Britain in December 1980 encouraged Granada to embark on the much greater project of making The Raj Quartet into a major 14-part television series known as The Jewel in the Crown, first broadcast in the UK in early 1984 and subsequently in the US and many Commonwealth countries. It was rebroadcast in the UK in 1997 as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of Indian independence, and in 2001 the British Film Institute voted it 22nd in the all-time best British television programmes. It was also adapted as a nine-part BBC Radio 4 dramatisation under its original title in 2005. Correspondence While Scott was teaching creative writing at the University of Tulsa in 1976, he arranged to sell his private correspondence to that university's McFarlin Library, thus making available some 6000 personal letters. The materials begin in 1940, when Scott was enlisted in the British Army, and end only a few days before his death on 1 March 1978. In the David Higham Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin can be found Scott‚Äôs correspondence with clients Arthur C. Clarke, M. M. Kaye, Muriel Spark, children's author Mary Patchett, Peter Green, Morris West, Gabriel Fielding and John Braine. Notes References *V. R.

The Covenant had two basic parts: the Covenant itself, which was signed by men, and the Declaration, which was signed by women. In total, the Covenant was signed by 237,368 men; the Declaration, by 234,046 women. Both the Covenant and Declaration are held by the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI). An online searchable database is available on the PRONI website. Ulster Covenant: a staunch reaction to Devolution in the United Kingdom. In January 1913, the Ulster Volunteers aimed to recruit 100,000 men aged from 17 to 65 who had signed the Covenant as a unionist militia. A British Covenant, similar to the Ulster Covenant in opposition to the Home Rule Bill, received two million signatures in 1914. September 28 is today known as \\"Ulster Day\\" to unionists.  The Covenant (for men)  > BEING CONVINCED in our consciences that Home Rule would be disastrous to the > material well-being of Ulster as well as of the whole of Ireland, subversive > of our civil and religious freedom, destructive of our citizenship, and > perilous to the unity of the Empire, we, whose names are underwritten, men > of Ulster, loyal subjects of His Gracious Majesty King George V., humbly > relying on the God whom our fathers in days of stress and trial confidently > trusted, do hereby pledge ourselves in solemn Covenant, throughout this our > time of threatened calamity, to stand by one another in defending, for > ourselves and our children, our cherished position of equal citizenship in > the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to > defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland. > And in the event of such a Parliament being forced upon us, we further > solemnly and mutually pledge ourselves to refuse to recognise its authority. > In sure confidence that God will defend the right, we hereto subscribe our > names. > And further, we individually declare that we have not already signed this > Covenant.  The Declaration (for women)  > We, whose names are underwritten, women of Ulster, and loyal subjects of our > gracious King, being firmly persuaded that Home Rule would be disastrous to > our Country, desire to associate ourselves with the men of Ulster in their > uncompromising opposition to the Home Rule Bill now before Parliament, > whereby it is proposed to drive Ulster out of her cherished place in the > Constitution of the United Kingdom, and to place her under the domination > and control of a Parliament in Ireland. > Praying that from this calamity God will save Ireland, we hereto subscribe > our names. Demographics The majority of the signatories of the Covenant were from Ulster, although the signing was also attended by several thousand southern unionists, many of whom had travelled to Belfast by rail from Amiens Street Station in Dublin. Acknowledging this, Carson paid tribute to \\"my own fellow citizens from Dublin, from Wicklow, from Clare [and], yes, from Cork, rebel Cork, who are now holding the hand of Ulster\\", to cheers from the crowd. Robert James Stewart, a Presbyterian from Drum, County Monaghan, and the grandfather of Heather Humphreys, the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in the Republic of Ireland, was one of around 6,000 signatories in County Monaghan, where one quarter of the population was Protestant before the establishment of the Irish Free State. Almost 18,000 people signed either the Covenant or the Declaration in County Donegal.

However, this is disputed. Based on the results of a forensic test that he carried out in September 2012 at PRONI, Dr. Alastair Ruffell of The Queen's University of Belfast has asserted that he is 90% positive that the signature is not blood. Crawford's signature was injected with a small amount of luminol; this substance reacts with iron in blood's haemoglobin to produce a blue-white glow. The test is very sensitive and can detect tiny traces even in old samples. Crawford's signature is still a rich red colour today which would be unlikely if it had been blood. Nevertheless, some unionists are not convinced by the evidence. Solemn League and Covenant The term \\"Solemn League and Covenant\\" recalled a key historic document signed in 1643, by which the Scottish Covenanters made a political and military alliance with the leaders of the English Parliamentarians during the First English Civil War. Natal Covenant The Ulster Covenant was used as a template for the \\"Natal Covenant\\", signed in 1955 by 33,000 British-descended Natalians against the nationalist South African government's intention of declaring the Union a republic. It was signed in Durban's City Hall ‚Äì itself loosely based on Belfast's, so that the Ulster scene was almost exactly reproduced.

It had a well amidships. The well was filled with circulated external water, which kept fish alive until delivered to land and sold. It was a modified form of a fishing smack. History Between roughly 1775 and 1875, \\"well smack\\" referred to a 50-foot gaff cutter used in long-lining for cod, ling, turbot, and other bottom-living sea fish. These vessels were also known as cod boats. From roughly 1875 to 1920, they were extended to make 80-foot gaff ketches, sometimes by the cut-and-shut procedure. Some were built as new 80-foot welled smacks; some were turned into dry ships for use with ice. Structure and usage Gaff cutter rig These smacks were heavy-hulled with a draught of two fathoms. They were buoyant fore and aft, with the well contained amidships. Augur holes were drilled in the sides of the hull so that water could flow freely for re-oxygenation. Fish placed in the well could then be carried upriver to market (from 1750 especially Billingsgate, London; from 1900 the Faroes) in fresh condition. The swim bladders of the fish had to be pierced to prevent them from floating. Turbot and other flatfish were suspended on thin rope to prevent them from clogging the augur holes. Crews considered these ships safe and stable, according to Faroes crewmen who remembered sailing in them before 1920. By about 1854, the Thames was too polluted for use of welled smacks, and fishermen had to leave fish in floating cod boxes in the Thames estuary near Ipswich. Many fishermen moved out of Thames fishing ports such as Barking, and went to the east coast, especially to Grimsby and Lowestoft. Some cod boats, including some welled smacks, did continue to fish out of Barking until around 1900. However most continued to carry the Port of London port-registration LO. Until the 1870s, these smacks traveled from London to Iceland in summer, and returned via North Sea ports, including Holland. From the 1870s, those converted to dry ketches were used in fleeting in the North Sea, especially in the Silver Pits. From 1900 to 1920, the last welled smacks were sold to the Faroe Islands. The last welled smacks sank in the Faroes in about 1920. Marine archaeology and research Gaff ketch rig There is no way today of seeing or touching a UK welled smack, apart from the drawings, and a fuzzy, distant photo or two, in Edgar J. March's 1950 book. There is no known film, photo of the deck, marine wreck site, or souvenir. A welled smack should be easily identifiable at a wreck site from the unusually heavy hull-construction around the well. In the British Film Institute there may be one copy of a Faroese film of sou-westered fishermen on the rolling deck of a welled smack, pricking swim-bladders and placing the fish in the well‚Äîbut it is not available to researchers for confirmation. In New England, however, the Emma C. Berry survives.

The crash killed all 349 people on board both planes, making it the world's deadliest mid-air collision and the deadliest aviation accident to occur in India. Collision The Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) Boeing 747-168B, registration HZ-AIH, was flying the first leg of a scheduled international Delhi‚ÄìDhahran‚ÄìJeddah passenger service as Flight SVA763 with 312 people on board; the Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76TD, registration UN-76435, was on a charter service from Chimkent Airport to Delhi as KZA1907. SVA763 departed Delhi at 18:32 local time (13:02 UTC). KZA1907 was, at the same time, descending to land at Delhi. Both flights were controlled by approach controller VK Dutta. The crew of SVA763 consisted of Captain , First Officer Nazir Khan, and Flight Engineer Ahmed Edrees. The crew of KZA1907 consisted of Captain Alexander Cherepanov, First Officer Ermek Dzhangirov, Flight Engineer Alexander Chuprov, Navigator Zhahanbek Aripbaev, and Radio Operator Egor Repp. KZA1907 was cleared to descend to when it was from the beacon of the destination airport while SVA763, travelling on the same airway as KZA1907 but in the opposite direction, was cleared to climb to . About eight minutes later, around 18:40, KZA1907 reported having reached its assigned altitude of but it was actually lower, at , and still descending. At this time, Dutta advised the flight, \\"Identified traffic 12 o'clock, reciprocal Saudia Boeing 747, . Report in sight.\\" When the controller called KZA1907 again, he received no reply. He warned of the other flight's distance, but it was too late. The two aircraft had collided, the tail of KZA1907 cutting through SVA763's left wing and horizontal stabiliser. The crippled Boeing quickly lost control and went into a rapidly descending spiral with fire trailing from the wing. The Boeing broke up before crashing into the ground at a nearly supersonic speed of . The Ilyushin remained structurally intact as it entered a steady but rapid and uncontrolled descent until it crashed in a field. Rescuers discovered four critically injured passengers from the Ilyushin, but they all died soon afterwards. Two passengers from the Saudia flight survived the crash, still strapped to their seats, only to die of internal injuries soon after. In the end, all 312 people on board SVA763 and all 37 people on KZA1907 were killed. Captain Timothy J. Place, a pilot for the United States Air Force, was the sole eyewitness to the event. He was making an initial approach in a Lockheed C-141B Starlifter when he saw that \\"a large cloud lit up with an orange glow\\". The collision took place about west of Delhi. The wreckage of the Saudi aircraft crashed near Dhani village, Bhiwani District, Haryana. The wreckage of the Kazakh aircraft hit the ground near Birohar village, Rohtak District, Haryana. Passengers and crew Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 763 The captain of the flight was a 45-year old veteran pilot with more than 9,800 flying hours. An article published in The New York Times on 14 November 1996 stated that 215 Indians who boarded the flight worked in Saudi Arabia; many of them worked or planned to work in blue-collar jobs as house maids, drivers, and cooks. The article also stated that 40 Nepalis and three Americans boarded the Saudi flight. According to an article published a day earlier in the same newspaper, the passenger manifest included 17 people of other nationalities, including nine Nepalis, three Pakistanis, two Americans, one Bangladeshi, one Briton, and one Saudi. Twelve of the crew members, including five anti- terrorism officials, were Saudi citizens. Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907 The captain of Flight 1907, aged 44, was also highly experienced, with more than 9,200 flight hours. A company from Kyrgyzstan chartered the flight, and the passenger manifest mostly included ethnic Russian Kyrgyz citizens planning to go shopping in India. Thirteen Kyrgyz traders boarded the flight. Investigation and final report The crash was investigated by the Lahoti Commission, headed by then-Delhi High Court judge Ramesh Chandra Lahoti. Depositions were taken from the Air Traffic Controllers Guild and the two airlines. The flight data recorders were decoded by Kazakhstan Airlines and Saudia under the supervision of air crash investigators in Moscow and Farnborough, England, respectively. The ultimate cause was held to be the failure of Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907's pilot to follow ATC instructions, whether due to cloud turbulence or due to communication problems. The commission determined that the accident had been the fault of the Kazakhstani Il-76 commander, who (according to FDR evidence) had descended from the assigned altitude of and subsequently and even lower. The report ascribed the cause of this serious breach in operating procedure to the lack of English language skills on the part of the Kazakhstani aircraft pilots; they were relying entirely on their radio operator for communications with the ATC. The radio operator did not have his own flight instrumentation and had to look over the pilots' shoulders for a reading. Kazakhstani officials stated that the aircraft had descended while their pilots were fighting turbulence inside a bank of cumulus clouds. Indian air controllers also complained that the Kazakhstani pilots sometimes confused their calculations because they are accustomed to using metre altitudes and kilometre distances, while most other countries use feet and nautical miles respectively for aerial navigation. Just a few seconds from impact, the Kazakhstani plane climbed slightly and the two planes collided. This was because the radio operator of Kazakhstan 1907 discovered only then that they were not at 15,000 feet and asked the pilot to climb. The captain gave orders for full throttle, and the plane climbed, only to hit the oncoming Saudi Arabian plane. The tail of the Kazakhstani plane clipped the left wing of the Saudi Arabian jet, severing both parts from their respective planes. Had the Kazakhstani pilots not climbed slightly, it is likely that they would have passed under the Saudi Arabian plane. The recorder of the Saudi Arabian plane revealed the pilots recited the prayer that is required, according to Islamic law, when one faces death. The counsel for the ATC Guild denied the presence of turbulence, quoting meteorological reports, but did state that the collision occurred inside a cloud. This was substantiated by the affidavit of Capt. Place, who was the commander of the aforementioned Lockheed C-141B Starlifter, which was flying into New Delhi at the time of the crash. The members of his crew filed similar affidavits. Furthermore, Indira Gandhi International Airport did not have secondary surveillance radar, which provides extra information, such as the aircraft's identity and altitude, by reading transponder signals; instead the airport had primary radar, which produces readings of distance and bearing, but not altitude. In addition, the civilian airspace around New Delhi had one corridor for departures and arrivals. Most areas separate departures and arrivals into separate corridors. The airspace had one civilian corridor because much of the airspace was taken by the Indian Air Force. Due to the crash, the air-crash investigation report recommended changes to air-traffic procedures and infrastructure in New Delhi's air-space: * Separation of inbound and outbound aircraft through the creation of 'air corridors' * Installation of a secondary air-traffic control radar for aircraft altitude data * Mandatory collision avoidance equipment on commercial aircraft operating in Indian airspace * Reduction of the airspace over New Delhi that was formerly under exclusive control of the Indian Air Force Aftermath The Directorate General of Civil Aviation subsequently made it mandatory for all aircraft flying in and out of India to be equipped with an airborne collision avoidance system. This set a worldwide precedent for mandatory use of Traffic Collision Avoidance System. Documentaries Miditech, a company based in Gurgaon, Haryana, produced a documentary about the disaster called Head On!, which aired on the National Geographic Channel. The disaster was also the subject of an episode in the documentary series Mayday (Air Crash Investigation) on 11 November 2009 entitled \\"Sight Unseen\\", also shown on the National Geographic Channel.

Originally started by Richard Haworth, from issue 2 it was part-edited and produced by Richard Griffin and Richard H with regular contributions from Jah P. The fanzine took a major interest in the Berkshire and Oxfordshire punk and post punk scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s and covered punk, Oi! post punk and Reggae. Many interviews were conducted by mailing a cassette and list of questions, which elicited interesting discussions between band members without the problem of an interviewer butting in (see also cassette culture). Bands interviewed ranged from The Jam and Stiff Little Fingers to The Raincoats, VIPs, Patrick Fitzgerald, LKJ and The Instant Automatons. The photographer Pennie Smith was also interviewed. A thousand copies of No Cure were sold each issue through record shops in Reading (Quicksliver), Windsor (Revolution) and London including Rough Trade and mail order. At one point it was the largest selling UK zine in New York City. As with most fanzines, production techniques were rudimentary. Text was produced using a portable typewriter, pens (most issues had a crossword) and images cut from magazines and elsewhere, along with some original photography by Richard H. Text was glued onto boards and sent to the printers. In total seven issues were produced. Richard G later teamed up with Chris Green producing two issues of Bits fanzine and X Cassettes which released music from local bands like Quality Drivel, as well as groups from further afield. They were also involved in the promotion and distribution of a Reading area compilation LP Beyond the River released by Open Door records and featuring local bands such as Dig Dig Dig, El Seven, The Ballistics, The Erection Set, St Vitus Dance, Movita, Shrinking Men, A1 Vegetables, The Beating Hearts, Access and The Stills. A single was released by Oxfordshire band Dig Dig Dig. Richard G was also involved with Mike D of Toxic Graffiti (sic) fanzine in establishing the short lived UK Fanzine Collective.

It ran from 1978 to 2006, and after initially appearing monthly, was issued fortnightly during most of that time. The name survived as a brand for a spin-off digital television channel, now named Box Hits, and website. A digital radio station was also available but closed on 5 August 2013.  Overview  Smash Hits featured the lyrics of latest hits and interviews with big names in music. It was initially published monthly, then went fortnightly. The style of the magazine was initially serious, but from around the mid-1980s onwards became one of ever-increasing irreverence. Its interviewing technique was novel at the time and, rather than looking up to the big names, it often made fun of them, asking strange questions rather than talking about their music. Created by journalist Nick Logan, the title was launched in 1978 and appeared monthly for its first few months. He based the idea on a songwords magazine that his sister used to buy, but which was of poor quality. His idea being to launch a glossy-looking magazine which also contained songwords as its mainstay. The publisher was Emap, which was a small-time publisher based in Peterborough and the magazine was originally titled Disco Fever, before they settled on Smash Hits. Smash Hits launched the career of many journalists including Radio Times editor Mark Frith. Other well-known writers have included Dave Rimmer, Mark Ellen (who went on to launch Q, Mojo and Word), Steve Beebee, Chris Heath, Tom Hibbert and Miranda Sawyer. Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys also worked as a writer and assistant editor, and once claimed that had he not become a pop star, he would likely have pursued his ambition to become editor. The magazine was also available in Continental Europe, especially in Germany where the issues could be bought at railway stations or airports, whilst the title was licensed for a French version in the 1990s. There were other licensed versions in the magazine's history. In 1984, an Australian version was created and proved just as successful for that new market as the original had back in Britain, whilst in the United States, a version was published during the 1980s under the title Star Hits, drawing articles from the British version. It was published by Emap, who also use the name for one of their digital television services, and for a digital radio station. The brand also covered the annual Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, an awards ceremony voted for by readers of the magazine. The magazine's sales peaked during the late 1980s. In the early part of the decade it was regularly selling 500,000 copies per issue, which had risen to over one million by 1989. Sales began to drop during the 1990s and by 1996 it was reported that sales were dropping roughly 100,000 per year. By the time of its demise, it was down to 120,000. Final years of publishing In the 1990s, the magazine's circulation slumped and it was overtaken by the BBC's spin off magazine Top of the Pops. Emap's other biweekly teen magazine of the period Big! (which featured more celebrities and stars of TV series including Australians based Home and Away and United States imported Beverly Hills, 90210) was closed and this celeb focus was shifted over to Smash Hits, which became less focused on teen pop and more of an entertainment magazine. The magazine also shifted size a number of times in subsequent relaunches including one format that was as big as an album with songwords to be clipped out on the card cover. Television presenter and journalist Kate Thornton was editor for a short time. In February 2006, it was announced that the magazine would cease publication after the February 13 edition due to declining sales. In July 2009, a one-off commemorative issue of the magazine was published as a tribute to singer Michael Jackson.Smash Hits resurrected for Jackson, Yahoo News, Retrieved 4 July 2009 Further one-off specials were released in November 2009 (Take That), December 2010 (Lady Gaga)Smash Hits returns for GaGa special Music Week. and November 2019 (Max Martin), the latter was a free magazine at certain London Underground stations to mark the debut of Martin's West End musical & Juliet.

It is also used to refer to the percentage of former prisoners who are rearrested for a similar offense.Henslin, James. Social Problems: A Down-To-Earth Approach, 2008. The term is frequently used in conjunction with criminal behavior and substance abuse. (Recidivism is a synonym for \\"relapse\\", which is more commonly used in medicine and in the disease model of addiction.) United States According to the latest study by the US Department of Justice, recidivism measures require three characteristics: 1\\\\. a starting event, such as a release from prison 2\\\\. a measure of failure following the starting event, such as a subsequent arrest, conviction, or return to prison 3\\\\. an observation or follow-up period that generally extends from the date of the starting event to a predefined end date as in 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, or 9 years). The latest [Government study of recidivism] reported that 83% of state prisoners were arrested at some point in the 9 years following their release. A large majority of those were arrested within the first 3 years, and more than 50% get rearrested within the first year. However, the longer the time period, the higher the reported recidivism rate, but the lower the actual threat to public safety. According to an April 2011 report by the Pew Center on the States, the average national recidivism rate for released prisoners is 43%.Public Safety Performance Project, State of Recidivism: The Revolving Door of America‚Äôs Prisons, The Pew Center on the States (April 2011), . According to the National Institute of Justice, almost 44 percent of the recently released return before the end of their first year out. About 68 percent of 405,000 prisoners released in 30 states in 2005 were arrested for a new crime within three years of their release from prison, and 77 percent were arrested within five years, and by year nine that number reaches 83 percent. Beginning in the 1990s, the US rate of incarceration increased dramatically, filling prisons to capacity in bad conditions for inmates. Crime continues inside many prison walls. Gangs exist on the inside, often with tactical decisions made by imprisoned leaders.Visher, Christy A. 2003. \\"Transitions From Prison To Community: Understanding Individual Pathways\\". The Urban Institute, Justice Policy Center, Washington, District of Columbia. While the US justice system has traditionally focused its efforts at the front end of the system, by locking people up, it has not exerted an equal effort at the tail end of the system: decreasing the likelihood of reoffending among formerly incarcerated persons. This is a significant issue because ninety-five percent of prisoners will be released back into the community at some point.Hughes, T. & D .J. Wilson. \\"Reentry Trends in the United States , Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance, 2002. A cost study performed by the Vera Institute of Justice, a non-profit committed to decarceration in the United States, found that the average per-inmate cost of incarceration among the 40 states surveyed was $31,286 per year.Henrichson, C. & Delaney, R. ‚ÄúThe Price of Prisons‚Äù. Vera Institute of Justice. 2012. Educational programming costs significantly less and is proven to decrease the rate of recidivism. While there is an up front cost associated with paying for prison based education, there is a larger cost avoidance by reducing the likelihood the offender will return to incarceration. According to a national study published in 2003 by The Urban Institute, within three years almost 7 out of 10 released males will be rearrested and half will be back in prison. The study says this happens due to personal and situation characteristics, including the individual's social environment of peers, family, community, and state-level policies. There are many other factors in recidivism, such as the individual's circumstances before incarceration, events during their incarceration, and the period after they are released from prison, both immediate and long term. One of the main reasons why they find themselves back in jail is because it is difficult for the individual to fit back in with ‚Äònormal‚Äô life. They have to reestablish ties with their family, return to high-risk places and secure formal identification; they often have a poor work history and now have a criminal record to deal with. Many prisoners report being anxious about their release; they are excited about how their life will be different ‚Äúthis time‚Äù which does not always end up being the case. Stakeholders At the most direct and personal level, those who have the greatest stake in recidivism are: the formerly incarcerated person; their family (especially children); the victim of the crime for which they were re- incarcerated (if there was one); and those employed by the justice system (from police, to parole officers, to jail guards, to those who build and profit from prisons, etc.). More broadly, however, recidivism affects everyone. Crime is a problem in every community (though some more so than others) and anyone can be a victim. Victimization can take many forms‚Äîfrom being directly injured in a violent crime, to being robbed, to having your sense of safety violated as result of living in an area where crime exists. Furthermore, all taxpayers are greatly impacted by the economic costs of crime. Drug-related crime Of US federal inmates in 2010, about half (51%) were serving time for drug offenses and many others likely committed crimes under the influence of one or more drugs, over drug-related disputes (turf battles, etc.), or in order to obtain money to buy drugs‚Äîfactors which were not necessarily cited in their charges. It is estimated that three quarters of those returning to prison have a history of substance abuse. Over 70 percent of prisoners with serious mental illnesses also have a substance use disorder. Nevertheless, only 7 to 17 percent of prisoners meet DSM criteria for alcohol/drug dependence or abuse receive treatment. Those involved in the criminal justice system have rates of substance abuse and dependence that are more than four times higher than the general population and fewer than 20 percent of federal and state prisoners who meet the criteria receive treatment. Effectiveness studies have shown that inmates who participate in residential treatment programs while incarcerated have 9 to 18 percent lower recidivism rates and 15 to 35 percent lower drug relapse rates than their counterparts who receive no treatment in prison. Furthermore, inmates who receive aftercare (treatment after imprisonment) have an even greater chance of not recidivating. When combined with treatment that was given during incarceration aftercare can be a very useful tool in recidivism reduction. Some offenders have had a reduced risk of recidivism of up to eighty percent after undergoing aftercare treatment. Recidivism rates Norway has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world at 20%. Prisons in Norway and the Norwegian criminal justice system focus on restorative justice and rehabilitating prisoners rather than punishment. As reported on BBC Radio 4 on Monday, 2 September 2005, the recidivism rates for released prisoners in the United States of America is 60% compared with 50% in the United Kingdom. The report attributed the lower recidivism rate in the UK to a focus on rehabilitation and education of prisoners compared with the US focus on punishment, deterrence and marginalizing suspects. The United States Department of Justice tracked the re-arrest, re-conviction, and re- incarceration of former inmates for 3 years after their release from prisons in 15 states in 1994. Key findings include: > * Released prisoners with the highest rearrest rates were robbers (70.2%), > burglars (74.0%), larcenists (74.6%), motor vehicle thieves (78.8%), those > in prison for possessing or selling stolen property (77.4%) and those in > prison for possessing, using or selling illegal weapons (70.2%). * Within 3 > years, 2.5% of released rapists were arrested for another rape, and 1.2% of > those who had served time for homicide were arrested for homicide. These are > the lowest rates of re-arrest for the same category of crime. * The 272,111 > offenders discharged in 1994 had accumulated 4.1 million arrest charges > before their most recent imprisonment and another 744,000 charges within 3 > years of release. The Prison Policy Initiative analyzed the recidivism rates associated with various initial offenses and found that statistically, \\"people convicted of any violent offense are less likely to be re-arrested in the years after release than those convicted of property, drug, or public order offenses.\\" Former criminals rose to become some of America's greatest leaders in law, industry and politics. This possibility seems to be narrowing as criminal records become electronically stored and accessible. An accused's history of convictions are called antecedents, known colloquially as \\"previous\\" or \\"form\\" in the UK and \\"priors\\" in the United States and Australia. There are organisations that help with the re-integration of ex-detainees into society by helping them obtain work, teaching them various societal skills, and by providing all-around support. One organization that works on meeting inmates at their point of entry (in jail) is JUST of DuPage in IL. Another organization that is currently based in New York City is the Exodus Transitional Community. In an effort to be more fair and to avoid adding to already high imprisonment rates in the US, courts across America have started using quantitative risk assessment software when trying to make decisions about releasing people on bail and sentencing, which are based on their history and other attributes. It analyzed recidivism risk scores calculated by one of the most commonly used tools, the Northpointe COMPAS system, and looked at outcomes over two years, and found that only 61% of those deemed high risk actually committed additional crimes during that period and that African- American defendants were far more likely to be given high scores than white defendants. The TRACER Act is intended to monitor released terrorists to prevent recidivism. Nevertheless, rates of re-offending for political crimes are much less than for non-political crimes. African Americans and recidivism With regard to the United States incarceration rate, African Americans represent only about 13 percent of the United States population, yet account for approximately half the prison population as well as ex-offenders once released from prison. As compared to whites, African Americans are incarcerated 6.4 times higher for violent offenses, 4.4 times higher for property offenses and 9.4 times higher for drug offenses.Hartney, C. and Vuong, L. \\"Created Equal: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the US Criminal Justice System\\" (2009). African Americans comprise a majority of the prison reentry population, yet few studies have been aimed at studying recidivism among this population. Recidivism is highest amongst those under the age of 18 who are male and African American, and African Americans have significantly higher levels of recidivism as compared to whites. The sheer number of ex- inmates exiting prison into the community is significant, however, chances of recidivism are low for those who avoid contact with the law for at least three years after release. What communities African American ex-inmates are released into plays a part in their likelihood to re-offend; communities that have high racial inequality increase the risk of African American recidivism as they are denied equal access to \\"employers, health care services, and other institutions that can facilitate a law-abiding reentry into society\\". Employment can also reduce recidivism; however, for African American ex- inmates, finding employment, which can be difficult prior to incarceration, becomes increasingly so after incarceration. Employment and recidivism Most research regarding recidivism indicates that those ex-inmates that obtain employment after release from prison tend to have lower rates of recidivism. In one study, it was found that even if marginal employment, especially for ex-inmates over the age of 26, is offered to ex-inmates, those ex-inmates are less likely to commit crime than their counterparts. Another study found that ex-inmates were less likely to re-offend if they found and maintained stable employment throughout their first year of parole. Although research is clear that obtaining employment can reduce recidivism, one must closely examine the ability of ex-inmates to obtain employment once released from prison. African Americans are disproportionately represented in the American prison system, representing approximately half the prison population. Of this population, many enter into the prison system with less than a high school diploma.Freeman, Richard B. \\"Can we close the revolving door?: Recidivism vs. employment of ex-offenders in the US.\\" (2003). The lack of education makes ex- inmates qualify for low-skill, low-wage employment. In addition to lack of education, many inmates report a difficulty in finding employment prior to incarceration. If an ex-inmate served a long prison sentence, they have lost an opportunity to gain work experience or network with potential job employers. Because of this, employers and agencies that assist with employment believe that ex-inmates cannot obtain or maintain employment. Furthermore, some employers are not able, or willing, to hire ex-inmates due to their criminal histories. For African American ex-inmates, their race is an added barrier to obtaining employment after release. According to one study, African Americans are more likely to re-offend because employment opportunities are not as available in the communities they return to in relation to whites. Education and Recidivism Education has been shown to reduce recidivism rates. When inmates use educational programs while within incarceration they are roughly 43% less likely to recidivate than those who received no education while incarcerated.Department of Justice, \\"Justice and Education Departments Announce New Research Showing Prison Education Reduces Recidivism, Saves Money, Improves Employment\\" , \\"Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs\\", August 22, 2013 Inmates, in regards to partaking in educational programs, can improve cognitive ability, work skills as well as being able to further their education upon release. Maryland, Minnesota and Ohio were involved in a study pertaining to education and recidivism. The study found that when the participant group of released offenders took educational classes while within the confines of prison, they had lower rates of recidivism as well as higher rates of employment.Steurer, Stephen J. and Linda G. Smith, \\"Education Reduces Crime, Three-State Recidivism Study\\", \\"MTC Institute and The Correctional Education Institute\\", February 2003 Moreover, the higher the inmates educational level the lower their odds of recidivating becomes. If an inmate attains a certificate of vocation their rate of recidivism reduces by 14.6%, if they attain a GED their rate of recidivism reduces by 25%, or if they attain an Associates in Arts or Associates in Science their rate of recidivism is reduced by 70%.Nevada Department of Corrections, \\"Education Services Newsletter\\" , \\"NDOC\\", Winter 2009 Tax payers are adversely affected as their tax money goes into the prison system instead of other places of society.\\"The High Budgetary Cost of Incarceration\\" , \\"Center for Economic and Policy Research\\", 2010 Educating inmates is also cost effective. When investing in education, it could drastically reduce incarceration costs. For a one dollar investment in educational programs, there would be a reduction of costs of incarceration by nearly five dollars. Education reduces recidivism rates which can reduce cost of incarceration as well as reduce the number of people who commit crime within the community. Reducing recidivism among African Americans A cultural re-grounding of African Americans is important to improve self-esteem and help develop a sense of community. Compare: Culturally specific programs and services that focus on characteristics that include the target population values, beliefs, and styles of problem solving may be beneficial in reducing recidivism among African American inmates; programs involving social skills training and social problem solving could also be effective. For example, research shows that treatment effectiveness should include cognitive-behavioral and social learning techniques of modeling, role playing, reinforcement, extinction, resource provision, concrete verbal suggestions (symbolic modeling, giving reasons, prompting) and cognitive restructuring; the effectiveness of the intervention incorporates a relapse prevention element. Relapse prevention is a cognitive- behavioral approach to self-management that focuses on teaching alternate responses to high-risk situations. Research also shows that restorative justice approaches to rehabilitation and reentry coupled with the therapeutic benefits of working with plants, say through urban agriculture, lead to psychosocial healing and reintegration into one's former community. Several theories suggest that access to low-skill employment among parolees is likely to have favorable outcomes, at least over the short term, by strengthening internal and external social controls that constrain behavior toward legal employment. Any legal employment upon release from prison may help to tip the balance of economic choice toward not needing to engage in criminal activity. Employment as a turning point enhances attachment and commitment to mainstream individuals and pursuits. From that perspective, ex-inmates are constrained from criminal acts because they are more likely to weigh the risk of severing social ties prior to engaging in illegal behavior and opt to refuse to engage in criminal activity. In 2015, a bipartisan effort, headed by Koch family foundations and the ACLU, reforms to reduce recidivism rates among low-income minority communities were announced with major support across political ideologies. President Obama has praised these efforts who noted the unity will lead to an improved situation of the prison system. There is greater indication that education in prison helps prevent reincarceration. Studies There have been hundreds of studies on the relationship between correctional interventions and recidivism. These studies show that a reliance on only supervision and punitive sanctions can actually increase the likelihood of someone reoffending, while well-implemented prison and reentry programs can substantially reduce recidivism. Counties, states, and the federal government will often commission studies on trends in recidivism, in addition to research on the impacts of their programming. Massachusetts In a study conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Correction in the year 2011, prisoners having drug related arrests were monitored after their release. Furthermore, the recidivism rates of former prisoners that entered the Massachusetts Department of Correction Correctional Recovery Academy program upon release would be compared with the recidivism rates of prisoners who did not enter the program. The Correctional Recovery Academy program is a six-month substance abuse treatment program. The studies findings were that those who completed the program had a 46.9% recidivism rate after 3 years, while those who did not use the program had a 52.9% recidivism rate. Minnesota The Minnesota Department of Corrections did a study on criminals who are in prison to see if rehabilitation during incarceration correlates with recidivism and/or saved the state money. They used the Minnesota's Challenge Incarceration Program (CIP) which consisted of three phases. The first was a six-month institutional phase followed by two aftercare phases, each lasting at least six months, for a total of about eighteen months. The first phase was the ‚Äúboot camp‚Äù phase. Here, inmates had daily schedules sixteen hours long where they participated in activities and showed discipline. Some activities in phase one included physical training, manual labor, skills training, drug therapy, and transition planning. The second and third phases were called ‚Äúcommunity phases.‚Äù In phase two the participants are on intensive supervised release (ISR). ISR includes being in contact with your supervisor on a daily basis, being a full-time employee, keeping curfew, passing random drug and alcohol tests, and doing community service while continuing to participate completely in the program. The final phase is phase three. During this phase one is still on ISR and has to remain in the community while maintaining a full-time job. They have to continue with community service and their participation in the program. Once phase three is complete participants have ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù CIP. They are then put on supervision until the end of their sentence. Inmates who drop out or fail to complete the program are sent back to prison to serve the rest of their sentence. Information was gathered through a quasi experimental design. This compared the recidivism rates of the CIP participants with a control group. The findings of the study have shown that the CIP program did not significantly reduce the chances of recidivism. However, CIP did increase the amount of time before rearrest. Moreover, CIP early release graduates lower the costs for the state by millions every year.Duwe, G., & Kerschner, D. 2008. \\"Removing a Nail From the Coffin.\\" Crime & Delinquency, 54. Kentucky A study was done by Robert Stanz in Jefferson County, Kentucky which discussed an alternative to jail time. The alternative was \\"home incarceration\\" in which the defendant would complete his or her time at home instead of in jail. According to the study: \\"Results show that the majority of offenders do successfully complete the program, but that a majority are also re-arrested within 5 years of completion.\\" In doing this, they added to the rate of recidivism.In doing a study on the results of this program, Stanz considered age, race, neighborhood, and several other aspects. Most of the defendants who fell under the recidivism category included those who were younger, those who were sentenced for multiple charges, those accruing fewer technical violations, males, and those of African-American descent. In contrast, a study published by the African Journal of Criminology and Justice Studies in 2005 used data from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections to examine 2,810 juvenile offenders who were released in the 1999/2000 fiscal year. The study built a socio-demographic of the offenders who were returned to the correctional system within a year of release. There was no significant difference between black offenders and white offenders. The study concluded that race does not play an important role in juvenile recidivism. The findings ran counter to conventional beliefs on the subject, which may not have controlled for other variables. Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) A study was conducted regarding the recidivism rate of inmates receiving MMT (Methadone Maintenance Therapy). This therapy is intended to wean heroin users from the drug by administering small doses of methadone, thereby avoiding withdrawal symptoms. 589 inmates who took part in MMT programs between November 22, 2005 and October 31, 2006 were observed after their release. Among these former inmates, \\"there was no statistically significant effect of receiving methadone in the jail or dosage on subsequent recidivism risks‚Äù.McMillan, Garnett P, 2008, \\"The effect of a jail methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) program on inmate recidivism\\", Addiction, 103:2017‚Äì23. =United States, nationwide= Male prisoners are exposed and subject to sexual and physical violence in prisons. When these events occur, the victim usually suffers emotionally and/or physically. Studies suggest that this leads the inmate to accept these types of behaviors and value their lives and the lives of others less when they are released. These dehumanizing acts, combined with learned violent behavior, are implicated in higher recidivism rates.Bailey, Kristen. \\"The Causes of Recidivism in the Criminal Justice System and Why It Is Worth the Cost to Address Them\\", Nashville Bar Journal, Dec 06/Jan 07, 21 April 2009. Two studies were done to attempt to provide a ‚Äúnational‚Äù recidivism rate for the US. One was done in 1983 which included 108,580 state prisoners from 11 different states. The other study was done in 1994 on 272,111 prisoners from 15 states. Both studies represent two-thirds of the overall prisoners released in their corresponding years. An image developed by Matt Kelley indicates the percent of parolees returning to prison in each state in 2006. According to this image, in 2006, there was more recidivism in the southern states, particularly in the Midwestern region. However, for the majority, the data is spread out throughout the regions. =Rikers Island, New York, New York= The recidivism rate in the New York City jail system is as high as 65%. The jail at Rikers Island, in New York, is making efforts to reduce this statistic by teaching horticulture to its inmates. It is shown that the inmates that go through this type of rehabilitation have significantly lower rates of recidivism.Jiler, James. \\"Doing Time in the Garden: Life Lessons Through Prison Horticulture.\\" New Village Press. 2006. (April 21, 2009). = Arizona and Nevada= A study by the University of Nevada, Reno on recidivism rates across the United States showed that, at only 24.6 percent, Arizona has the lowest rate of recidivism among offenders compared to all other US states. Nevada has one of the lowest rates of recidivism among offenders at only 29.2 percent. =California= The recidivism rate in California as of 2008-2009 is 61%.California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, \\"2013 Outcome Evaluation\\" , \\"California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Office of Research\\", January 2014 Recidivism has reduced slightly in California from the years of 2002 to 2009 by 5.2%. However, California still has one of the highest recidivism rates in the nation. This high recidivism rate contributes greatly to the overcrowding of jails and prisons in California. =Connecticut= A study conducted in Connecticut followed 16,486 prisoners for a three-year period to see how many of them would end up going back to jail. Results from the study found that about 37% of offenders were rearrested for a new crime and sent to prison again within the first three years they were released. Of the 16,486 prisoners, about 56% of them were convicted of a new crime. =Florida= In 2001, the Florida Department of Corrections created a graph showing the general recidivism rate of all offenders released from prison from July 1993 until six and a half years later. This graph shows that recidivism is much more likely within the first six months after they are released. The longer the offenders stayed out of prison, the less likely they were to return. Causes A 2011 study found that harsh prison conditions, including isolation, tended to increase recidivism, though none of these effects were statistically significant. Various researchers have noted that prisoners are stripped of civil rights and are reluctantly absorbed into communities - which further increases their alienation and isolation. Other contributors to recidivism include the difficulties released offenders face in finding jobs, in renting apartments or in getting education. Owners of businesses will often refuse to hire a convicted felon and are at best hesitant, especially when filling any position that entails even minor responsibility or the handling of money (note that this includes most work), especially to those convicted of thievery, such as larceny, or to drug addicts. Many leasing corporations (those organisations and/or people who own and rent apartments) routinely perform criminal background checks and disqualify ex-convicts. (However, especially in the inner city or in areas with high crime rates, lessors may not always apply their official policies in this regard. When they do, apartments may be rented by someone other than the occupant.) People with criminal records report difficulty or inability to find educational opportunities, and are often denied financial aid based on their records. In the United States of America, those found guilty of even a minor misdemeanor (in some states, a citation offense, such as a traffic ticket) or misdemeanour drug offence (e.g. possession of marijuana or heroin) while receiving Federal student aid are disqualified from receiving further aid for a specified period of time. Policies addressing recidivism  Countless policies aim to ameliorate recidivism, but many involve a complete overhaul of societal values concerning justice, punishment, and second chances. Other proposals have little impact due to cost and resource issues and other constraints. Plausible approaches include: # allowing current trends to continue without additional intervention (maintaining the status-quo) # increasing the presence and quality of pre-release services (within incarceration facilities) that address factors associated with (for example) drug-related criminality‚Äîaddiction treatment and mental-health counseling and education programs/vocational training # increasing the presence and quality of community-based organizations that provide post-release/reentry services (in the same areas mentioned in approach 2 The current criminal-justice system focuses on the front end (arrest and incarceration), and largely ignores the tail-end (and preparation for the tail-end), which includes rehabilitation and re-entry into the community. In most correctional facilities, if planning for re-entry takes place at all, it only begins a few weeks or months before the release of an inmate. \\"This process is often referred to as release planning or transition planning and its parameters may be largely limited to helping a person identify a place to stay upon release and, possibly, a source of income.\\" A judge in Missouri, David Mason, believes the Transcendental Meditation program is a successful tool for rehabilitation. Mason and four other Missouri state and federal judges have sentenced offenders to learn the Transcendental Meditation program as an anti-recidivism modality. Mental disorders Psychopaths may have a markedly distorted sense of the potential consequences of their actions, not only for others, but also for themselves. They do not, for example, deeply recognize the risk of being caught, disbelieved or injured as a result of their behaviour. However, numerous studies and recent large- scale meta-analysis cast serious doubt on claims made about the ability of psychopathy ratings to predict who will offend or respond to treatment.  Law and economics  The law and economics literature has provided various justifications for the fact that the sanction imposed on an offender depends on whether he was convicted previously. In particular, some authors such as Rubinstein (1980) and Polinsky and Rubinfeld (1991) have argued that a record of prior offenses provides information about the offender‚Äôs characteristics (e.g., a higher-than-average propensity to commit crimes). However, Shavell (2004) has pointed out that making sanctions depend on offense history may be advantageous even when there are no characteristics to be learned about. In particular, Shavell (2004, p. 529) argues that when ‚Äúdetection of a violation implies not only an immediate sanction, but also a higher sanction for a future violation, an individual will be deterred more from committing a violation presently‚Äù. Building on Shavell‚Äôs (2004) insights, M√ºller and Schmitz (2015) show that it may actually be optimal to further amplify the overdeterrence of repeat offenders when exogenous restrictions on penalties for first-time offenders are relaxed.

Biography and career Fabre studied at the Municipal Institute of Decorative Arts and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Between 1976 en 1980 he wrote his first scripts for the theatre and did his first solo performances. During his 'money-performances', he burned money and wrote the word 'MONEY' with the ashes. In 1977, he renamed the street where he lived to \\"Jan Fabre Street\\" and fixed a commemorative plaque \\"Here lives and works Jan Fabre\\" to the house of his parents, analogous to the commemorative plate on the house of Vincent Van Gogh in the same street. In 1978 he made drawings with his own blood during the solo performance 'My body, my blood, my landscape'. In 1980, in 'The Bic-Art Room', he had himself locked up for three days and three nights in a white cube full of objects, drawing with blue \\"Bic\\" ballpoint pens as an alternative to \\"Big\\" art. Fabre also established in 1986 the Troubleyn/Jan Fabre theatre company with extensive international operations; its home base is Antwerp, Belgium. From 1980, Fabre began his career as a stage director and stage designer in the following productions: *Theater geschreven met een K is een kater (1980) *Het is theater zoals te verwachten en te voorzien was (\\"It is Theatre as to be Expected and Foreseen\\" 1982) *De macht der theaterlijke dwaasheden (\\"The power of theatrical madness\\", Venice Biennale 1984) *Das Glas im Kopf wird vom Glas (1987) *Prometheus Landschaft (1988) *Das Interview das stirbt...

In 1990 he covered an entire building with ballpoint drawings. Fabre also explores relationships between drawing and sculpture and has made sculptures in bronze (among them The man who measures the clouds and Searching for Utopia) and with beetles. His decoration of the ceiling of the Royal Palace in Brussels, titled Heaven of Delight (made out of one million six hundred thousand jewel-scarab wing cases), is widely praised. In 2004 he erected Totem, a giant bug stuck on a 70-foot steel needle, on the Ladeuzeplein in Leuven. In 2008, Fabre's The Angel of Metamorphosis exhibition was held at the Louvre Museum. In September 2016 Fabre made an attempt to not break cyclist Eddy Merckx's 1972 hour record at the T√™te d'Or Velodrome in Lyon. Fabre completed a total of 23 km in an hour, compared to Merckx's record of over 49 km. The attempt was commentated on by Merckx, fellow cyclist Raymond Poulidor, and veteran cycling commentator Daniel Mangeas and was performed as the opening of his \\"Stigmata\\" retrospective exhibition organised by the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Lyon. Fabre described the attempt as \\"how to remain a dwarf in the land of giants\\".  Controversy  The heaven of delight inside the Hall of Mirrors of the Royal palace, a part can be seen above the fireplace. On 26 October 2012, several media reported how during a shoot in the Antwerp town hall for a forthcoming film on Fabre, living cats were thrown repeatedly several meters spinning into the air, after which they made a hard landing on the steps of the entrance hall. Animal welfare executive chairman Luc Bungeneers said he was having a meeting with his party chairman when he heard howling cats. \\"To my horror, we found cats were being assaulted in the name of art\\", Bungeneers said. \\"It went on for several hours.\\" The filming was eventually aborted after protests from the crew's own technicians. Later that day, Fabre claimed all cats were still in good health and that it was a conspiracy of the political party NVA. Fabre also received 20,000 emails slamming his act. He had also been attacked seven times by men carrying clubs whilst out jogging in the park and been forced to sleep in a different location every night. Antwerp's deputy mayor for animal well-being and the animal rights organisation Global Action in the Interest of Animals also launched complaints about Fabre's controversial act. Then in February 2016, Jan Fabre was appointed by the Greek Ministry of Culture as the Creative Director of the annual Athens ‚Äì Epidaurus Festival. He resigned less than two months later, on 2 April 2016, after a huge controversy over his plan to turn Greece's major arts festival into \\"a tribute to Belgium\\" and devote eight of the festival's ten productions to those from his homeland. In October 2016, the Russian State Hermitage museum staged a Fabre exhibition which drew a lot of criticism from visitors and institutions such as the Russian Orthodox Church. Stuffed animals in strange poses sparked outcry among Russian social media network users who launched a campaign under the hashtag #–ø–æ–∑–æ—Ä—ç—Ä–º–∏—Ç–∞–∂—É, or \\"Shame on you, Hermitage\\". The number of posts in Instagram tagged this way amounted to nearly 10,000 by late November. The museum then organized an event to meet the public and explain the exhibition after refusing to stop the exhibition which was slated to last up to April 2017. The artist repeatedly claimed that the animals used were taken from roads where they had been killed and denied any accusations by critics of cruelty and sadism.

To change the environment it offers teachers and other school staff a structure for planning, carrying out and evaluating their ideas. Evaluation has shown that changing something in the environment for the better almost always improves the behaviour of the child, and also the behaviour of others in the class.

They are best known for their 1968 UK Top 10 hit single, \\"I Can't Let Maggie Go\\", written by Pete Dello who also composed their previous single \\"(Do I Figure) In Your Life\\", later recorded by Dave Berry, Ian Matthews, Joe Cocker, Dave Stewart, Paul Carrack, Samantha Jones, Dana and Pierce Turner. Career The band's main composers were Dello and Ray Cane although other members contributed songs. The group's supporters and critics, amongst them Kenny Everett, compared the band to Rubber Soul-era Beatles. Honeybus had a major hit with 1968's \\"I Can't Let Maggie Go\\", which was so popular that it earned the band a cover photo on the popular music magazine, Disc and Music Echo, for which they posed atop a red London bus. \\"I Can't Let Maggie Go\\" reached Number 8 in the UK Singles Chart, in April 1968, staying in the Top 40 for over two months. Dello resigned in August 1968. The band recruited Jim Kelly on guitar and vocals to replace him and Cane began songwriting and performing lead vocals. This line-up scored minor successes with \\"She Sold Blackpool Rock\\" and \\"Girl Of Independent Means\\". Honeybus eventually disbanded late in 1969. Their 1970 album Story, without an active band to promote it, failed to chart. However, it is now highly collectable and sells for around ¬£1,000 in perfect condition. It has since been re-issued on compact disc. Dello, Hare and Kelly all went on to record solo material in the early 1970s that was critically acclaimed but failed to achieve significant commercial success. The Dello line-up of the band reunited in 1971 to record a new body of songs for the Bell Records label and a complete LP, Recital, for the British division of Warner Bros. Records. A change in management at Warner Brothers meant that Recital was never issued. \\"I Can't Let Maggie Go\\" was also a top 10 hit in Italy, with a version made by Equipe 84, entitled \\"Un angelo blu\\" (\\"A blue angel\\"). It enjoyed an unexpected return in popularity in the 1970s, when it was used as the TV jingle commercial for \\"Nimble\\", a bread produced for slimmers. Disbanding and aftermath Kircher left the group in the summer of 1969 and went on tour with Engelbert Humperdinck. He was replaced by drummer Lloyd Courtney for the remainder of the sessions for their debut album. Kircher's drumming career saw him joining several bands, among them Compass with Billy Bremner, Roger Rettig and Brian Hodgson, Shanghai, John Scott Cree, Liverpool Express, Original Mirrors and Status Quo. He retired from the music industry after Quo's appearance at Live Aid. Kelly released a solo single in 1969 on Deram entitled \\"Mary Mary\\" b/w \\"Rev. Richard Bailey\\", both written by Cane, but it failed to chart. Kelly joined the Sleaz Band in the 1970s and they released \\"All I Want Is You\\" on the Fontana label. An album was also recorded, but never released. He died on Boxing Day in 1995 after a long illness. After a number of years out of the spotlight, Hare released new solo material in 2002. He now runs an official Honeybus website. In 2007 Hare played a few gigs with a completely new Honeybus line-up minus Dello. Surviving members of Honeybus were briefly reunited for a Dutch television programme \\"Single Luck\\" in 2003. A solo EP, \\"Down From Pitswood\\", featured two original and long-forgotten Honeybus songs, which the band had recorded for BBC Radio sessions in the late 1960s.

It is named after the gauss, a unit of magnetism, which in turn was named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. Due to magnetic hysteresis, it is generally not possible to reduce a magnetic field completely to zero, so degaussing typically induces a very small \\"known\\" field referred to as bias. Degaussing was originally applied to reduce ships' magnetic signatures during World War II. Degaussing is also used to reduce magnetic fields in cathode ray tube monitors and to destroy data held on magnetic storage. Ships' hulls RMS Queen Mary arriving in New York Harbor, 20 June 1945, with thousands of U.S. soldiersnote the prominent degaussing coil running around the outer hull Control panel of the MES-device (\\"Magnetischer Eigenschutz\\" German: Magnetic self-protection) in a German submarineThe term was first used by then- Commander Charles F. Goodeve, Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, during World War II while trying to counter the German magnetic naval mines that were playing havoc with the British fleet. The mines detected the increase in the magnetic field when the steel in a ship concentrated the Earth's magnetic field over it. Admiralty scientists, including Goodeve, developed a number of systems to induce a small \\"N-pole up\\" field into the ship to offset this effect, meaning that the net field was the same as the background. Since the Germans used the gauss as the unit of the strength of the magnetic field in their mines' triggers (not yet a standard measure), Goodeve referred to the various processes to counter the mines as \\"degaussing\\". The term became a common word. The original method of degaussing was to install electromagnetic coils into the ships, known as coiling. In addition to being able to bias the ship continually, coiling also allowed the bias field to be reversed in the southern hemisphere, where the mines were set to detect \\"S-pole down\\" fields. British ships, notably cruisers and battleships, were well protected by about 1943. Installing such special equipment was, however, far too expensive and difficult to service all ships that would need it, so the navy developed an alternative called wiping, which Goodeve also devised, and which is now also called deperming. This procedure dragged a large electrical cable along the side of the ship with a pulse of about 2000 amperes flowing through it. This induced the proper field into the ship in the form of a slight bias. It was originally thought that the pounding of the sea and the ship's engines would slowly randomize this field, but in testing, this was found not to be a real problem. A more serious problem was later realized: as a ship travels through Earth's magnetic field, it will slowly pick up that field, counteracting the effects of the degaussing. From then on captains were instructed to change direction as often as possible to avoid this problem. Nevertheless, the bias did wear off eventually, and ships had to be degaussed on a schedule. Smaller ships continued to use wiping through the war. To aid the Dunkirk evacuation, the British \\"wiped\\" 400 ships in four days.PBS Nova \\"Great Escape at Dunkirk\\" https://www.pbs.org/video/great-escape-at-dunkirk-qb5qcr/ During World War II, the United States Navy commissioned a specialized class of degaussing ships that were capable of performing this function. One of them, USS Deperm (ADG-10), was named after the procedure. After the war, the capabilities of the magnetic fuzes were greatly improved, by detecting not the field itself, but changes in it. This meant a degaussed ship with a magnetic \\"hot spot\\" would still set off the mine. Additionally, the precise orientation of the field was also measured, something a simple bias field could not remove, at least for all points on the ship. A series of ever-increasingly complex coils were introduced to offset these effects, with modern systems including no fewer than three separate sets of coils to reduce the field in all axes. High-temperature superconductivity The US Navy tested, in April 2009, a prototype of its High-Temperature Superconducting Degaussing Coil System, referred to as \\"HTS Degaussing\\". The system works by encircling the vessel with superconducting ceramic cables whose purpose is to neutralize the ship's magnetic signature, as in the legacy copper systems. The main advantage of the HTS Degaussing Coil system is greatly reduced weight (sometimes by as much as 80%) and increased efficiency. A sea-going metal-hulled ship or submarine, by its very nature, develops a magnetic signature as it travels, due to a magneto-mechanical interaction with Earth's magnetic field. It also picks up the magnetic orientation of the Earth's magnetic field where it is built. This signature can be exploited by magnetic mines or facilitate the detection of a submarine by ships or aircraft with magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) equipment. Navies use the deperming procedure, in conjunction with degaussing, as a countermeasure against this. Specialized deperming facilities, such as the United States Navy's Lambert's Point Deperming Station at Naval Station Norfolk, or Pacific Fleet Submarine Drive-In Magnetic Silencing Facility (MSF) at Joint Base Pearl Harbor‚ÄìHickam, are used to perform the procedure. During a closed-wrap magnetic treatment, heavy-gauge copper cables encircle the hull and superstructure of the vessel, and high electrical currents (up to 4000 amperes) are pulsed through the cables. This has the effect of \\"resetting\\" the ship's magnetic signature to the ambient level after flashing its hull with electricity. It is also possible to assign a specific signature that is best suited to the particular area of the world in which the ship will operate. In drive-in magnetic silencing facilities, all cables are either hung above, below and on the sides, or concealed within the structural elements of facilities. Deperming is \\"permanent\\". It is only done once unless major repairs or structural modifications are done to the ship.  Early experiments  With the introduction of iron ships, the negative effect of the metal hull on steering compasses was noted. It was also observed that lightning strikes had a significant effect on compass deviation, identified in some extreme cases as being caused by the reversal of the ship's magnetic signature. In 1866, Evan Hopkins of London registered a patent for a process \\"to depolarise iron vessels and leave them thenceforth free from any compass-disturbing influence whatever\\". The technique was described as follows: \\"For this purpose he employed a number of Grove's batteries and electromagnets. The latter were to be passed along the plates till the desired end had been obtained... the process must not be overdone for fear of re-polarising in the opposite direction.\\" The invention was, however, reported to be \\"incapable of being carried to a successful issue\\", and \\"quickly died a natural death\\".Lecky, Commander S.T.S., Wrinkles in Practical Navigation, first published 1881, 19th Edition, George Philip & Son Ltd., London, 1917, p. 36 Monitors Until recently, the most common use of degaussing was in CRT-based color TV sets and color computer monitors. For example, many monitors use a metal plate near the front of the tube to guide the electron beams from the back. This plate, the shadow mask, can pick up strong external fields and from that point produce discoloration on the display by imparting an undesired deflection to the electron beam. To minimize this, CRTs have a copper, or often in the case of cheaper appliances, aluminum, coil wrapped around the front of the display, known as the degaussing coil. Monitors without an internal coil can be degaussed using an external handheld version. Internal degaussing coils in CRTs are generally much weaker than external degaussing coils, since a better degaussing coil takes up more space. A degauss causes a magnetic field inside the tube to oscillate rapidly, with decreasing amplitude. This leaves the shadow mask with a small and somewhat randomized field, removing the discoloration. A degaussing in progress Many televisions and monitors automatically degauss their picture tube when switched on, before an image is displayed. The high current surge that takes place during this automatic degauss is the cause of an audible \\"thunk\\" or loud hum, which can be heard (and felt) when televisions and CRT computer monitors are switched on. Visually, this causes the image to shake dramatically for a short period of time. A degauss option is also usually available for manual selection in the operations menu in such appliances. In most commercial equipment the current surge to the degaussing coil is regulated by a simple positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistor device, which initially has a low resistance but quickly changes to a high resistance due to the heating effect of the current flow. Such devices are designed for a one-off transition from cold to hot at power up; \\"experimenting\\" with the degauss effect by repeatedly switching the device on and off may cause this component to fail. The effect will also be weaker, since the PTC will not have had time to cool off. Magnetic data storage media Data is stored in the magnetic media, such as hard drives, floppy disks, and magnetic tape, by making very small areas called magnetic domains, change their magnetic alignment to be in the direction of an applied magnetic field. This phenomenon occurs in much the same way a compass needle points in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. Degaussing, commonly called erasure, leaves the domains in random patterns with no preference to orientation, thereby rendering previous data unrecoverable. There are some domains whose magnetic alignment is not randomized after degaussing. The information these domains represent is commonly called magnetic remanence or remanent magnetization. Proper degaussing will ensure there is insufficient magnetic remanence to reconstruct the data. Erasure via degaussing may be accomplished in two ways: in AC erasure, the medium is degaussed by applying an alternating field that is reduced in amplitude over time from an initial high value (i.e., AC powered); in DC erasure, the medium is saturated by applying a unidirectional field (i.e., DC powered or by employing a permanent magnet). A degausser is a device that can generate a magnetic field for degaussing magnetic storage media.National Computer Security Center TG-025.  Irreversible damage to some media types  Many forms of generic magnetic storage media can be reused after degaussing, including reel-to-reel audio tape, VHS videocassettes, and floppy disks. These older media types are simply a raw medium which are overwritten with fresh new patterns, created by fixed- alignment read/write heads. For certain forms of computer data storage, however, such as modern hard disk drives and some tape drives, degaussing renders the magnetic media completely unusable and damages the storage system. This is due to the devices having an infinitely variable read/write head positioning mechanism which relies on special servo control data (e.g. Gray Code) that is meant to be permanently recorded onto the magnetic media. This servo data is written onto the media a single time at the factory using special-purpose servo writing hardware. The servo patterns are normally never overwritten by the device for any reason and are used to precisely position the read/write heads over data tracks on the media, to compensate for sudden jarring device movements, thermal expansion, or changes in orientation.

Using four-dimensional Cerf theory, he proved that if M and N are 3-manifolds, resulting from Dehn surgery on framed links L and J respectively, then they are homeomorphic if and only if L and J are related by a sequence of Kirby moves. According to the Lickorish‚ÄìWallace theorem any closed orientable 3-manifold is obtained by such surgery on some link in the 3-sphere. Some ambiguity exists in the literature on the precise use of the term \\"Kirby moves\\". Different presentations of \\"Kirby calculus\\" have a different set of moves and these are sometimes called Kirby moves. Kirby's original formulation involved two kinds of move, the \\"blow-up\\" and the \\"handle slide\\"; Roger Fenn and Colin Rourke exhibited an equivalent construction in terms of a single move, the Fenn‚ÄìRourke move, that appears in many expositions and extensions of the Kirby calculus. Dale Rolfsen's book, Knots and Links, from which many topologists have learned the Kirby calculus, describes a set of two moves: 1) delete or add a component with surgery coefficient infinity 2) twist along an unknotted component and modify surgery coefficients appropriately (this is called the Rolfsen twist). This allows an extension of the Kirby calculus to rational surgeries. There are also various tricks to modify surgery diagrams. One such useful move is the slam-dunk. An extended set of diagrams and moves are used for describing 4-manifolds. A framed link in the 3-sphere encodes instructions for attaching 2-handles to the 4-ball. (The 3-dimensional boundary of this manifold is the 3-manifold interpretation of the link diagram mentioned above.) 1-handles are denoted by either (a) a pair of 3-balls (the attaching region of the 1-handle) or, more commonly, (b) unknotted circles with dots. The dot indicates that a neighborhood of a standard 2-disk with boundary the dotted circle is to be excised from the interior of the 4-ball. Excising this 2-handle is equivalent to adding a 1-handle; 3-handles and 4-handles are usually not indicated in the diagram. Handle decomposition * A closed, smooth 4-manifold is usually described by a handle decomposition. * A 0-handle is just a ball, and the attaching map is disjoint union. * A 1-handle is attached along two disjoint 3-balls. * A 2-handle is attached along a solid torus; since this solid torus is embedded in a 3-manifold, there is a relation between handle decompositions on 4-manifolds, and knot theory in 3-manifolds. * A pair of handles with index differing by 1, whose cores link each other in a sufficiently simple way can be cancelled without changing the underlying manifold. Similarly, such a cancelling pair can be created. Two different smooth handlebody decompositions of a smooth 4-manifold are related by a finite sequence of isotopies of the attaching maps, and the creation/cancellation of handle pairs.

His reign is best known for its demise with the sudden fall of Babylon at the hands of the Hittites. History He was the great, great grandson of Hammurabi and, although the Babylonian kingdom had shrunk considerably since its peak under this illustrious ancestor, it still extended north from Babylon and the Euphrates to Mari and Terqa. For the most part, he appears to have been non-belligerent and content to stay at home at the seat of his kingdom as none of his year names describe the waging of war or the building of monumental edifices. They are about pious gifts to the gods and the erection of statues dedicated to himself. None of his inscriptions have survived. A royal epic of Gulki≈°ar, the 6th king of the 2nd Dynasty of Babylon, the Sealand Dynasty, describes his enmity against Samsu-ditƒÅna. Samsu-ditƒÅna apparently feared an attack as evidenced in extant tamitu texts, oracle questions addressed to the gods ≈†ama≈° and Adad, which name seven ‚Äúrebel‚Äù enemies. However, he was powerless to prevent it, as the Babylonian state was in decay, with offices becoming hereditary, usurping royal prerogative, and payments accepted in lieu of military service to fund the bloated bureaucracy. The eventual coup-de-grace came from an unexpected quarter and his reign was brought to an abrupt end by a raid by the Hittite king, Mur≈°ili I in 1595 BC (Middle Chronology), 1531 BC (Short Chronology), which resulted in the sacking and complete devastation of Babylon.

Reactions  Samarium(II) iodide is a powerful reducing agent ‚Äì for example it rapidly reduces water to hydrogen. It is available commercially as a dark blue 0.1 M solution in THF. Although used typically in superstoichiometric amuonts, catalytic applications have been described. Organic chemistry Samarium(II) iodide is a reagent for carbon-carbon bond formation, for example in a Barbier reaction (similar to the Grignard reaction) between a ketone and an alkyl iodide to form a tertiary alcohol: :R1I + R2COR3 ‚Üí R1R2C(OH)R3 Barbier reaction using SmI2 Typical reaction conditions use SmI2 in THF in the presence of catalytic NiI2. Esters react similarly (adding two R groups), but aldehydes give by-products. The reaction is convenient in that it is often very rapid (5 minutes or less in the cold). Although samarium(II) iodide is considered a powerful single-electron reducing agent, it does display remarkable chemoselectivity among functional groups. For example, sulfones and sulfoxides can be reduced to the corresponding sulfide in the presence of a variety of carbonyl-containing functionalities (such as esters, ketones, amides, aldehydes, etc.). This is presumably due to the considerably slower reaction with carbonyls as compared to sulfones and sulfoxides. Furthermore, hydrodehalogenation of halogenated hydrocarbons to the corresponding hydrocarbon compound can be achieved using samarium(II) iodide. Also, it can be monitored by the color change that occurs as the dark blue color of SmI2 in THF discharges to a light yellow once the reaction has occurred. The picture shows the dark colour disappearing immediately upon contact with the Barbier reaction mixture. Work-up is with dilute hydrochloric acid, and the samarium is removed as aqueous Sm3+. Carbonyl compounds can also be coupled with simple alkenes to form five, six or eight membered rings. Tosyl groups can be removed from N-tosylamides almost instantaneously, using SmI2 in conjunction with a base. The reaction is even effective for the synthesis of sensitive amines such as aziridines: :Removal of a tosyl group from an N-tosylamide using SmI2 In the Mark√≥-Lam deoxygenation, an alcohol could be almost instantaneously deoxygenated by reducing their toluate ester in presence of SmI2. : Mark√≥-Lam deoxygenation using SmI2 The applications of SmI2 have been reviewed.

It is often associated today with the cultural icon Rosie the Riveter, although it does not actually depict her. \\"I am a good war hen, I eat little and produce a lot.\\" French poster from World War I. Home front is an English language term with analogues in other languages. It is commonly used to describe the full participation of the British public in World War I who suffered Zeppelin raids and endured food rations as part of what came to be called the \\"Home Front\\". Civilians are traditionally uninvolved in combat, except when the fighting happened to reach their dwelling places. However, the expanded destructive capabilities of modern warfare posed an increased direct threat to civilian populations. With the rapid increase of military technology, the term \\"military effort\\" has changed to include the \\"home front\\" as a reflection of both a civilian \\"sector\\" capacity to produce arms, as well as the structural or policy changes which deal with its vulnerability to direct attack. This continuity of \\"military effort\\" from fighting combat troops to manufacturing facilities has profound effects for the concept of \\"total war\\". By this logic, if factories and workers producing material are part of the war effort, they become legitimate targets for attack, rather than protected non-combatants. Hence, in practice, both sides in a conflict attack civilians and civilian infrastructure, with the understanding that they are legitimate and lawful targets in war. This military view of civilian targets has effects on the equity of applied legal principles on which the prosecution of crimes against humanity are based. The concept of civilians' involvement in war also developed in connection with general development and change of the ideological attitude to the state. In feudal society and also in absolute monarchy the state was perceived as essentially belonging to the monarch and the aristocracy, ruling over a mass of passive commoners; wars were perceived as a contest between rival rulers, conducted \\"above the head\\" of the commoners, who were expected to submit to the victor. However even given this, in feudal societies the income of estates and nations, and therefore the wealth and power of monarchs and aristocrats, was proportional to the number of commoners available to work the land. By killing, terrorizing, destroying property and driving away a nobleman's serfs, a tactic known as chevauch√©e, an attacker could hope either to diminish the strength of an opponent or to force an opponent to give battle. In contrast, since the French Revolution, the state was increasingly perceived as belonging to \\"the People\\", a perception shared‚Äîthough in different forms‚Äîby democracy, communism and fascism. A logical conclusion was that war has become everybody's business and that also those not taken into the military must still \\"do their part\\" and \\"fight on the home front\\". History The importance of civilian manufacturing and support services in a nation's capacity to fight a war first became apparent during the twenty-five years of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars when the United Kingdom was able to finance and, to a lesser extent, arm and supply the various coalitions which opposed France. Although Britain had a much smaller population than France, its global maritime trade and its early industrialisation meant that its economy was much larger than that of France, which allowed Britain to offset the French manpower advantage. Durin the American Civil War, the capacity of Northern factories and agriculture proved as decisive in winning the war as the skills of the generals of either side. World War I During World War I, the British Shell Crisis of 1915 and the appointment of David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be geared for war if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front. The United States home front during World War I saw the first ring World War II. World War II A factor in Allied victory in World War II was the ability of Allied nations to successfully and efficiently mobilize their civilian industries and domestic populations in order to turn out weapons and goods necessary for waging war. By contrast, mobilization of economic resources in Nazi Germany was so inefficient that some early historians of the Reich's economy concluded that the Nazi leadership must have had an intentional policy of favoring civilian over military production until late in the war. The British, by contrast, had already accomplished mobilization for total war by 1940, thereby increasing the output of weapons‚Äîespecially heavy bombers‚Äîvastly. This view was for example presented quite early by John Kenneth Galbraith in Fortune magazine in 1945 \\"The simple fact is that Germany should have never lost the war ...\\". According to Adam Tooze this view was influenced by the post-war reports from Albert Speer and SS Wirtschaftsf√ºhrer (economy leader) , which were not free from own interests. Tooze's alternative view is that Germany was extremely mobilising - already in 1939 there was a higher degree of mobilisation of women in Germany, for example, than Britain ever achieved during the whole war -, but the economy of Germany was simply not strong enough in comparison to the economies of the war opponents, especially with respect to the ever growing support coming from the USA. Slave labour and foreign labour in addition to women's labour could not change this.Adam Tooze, Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy, 2006, picket 2007, pp. 429seq. Hitler was early aware of this German weakness. He hoped, however, by a series of Blitzkriegs to change the situation early enough in favour of Germany. This failed due to military defeats in Russia and the ongoing support provided by the US to Britain. During the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Soviet soldiers and civilians moved their industries out of reach of the advancing Germans (sometimes disassembling and reassembling entire factories) and began turning out vast numbers of T-34 tanks, Il-2 attack aircraft, and other weapons.

He was known as \\"The President's Banker.\\"  Life and work  Riggs was born in Georgetown, D.C. (now part of Washington), the son of Elisha Riggs and Alice Lawrason. His great-grandfather was John Riggs, who was mentioned in a will in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, as early as 1716. George was brought up in Baltimore, to which his father removed after he took George Peabody into partnership and established the firm of Riggs & Peabody there. He went to the Round Hill School kept by George Bancroft and Joseph Green Cogswell at Northampton, Massachusetts, and entered Yale College in 1829, but left some time in his junior year. He traveled abroad, and, returning to America, worked for his father in the mercantile firm of Riggs, Taylor & Company in New York City. On June 23, 1840, he was married to Janet Madeleine Cecilia Shedden, the daughter of Thomas Shedden of Glasgow, Scotland. They had nine children, among them the Catholic priest T. Lawrason Riggs. The same year William W. Corcoran took him into partnership in the banking firm of Corcoran & Riggs at Washington, D.C. The firm was immediately successful; it was able to obtain a major share of the loans required by the federal government, acquired a reputation in financing the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and made large profits. In 1848 he gave up his connection with the firm, to which, however, his younger half-brother Elisha succeeded so that the firm name remained the same. When Corcoran retired in 1854, Riggs bought his interest. Under the firm name of Riggs & Company (since 1896 Riggs Bank), he directed the business until his death. Gravesite of George Washington Riggs He was a member of the board of aldermen of the District of Columbia, in 1873 was chairman of a committee to present to Congress a petition asking for an investigation into the conduct of the board of public works, helped to obtain a committee report favorable to the abolition of the existing territorial form of government, and was active in the establishment of the present (1934) form of government that vests all authority in Congress. He built and owned the Riggs House, a famous hotel of his time, and was one of the organizers of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company. He was a trustee of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and of the Peabody Education Fund. He was for many years the treasurer of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association of the Union. In 1864 he advanced the money to maintain Mount Vernon until the return of peace should make it possible for the society again to raise funds. George Washington Riggs died at his home, Green Hill, in Prince George's County, Maryland. The Green Hill estate included much of the nearby Maryland suburbs northeast of Washington including Adelphi, Chillum, and Lewisdale.

A generic selection procedure may be implemented as follows: #The fitness function is evaluated for each individual, providing fitness values, which are then normalized. Normalization means dividing the fitness value of each individual by the sum of all fitness values, so that the sum of all resulting fitness values equals 1. #Accumulated normalized fitness values are computed: the accumulated fitness value of an individual is the sum of its own fitness value plus the fitness values of all the previous individuals; the accumulated fitness of the last individual should be 1, otherwise something went wrong in the normalization step. #A random number R between 0 and 1 is chosen. #The selected individual is the first one whose accumulated normalized value is greater than or equal to R. For many problems the above algorithm might be computationally demanding. A simpler and faster alternative uses the so-called stochastic acceptance. If this procedure is repeated until there are enough selected individuals, this selection method is called fitness proportionate selection or roulette-wheel selection. If instead of a single pointer spun multiple times, there are multiple, equally spaced pointers on a wheel that is spun once, it is called stochastic universal sampling. Repeatedly selecting the best individual of a randomly chosen subset is tournament selection. Taking the best half, third or another proportion of the individuals is truncation selection. There are other selection algorithms that do not consider all individuals for selection, but only those with a fitness value that is higher than a given (arbitrary) constant. Other algorithms select from a restricted pool where only a certain percentage of the individuals are allowed, based on fitness value. Retaining the best individuals in a generation unchanged in the next generation, is called elitism or elitist selection. It is a successful (slight) variant of the general process of constructing a new population.  Methods of Selection (Genetic Algorithm)   Roulette Wheel Selection  In the roulette wheel selection, the probability of choosing an individual for breeding of the next generation is proportional to its fitness, the better the fitness is, the higher chance for that individual to be chosen. Choosing individuals can be depicted as spinning a roulette that has as many pockets as there are individuals in the current generation, with sizes depending on their probability. Probability of choosing individual i is equal to p_i = \\\\frac{f_i}{\\\\Sigma_{j=1}^{N} f_j}, where f_i is the fitness of i and N is the size of current generation (note that in this method one individual can be drawn multiple times) If we're working on minimization problem, it is however needed to transform it into maximization problem (which can be easily done by taking the inversion of our fitness).  Rank Selection  Rank Selection also works with negative fitness values and is mostly used when the individuals in the population have very close fitness values (this happens usually at the end of the run). This leads to each individual having an almost equal share of the pie (like in case of fitness proportionate selection) and hence each individual no matter how fit relative to each other has an approximately same probability of getting selected as a parent. This in turn leads to a loss in the selection pressure towards fitter individuals, making the GA to make poor parent selections in such situations.  Steady State Selection  This is not particular method of selecting parents. Main idea of this selection is that big part of chromosomes should survive to next generation. In every generation are selected a few (good - with high fitness) chromosomes for creating a new offspring. Then some (bad - with low fitness) chromosomes are removed and the new offspring is placed in their place. The rest of population survives to new generation.  Tournament Selection  Tournament Selection is a method of choosing the individual from the set of individuals. The winner of each tournament is selected to perform crossover.  Elitism Selection  Often to get better parameters, strategies with partial reproduction are used. One of them is elitism, in which a small portion of the best individuals from the last generation is carried over (without any changes) to the next one.  Boltzmann Selection  In Boltzmann selection, a continuously varying temperature controls the rate of selection according to a preset schedule. The temperature starts out high, which means that the selection pressure is low. The temperature is gradually lowered, which gradually increases the selection pressure, thereby allowing the GA to narrow in more closely to the best part of the search space while maintaining the appropriate degree of diversity.

Taurus is powered by a turbofan engine at Mach 1 and can be carried by Tornado, Eurofighter Typhoon, Gripen, F/A-18, and F-15K jets. The double warhead, called Mephisto (Multi-Effect Penetrator HIghly Sophisticated and Target Optimised), features a precharge and initial penetrating charge to clear soil or enter a hardened underground bunker, then a variable delay fuze to control detonation of the main warhead. The missile weighs about and has a maximum body diameter of . Intended targets are hardened bunkers; command, control, and communications facilities; airfield and port facilities; AMS and ammunition storage; ships in port or at sea; and bridges. The missile also includes counter measures as a self-defence mechanism and electronic counter measures. Mission planners program the missile with the target, air defence locations and planned ground path, then the missile uses a low terrain-hugging flight path guided by INS, IBN, TRN, and GPS to the proximity of the target, although it is capable of navigating over very long distances without GPS support. Once there the missile commences a bunt (climb) manoeuvre to an altitude intended to achieve the best probability of target acquisition and penetration. During the cruise flight a high resolution thermographic camera (infrared homing) can support the navigation by using IBN and is also used for GPS-free target attack. The missile attempts to match a camera image with the planned 3D target model (DSMAC). If it cannot, it defaults to the other navigation systems, or, if there is a high risk of collateral damage, it will steer to a pre-designated crash point instead of risking an inaccurate attack with undesired consequences.

According to the Bible, one of the disciples, Simon Peter, being armed with a sword, cut off the servant's ear in an attempt to prevent the arrest of Jesus. Biblical accounts That a disciple cut off the ear of a servant of the high priest is related in all four canonical gospels, in , , , and , but Simon Peter and Malchus are named only in the Gospel of John. Also, Luke is the only gospel that says Jesus healed the servant. This was Jesus' last recorded miracle prior to his resurrection. The relevant passages in the Gospels of John and Luke, KJV, read: James F. McGrath suggests that this account reflects an event that did happen, in that early Christians would hardly have invented a story portraying themselves as violent. Later in Chapter 18, John records that a relative of Malchus witnessed Peter's assault in the Garden of Gethsemane, and identified Peter as a follower of Christ. Peter denied this. Literature and arts Thornton Wilder wrote a short play entitled, \\"The Servant's Name Was Malchus\\"; it appears in the collection The Angel That Troubled the Waters and Other Plays. The Fire Gospel, a 2008 novel by Michel Faber, centers on the discovery of the fictional lost gospel of Malchus. Malchus is portrayed by Paul Brightwell in the 2013 TV miniseries The Bible. In the 2004 Mel Gibson film The Passion of the Christ, Malchus is represented as an armed member of the temple guard. In this depiction, Jesus heals Malchus' wounded ear, leaving the latter to stay behind sitting dumbfounded in a state of disbelief, suggesting a possible conversion to Christianity. Isak Dinesen in The Deluge at Norderney (the first of Seven Gothic Tales) relates a story about Simon Peter wherein he uses the memory of cutting off Malchus' ear \\"to control his temper\\".

He was given the name \\"Tibet\\" by Genesis P-Orridge, and in January 2005 he announced that he would revert to the name David Michael, although he continues to use the well-known \\"Tibet\\" in his public career to date. Career David Bunting was born in Batu Gajah, Perak, Malaysia. Early in his career, he collaborated with Psychic TV and 23 Skidoo. Tibet left Psychic TV in 1983 and founded Current 93 the same year. He has worked with Steven Stapleton of Nurse With Wound (of which band he is a member), Michael Cashmore, Douglas P. (of Death in June, on whose albums he has appeared several times), Steve Ignorant of Crass (using the name \\"Stephen Intelligent\\"), Boyd Rice, Little Annie, Bj√∂rk, Nick Cave, Rose McDowall, Tiny Tim, Annabella Lwin (of Bow Wow Wow) and Ian Read of Fire and Ice. Related bands Tibet's main musical outlet is the band Current 93, the only constant member of which is Tibet himself. Current 93's first release was the cassette- only Mi-Mort, a split C60 with Nurse With Wound. The first vinyl release was LAShTAL, with the line-up of Tibet, John Balance of Coil and Psychic TV and Fritz Haaman (Fritz Catlin) of 23 Skidoo. Tibet often participated in making and producing several records by a number of industrial bands individually or in the name of Current 93. Those industrial bands include the Nurse With Wound, Coil, and some labels producing industrial noise music, such as Dark Vinyl. Among many important figures of the main line of industrial noise music, the network among David Tibet, Steven Stapleton and John Balance is an indispensable one. These people are proficient in various related musical styles from dark ambient to industrial noise music. They sometimes acquired knowledge from each other when working together, thus it is easy to see that in the music of David Tibet/Current 93, there are mainly two important genres of underground industrial music including ambient music and dark industrial. These mixed styles of music represents the development of the industrial noise music. At the same time, as David Tibet used to be a member of Death in June, which is a neo-folk band, the band Current 93 also has some works of neo-folk. Influences Tibet believes in mysticism, which derived from several kinds of fields including the realms of religion, philosophy, witchcraft, poetry and paintings. He is always trying to derive inspiration from them, then blends those ideas into his works. Their particular style of music works are closely linked with the mysterious ideas of David Tibet. When talking about the objects which can make David feel energy as well as acquire inspiration, he initially points out religions. In addition to Christianity, he believes Buddhism as well. David Tibet concentrates on Vajrayana, one school of Tibetan Buddhism. He also regards the Padmasambhava (a famous Buddhist in India. Padmasambhava has a high reputation in the field of Tibetan Buddhism) as his own tutor. The album \\"Buddhist Monks of the Maitri Vihar Monastery\\" of Tibet in the year 1997 is essentially a form of paternoster from Tibetan Buddhism. Tibet always keeps modest towards religions no matter which religion it is. He said that one must have a strong faith when one believes a new religion. David has been influenced by the theories of Aleister Crowley (1875‚Äì1947, a famous author and mystic in the 20th Century) since he was ten years old. The influence by Crowley is apparent in many aspects of Current 93's covers, lyrics and themes. Tibet's lyrical subject matter reflects a consistent preoccupation with all aspects of apocalypse. He has long been a student of Christian eschatology. At a precocious age, he developed a strong interest in Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis. He borrowed the term \\"93 Current\\", the current of Thelema or Agape, from Crowley. His initial recording as Current 93, LAShTAL, was, according to Tibet, \\"the invocation of Malkunofath on the Nightside of Eden, the reverse of the Tree of Life\\". He has long proclaimed a virtual anathema to Crowleyism (despite a strong appreciation for Crowley as an individual) and instead has embraced at various intervals, Tibetan Buddhism and esoteric Christianity. His projects continue to focus on the multifaceted aspects of apocalypse, mainly death, loss and destruction. Progressively, his works are tempered by Christian mysticism and an increasingly strong faith in the end of the world. Other influences include Noddy, Gnosticism, Austin Osman Spare, Bobby Beausoleil, and a variety of occult topics. In April 2006, the Ordo Templi Orientis formed the International OTO Cabinet, an advisory, non-voting panel made up of both OTO Initiates and Non-Initiates. David Tibet was named among the initial non- member appointments. Other activities He is an established outsider artist and painter with much of his work in well-known galleries such as the Henry Boxer Gallery and Isis Gallery. Tibet's 'The Moons At Your Door,' an anthology of 'strange tales that influenced' Tibet illustrated by his own artwork, was released in Paperback Edition in March 2016. Tibet is interested in the work of Count Stenbock, whose writings he has worked to republish. He also ran the Durtro publishing imprint and record label (1988‚Äì2010) which has since been replaced by an earlier label, Coptic Cat, where many Durtro releases continue to be available.

He was a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation member of the federal parliament from 1942 to 1945 and again from 1949 to 1956. He died in office on March 30, 1956. Background Noseworthy was born in Lewisporte, Newfoundland and grew up working on fishing boats and getting his education when he could. As a teenager he worked as a lumberman before obtaining his teaching certificate at the age of 18. In 1910, he entered Albert College in Belleville, Ontario and paid his tuition by working with Frontier College going into the bush and teaching lumberjacks how to read and continued working for Frontier College when he attended Victoria College in Toronto. Finishing his education at the age of 30, he sold insurance for a year before joining North Toronto Collegiate Institute as a history teacher. After seven years, he moved to Vaughan Road Collegiate Institute in the suburb of York, Toronto becoming head of the English department. Noseworthy became the President of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation in 1938 serving a one year term. Politics He joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and was its candidate in the riding of York South in the 1940 federal election where he was defeated. He stood again for the CCF when a by-election was called after the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) resigned in order to allow the new Conservative leader, former Prime Minister Arthur Meighen, to win a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. It was tradition for the Liberals and Conservatives not to run against the other party's leader in by-elections, but the CCF did not accept this convention. William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Liberals were determined to block Meighen's return to politics: King didn't want the vocally pro-Conscription Meighen back in Parliament (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). The two men also had an intense rivalry dating from the 1920s when Meighen had previously been Tory leader. The Liberals donated money to Noseworthy's campaign, and encouraged their members to support his candidacy. Conversely, the Ontario Liberal Party and Premier of Ontario, Mitchell Hepburn, was opposed to King's conscription stance, and decided to put their support behind Meighen in the by-election. The result on February 9, 1942, was a major upset and breakthrough for the CCF, with Noseworthy being elected by a margin of 5,000 votes. The defeat forced Meighen out of public life. Noseworthy was defeated in the subsequent 1945 general election by Alan Cockeram who had held the riding prior to the 1942 by-election, but returned as York South's MP in the 1949 election and remained in Parliament until his death. Noseworthy was an active parliamentarian and defended the rights of immigrants and minorities. At one point, he embarrassed the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Walter Harris, by tabling a letter Harris had written that made it clear that the government intended to use provisions of the new 1952 Immigration Act to exclude non-whites.

His first career was in the Colonial Service; he survived imprisonment by the Japanese during the Second World War, when he was stationed in Singapore, to later serve terms as British Resident in Brunei and then Resident Commissioner in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony (now Kiribati and Tuvalu) before retiring in 1951. His father Sir William Peel had been Governor of Hong Kong. Peel was elected as a member of the House of Commons at a by-election in 1957.

The former Palace of the Dukes of Medinaceli now houses the city's mayor. Segorbe's bull-running week (semana de Toros) in September attracts 200,000 visitors each year.  Geography  The municipal district area is crossed by the Palancia River from north west to south east. It is located on the natural way from Arag√≥n to Valencian Community, between the Serra d'Espad√† on the north and Serra Calderona on the south. The urban area is located at 358 m height, placed over two hills emerging from the bank of the river. History The wall of Segorbe. The area of Segorbe was inhabited as early as the mid-Palaeolithic Age, as testified by archaeological remains. Segorbe was once identified as the ancient Segobriga, described by Pliny the Elder as the capital of Celtiberia. However, archaeological excavations have uncovered an extensive Roman city in La Mancha which has been identified as Segobriga. During the Visigothic rule in Iberia, it became a diocese seat. In the 8th century Segorbe was occupied by Moors from North Africa and its cathedral became a mosque. Segorbe was the residence of Zayd Abu Zayd, the last Almohad governor of Valencia. After his conversion to Christianism, Segorbe became a base for the conquest of Valencia in 1238. In 1435 it became part of the royal estates of the Kingdom of Aragon. C√°rcel Tower and Teruel Gate. Main sights The Cathedral of Segorbe, consecrated in 1534 and extended in 1795 is connected by a bridge with the old episcopal palace. Its tower and its cloister are built on a trapezoidal ground-plan. Segorbe's ancient castle was perhaps located over an Iberian acropolis. It originated as a Moorish alcazar, and lived its period of highest splendor in the later 15th century; Martin of Aragon held his court here. After the administrative center was moved to the new ducal palace in the city, it declined, and, from the mid-18th century, its materials were used for the construction of the hospital and Casa de Misericordia. Other sights include: *Church of St. Martin, built in Baroque style in 1612 *Baroque church of San Joaqu√≠n y Santa Ana (1695) *Medieval walls, dating to before the 13th century, including in their last stretch a 14th-century aqueduct.

His son Enric II was created duke of Segorbe and was also count of Emp√∫ries, like his son Alfons I. The son of this last one, Francesc I, inherited from his father the duchy of Segorbe and county of Emp√∫ries, and from his mother (Joana of Cardona) the duchy of Cardona. He had no sons and the succession passed through his sister Joana, who was married to Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, marquis of Comares.

She is frequently referred to as countess, and made heiress to her father, yet she was not the eldest daughter, and likewise Aragon had already been absorbed into the Kingdom of Pamplona by Sancho I, years before her marriage to that king's son, Garc√≠a S√°nchez I. Prior to 940, Garc√≠a divorced Andregoto, presumably due to consanguinity since the two shared a grandparent. They left a sole son, Sancho II of Pamplona, and Garc√≠a's two daughters may also have been hers: Toda, who is mentioned in 991 as sister of King Sancho, and Urraca, wife successively of Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile and William II S√°nchez of Gascony.Urraca is commonly given as daughter by Garc√≠a's second wife. Gonzalo Mart√≠nez D√≠ez in Sancho III el Mayor: rey de Pamplona, Rex Ibericus makes her daughter of Andregoto. Traditional chronology would require this to have been otherwise, as she is typically identified with Urraca, duchess of Gascony, who died in 1041. However, while still showing Urraca as daughter of Teresa, Jaime de Salazar y Acha shows her to have died by 1008, concluding that the Urraca who died in 1041 was instead her daughter- in-law Urraca S√°nchez, daughter of Sancho Garc√≠a of Castile and widow of Sancho VI William of Gascony. While this would thereby allow the Mart√≠nez D√≠ez reconstruction, Urraca still married Fern√°n Gonz√°lez between 961 and 964, more than two decades after Andregoto's divorce, making Teresa more likely to have been her mother. It has been suggested that Andregoto remarried and had further children, although the details have not been discovered. Endregota, wife of 11th-century nobleman Sancho Macer√°tiz and mother of his son Sancho S√°nchez, calls Queen Andregoto avuncula, meaning maternal aunt, or more broadly that Endregota derived from the queen's sister. Ubieto Arteta suggested a descent from Andregoto's full-sister, Velasquita Gal√≠ndez.

Although it was not the only such mission, it is the most well-known and possibly most significant in terms of its impact on the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. The mission was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck, based to some degree on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I. The aim of the mission was threefold; to gain recognition for the newly reinstated imperial dynasty under the Emperor Meiji; to begin preliminary renegotiation of the unequal treaties with the dominant world powers; and to make a comprehensive study of modern industrial, political, military and educational systems and structures in the United States and Europe. The Iwakura mission followed several such missions previously sent by the Shogunate, such as the Japanese Embassy to the United States in 1860, the First Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1862, and the Second Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1863. Participants The mission was named after and headed by Iwakura Tomomi in the role of extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador, assisted by four vice-ambassadors, three of whom (≈åkubo Toshimichi, Kido Takayoshi, and It≈ç Hirobumi) were also ministers in the Japanese government. The historian Kume Kunitake as private secretary to Iwakura Tomomi, was the official diarist of the journey. The log of the expedition published in 1878 in five volumes as Tokumei Zenken Taishi Bei-O Kairan Jikki (ÁâπÂëΩÂÖ®Ê®©Â§ß‰ΩøÁ±≥Ê¨ßÂõûË¶ßÂÆüË®ò), provided a detailed account of Japanese observations on the United States and rapidly industrializing Western Europe. Women students of the Iwakura Mission, from the left, Nagai Shigeko (10), Ueda Teiko (16), Yoshimasu Ry≈çko (16), Tsuda Ume (9) and Yamakawa Sutematsu (12)Also included in the mission were a number of administrators and scholars, totaling 48 people. In addition to the mission staff, about 53 students and attendants also joined the outward voyage from Yokohama. Several of the students were left behind to complete their education in the foreign countries, including five young women who stayed in the United States to study, including the then 6-year old Tsuda Umeko, who after returning to Japan, founded the Joshi Eigaku Juku (present day Tsuda University) in 1900, Nagai Shigeko, later Baroness Ury≈´ Shigeko, as well as Yamakawa Sutematsu, later Princess ≈åyama Sutematsu. * Kaneko Kentar≈ç was left in the U.S., too, as a student. In 1890 he was introduced to Theodore Roosevelt. They became friends and their relationship resulted later in Roosevelt's mediation at the end of the Russo-Japanese War and the Treaty of Portsmouth.Baron Kaneko and the Russo-Japanese War, 2009, Part One, Chapter Four * Makino Nobuaki, a student member of the mission was to remark in his memoirs: \\"Together with the abolition of the han system, dispatching the Iwakura Mission to America and Europe must be cited as the most important events that built the foundation of our state after the Restoration.\\" * Nakae Ch≈çmin, who was a member of the mission staff and the Ministry of Justice, stayed in France to study the French legal system with the radical republican Emile Acollas. Later he became a journalist, thinker and translator and introduced French thinkers like Jean- Jacques Rousseau to Japan. Itinerary United States On 23 December 1871 the mission sailed from Yokohama on the , bound for San Francisco. Arriving in San Francisco on 15 January 1872, the group travelled by train via Salt Lake City and Chicago eventually reaching Washington, D.C. on 29 February. The mission's stay in the United States was extended with an attempt to negotiate new treaty rights, a task that necessitated two members of the party to return to Japan to obtain necessary letters of representation. Members of the Iwakura Mission were keenly interested in observing schools and learning more about educational policy. Tours to schools, universities and industrial locations in Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. were made as a result. Unsuccessful in their attempts to renegotiate the existing unequal treaties the party eventually set sail for the United Kingdom in August 1872. United Kingdom On 17 August 1872 the Iwakura Mission arrived at Liverpool on the Cunard steamer Olympus. Traveling to London via Manchester the party spent much of late August and early September in and around the capital inspecting political, academic and military institutions, visiting the British Museum, travelling on the newly constructed London Underground and attending musical concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. After visits to the Royal dockyards at Portsmouth and a day visit to Brighton, the mission split into smaller groups to visit, among other places, Blair Atholl in the Highlands of Scotland, Edinburgh, the Yorkshire Dales and the industrial centers of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne and Bradford. Iwakura Tomomi led the Manchester-Liverpool delegation. A visit that culminated on 7 October in a civic reception and banquet where toasts highlighted the leading role of the region in world manufacturing, technology and municipal administration. In Glasgow, as guests of Lord Blantyre, the delegation stayed at Erskine House and given tours of shipbuilding and steel fabrication facilities on banks of the River Clyde. In Newcastle upon Tyne the group arrived on 21 October staying in the Royal Station Hotel where they met the industrialist Sir William Armstrong. It had been ten years since the Bakufu mission had visited the town, but as a direct result of the visit significant new export orders were obtained for ships and armaments from Tyneside factories. > The gentlemen were attired in ordinary morning costume and except for their > complexion and the oriental cast of their features, they could scarcely be > distinguished from their English companions. :‚Äî Newcastle Daily Chronicle, > 23 October 1872 They visited the Elswick Engine and Ordnance Works with Captain Andrew Noble and George Rendell, inspected the hydraulic engines and the boring and turning departments and examined the construction of Armstrong and Gatling guns. They also visited the Gosforth Colliery, descending into the mine itself. Further visits were made to Bolkcow and Vaughan Iron Works in Middlesbrough and iron- ore mines in Cleveland. The Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber of Commerce arranged a river trip on the Tyne, taking in the High Level Bridge, the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company Hebburn and the Jarrow Chemical Works. From Newcastle upon Tyne the group travelled to Yorkshire, visiting the open countryside and Bolton Abbey prior to inspecting textile manufacturing facilities at Salts Mill in Saltaire and Dean Clough Mill in Halifax. Accompanied by the British Envoy to Japan, Sir Harry Smith Parkes, the group toured not only manufacturing facilities but also village accommodation, schools, almshouses, hospitals and parks provided by Sir Titus Salt and Sir John Crossley for their workers. A visit to Chatsworth House on 30 October was followed by visits to Burton-upon-Trent, Birmingham, Worcester, Stoke on Trent and Chester. The delegation was presented at an official audience with Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 5 December 1872. Another audience with the Prince of Wales took place at Sandringham on 9 December. The party finally left for France on 16 December. France, Germany and the return to Japan Thiers on December 26, 1872.The Iwakura Embassy to the USA and Europe 1871-1873, Kume Kunitake, p.226-227 France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Russia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland were all visited by the mission during the first half of 1873. On the return journey, Egypt, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, and Shanghai were also stopping points en route, although visits in these locations were much shorter. The mission eventually reached Yokohama on 13 September 1873, almost two years after first setting out. Purpose and results Of the initial goals of the mission the aim of revision of the unequal treaties was not achieved, prolonging the mission by almost four months, but also impressing the importance of the second goal on its members. The attempts to negotiate new treaties under better conditions with the foreign governments led to criticism of the mission that members were attempting to go beyond the mandate set by the Japanese government. Members of the mission were nonetheless favorably impressed by industrial modernization seen in America and Europe and the experience of the tour provided them a strong impetus to lead similar modernization initiatives on their return. Commemoration events * In 1997 a special celebration marked the 125th anniversary of the mission's visit to the north-west of England. Led by the Centre for Japanese Studies at the University of Manchester in collaboration with the Osaka Chamber of Commerce, a delegation of over 70 leading industrialists visited the Manchester Region. A Civic Banquet was held in Manchester Town Hall replicating the 1872 Reception. The Lord Mayor attended and received Ambassadors together with a citation from the Japanese Foreign Minister. A Civic Plaque commemorating the anniversary of the Iwakura Mission to Manchester was also inaugurated at the site of the original Manchester Town Hall.

The last three letters of the call sign represented the station's branding as \\"Ring Radio,\\" as in the ringing of a telephone. The station was originally a daytimer operating at 5,000 watts but having to sign-off at night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1970 page B-54 It was the first broadcast home of talk radio personality Neal Boortz, who went onto a long career at WSB and syndicated nationally. Other, now well known talk radio personalities were also heard on the station, including Ronn Owens, later at KGO in San Francisco, Southern Humorist Ludlow Porch, and Barry Young, later at KFYI in Phoenix. In 1982, the station began an experiment by broadcasting the audio feed of CNN Headline News. The call letters were changed to WCNN, a nod to CNN's headquarters being in Atlanta.Jeffrey Leachman - Atlanta, Georgia AM Radio Directory In February 1987, the station switched to an adult standards radio format and changed its call letters to WGTW. Its call sign was a reference to the Atlanta-based classic movie Gone with the Wind, which, ironically, is the favorite movie of CNN founder Ted Turner. The station went by the branding \\"Stardust 680\\" during that time. The radio format failed to gain ratings in the market. In late 1988, chief engineer Bob Mayben and his staff built elaborate studios in the CNN Center (formerly known as The Omni) and became WCNN \\"All News 680\\", with a 24-hour local news format. The CNN Headline News audio returned in June 1990, when the local all-news format failed to generate sufficient ratings. In 1995, WCNN was leased to Cox Radio for a 5-year term. The radio format was switched to Sports Talk as \\"680 The Fan\\". In 1998, the format switched to news/talk to complement WSB's programming. In 2000, when the LMA expired, control of WCNN returned to Dickey Broadcasting. The \\"680 The Fan\\" branding and the sports radio format returned to WCNN.

They also include the Odawa, Saulteaux, Ojibwe (including Mississaugas), Potawatomi, Oji-Cree, and Algonquin peoples. The Anishinaabe speak Anishinaabemowin, or Anishinaabe languages that belong to the Algonquian language family. They historically lived in the Northeast Woodlands and Subarctic. The word Anishinaabeg translates to \\"people from whence lowered\\". Another definition refers to \\"the good humans\\", meaning those who are on the right road or path given to them by the Creator Gitche Manitou, or Great Spirit. Basil Johnston, an Ojibwe historian, linguist, and author wrote that the term's literal translation is \\"Beings Made Out of Nothing\\" or \\"Spontaneous Beings\\". Anishinaabe claims the people were created by divine breath. Anishinaabe is often mistakenly considered a synonym of Ojibwe; however, it refers to a much larger group of tribes. Name Anisnaabe Thunderbird, designed by freehand sign painter Grand Chief Ben Wawia Pictograph of a canoe (top left), Michipeshu (top right), and two giant serpents (chignebikoogs), panel VIII, Agawa Rock, Lake Superior Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada ·êä·ìÇ·îë·ìà·êØ Anishinaabe has many different spellings. Different spelling systems may indicate vowel length or spell certain consonants differently (Anishinabe, Anicinape); meanwhile, variants ending in -eg/ek (Anishinaabeg, Anishinabek) come from an Algonquian plural, while those ending in an -e come from an Algonquian singular. The name Anishinaabe is shortened to Nishnaabe, mostly by Odawa people. The cognate Neshnab√© comes from the Potawatomi, a people long allied with the Odawa and Ojibwe in the Council of Three Fires. The Nipissing, Mississaugas, and Algonquin are identified as Anishinaabe but are not part of the Council of Three Fires. Closely related to the Ojibwe and speaking a language mutually intelligible with Anishinaabemowin (Anishinaabe language) is the Oji-Cree (also known as \\"Severn Ojibwe\\"). Their most common autonym is Anishinini (plural: Anishininiwag) and they call their language Anishininiimowin. Among the Anishinaabe, the Ojibwe collectively call the Nipissings and the Algonquins Odishkwaagamii (those who are at the end of the lake), while those among the Nipissings who identify themselves as Algonquins call the Algonquins proper Om√†miwinini (those who are downstream). Not all Anishinaabemowin- speakers call themselves Anishinaabe. The Ojibwe people who migrated to what are now the prairie provinces of Canada call themselves Nakawƒì(-k) and call their branch of the Anishinaabe language Nakawƒìmowin. (The French ethnonym for the group is Saulteaux). Particular Anishinaabeg groups have different names from region to region. Origins upright According to Anishinabe tradition, and from records of wiigwaasabak (birch bark scrolls), the people migrated from the eastern areas of North America, and from along the East Coast. In old stories, the homeland was called Turtle Island. This comes from the idea that the universe, the Earth, or the continent of North America are all sometimes understood as being the back of a great turtle, a mysterious natural consciousness. The Anishinaabe oral history considers the Anishinaabe peoples as descendants of the Abenaki people and refers to them as the \\"Fathers\\". Another Anishinaabe oral history considers the Abenaki as descendants of the Lenape (Delaware), thus refers to them as \\"Grandfathers\\". However, Cree oral traditions generally consider the Anishinaabe as their descendants, and not the Abenakis. A number of complementary origin concepts exist within the oral traditions of the Anishinaabe. According to the oral history, seven great miigis (radiant/iridescent beings in human form) appeared to the Anishinaabe peoples in the Waabanakiing (Land of the Dawn, i.e., Eastern Land) to teach the people about the midewiwin life-style. One great miigis was too spiritually powerful and would kill people in the Waabanakiing whenever they were in its presence. This being later returned to the depths of the ocean, leaving the six great miigis to teach the people. The Anishinaabe are one of the First Nations in Canada. Clans Artwork depicting Ojibwe cosmology Each of the six miigis established separate doodem (clans) for the people. Of these doodem, five clan systems appeared: # Awaazisii (Bullhead), # Baswenaazhi (Echo-maker, i.e., Crane), # Aan'aawenh (Pintail Duck), # Nooke (Tender, i.e., Bear), and # Moozoonii (Little Moose). Later a sixth was added. # Waabizheshi (Marten). After founding the doodem, the six minis returned to the depths of the ocean as well. Some oral histories surmise that if the seventh miigis had stayed, it would have established the Animikii Thunderbird doom. The powerful miigis returned in a vision relating a prophecy to the people. It said that the Anishinaabeg needed to move west to keep their traditional ways alive, because of the many new settlements and people not of Anishinaabe blood who would soon arrive. The migration path of the Anishinaabe peoples would become a series of smaller Turtle Islands, confirmed by the minis shells (i.e., cowry shells). After receiving assurance from their \\"Allied Brothers\\" (i.e., Mi'kmaq) and \\"Father\\" (i.e., Abnaki) of their safety in crossing other tribal territory, the Anishinaabeg moved inland. They advanced along the St. Lawrence River to the Ottawa River and through to Lake Nipissing, and then to the Great Lakes. The first of these smaller Turtle Islands was Mooniyaa, where Mooniyaang now stands. Here the Anishinaabeg divided into two groups: one that traveled up and settled along the Ottawa River, and the core group who proceeded to the \\"second stopping place\\" near Niagara Falls. By the time the Anishinaabeg established their \\"third stopping place\\" near the present city of Detroit, the Anishinaabeg had divided into six distinct nations: Algonquin, Nipissing, Missisauga, Ojibwa, Odawa and Potawatomi. While the Odawa established their long-held cultural center on Manitoulin Island, the Ojibwe established their center in the Sault Ste. Marie region of Ontario, Canada. With the expansion of trade with the French and later the British, fostered by the availability of European small arms, members of the Council of Three Fires expanded southward to the Ohio River, southwestward along the Illinois River, and westward along Lake Superior, Lake of the Woods and the northern Great Plains. In their western expansion, the Ojibwa again divided, forming the Saulteaux, the seventh major branch of the Anishinaabeg. As the Anishinaabeg moved inland, through both alliances and conquest, they incorporated various other closely related Algonquian peoples into the Anishinaabe Nation. These included, but were not limited to, the Noquet (originally part of the Menomini Tribe) and Mandwe (originally part of the Fox). Other incorporated groups can generally be identified by the individual's Doodem (Clan). Migizi-doodem (Bald Eagle Clan) generally identifies those whose ancestors were from the area of the present-day United States and Ma'iingan-doodem (Wolf Clan) as Santee Sioux. Other Anishinaabe doodem thought to have migrated out of the core Anishinaabeg groupings, such as the Nibiinaabe-doodem (Merman Clan), which is now the \\"Water-spirit Clan\\" of the Winnebago or Ho-Chunk. Anishinaabe peoples now reside throughout North America, in both the northern United States and southern Canada, chiefly around the Great Lakes and Lake Winnipeg. After this migration and the immigration of European newcomers to North America, many Anishinaabe tribe chiefs were coerced into signing treaties‚Äîin a language they did not speak nor could read‚Äîwith the governments of the Dominion of Canada and the United States. Treaty 3 (of the Numbered Treaties) in Canada was signed in 1873 between the Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) people west of the Great Lakes and the government of Canada. Through other treaties and resulting relocations, some Anishinaabeg now reside in the states of Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana in the United States, and the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia in Canada.  Relations with European settlers  The first of the Anishinaabe to encounter European settlers were those of the Three Fires Confederation, within the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania in the territory of the present-day United States, and southern Ontario and Quebec of Canada. Although there were many peaceful interactions between the Anishinaabeg and the European settlers, there were also times of turmoil and war. Warfare cost many lives on both sides. The Anishinaabe dealt with Europeans through the fur trade, intermarriage, and performance as allies. Europeans traded with the Anishinaabe for their furs in exchange for goods and also hired the men as guides throughout the lands of North America. The Anishinaabeg women (as well as other Aboriginal groups) began to intermarry with fur traders and trappers. Some of their descendants would later create a M√©tis ethnic group. Explorers, trappers, and other European workers married or had unions with other Anishinaabeg women, and their descendants tended to form a M√©tis culture. French colonialists The earliest Europeans to encounter native peoples in the Great Lakes area were the French voyageurs. These men were professional canoe-paddlers who transported furs and other merchandise over long distances in the lake and river system of northern America. Such explorers gave French names to many places in present-day Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin. The French were mainly trappers and traders rather than settlers. So in general they got along with the native peoples much better than the English did, who often were settlers and took the land from the native inhabitants of the country. Much more often French people intermarried with American native women. British colonialists The ethnic identities of the Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potawatomi did not develop until after the Anishinaabeg reached Michilimackinac on their journey westward from the Atlantic coast. Using the Midewiwin scrolls, Potawatomi elder Shop-Shewana dated the formation of the Council of Three Fires to 796 AD at Michilimackinac. In this Council, the Ojibwa were addressed as the \\"Older Brother\\", the Odawa as the \\"Middle Brother\\", and the Potawatomi as the \\"Younger Brother\\". Consequently, when the three Anishinaabe nations are mentioned in this specific order: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi, it implies the Council of Three Fires as well. Each tribe had different functions: the Ojibwa were the \\"keepers of the faith\\", the Odawa the \\"keepers of trade,\\" and the Potawatomi are the \\"keepers/maintainers of/for the fire\\" (boodawaadam). This was the basis for their exonyms of Boodewaadamii (Ojibwe spelling) or Bod√©wadmi (Potawatomi spelling). The Ottawa (also Odawa, Ottawa, Outaouais, or Trader) are a Native American and First Nations people. Ojibwe, Ojibwa, Chippewa (or Anishinaabemowin in Eastern Ojibwe syllabics) is the third most commonly spoken Native language in Canada (after Cree and Inuktitut), and the fourth most spoken in North America (behind Navajo, Cree, and Inuktitut). Potawatomi is a Central Algonquian language. It is spoken around the Great Lakes in Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as in Kansas in the United States. In southern Ontario in Canada, it is spoken by fewer than 50 people. Though the Three Fires had several meeting places, they preferred Michilimackinac due to its central location. The Council met for military and political purposes. The Council maintained relations with other nations, both fellow Anishinaabeg: the Ozaagii (Sac), Odagaamii (Meskwaki), Omanoominii (Menominee), and non- Anishinaabeg: Wiinibiigoo (Ho-Chunk), Naadawe (Iroquois Confederacy), Nii'inaa-Naadawe (Wyandot), Naadawensiw (Sioux), Wemitigoozhi (France), Zhaaganaashi (England) and the Gichi-mookomaan (the United States). After the Europeans came into the country, the French built Fort Michilimackinac in the 18th century. After the Seven Years' War, the victorious English took over the fort, also using it as a trading post. Through the totem-system (a totem is any entity which watches over or assists a group of people, such as a family, clan or tribe) and promotion of trade, the Council generally had a peaceful existence with its neighbours. However, occasional unresolved disputes erupted into wars. The Council notably fought against the Iroquois Confederacy and the Sioux. During the Seven Years' War, the Council fought with France and against England, as it had longstanding trade relationships with the French. Conventional war however was a European import, complete with its signature of high casualty, cruelty and focus on resource acquisition. Ceremonial warfare that was the predominant mode prior to European contact parallels older forms of European chivalry, where combatants met oftentimes one-on-one honor bouts. These matches did not always end in casualties and they had no component of political or material gain attached. Later, the Anishinaabeg established a relationship with the British similar to that they had with the French. They formed the Three Fires Confederation in reaction to conflict with encroaching settlers and continuing tensions with the British Canadian government, as well as that of the new United States after it established independence at the end of the eighteenth century. The letters of Colonel Henry Boquet and Jeffery Amherst of the British army reveal a plan to eliminate Anishnaabe people through the intentional distribution of smallpox infected materials at Fort Pitt circa 1763. Peter Harstead's article 'Sickness and Disease on the Wisconsin frontier' (1959) chronicles similar efforts made by Americans (the fur company at Mackinac circa 1770). In the latter case, a cask of liquor was wrapped in a flag. Instructions were given that this gift not be opened until the Anishnaabe people present had returned to their home communities. Opening the gift early at Fon Du Lac people began to get sick, and one who had seen the disease before in Montreal recognized it as smallpox. United States During the Northwest Indian War and the War of 1812, the Three Fires Confederacy fought against the United States. Many Anishinaabe refugees from the Revolutionary War, particularly Odawa and Potawatomi, migrated north to British-held areas. Those who remained east of the Mississippi River were subjected to the 1830 Indian Removal policy of the United States; among the Anishinaabeg, the Potawatomi were most affected. The Odawa had been removed from the settlers' paths, so only a handful of communities experienced removal. For the Ojibwa, removal attempts culminated in the Sandy Lake Tragedy and several hundred deaths. The Potawatomi avoided removal only by escaping into Ojibwa-held areas and hiding from US officials. William Whipple Warren (1825‚Äì1853), a United States man of mixed Ojibwe and European descent, became an interpreter, assistant to a trader to the Ojibwe, and legislator of the Minnesota Territory. A gifted storyteller and historian, he collected native accounts and wrote the History of the Ojibway People, Based Upon Traditions and Oral Statements, first published by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1885, some 32 years after his early death from tuberculosis. Given his Anglo- American father, Lyman Marcus Warren, and American education, the Ojibwe of the time did not consider Warren as \\"one of them\\". However, they retained friendly relations with him and considered him as a \\"half brother\\" due to his extensive knowledge of the Ojibwe language and culture and the fact that he had Ojibwe ancestry through his mixed Ojibwe-French mother, Marie Cadotte. His work covered much of the culture and history of the Ojibwe, gathered from stories of the Ojibwe Nation. Warren identified the Crane and Loon clans as the two Chief clans among his mother's Anishinaabe people. Crane Clan was responsible for external governmental relationships, and Loon Clan was responsible for internal governance relationships. Warren believed that the British and United States governments had deliberately destroyed the clan system, or the polity of governance when they forced indigenous nations to adopt representative government and direct elections of chiefs. Further, he believed such destruction led to many wars among the Anishinaabe. He also cited the experiences of other Native Nations in the US (such as the Creek, Fox, and others). His work in its entirety demonstrated the significance of the clan system. After the Sandy Lake Tragedy, the government changed its policy to relocating tribes onto reservations, often by consolidating groups of communities. Conflict continued through the 19th century, as Native Americans and the United States had different goals. After the Dakota War of 1862, many Anishinaabe communities in Minnesota were relocated and further consolidated.  Relations with their neighbours  Anishinaabe Reserves/Reservations in North America, with diffusion rings if an Anishinaabe language is spoken. Cities with Anishinaabe population also shown.  Other indigenous groups  There are many Anishinaabeg reserves and reservations; in some places, the Anishinaabeg share some of their lands with others, such as the Cree, the Dakota, Delaware, and the Kickapoo, among others. The Anishnabeg who \\"merged\\" with the Kickapoo tribe may now identify as being Kickapoo in Kansas and Oklahoma. The Prairie Potawatomi were the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi of Illinois and Wisconsin who were relocated to Kansas during the 19th century. The Anishinaabe of Manitoba, particularly those along the east side of Lake Winnipeg, have had longstanding historical conflicts with the Cree people.  Canada  In addition to other issues shared by First Nations recognized by the Canadian government and other aboriginal peoples in Canada, the Anishinaabe of Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec have opposed the Energy East pipeline of TransCanada. The Chippewas of the Thames First Nation legally challenged the right of the Canadian government to hold a pipeline hearing without their consent. The project was also the basis of a June 2015 declaration of reclaimed sovereignty over the Ottawa River valley by several Anishinaabe peoples.  United States  The relationship between the various Anishinaabe communities and the United States government has been steadily improving since the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act. Several Anishinaabe communities still experience tensions with the state governments, county governments, and non-Native American individuals and their groups. In contemporary times, the Anishinaabe have worked to renew the clan system as a model for self-governance. They have drawn from the work of Ojibwe educator Edward Benton-Banai, who emphasizes education based on one's own culture. They believe using the clan system will also be a basis for the cultural and political revitalization of the people. Clan originally meant extended family. In this system originally clans were represented by a changing cast of spokespeople at yearly meetings. In more recent times, clans have come to align personality characteristics with the animals that represent them. This shifts the focus from extended family governance to groups of people who have a particular kind of strength to offer to the community. For example, the deer clan is sometimes understood as having the direction of hospitality toward visitors, whereas the crane clan or eagle clan, depending on region, may be aligned with leadership qualities. Conversations surrounding how to change current systems of governance to better match how the people governed themselves over millennia are always occurring throughout Anishinaabe Aki. Major issues facing the various Anishinaabe communities are: * cultural and language preservation or revitalization; * full and independent federal recognition: some Anishinaabe communities are recognized by county or state governments, or are recognized by the federal government only as part of another tribe; * band government is not always looked on as legitimate by the communities it claims to represent. This is because the original band council system was imposed by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments as a pseudo- representative conciliatory puppet system that helped the supposed protectorate of the reservation (which was originally conceived as segregation). In many cases, despite its inherent drawbacks the people have successfully used the band council system at times to forward the well-being of the community. At other times, the band council system has been used as an insider trading house where federal governments and corporate partners manipulate deals that have the appearance of legitimacy, when in fact they have only persuaded members of a momentarily non-representative band council. * one major discrepancy between the band council system and older systems of governance is the imposed presence of a Chief. European colonists when encountering Sachems (whose sole authority was to negotiate land use between family groups so that over-hunting would not occur) erroneously believed they were encountering village or community headmen. This historical error has had devastating effects on the formulation of local governance as many of the people themselves have come to believe that older systems of governance were hierarchical when in fact they were purely horizontal in power distribution between individuals. * treaty rights: traditional means of support (hunting, fishing, and gathering), the establishment of reservations or upholding of the reservation boundaries per treaties and their amendments; * personal health: diabetes and asthma affect many Anishinaabe communities at a rate higher than the general population; and * mistrust of mainstream medicine: non-consensual sterilization practiced in the Indian Health Service (IHS) in the US, among other shortcomings and abuses has compromised the relationship between Anishnaabeg and practitioners of mainstream medicine. Mainstream medicine is still used, but oftentimes with great reluctance and caution. * relationship with law enforcement: since its inception, the reservation system has been accompanied by oftentimes severe police brutality and a systematized effort to use the prison system to silence and terrorize Anishnaabeg. Even in some cases where police may be hired by the band council, brutality persists. This is often due to the aforementioned nebulousness of band council relevance, and the band councils sometimes penchant for corruption. Anishnaabeg communities constantly face having to make legal and policy reforms to address problems of this nature. * social disparity: many Anishinaabeg suffer poor education, high unemployment, substance abuse/addiction and domestic violence at rates higher than the general population. These are symptomatic social characteristics of reflected in nearly all communities that endure long occupations by foreign armies. Education In June 1994, the Chiefs at the Anishinabek Grand Council gathering at Rocky Bay First Nation, directed that the Education Directorate formally establish the Anishinabek Education Institute (AEI) in accordance with the post-secondary education model that was submitted and ratified with provisions for satellite campuses and a community-based delivery system. (Res. 94/13) In August 2017 the Anishinabek Nation in Ontario and the government of Canada signed an agreement allowing the Anishinabek Nation to control the classroom curriculum and school resources of its Kindergarten-to- Grade 12 education system in 23 communities. Approximately 8% of Anishinabek students attend schools on-reserve. See also * Anishinaabe tribal political organizations Notes References * Benton-Banai, Edward. (2004). Creation‚ÄîFrom the Ojibwa.

The stadium, which also contains the headquarters of the Malta Football Association, seats 16,997 people and is, by far, the largest stadium in the country. It serves as the national football stadium of Malta and is the home stadium of the Malta national football team. The stadium, together with three other stadiums, also hosts the Maltese Premier League.  History   Background and early years  Although officially the new stadium was inaugurated on 6 December 1981 with a Maltese Premier League encounter between Zurrieq F.C. and Senglea Athletic F.C., certain records suggest that the stadium was already up and running by May 1981. Indeed, newspapers extracts indicate that the stadium hosted the final of the first ever national championship organised by the now defunct Malta Football Federation (not to be mixed with the Malta Football Association, which at that time was known as the Main Football Association) between Valletta Vanguards FC and Birkirkara St. Joseph Sports Club on 3 May 1981.http://www.bkarastjoseph.com/index.php?id=238 The highest ever attendance at the Stadium was on during a 1986 World Cup Qualifier encounter between Malta and West Germany played on 16 December 1984, when 35,102 people turned up to watch Malta narrowly lose to the runners up of the previous World Cup.https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=8211  The Millennium Stand  Entrance to the Millennium Stand On 3 September, 2002, the Malta Football Association inaugurated the Millennium Stand.https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20020904/sport/millennium- stand-inaugurated.167835 The Millennium Stand replaced the 5,000 seater East Stand, which had been declared as a dangerous structure for a number of years by then and hence had to be demolished. The construction of the Millennium Stand, which costed 3.5 million Maltese lira, Malta's currency before the introduction of the Euro, was regarded as the \\"biggest infrastructural project ever undertaken by the Malta Football Association\\" whereas the stand itself has been described as \\"the jewel in the Malta FA's crown\\".https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20020904/sport/millennium- stand- inaugurated.167835https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20020924/letters/millions- for-the-millennium-stand.166602  Pitch Resurfacing  In 2016, the Maltese Football Association announced a ‚Ç¨1.5 million project to replace the old grass surface with a modern hybrid grass surface, with the latter having been in service for 35 years.

The university identifies 1860 as the year of its founding, the same as its Rock Island, Illinois Swedish-heritage sister school, Augustana College. It derives its name from the Confessio Augustana, or Augsburg Confession, a foundational document of Lutheranism. Prior to September 2015, the university was known as Augustana College. It is the largest private university in the state and offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in more than 50 major fields of study. Students also participate in a variety of extracurricular activities, including musical ensembles and NCAA athletic programs. History The institution traces its origin to 1835, when Scandinavian immigrants established the Hillsboro Academy in Hillsboro, Illinois. In 1846, the Academy became the Literary and Theological Institute of the Lutheran Church of the Far West before moving to Springfield, Illinois under the name Illinois State University. In 1860, after church leaders formed the Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod, Professor Lars Paul Esbj√∂rn and a group of followers moved to Chicago to create their own institution. There they established the Augustana College and Seminary, marking the date that the university identifies as the year of its founding. As the United States expanded westward during and after the American Civil War, pioneers moved the school to Paxton, Illinois in 1863. There, a split occurred: the Norwegian leadership, desiring to create their own school, relocated to Marshall, Wisconsin in 1869, while the Swedes later moved to Rock Island, Illinois, establishing Augustana College (Illinois). The school at Marshall moved to Beloit, Iowa in 1881, and then to Canton, South Dakota in 1888. The Lutheran Normal School opened in 1889 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, housed in what is now known as Old Main, with the purpose of educating teachers. City and business leaders lobbied for Augustana to relocate to Sioux Falls, and church leaders in 1918 merged the Lutheran Normal School and Augustana College in Canton under the name Augustana College and Normal School. In 1926, \\"and Normal School\\" was dropped from the name and the site in Canton eventually became Augustana Academy. Despite the similarities in name, the Academy was no longer affiliated with the College and ultimately closed in 1971. The 2010‚Äì2011 academic year marked Augustana University's sesquicentennial. Augustana draws its name from the origin of the Lutheran Church in the Augsburg Confession, written in 1530 during the Protestant Reformation. \\"Augustana\\" stems from the document's Latin name, Confessio Augustana. On August 21, 2015, the school announced that it would change its name from Augustana College and instead be known as Augustana University as of September 1, 2015. Previous Names Literary and Theological Institute of the Lutheran Church of the Far West Academics Augustana University offers 53 majors, 34 minors, and 15 pre- professional programs. The top five most popular majors are nursing, biology, business administration, elementary education and psychology. The university's curriculum is based on a calendar divided into two 15-week semesters, separated by an interim period of four weeks during January, as well as an optional summer term of eight weeks. Classes may be taken during the month of January. The school offers a 12:1 student-to-faculty ratio, and notable professors include L. Adrien Hannus and V.R Nelson. Graduation requires completion of 124 total credit hours, 59 of which are general education courses, with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. \\"The Augustana Plan,\\" the name of the 59 credit core curriculum, is \\"designed to develop articulate communicators, competent writers, creative thinkers, skilled problem solvers, and ethically minded, responsible citizens of the world.\\" Extensive internship, study-abroad, undergraduate research and Civitas, the university's honors program, supplement the curriculum. Between 2007 and 2008, 285 students participated in an international educational experience, and 44% of students study abroad before graduation. In 2017, U.S. News & World Report reported Augustana's financial endowment at $67.2 million. Donations have allowed the school to expand its academic facilities, such as the recent $7 million renovation of the Mikkelsen Library and the planned $45 million reconstruction of the Gilbert Science Complex. Admissions and rankings , Augustana's student body consists of 1,825 undergraduates, 99% of whom are full-time students and 1% part-time, 59% were female. The acceptance rate stands at 61%. U.S. News & World Report classifies Augustana as a \\"more selective\\" school, with 62% of the students enrolled having graduated from high school in the top quartile of their class, the average GPA being 3.7. ACT test score submissions had a 23‚Äì28 middle 50% range, with an average ACT composite score of 26. Eight percent of incoming students in 2014 submitted SAT scores, with the middle 50% range for the mathematical and critical reading components being 500‚Äì650 and 510‚Äì580, respectively. The school's retention rate of freshmen returning as sophomores was 80% between 2013 and 2014. Those enrolled are primarily from South Dakota (42%) and Minnesota (34%), followed by Iowa (12%) and Nebraska (4%). In the fall of the 2010‚Äì2011 academic year, Augustana reported its largest ever incoming class of international students. Fifty-four new students representing 20 countries and 5 continents joined 25 continuing international students for a total of 79 international students from 23 countries, making up about 4.5% of the student body. Although only 46% of students claim a preference for the school's Lutheran religious affiliation, the school is nevertheless composed primarily of students following another Christian denomination, Catholicism being the second largest at 21%; 22% of students, meanwhile, are categorized under \\"other.\\" Campus statute of Ole, Augustana's mascot In the 2015 U.S. News & World Report ranking of Midwestern colleges, Augustana placed third. The publication additionally named it a \\"Best Buy\\" school, the award based on academic quality in relation to attendance costs. The Princeton Review named Augustana as one of 159 \\"Best in the Midwest\\" schools in 2015. Forbes' list of \\"America's Top Colleges\\" placed Augustana at #97 among schools in the Midwest and #423 overall. Peterson's 440 Colleges for Top Students featured Augustana, and Harvard Schmarvard: Getting Beyond the Ivy League to the College That is Best for You listed the school as one of its \\"top 100 outstanding (but under- appreciated) colleges.\\" The Templeton Guide selected Augustana as one of 100 select colleges and universities nationwide as part of its \\"Templeton Honor Roll.\\"  Arts  Replica of Michelangelo's Moses at Augustana University Augustana created the Center for Western Studies in 1970, which serves as a library, repository for special collections of art and artifacts, and academic publisher. The center holds an annual Dakota Conference on the Northern Plains for history, literature, art, and archaeology. It is \\"the largest annual humanities conference specifically about the Northern Plains.\\" In addition to shows and galleries of Western, Scandinavian, and Native American art, the Center also hosts the Boe Forum on Public Affairs, which has featured speakers such as Pervez Musharraf, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Mikhail Gorbachev. The Augustana Choir and Concert Band tour widely nationally and internationally, including the People's Republic of China, Italy, and Tanzania. The band, while on tour in Egypt during the Revolution of 2011, found themselves briefly stranded in Cairo due to anti-government protests. The Augustana College Theatre Company presents several main-stage shows each year, one of which is a musical, as well as several student produced shows by the Augustana College Theatrical Society. The department furthermore serves as home to the Claire Donaldson New Play Festival (previously called the 8-in-48 Claire Donaldson Short Play Festival), which occurs every other year. In 2006, the new Center for Visual Arts replaced the old art department buildings, previously used as barracks during World War II. It holds artist and professor studios, studio classrooms for design, drawing, printmaking, painting, sculpture, ceramics, and an art education lab. In addition, the building houses the Eide-Dalrymple Gallery, which hosts several art exhibitions throughout the year.  Civitas  Augustana's honors program, Civitas, was launched in 2007 and is currently directed by Sociology professor Wiiliam J. Swart. The program is named Civitas, a Latin word meaning \\"citizenship,\\" and is built upon the work of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor and theologian who acted as a founding member of the Confessing Church and a participant in the German resistance movement against Nazism. Bonhoeffer's essay \\"The Structure of Responsible Life\\" serves as the central focus of the program. Emphasizing Stellvertretung (roughly translated as \\"vicarious representative action\\"), Bonhoeffer participated in the Abwehr plot to assassinate Hitler, and subsequently wrote the piece as a justification for his actions. Students examine his work in classes specifically designated for Civitas and in special honors sections of existing courses. 40 students are selected from each graduating class, of whom must maintain at minimum a 3.0 GPA, with entrance priority going to incoming students who possess an ACT score of at least 27 and a 3.5 cumulative high school GPA. Natural sciences An average of 90% of graduating seniors seeking admission into medical school have been accepted over the last three years, double the national acceptance rate, and the school claims a consistent 100% placement record of nursing graduates. Construction began on the new Froiland Science Complex in August 2014, involving additions to and renovations of the existing Gilbert Science Center, and was completed in December 2015. The remodeled west wing of the building maintains the Gilbert name. Athletics Kirkeby‚ÄìOver Stadium, seats over 6,500 fans The Augustana Vikings currently participate in NCAA Division II athletics in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference. The Vikings joined the NSIC from the North Central Conference, which folded in 2008. The men's basketball team won the NCAA Division II national championship in 2016. The women's basketball team advanced to the NCAA Division II Final Four in 2013. The men's baseball team won the NCAA Division II national championship in 2018. During both the 2004‚Äì2005 and 2009‚Äì2010 school years, Augustana wrestlers finished second in the NCAA Division II championship. The Sioux Falls Arena serves at the home court for the men's and women's basketball team. The Elmen Center, opened in 1989, serves as the home court for the volleyball team and wrestling team. On December 13, 2018, President Stephanie Herseth Sandlin announced that Augustana would begin pursuing a transition to Division I as part of the University's \\"Vision 2030\\" plan.  Media  The college used to operate a radio station, 89.1 FM KAUR, which broadcast 24 hours per day. Up until 2009, KAUR broadcast a variety of genres of music and specialized in independent or college rock. KAUR was founded in 1972 and Augustana University also once managed a self-constructed AM station, which, itself, was founded in 1945. In the spring of 2009, administrators at Augustana University decided to discontinue KAUR's student operations in favor of broadcasting Minnesota Public Radio News.

The expanded canal allowed freighters to haul copper from the rich copper mines of the Keweenaw Peninsula out through Lake Superior to larger cities. It also enabled supply boats and freighters to reach the cities of Houghton and Hancock, which supplied goods to most of Michigan's copper region. The expanded canal and shipping lane has a depth of , deeper in some locations. As the waterway connects Lake Superior to itself, there are no locks needed.Army Corps of Engineers - Keweenaw Waterway Summary PageArmy Corps of Engineers data sheet The local mines' stamp mills dumped large quantities of stamp sand (containing traces of copper and chemical leaching agents) into the waterway, causing significant environmental damage near the sand dumps. Stamp mills on the waterway included the Old Atlantic, old Quincy, Pewabic, old Franklin, and the Isle Royale mills. The area north of the waterway is known locally as Copper Island, because the waterway separates the northern part of the Keweenaw Peninsula from the mainland. The only land route across the waterway is US 41/M-26 across the Portage Lake Lift Bridge.

When the big toe is involved, it is known as \\"turf toe\\". Causes Turf toe is named from the injury being associated with playing sports on rigid surfaces such as artificial turf and is a fairly common injury among professional American football players. Often, the injury occurs when someone or something falls on the back of the calf while that leg's knee and tips of the toes are touching the ground. The toe is hyperextended and thus the joint is injured. Additionally, athletic shoes with very flexible soles combined with cleats that \\"grab\\" the turf will cause overextension of the big toe. This can occur on the lesser toes as well. It has also been observed in sports beyond American football, including soccer, basketball, rugby, volleyball, and tae kwon do. This is a primary reason why many athletes prefer natural grass to turf, because it is softer. Diagnosis Treatment  The injury can be debilitating for athletes of many sports who need to accelerate, quickly change direction, or jump. Use of the toes is not possible during the healing process. Since the toes are necessary for proper push-off when accelerating, those sorts of athletic activities should be almost completely curtailed. An extended healing period of one or more months is often required. Because of the anatomy of the distal foot and the unique use of the foot, it is often impossible to properly tape or brace the joint. Although difficult, it is not impossible to tape the toe to limit extension (upward bend of toe). Additionally, wearing a shoe with a rigid sole (often a metal plate) and cushioned innersole will help minimize extension of the joint. Anti-inflammatory medication as well as physical therapy is recommended. Turf toe is usually healed in about 2‚Äì3 weeks. It can become more serious if left untreated, and may cause serious problems for the athlete. Treating the injury includes icing of the area, elevating the foot, or possibly the use of custom orthotics.

Biography  Freeman was born in Randolph, Massachusetts on October 31, 1852, to Eleanor Lothrop and Warren Edward Wilkins, who originally baptized her \\"Mary Ella\\".Fishinger, Sondra. \\"Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, 1852‚Äì1930\\", in Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1997: 139. Freeman's parents were orthodox Congregationalists, bestowing a very strict childhood.Freeman, Mary E. Wilkins. \\"The Norton Anthology of American Literature\\". seventh ed. Vol. C. Ed. Nina Baym. New York: Norton & Company, 2007. Pg. 625-26. Religious constraints play a key role in some of her works. In 1867, the family moved to Brattleboro, Vermont, where Freeman graduated from the local high school before attending Mount Holyoke College (then, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary) in South Hadley, Massachusetts, for one year, from 1870‚Äì71. She later finished her education at Glenwood Seminary in West Brattleboro.Fishinger, Sondra. \\"Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, 1852‚Äì1930\\", in Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1997: 140. When the family's dry goods business in Vermont failed in 1873, the family returned to Randolph, Massachusetts. Freeman's mother died three years later, and she changed her middle name to \\"Eleanor\\" in her memory. Freeman's father died suddenly in 1883, leaving her without any immediate family and an estate worth only $973. Wilkins returned to her hometown of Randolph. She moved in with a friend, Mary J. Wales, and began writing as her only source of income.Fishinger, Sondra. \\"Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, 1852‚Äì1930\\", in Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1997: 141. During a visit to Metuchen, New Jersey in 1892, she met Dr. Charles Manning Freeman, a non- practicing medical doctor seven years younger than she. After years of courtship and delays, the two were married on January 1, 1902. Immediately after, she firmly established her name as \\"Mary E. Wilkins Freeman\\", which she asked Harper's to use on all of her work. The couple built a home in Metuchen, where Freeman became a local celebrity for her writing, despite having occasionally published satirical fictional representations of her neighbors. Her husband suffered from alcoholism and an addiction to sleeping powders. He also had a reputation for driving fast horses,and womanizing. He was committed to the New Jersey State Hospital for the Insane in Trenton, and the two legally separated a year later. After his death in 1923, he left the majority of his wealth to his chauffeur and only one dollar to his former wife. In April 1926, Freeman became the first recipient of the William Dean Howells Medal for Distinction in Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Freeman suffered a heart attack and died in Metuchen on March 15, 1930, aged 77. She was laid to rest in Hillside Cemetery in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.  Adolescence  As an adolescent, Freeman was increasingly caught between the need for her mother's love and her instinct to avoid becoming her mother and subsiding into her mother's form of passivity. Despite continuous pressure from her mother to participate in domestic chores, no amount of discipline could pull Mary away from her reading to the reality of hated kitchen work. According to Edward Foster's biography of Freeman, \\"Disliking her household duties, she avoided them, nor could she be moved by disciplinary tactics.\\" It is clear that a growing tension between Mary and her mother centered on her resistance to undertaking the tasks expected of a \\"good girl.\\" As the years passed, the contrast between Mary and her sister, Anna, became apparent. While her sister Anna willingly undertook domestic work and increasingly met her parents' expectations, Mary quietly began to reject them. She would resist her mother's world of domesticity throughout her entire life. Her story, \\"The Revolt of Mother\\" is especially significant in this context, for the story seems to have been written as a tribute to her mother's work, a form of work she had never valued in her mother's lifetime. Writing left Freeman began writing stories and verse for children while still a teenager to help support her family and was quickly successful. Her career as a short story writer launched in 1881 when she took first place in a short story contest with her submission ‚ÄúThe Ghost Family.‚Äù When the supernatural caught her interest, the result was a group of short stories which combined domestic realism with supernaturalism and these have proved very influential. Her best known work was written in the 1880s and 1890s while she lived in Randolph. She produced more than two dozen volumes of published short stories and novels. She is best known for two collections of stories, A Humble Romance and Other Stories (1887) and A New England Nun and Other Stories (1891). Her stories deal mostly with New England life. Freeman is also remembered for her novel Pembroke (1894), and she contributed a notable chapter to the collaborative novel entitled The Whole Family (1908). Through her different genres of work including children's stories, poems, and short stories, Mary Wilkins Freeman sought to demonstrate her values as a feminist. During the time which she was writing, she did this in nonconventional ways; for example, she diverged from making her female characters weak and in need of help which was a common trope in literature. Through characters such as Louisa in her short story: ‚ÄúA New England Nun,‚Äù Freeman challenges contemporary ideas concerning female roles, values, and relationships in society. Also, Freeman's short story ‚ÄúThe Revolt of 'Mother'\\" illustrated the struggles of rural women and the role they played within their families. ‚ÄúThe Revolt of 'Mother'‚Äù initiated the discussion on the rights of rural woman, went on to inspire many more pieces discussing the lack of control rural woman had over families finances, and looking to improve the structure of farm families in the early twentieth-century. The one-act opera The Village Singer by Stephen Paulus was adapted from a Freeman short story; it was commissioned by Opera Theater of Saint Louis, and was premiered in 1979. left Although she produced a dozen volumes of short stories and as many novels, Freeman is remembered chiefly for the first two collections of stories, A Humble Romance and Other Stories (1887) and A New England Nun and Other Stories(1891), and the novel Pembroke (1894) (Britannica Encyclopedia).

For Pierre Gilliard and Alexander Spiridovich, Vyrubova had been ignorant and devoid of common sense when she entered the court. The latter said she openly became Rasputin's \\"fanatical admirer, the driving force of his cult, and was at the head of his loyalists\\" For a long time she served as a go-between for the Tsarina and Rasputin. In the Summer of 1914 Vyrubova received a cable from Rasputin, recovering from the attack by Khioniya Guseva in a Tyumen hospital. She had to show it directly to the Tsar Nicholas II. Rasputin was fearful of the consequences of war with Germany. Nicholas had been furious, but Anna arranged a reunion.Fuhrmann, p. 132. While seldom meeting with Alexandra personally after the debate in the Imperial Duma, Rasputin had become her personal adviser after the Tsar took supreme command of the Russian armies in the field on 23 August 1915 (O.S.), hoping this would lift morale. All contacts between the Tsarina and Rasputin went through Vyrubova; every morning at ten she phoned Rasputin and he came to visit her lemon-yellow house in Tsarskoye Selo to meet Alexandra. The Tsar's biggest concern was that Alexandra might share information with others.Fuhrmann, p. 151. During World War I she trained as a Red Cross nurse and nursed soldiers along with the Tsarina and the Tsarina's two older daughters, The Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana. Vyrubova was severely injured in a train accident between the capital and Tsarskoye Selo in January 1915; the convalescent Vyrubova found herself a paraplegic, but credited Rasputin with saving her life with his prayers.Vyrubova In September 1916 she, Lili Dehn and Rasputin went to Tobolsk to pay tribute to John of Tobolsk, who had been glorified.\\"The Life and Tragedy of Alexandra Feodorovna ‚Äì Empress of Russia\\".

Similarly, , a polynomial of degree , is called antipalindromic if for . That is, a polynomial is antipalindromic if . Examples From the properties of the binomial coefficients, it follows that the polynomials are palindromic for all positive integers , while the polynomials are palindromic when is even and antipalindromic when is odd. Other examples of palindromic polynomials include cyclotomic polynomials and Eulerian polynomials. Properties * If is a root of a polynomial that is either palindromic or antipalindromic, then is also a root and has the same multiplicity. for the palindromic case only * The converse is true: If a polynomial is such that if is a root then is also a root of the same multiplicity, then the polynomial is either palindromic or antipalindromic. * For any polynomial , the polynomial is palindromic and the polynomial is antipalindromic. * Any polynomial can be written as the sum of a palindromic and an antipalindromic polynomial. * The product of two palindromic or antipalindromic polynomials is palindromic. * The product of a palindromic polynomial and an antipalindromic polynomial is antipalindromic. * A palindromic polynomial of odd degree is a multiple of (it has ‚Äì1 as a root) and its quotient by is also palindromic. * An antipalindromic polynomial is a multiple of (it has 1 as a root) and its quotient by is palindromic. * An antipalindromic polynomial of even degree is a multiple of (it has -1 and 1 as a roots) and its quotient by is palindromic. * If is a palindromic polynomial of even degree , then there is a polynomial of degree such that (Durand 1961). * If is a monic antipalindromic polynomial of even degree over a field with odd characteristic, then it can be written uniquely as , where is a monic polynomial of degree with no constant term. * If an antipalindromic polynomial has even degree , then its \\"middle\\" coefficient (of power ) is 0 since . Real coefficients A polynomial with real coefficients all of whose complex roots lie on the unit circle in the complex plane (all the roots are unimodular) is either palindromic or antipalindromic. Conjugate reciprocal polynomials A polynomial is conjugate reciprocal if p(x) \\\\equiv p^{\\\\dagger}(x) and self-inversive if p(x) = \\\\omega p^{\\\\dagger}(x) for a scale factor on the unit circle. If is the minimal polynomial of with , and has real coefficients, then is self-reciprocal. This follows because :z_0^n\\\\overline{p(1/\\\\bar{z_0})} = z_0^n\\\\overline{p(z_0)} = z_0^n\\\\bar{0} = 0. So is a root of the polynomial z^n\\\\overline{p(\\\\bar{z}^{-1})} which has degree . But, the minimal polynomial is unique, hence :cp(z) = z^n\\\\overline{p(\\\\bar{z}^{-1})} for some constant , i.e. ca_i=\\\\overline{a_{n-i}}=a_{n-i}. Sum from to and note that 1 is not a root of . We conclude that . A consequence is that the cyclotomic polynomials are self-reciprocal for . This is used in the special number field sieve to allow numbers of the form and to be factored taking advantage of the algebraic factors by using polynomials of degree 5, 6, 4 and 6 respectively ‚Äì note that (Euler's totient function) of the exponents are 10, 12, 8 and 12. Application in coding theory The reciprocal polynomial finds a use in the theory of cyclic error correcting codes. Suppose can be factored into the product of two polynomials, say . When generates a cyclic code , then the reciprocal polynomial generates , the orthogonal complement of . Also, is self-orthogonal (that is, , if and only if divides .

Stochastic health effects are those that occur by chance, and whose probability is proportional to the dose, but whose severity is independent of the dose. The LNT model assumes there is no lower threshold at which stochastic effects start, and assumes a linear relationship between dose and the stochastic health risk. In other words, LNT assumes that radiation has the potential to cause harm at any dose level, and the sum of several very small exposures is just as likely to cause a stochastic health effect as a single larger exposure of equal dose value. In contrast, deterministic health effects are radiation- induced effects such as acute radiation syndrome, which are caused by tissue damage. Deterministic effects reliably occur above a threshold dose and their severity increases with dose. Because of the inherent differences, LNT is not a model for deterministic effects, which are instead characterized by other types of dose-response relationships. LNT is a common model to calculate the probability of radiation-induced cancer both at high doses where epidemiology studies support its application but, controversially, also at low doses, which is a dose region that has a lower predictive statistical confidence. Nonetheless, regulatory bodies commonly use LNT as a basis for regulatory dose limits to protect against stochastic health effects, as found in many public health policies. There are three active (as of 2016) challenges to the LNT model currently being considered by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. One was filed by Nuclear Medicine Professor Carol Marcus of UCLA, who calls the LNT model scientific \\"baloney\\". Is a Little Dose of Radiatoion So Bad?, Wall Street Journal, 13 Aug 2016 Whether the model describes the reality for small- dose exposures is disputed. It opposes two competing schools of thought: the threshold model, which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the radiation hormesis model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data is inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used. Pending any definitive answer to these questions and the precautionary principle, the model is sometimes used to quantify the cancerous effect of collective doses of low-level radioactive contaminations, even though it estimates a positive number of excess deaths at levels that would have had zero deaths, or saved lives, in the two other models. Such practice has been condemned by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.ICRP publication 103, ¬ß66 One of the organizations for establishing recommendations on radiation protection guidelines internationally, the UNSCEAR, recommended policies in 2014 that do not agree with the LNT model at exposure levels below background levels. The recommendation states \\"the Scientific Committee does not recommend multiplying very low doses by large numbers of individuals to estimate numbers of radiation-induced health effects within a population exposed to incremental doses at levels equivalent to or lower than natural background levels.\\" This is a reversal from previous recommendations by the same organization. UNSCEAR Fifty-Ninth Session 21‚Äì25 May 2012 Published 14 August 2012 The LNT model is sometimes applied to other cancer hazards such as polychlorinated biphenyls in drinking water. Consumer Factsheet on: polychlorinated biphenyls US Environment Protection Agency. Origins A-bomb survivors, from BEIR report. Notably this exposure pathway occurred from essentially a massive spike or pulse of radiation, a result of the brief instant that the bomb exploded, which while somewhat similar to the environment of a CT scan, it is wholly unlike the low dose rate of living in a contaminated area such as Chernobyl, were the dose rate is orders of magnitude smaller. However LNT does not consider dose rate and is an unsubstantiated one size fits all approach based solely on total absorbed dose. When the two environments and cell effects are vastly different. Likewise, it has also been pointed out that bomb survivors inhaled carcinogenic benzopyrene from the burning cities, yet this is not factored in. The association of exposure to radiation with cancer had been observed as early as 1902, six years after the discovery of X-ray by Wilhelm R√∂ntgen and radioactivity by Henri Becquerel. In 1927, Hermann Muller demonstrated that radiation may cause genetic mutation. He also suggested mutation as a cause of cancer. Muller, who received a Nobel Prize for his work on the mutagenic effect of radiation in 1946, asserted in his Nobel Lecture, \\"The Production of Mutation\\", that mutation frequency is \\"directly and simply proportional to the dose of irradiation applied\\" and that there is \\"no threshold dose\\". The early studies were based on relatively high levels of radiation that made it hard to establish the safety of low level of radiation, and many scientists at that time believed that there may be a tolerance level, and that low doses of radiation may not be harmful. A later study in 1955 on mice exposed to low dose of radiation suggest that they may outlive control animals. The interest in the effect of radiation intensified after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and studies were conducted on the survivors. Although compelling evidence on the effect of low dosage of radiation was hard to come by, by the late 1940s, the idea of LNT became more popular due to its mathematical simplicity. In 1954, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) introduced the concept of maximum permissible dose. In 1958, United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) assessed the LNT model and a threshold model, but noted the difficulty in acquiring \\"reliable information about the correlation between small doses and their effects either in individuals or in large populations\\". The United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE) similarly could not establish if there is a threshold or \\"safe\\" level for exposure, nevertheless it introduced the concept of \\"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\\" (ALARA). ALARA would become a fundamental principle in radiation protection policy that implicitly accepts the validity of LNT. In 1959, United States Federal Radiation Council (FRC) supported the concept of the LNT extrapolation down to the low dose region in its first report. By the 1970s, the LNT model had become accepted as the standard in radiation protection practice by a number of bodies. In 1972, the first report of National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR), an expert panel who reviewed available peer reviewed literature, supported the LNT model on pragmatic grounds, noting that while \\"dose-effect relationship for x rays and gamma rays may not be a linear function\\", the \\"use of linear extrapolation . . . may be justified on pragmatic grounds as a basis for risk estimation.\\" In its seventh report of 2006, NAS BEIR VII writes, \\"the committee concludes that the preponderance of information indicates that there will be some risk, even at low doses\\".  Radiation precautions and public policy Radiation precautions have led to sunlight being listed as a carcinogen at all sun exposure rates, due to the ultraviolet component of sunlight, with no safe level of sunlight exposure being suggested, following the precautionary LNT model. According to a 2007 study submitted by the University of Ottawa to the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., there is not enough information to determine a safe level of sun exposure at this time. If a particular dose of radiation is found to produce one extra case of a type of cancer in every thousand people exposed, LNT projects that one thousandth of this dose will produce one extra case in every million people so exposed, and that one millionth of the original dose will produce one extra case in every billion people exposed. The conclusion is that any given dose equivalent of radiation will produce the same number of cancers, no matter how thinly it is spread. This allows the summation by dosimeters of all radiation exposure, without taking into consideration dose levels or dose rates.\\"In the absence of more conclusive data, scientists have assumed that even the smallest radiation exposure carries a risk.\\" GAO study The model is simple to apply: a quantity of radiation can be translated into a number of deaths without any adjustment for the distribution of exposure, including the distribution of exposure within a single exposed individual. For example, a hot particle embedded in an organ (such as lung) results in a very high dose in the cells directly adjacent to the hot particle, but a much lower whole-organ and whole-body dose. Thus, even if a safe low dose threshold was found to exist at cellular level for radiation-induced mutagenesis, the threshold would not exist for environmental pollution with hot particles, and could not be safely assumed to exist when the distribution of dose is unknown. The linear no-threshold model is used to extrapolate the expected number of extra deaths caused by exposure to environmental radiation, and it therefore has a great impact on public policy. The model is used to translate any radiation release, like that from a \\"dirty bomb\\", into a number of lives lost, while any reduction in radiation exposure, for example as a consequence of radon detection, is translated into a number of lives saved. When the doses are very low, at natural background levels, in the absence of evidence, the model predicts via extrapolation, new cancers only in a very small fraction of the population, but for a large population, the number of lives is extrapolated into hundreds or thousands, and this can sway public policy. A linear model has long been used in health physics to set maximum acceptable radiation exposures. The United States-based National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), a body commissioned by the United States Congress, recently released a report written by the national experts in the field which states that, radiation's effects should be considered to be proportional to the dose an individual receives, regardless of how small the dose is. A 1958 analysis of two decades of research on the mutation rate of 1 million lab mice showed that six major hypotheses about ionizing radiation and gene mutation were not supported by data. Its data was used in 1972 by the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation I committee to support the LNT model. However, it has been claimed that the data contained a fundamental error that was not revealed to the committee, and would not support the LNT model on the issue of mutations and may suggest a threshold dose rate under which radiation does not produce any mutations. The acceptance of the LNT model has been challenged by a number of scientists, see controversy section below. Fieldwork The LNT model and the alternatives to it each have plausible mechanisms that could bring them about, but definitive conclusions are hard to make given the difficulty of doing longitudinal studies involving large cohorts over long periods. A 2003 review of the various studies published in the authoritative Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concludes that \\"given our current state of knowledge, the most reasonable assumption is that the cancer risks from low doses of x- or gamma-rays decrease linearly with decreasing dose.\\" A 2005 study of Ramsar, Iran (a region with very high levels of natural background radiation) showed that lung cancer incidence was lower in the high-radiation area than in seven surrounding regions with lower levels of natural background radiation. A fuller epidemiological study of the same region showed no difference in mortality for males, and a statistically insignificant increase for females. A 2009 study by researchers that looks at Swedish children exposed to fallout from Chernobyl while they were fetuses between 8 and 25 weeks gestation concluded that the reduction in IQ at very low doses was greater than expected, given a simple LNT model for radiation damage, indicating that the LNT model may be too conservative when it comes to neurological damage. However, in medical journals, studies detail that in Sweden in the year of the Chernobyl accident, the birth rate, both increased and shifted to those of \\"higher maternal age\\" in 1986. More advanced maternal age in Swedish mothers was linked with a reduction in offspring IQ, in a paper published in 2013. Neurological damage has a different biology than cancer. In a 2009 study cancer rates among UK radiation workers were found to increase with higher recorded occupational radiation doses. The doses examined varied between 0 and 500 mSv received over their working lives. These results exclude the possibilities of no increase in risk or that the risk is 2-3 times that for A-bomb survivors with a confidence level of 90%. The cancer risk for these radiation workers was still less than the average for persons in the UK due to the healthy worker effect. A 2009 study focusing on the naturally high background radiation region of Karunagappalli, India concluded: \\"our cancer incidence study, together with previously reported cancer mortality studies in the HBR area of Yangjiang, China, suggests it is unlikely that estimates of risk at low doses are substantially greater than currently believed.\\" A 2011 meta-analysis further concluded that the \\"Total whole body radiation doses received over 70 years from the natural environment high background radiation areas in Kerala, India and Yanjiang, China are much smaller than [the non- tumour dose, \\"defined as the highest dose of radiation at which no statistically significant tumour increase was observed above the control level\\"] for the respective dose-rates in each district.\\" In 2011 an in vitro time-lapse study of the cellular response to low doses of radiation showed a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF). The study found that low doses of radiation prompted higher rates of RIF formation than high doses, and that after low- dose exposure RIF continued to form after the radiation had ended. In 2012 a historical cohort study of >175 000 patients without previous cancer who were examined with CT head scans in UK between 1985 and 2002 was published. The study, which investigated leukaemia and brain cancer, indicated a linear dose response in the low dose region and had qualitative estimates of risk that were in agreement with the Life Span Study (Epidemiology data for low-linear energy transfer radiation). In 2013 a data linkage study of 11 million Australians with >680 000 people exposed to CT scans between 1985 and 2005 was published. The study confirmed the results of the 2012 UK study for leukaemia and brain cancer but also investigated other cancer types. The authors conclude that their results were generally consistent with the linear no threshold model. Controversy The LNT model has been contested by a number of scientists. It has been claimed that the early proponent of the model Hermann Joseph Muller intentionally ignored an early study that did not support the LNT model when he gave his 1946 Nobel Prize address advocating the model. It is also argued that the LNT model had caused an irrational fear of radiation. In the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, Europe-wide anxieties were fomented in pregnant mothers over the perception enforced by the LNT model that their children would be born with a higher rate of mutations. As far afield as the country of Denmark, hundreds of excess induced abortions were performed on the healthy unborn, out of this no-threshold fear. Following the accident however, studies of data sets approaching a million births in the EUROCAT database, divided into \\"exposed\\" and control groups were assessed in 1999. As no Chernobyl impacts were detected, the researchers conclude \\"in retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn was not justified\\". Despite studies from Germany and Turkey, the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects, in Greece, Denmark, Italy etc., due to the anxieties created. In very high dose radiation therapy, it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies, however, human exposure data and animal testing suggests that the \\"malformation of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose\\" below which, no rate increase is observed. A review in 1999 on the link between the Chernobyl accident and teratology (birth defects) concludes that \\"there is no substantive proof regarding radiation‚Äêinduced teratogenic effects from the Chernobyl accident\\". It is argued that the human body has defense mechanisms, such as DNA repair and programmed cell death, that would protect it against carcinogenesis due to low-dose exposures of carcinogens.The Mythology of Linear No-Threshold Cancer Causation Ramsar, located in Iran, is often quoted as being a counter example to LNT. Based on preliminary results, it was considered as having the highest natural background radiation levels on Earth, several times higher than the ICRP-recommended radiation dose limits for radiation workers, whilst the local population did not seem to suffer any ill effects.High Background Radiation Areas of Ramsar, Iran, S. M. Javad Mortazavi, Biology Division, Kyoto University of Education, Kyoto 612-8522, Japan. Retrieved 4 September 2011. However, the population of the high- radiation districts is small (about 1800 inhabitants) and only receive an average of 6 millisieverts per year, so that cancer epidemiology data are too imprecise to draw any conclusions. On the other hand, there may be non-cancer effects from the background radiation such as chromosomal aberrations or female infertility. A 2011 research of the cellular repair mechanisms support the evidence against the linear no-threshold model. According to its authors, this study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America \\"casts considerable doubt on the general assumption that risk to ionizing radiation is proportional to dose\\". However, a 2011 review of studies addressing childhood leukaemia following exposure to ionizing radiation, including both diagnostic exposure and natural background exposure, concluded that existing risk factors, excess relative risk per Sv (ERR/Sv), is \\"broadly applicable\\" to low dose or low dose-rate exposure. Several expert scientific panels have been convened on the accuracy of the LNT model at low dosage, and various organizations and bodies have stated their positions on this topic: ; Support * In 2004 the United States National Research Council (part of the National Academy of Sciences) supported the linear no threshold model and stated regarding Radiation hormesis:Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2.

Health Effects of Low-Level Radiation. Position Statement 41 ;Intermediate The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission takes the intermediate position that \\"accepts the LNT hypothesis as a conservative model for estimating radiation risk\\", but noting that \\"public health data do not absolutely establish the occurrence of cancer following exposure to low doses and dose rates ‚Äì below about 10,000 mrem (100 mSv). Studies of occupational workers who are chronically exposed to low levels of radiation above normal background have shown no adverse biological effects.\\" Mental health effects The consequences of low-level radiation are often more psychological than radiological. Because damage from very-low- level radiation cannot be detected, people exposed to it are left in anguished uncertainty about what will happen to them. Many believe they have been fundamentally contaminated for life and may refuse to have children for fear of birth defects. They may be shunned by others in their community who fear a sort of mysterious contagion. Forced evacuation from a radiation or nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. Such was the outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine. A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that \\"the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date\\". Frank N. von Hippel, a U.S. scientist, commented on the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying that \\"fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas\\". Such great psychological danger does not accompany other materials that put people at risk of cancer and other deadly illness. Visceral fear is not widely aroused by, for example, the daily emissions from coal burning, although, as a National Academy of Sciences study found, this causes 10,000 premature deaths a year in the US. It is \\"only nuclear radiation that bears a huge psychological burden ‚Äì for it carries a unique historical legacy\\".

Until 1918, it was also associated with the princely titles of members of some German ruling and mediatised dynasties and with a few princely but non-ruling families. It was also the form of address used for cadet members of the dynasties of France, Italy, Russia and Ernestine Saxony, under their monarchies. Additionally, the treatment was granted for some, but not all, princely yet non-reigning families of Bohemia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania and Russia by emperors or popes. In a handful of rare cases, it was employed by non-royal rulers in viceregal or even republican contexts. In a number of older English dictionaries, serene as used in this context means supreme; royal; august; marked by majestic dignity or grandeur; or high or supremely dignified. German-speaking lands The current, legal usage of the style in the German-speaking countries is confined to the Princely Family of Liechtenstein, the entirety of which bears the treatment. The German term is Durchlaucht, a translation of the Latin (su)perillustris. This is usually translated into English as Serene Highness, however, it would be more literal to translate it as superior to, above, beyond or greater than illustrious, as it is an augmentation of Erlaucht (\\"illustrious\\"), which was accorded to immediate counts (Reichsgrafen) of the Holy Roman Empire and by mediatised counts of the German Confederation and the German Empire. The 1911 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica wryly observes that a perfectly logical English version might be \\"Your Transparency\\". In 1375 Emperor Charles IV bestowed the nobiliary style Durchlauchtig (Most Serene Highness) upon the seven Prince-electors designated by the Golden Bull of 1356. As from 1664 Emperor Leopold I vested all Imperial Princes with the title, it became so common that the Electors like the Archdukes of Austria began to use the superlative address Durchlauchtigst. In the German Empire, the style of Serene Highness was usually held by princes of lower rank than those who were entitled to Highness (exceptions were the Wettin cadets of the Ernestine duchies), Grand Ducal Highness, Royal Highness, and Imperial Highness. Therefore, if a woman entitled to the treatment of Royal Highness married a man who was addressed only as Serene Highness, the woman usually retained her pre-marital style. In 1905 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria granted the style of Durchlaucht to members of virtually every family which had held the title of prince in the former Holy Roman Empire, even if the family had never exercised sovereignty. In the German and Austrian empires of the 19th and 20th centuries, the style Serene Highness was also officially borne by: * Cadet branches of the sovereign Ernestine dukes (i.e., Saxe- Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha);Almanach de Gotha (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), pages 111-113, 115 * Reigning F√ºrsten of the small German realms which survived the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire;Almanach de Gotha (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), pages 73, 94, 97, 98, 121, 124, 126 ** Hohenzollern (yielded sovereignty to Hohenzollern kinsman, the King of Prussia, in 1848) ** Lippe ** Reuss ** Schaumburg-Lippe ** Schwarzburg ** Waldeck and Pyrmont * Mediatised princes (e.g., F√ºrstenberg, Hohenlohe, Leiningen, Thurn und Taxis) and dukes (e.g., Ratibor), and, eventually, their family members; * Morganatic princes, descended from reigning dynasties; * Other non-reigning princes of the German nobility, but not (always) their cadets (e.g., Bismarck, Carolath-Beuthen, Pless, Wrede). By tradition, Durchlaucht is still attributed to the princely dynasties which were sovereign until 1917 or had been mediatised under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and German Confederation in 1815, although the usage has been unofficial since 1918. N.B. The highest form of durchlauchtig (adjective) was allerdurchlauchtigst (absolutely most serene), which was reserved only to the Emperor in his style of address: Allerdurchlauchtigster Gro√üm√§chtigster Allergn√§digster Kaiser und Herr Francophone dominions There is some evidence that in pre- Revolutionary France, unlike Germany, one entitled to be addressed as Serene Highness was considered to outrank someone who was merely addressed as Highness. Those members of the royal family who were not children or grandchildren of a king, i.e., the princes du sang, were entitled to be addressed as \\"Most Serene Highness\\" (son altesse s√©r√©nissime). The simple style of \\"Highness\\" (altesse) was claimed by the princes √©trangers and the princes l√©gitim√©s. In fact, these formal styles were seldom employed in conversation, since the princes du sang used unique styles (e.g. Mademoiselle, Monsieur le Prince), while the ducal peers, led by the proud Duc de Saint- Simon, avoided conceding the altesse to the princes √©trangers and b√¢tards royaux, prompting nobles of lesser rank to do likewise. The reigning Prince of Monaco, Albert II, is addressed as His Serene Highness. His wife, children and younger sister, Princess St√©phanie, are also referred to as Serene Highness. His elder sister, Princess Caroline, was also styled Her Serene Highness prior to her 1999 marriage, but is styled Royal Highness since then, even during the period when she was officially \\"The Hereditary Princess of Monaco\\" as heiress presumptive to the throne. In French, both male and female versions are Son Altesse S√©r√©nissime (S.A.S.), which translates, literally, as \\"His/Her Most Serene Highness\\". Italy In the Republic of Venice, also called \\"the Most Serene Republic\\", the Doge was known as Serenissimus (\\"Most Serene\\") as was the Duke of Mantua. Children of the Savoy kings and crown princes of Italy were entitled to the treatment of Royal Highness, but more remote male-line descendants were Serene Highnesses by right (although often the style of Royal Highness was granted to them ad personam, e.g., the Dukes of Aosta or the Dukes of Genoa). The mediatised House of Thurn and Taxis, entitled to the Serene Highness treatment in the German Empire, has a non-dynastic cadet branch, the Dukes di Castel Duino, which obtained naturalization in Italy in 1923. When incorporated into the Italian nobility, their use of the Serene Highness style was authorised by the Crown. San Marino San Marino is styled as the Most Serene Republic. Poland In the First Republic of Poland (1569-1795), also called \\"the Most Serene Republic of Poland\\" (Najja≈õniejsza Rzeczpospolita Polska), His/Her Serene Reigning Majesty (SRM) was a style used by the reigning monarchs. Russia After 1886, great-grandchildren of Russian emperors in the male-line were Prince[ss] of Russia, and were to be granted the treatment of Highness, and Prince[ss] of Russia with the style of Serene Highness if being more distantly descended from an emperor, and born from an equally marriage. An exception was for each eldest son of senior imperial great-grandsons (in the patrilineal descent of each son of the emperor), who retained the higher style of Highness.Almanach de Gotha (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), page 104 Strictly, the Russian term, Svetlost, was an honorific used in adjectival form (–°–≤–µ—Ç–ª–µ–π—à–∏–π: Svetleyshiy, Most Serene) to refer to members of a select few of Russia's princely families (e.g. \\"The Serene\\" Prince Anatoly Pavlovich Lieven or \\"The Serene\\" Prince Dmitri Vladimirovich Golitsyn). However, when translated into non-Slavic languages and used in reference to a member of the imperial Romanov family, it was usually rendered as Serene Highness. United Kingdom Queen Victoria elevated each of the princes who married her daughters to Royal Highness (except for Crown Prince Friedrich of Prussia, husband of Victoria, Princess Royal, who already possessed the HRH). This included, on 30 January 1884, HSH Prince Henry of Battenberg, husband of Princess Beatrice.Almanach de Gotha (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), pages 49 That couple's children were granted the style of Highness by their British grandmother by letters patent 4 December 1886. Several morganatic branches of reigning German dynasties took up residence in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, where their German princely titles and style of Serene Highness were recognized by the sovereign. Included in this group were Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the dukes and princes of Teck and the princes of Battenberg. During World War I, King George V revoked recognition of the style Serene Highness, hitherto used by some relatives of the British Royal Family who used German princely titles but lived in Britain. George V's queen consort was born \\"Her Serene Highness Princess Mary of Teck\\", and Prince Philip's mother had been born \\"Her Serene Highness Princess Alice of Battenberg\\". The Tecks (descended from the royal House of W√ºrttemberg) and the Battenbergs (descended from the Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine) were compensated with multiple peerages, viz. Marquess of Cambridge and Earl of Athlone for the former, and Marquess of Milford Haven and Marquess of Carisbrooke for the latter. Belgium The following titleholders or families are authorised by the Crown to use the style Serene HighnessAlmanach de Gotha (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), pages 170,190,248,372. (, ) *Dukes and princes of Arenberg *Dukes of Beaufort-Spontin *Dukes and princes of Cro√ø *Princes of Habsburg- Lorraine (archducal cadets resident in Belgium) *Princes of Lobkowicz (resident in Belgium) *Dukes and princes of Looz-Corswarem *Princes of Stolberg-Stolberg *Prince of Waterloo Hungary Before 1947, the style His/Her Serene Highness (≈êf≈ëm√©lt√≥s√°ga, literally: \\"His/Her High Dignity\\") was in use in Hungary. Peers with the title of prince were entitled to it, and between 1920 and 1944 the regent, Mikl√≥s Horthy, was styled as His Serene Highness the Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (≈êf≈ëm√©lt√≥s√°ga, a Magyar Kir√°lys√°g korm√°nyz√≥ja). Portugal As the most powerful noble family in Portugal, the Dukes of Braganza had the official treatment of Serene Highness until 1640, when they mounted the Portuguese throne, thereby becoming entitled to the style of Royal Highness, however the infantes not in direct line for the throne of Portugal were titled as \\"His/Her Highness, the Serene Infante(a)\\". Mexico From 1853 to 1855 the president of Mexico, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, enjoyed the official style of Most Serene Highness, a treatment unique in that country. Agustin I de Mexico gave that title to several members of his family. Spain In 1807 Manuel de Godoy, Prince de la Paz, was accorded the style of Most Serene Highness, a treatment unique in that country at the time. Previous to this grant the style was sometimes used by the Catholic Monarch Isabella and Ferdinand as well as by other houses known anciently as illustrious or serene. A majority of these ancient houses lost the style through prescription. Monitorio √°ulico By Pascual Maria Massa Martinez (baron del Pujol de Planes.) The honorific () is one of the styles of the infantes. Thailand In Thailand, the title of Serene Highness is the westernized style of the Thai title of Mom Chao (His/Her Serene Highness Prince/Princess Thai: ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤), denoting the grandchild of a king through one of his princely sons. In present-day Thailand, there are very few Mom Chao left after the royal family discontinued the traditional practice of polygamous marriages, and in Thailand all royal titles and styles decrease one level every generation for those not of the immediate royal family. Therefore, the child of a Mom Chao would only have the aristocratic title of Mom Rajawongse, which would then decrease in the next generation to Mom Luang, which would then decrease further, similar to a British life peerage.

History The break-up of the Soviet Union had an enormous impact on the left in Pakistan, as elsewhere in the world. A great number of factions abandoned Marxism and the Communist movement. At this difficult juncture in history the CPP and Major Ishaque's MKP group (one of three factions resulting from a split in the MKP in 1978) came together to engage in criticism and self-criticism and form the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party in 1995. In 1999 much of the former Communist Party of Pakistan broke away and reconstituted itself as a separate party. In 2003, after further organizational problems and ideological disagreements, a large section of the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party separated and reformed the Major Ishaque MKP group, whereas a group led by Sufi Abdul Khaliq Baloch and Taimur Rahman remained aligned with CMKP and its Marxist‚ÄìLeninist program. In late 2009, CMKP faced yet another split when several long-time members, including Sufi Abdul Khaliq Baloch, separated from the party and joined the Workers Party of Pakistan, a broad-left political party. CMKP continued as a distinct Marxist‚ÄìLeninist-Stalinist Party. Taimur Rahman, the former General Secretary of the CMKP, stopped working with and being a part of CMKP. Instead the party was led by central committee member Mehfoz Khan Shujaat from Multan, with Hkmat Shaw from Hashtnagar as party president. On February 14, 2015 it merged with Peoples National Congress to form Peoples Mazdoor Kissan Party. On 20th of December 2015 Peoples Mazdoor Kissan Party merged with Pakistan Mazdoor Kissan Party forming a new party named Mazdoor Kissan Party. Politics and influence The party's politics are based on Major Ishaq's philosophy, and is focused on working with the peasantry of Pakistan. It arranges study circles regularly throughout the country and has an official circular named \\"Awami Morcha\\", which is edited by Mehfoz Khan Shujaat and published every now and then. CMKP sees China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor as a neocolonization of Pakistan and believes it will damage the people of Pakistan.

It is situated to the south of Kohat District and on the north side of Bannu and Lakki Marwat districts on the main Indus Highway between Peshawar and Karachi ‚Äì it is 123 km from the provincial capital Peshawar. It gained a district status in 1982, prior to which it was part of Kohat District. The total population counted in the 1998 census was . The major first language is Pashto spoken by 99.7% of the district's inhabitants. Demographics  Population  The population of Karak by the 2017 census is 706,299. Resources There are several natural resources that have been discovered in Karak. The salt mines were well known in antiquity and a major source of salt for the Indian subcontinent into British imperial times. More recently oil, gas, and uranium have all been discovered. Oil and gas reservoirs have been found in the towns of Makori, Noshpa Banda, Gurguri and Lachi circle. Oil and gas reservoirs explored in Karak district are producing 7000 barrels of oil and 2500 cubic feet gas on a daily basis which is a record production from one oil well in the country. The oil and gas reservoirs at Noshapa Banda in district Karak are generating millions of rupees revenue daily. District Karak is blessed with mineral resources and many national and international companies and OGDCL are busy in oil and gas exploration in different areas of the district. Vast reservoirs of oil and gas have been explored in Gurguri and Noshpa Banda areas of the district so far whereas exploration is under way in other areas. According to a serve conducted by International Nuclear Information System where Fission Track Technique has been applied for the estimation of uranium in 30 drinking water sources of Tehsil Takht-e-Nasrati ,Shnawa Gudi khill and District Karak, Kpk, Pakistan. These samples have mean, minimum and maximum concentration of uranium of 13.45 +- 3.207, 1.07 +- 0.6, 84.23 +- 15.63 micro g l/sup -1/, respectively. The significant finding was the observation of very high level of uranium in drinking water sources obtained from uranium rich bedrocks than the safe limit of WHO (15 micro g l/sup -1/) for human consumption. On the basis of this study, it was concluded that the origin of uranium is potentially due to one of the Asia richest mineral deposit of uranium in Karak, Pakistan. The results could be of vital concern in diagnosis and prognosis of uranium induced disease in the local population under investigation.

The label was founded in 1988 and during its time in activity existed as part of the EMI Group. History Stephen Swid, Martin Bandier and Charles Koppelman formed SBK Entertainment in 1989 after they purchased the music publishing division of CBS Records, CBS Songs, in 1986 for $125 million. The name is an acronym incorporating the first letter of the founders' surnames. The partners sold the company to EMI Music Publishing (for a reported US$295 million), and launched SBK Records. It was distributed through the short-lived EMI Records Group North America, or ERG. In 1989, Daniel Glass joined SBK as Senior Vice President of Promotion. In 1990, Glass was promoted to Executive Vice President/General Manager. With the consolidation of SBK, Chrysalis, Wild Pitch and EMI Records USA several years later into EMI Records Group North America, he rose to President-CEO. The label had several hits with Vanilla Ice, Waterfront, Jesus Jones, Boy George, Wilson Phillips, Jon Secada, Ya Kid K, McQueen Street, Technotronic, Blur, Billy Dean and Everyday People. SBK Records was part of the EMI Group, but became dormant as of 2007, when Martin Bandier left EMI Publishing for Sony Corp.'s Sony/ATV Music Publishing. EMI was sold in 2012 to two different entities and split up. SBK also signed the first Latino MC to a major label, Ray Roll, from the famed Rock Steady Crew, and Selena, the first female crossover Latin artist. The 1994 album The Divine Comedy by Milla Jovovich was released through SBK and was critically acclaimed. The album is still in print since its release. It also published the first ever Barney and Friends album Barney's Favorites, Volume 1.

Radiation hormesis is the hypothesis that low doses of ionizing radiation (within the region of and just above natural background levels) are beneficial, stimulating the activation of repair mechanisms that protect against disease, that are not activated in absence of ionizing radiation (similar to vaccinations). The reserve repair mechanisms are hypothesized to be sufficiently effective when stimulated as to not only cancel the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation but also inhibit disease not related to radiation exposure (see hormesis). This hypothesis has captured the attention of scientists and public alike in recent years. While the effects of high and acute doses of ionising radiation are easily observed and understood in humans (e.g. Japanese atomic bomb survivors), the effects of low-level radiation are very difficult to observe and highly controversial. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high and the risk of developing cancer fluctuates 40% because of individual life style and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low-level radiation. An acute effective dose of 100 millisieverts may increase cancer risk by ~0.8%. However, children are particularly sensitive to radioactivity, with childhood leukemias and other cancers increasing even within natural and man-made background radiation levels (under 4 mSv cumulative with 1 mSv being an average annual dose from terrestrial and cosmic radiation excluding radon which primarily doses the lung). There is also indication that exposures around this dose level will cause negative subclinical health impacts to neural development. Students born in regions of Sweden with higher Chernobyl fallout performed worse in secondary school, particularly in mathematics. ‚ÄúDamage is accentuated within families (i.e., siblings comparison) and among children born to parents with low education...\\" who often don't have the resources to overcome this additional health challenge. Hormesis remains largely unknown to the public. Government and regulatory bodies disagree on the existence of radiation hormesis and research points to the \\"severe problems and limitations\\" with the use of hormesis in general as the \\"principal dose-response default assumption in a risk assessment process charged with ensuring public health protection.\\" Quoting results from a literature database research, the Acad√©mie des Sciences ‚Äì Acad√©mie nationale de M√©decine (French Academy of Sciences ‚Äì National Academy of Medicine) stated in their 2005 report concerning the effects of low-level radiation that many laboratory studies have observed radiation hormesis. However, they cautioned that it is not yet known if radiation hormesis occurs outside the laboratory, or in humans. Reports by the United States National Research Council and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) argueUNSCEAR 2000 REPORT Vol. II: Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation: Annex G: Biological effects at low radiation doses. that there is no evidence for hormesis in humans and in the case of the National Research Council hormesis is outright rejected as a possibility. Therefore, estimating Linear no-threshold model (LNT) continues to be the model generally used by regulatory agencies for human radiation exposure.  Proposed mechanism and ongoing debate  A very low dose of a chemical agent may trigger from an organism the opposite response to a very high dose. Radiation hormesis proposes that radiation exposure comparable to and just above the natural background level of radiation is not harmful but beneficial, while accepting that much higher levels of radiation are hazardous. Proponents of radiation hormesis typically claim that radio-protective responses in cells and the immune system not only counter the harmful effects of radiation but additionally act to inhibit spontaneous cancer not related to radiation exposure. Radiation hormesis stands in stark contrast to the more generally accepted linear no-threshold model (LNT), which states that the radiation dose-risk relationship is linear across all doses, so that small doses are still damaging, albeit less so than higher ones. Opinion pieces on chemical and radiobiological hormesis appeared in the journals Nature and Science in 2003. Assessing the risk of radiation at low doses (<100 mSv) and low dose rates (<0.1 mSv.min‚àí1) is highly problematic and controversial. While epidemiological studies on populations of people exposed to an acute dose of high level radiation such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors () have robustly upheld the LNT (mean dose ~210 mSv), studies involving low doses and low dose rates have failed to detect any increased cancer rate. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high (~42 of 100 people will be diagnosed in their lifetime) and it fluctuates ~40% because of lifestyle and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low level radiation. Epidemiological studies may be capable of detecting elevated cancer rates as low as 1.2 to 1.3 i.e. 20% to 30% increase. But for low doses (1‚Äì100 mSv) the predicted elevated risks are only 1.001 to 1.04 and excess cancer cases, if present, cannot be detected due to confounding factors, errors and biases. In particular, variations in smoking prevalence or even accuracy in reporting smoking cause wide variation in excess cancer and measurement error bias. Thus, even a large study of many thousands of subjects with imperfect smoking prevalence information will fail to detect the effects of low level radiation than a smaller study that properly compensates for smoking prevalence. Given the absence of direct epidemiological evidence, there is considerable debate as to whether the dose-response relationship <100 mSv is supralinear, linear (LNT), has a threshold, is sub-linear, or whether the coefficient is negative with a sign change, i.e. a hormetic response. The radiation adaptive response seems to be a main origin of the potential hormetic effect. The theoretical studies indicate that the adaptive response is responsible for the shape of dose-response curve and can transform the linear relationship (LNT) into the hormetic one. While most major consensus reports and government bodies currently adhere to LNT, the 2005 French Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Medicine's report concerning the effects of low-level radiation rejected LNT as a scientific model of carcinogenic risk at low doses. > Using LNT to estimate the carcinogenic effect at doses of less than 20 mSv > is not justified in the light of current radiobiologic knowledge. They consider there to be several dose-effect relationships rather than only one, and that these relationships have many variables such as target tissue, radiation dose, dose rate and individual sensitivity factors. They request that further study is required on low doses (less than 100 mSv) and very low doses (less than 10 mSv) as well as the impact of tissue type and age. The Academy considers the LNT model is only useful for regulatory purposes as it simplifies the administrative task. Quoting results from literature research, they furthermore claim that approximately 40% of laboratory studies on cell cultures and animals indicate some degree of chemical or radiobiological hormesis, and state: > ...its existence in the laboratory is beyond question and its mechanism of > action appears well understood. They go on to outline a growing body of research that illustrates that the human body is not a passive accumulator of radiation damage but it actively repairs the damage caused via a number of different processes, including: * Mechanisms that mitigate reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation and oxidative stress. * Apoptosis of radiation damaged cells that may undergo tumorigenesis is initiated at only few mSv. * Cell death during meiosis of radiation damaged cells that were unsuccessfully repaired. * The existence of a cellular signaling system that alerts neighboring cells of cellular damage. * The activation of enzymatic DNA repair mechanisms around 10 mSv. * Modern DNA microarray studies which show that numerous genes are activated at radiation doses well below the level that mutagenesis is detected. * Radiation-induced tumorigenesis may have a threshold related to damage density, as revealed by experiments that employ blocking grids to thinly distribute radiation. * A large increase in tumours in immunosuppressed individuals illustrates that the immune system efficiently destroys aberrant cells and nascent tumors. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to radiation induced cancer in the inherited condition Ataxia-telangiectasia like disorder, illustrates the damaging effects of loss of the repair gene Mre11h resulting in the inability to fix DNA double-strand breaks. The BEIR-VII report argued that, \\"the presence of a true dose threshold demands totally error-free DNA damage response and repair.\\" The specific damage they worry about is double strand breaks (DSBs) and they continue, \\"error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair in postirradiation cellular response, argues strongly against a DNA repair-mediated low-dose threshold for cancer initiation\\". Recent research observed that DSBs caused by CAT scans are repaired within 24-hours and DSBs maybe more efficiently repaired at low doses, suggesting the risk ionizing radiation at low doses may not by directly proportional to the dose. However, it is not known if low dose ionizing radiation stimulates the repair of DSBs not caused by ionizing radiation i.e. a hormetic response. Radon gas in homes is the largest source of radiation dose for most individuals and it is generally advised that the concentration be kept below 150 Bq/m¬≥ (4 pCi/L). A recent retrospective case-control study of lung cancer risk showed substantial cancer rate reduction between 50 and 123 Bq per cubic meter relative to a group at zero to 25 Bq per cubic meter. This study is cited as evidence for hormesis, but a single study all by itself cannot be regarded as definitive. Other studies into the effects of domestic radon exposure have not reported a hormetic effect; including for example the respected \\"Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study\\" of Field et al. (2000), which also used sophisticated radon exposure dosimetry. In addition, Darby et al. (2005) argue that radon exposure is negatively correlated with the tendency to smoke and environmental studies need to accurately control for this; people living in urban areas where smoking rates are higher usually have lower levels of radon exposure due to the increased prevalence of multi-story dwellings. When doing so, they found a significant increase in lung cancer amongst smokers exposed to radon at doses as low as 100 to 199 Bq m‚àí3 and warned that smoking greatly increases the risk posed by radon exposure i.e. reducing the prevalence of smoking would decrease deaths caused by radon. However, the discussion about the opposite experimental results is still going on, especially the popular US and German studies have found some hormetic effects. Furthermore, particle microbeam studies show that passage of even a single alpha particle (e.g. from radon and its progeny) through cell nuclei is highly mutagenic, and that alpha radiation may have a higher mutagenic effect at low doses (even if a small fraction of cells are hit by alpha particles) than predicted by linear no-threshold model, a phenomenon attributed to bystander effect. However, there is currently insufficient evidence at hand to suggest that the bystander effect promotes carcinogenesis in humans at low doses. Statements by leading nuclear bodies Radiation hormesis has not been accepted by either the United States National Research Council, or the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP).NCRP Report No. 136 -- Evaluation of the Linear- Nonthreshold Dose-Response Model for Ionizing Radiation In May 2018, the NCRP published the report of an interdisciplinary group of radiation experts who critically reviewed 29 high-quality epidemiologic studies of populations exposed to radiation in the low dose and low dose-rate range, mostly published within the last 10 years. The group of experts concluded: > The recent epidemiologic studies support the continued use of the LNT model > for radiation protection. This is in accord with judgments by other national > and international scientific committees, based on somewhat older data, that > no alternative dose-response relationship appears more pragmatic or prudent > for radiation protection purposes than the LNT model. In addition, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) wrote in its most recent report:UNSCEAR 2000 REPORT Vol. II: Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation: Annex G: Biological effects at low radiation doses. page 160, paragraph 541. > Until the [...] uncertainties on low-dose response are resolved, the > Committee believes that an increase in the risk of tumour induction > proportionate to the radiation dose is consistent with developing knowledge > and that it remains, accordingly, the most scientifically defensible > approximation of low-dose response. However, a strictly linear dose response > should not be expected in all circumstances. This is a reference to the fact that very low doses of radiation have only marginal impacts on individual health outcomes. It is therefore difficult to detect the 'signal' of decreased or increased morbidity and mortality due to low-level radiation exposure in the 'noise' of other effects. The notion of radiation hormesis has been rejected by the National Research Council's (part of the National Academy of Sciences) 16-year-long study on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. \\"The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial. The health risks ‚Äì particularly the development of solid cancers in organs ‚Äì rise proportionally with exposure\\" says Richard R. Monson, associate dean for professional education and professor of epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston.  Studies of low level radiation   Very high natural background gamma radiation cancer rates at Kerala, India  Kerala's monazite sand (containing a third of the world's economically recoverable reserves of radioactive thorium) emits about 8 micro Sieverts per hour of gamma radiation, 80 times the dose rate equivalent in London, but a decade long study of 69,985 residents published in Health Physics in 2009: \\"showed no excess cancer risk from exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation. The excess relative risk of cancer excluding leukemia was estimated to be -0.13 per Gy (95% CI: -0.58, 0.46)\\", indicating no statistically significant positive or negative relationship between background radiation levels and cancer risk in this sample.  Cultures  Studies in cell cultures can be useful for finding mechanisms for biological processes, but they also can be criticized for not effectively capturing the whole of the living organism. A study by E.I. Azzam suggested that pre-exposure to radiation causes cells to turn on protection mechanisms. A different study by de Toledo and collaborators, has shown that irradiation with gamma rays increases the concentration of glutathione, an antioxidant found in cells. In 2011, an in vitro study led by S.V. Costes showed in time-lapse images a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF). The study found that low doses of radiation prompted higher rates of RIF formation than high doses, and that after low-dose exposure RIF continued to form after the radiation had ended. Measured rates of RIF formation were 15 RIF/Gy at 2 Gy, and 64 RIF/Gy at .1 Gy. These results suggest that low dose levels of ionizing radiation may not increase cancer risk directly proportional to dose and thus contradict the linear-no-threshold standard model.http://www.healthcanal.com/public-health- safety/24865-New-Take-Impacts-Low-Dose-Radiation.html Mina Bissell, a world- renowned breast cancer researcher and collaborator in this study stated ‚ÄúOur data show that at lower doses of ionizing radiation, DNA repair mechanisms work much better than at higher doses. This non-linear DNA damage response casts doubt on the general assumption that any amount of ionizing radiation is harmful and additive.‚Äù  Animals  An early study on mice exposed to low dose of radiation daily (0.11 R per day) suggest that they may outlive control animals. A study by Otsuka and collaborators found hormesis in animals. Miyachi conducted a study on mice and found that a 200 mGy X-ray dose protects mice against both further X-ray exposure and ozone gas. In another rodent study, Sakai and collaborators found that (1 mGy/hr) gamma irradiation prevents the development of cancer (induced by chemical means, injection of methylcholanthrene). In a 2006 paper, a dose of 1 Gy was delivered to the cells (at constant rate from a radioactive source) over a series of lengths of time. These were between 8.77 and 87.7 hours, the abstract states for a dose delivered over 35 hours or more (low dose rate) no transformation of the cells occurred. Also for the 1 Gy dose delivered over 8.77 to 18.3 hours that the biological effect (neoplastic transformation) was about \\"1.5 times less than that measured at high dose rate in previous studies with a similar quality of [X-ray] radiation.\\" Likewise it has been reported that fractionation of gamma irradiation reduces the likelihood of a neoplastic transformation. Pre- exposure to fast neutrons and gamma rays from Cs-137 is reported to increase the ability of a second dose to induce a neoplastic transformation. Caution must be used in interpreting these results, as it noted in the BEIR VII report, these pre-doses can also increase cancer risk: However, 75 mGy/d cannot be accurately described as a low dose rate ‚Äì it is equivalent to over 27 sieverts per year. The same study on dogs showed no increase in cancer nor reduction in life expectancy for dogs irradiated at 3 mGy/d.http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/pdfs/Presentations/Guest- Speakers/2013/20130625-Cuttler-CNSC-Fukushima-and-beneficial-effects-low- radiation.pdf  Humans  Effects of sunlight exposure In an Australian study which analyzed the association between solar UV exposure and DNA damage, the results indicated that although the frequency of cells with chromosome breakage increased with increasing sun exposure, the misrepair of DNA strand breaks decreased as sun exposure was heightened. Effects of cobalt-60 exposure The health of the inhabitants of radioactive apartment buildings in Taiwan has received prominent attention in popular treatments of radiation hormesis. In 1982, more than 20,000 tons of steel was accidentally contaminated with cobalt-60, and much of this radioactive steel was used to build apartments and exposed thousands of Taiwanese to gamma radiation levels of up to >1000 times background (average 47.7 mSv, maximum 2360 mSv excess cumulative dose) ‚Äì it was not until 1992 that the radioactive contamination was discovered. A medical study published in 2004 claimed the cancer mortality rates in the exposed population were much lower than expected. However, this initial study failed to control for age, comparing a much younger exposed population (mean age 17.2 years at initial exposure) with the much older general population of Taiwan (mean age approx. 34 years in 2004), a serious flaw. Older people have much higher cancer rates even in the absence of excess radiation exposure. A subsequent study by Hwang et al. (2006) found the incidence of \\"all cancers\\" in the irradiated population was 40% lower than expected (95 vs. 160.3 cases expected), except for leukaemia in men (6 vs. 1.8 cases expected) and thyroid cancer in women (6 vs. 2.8 cases expected), an increase only detected amongst those exposed before the age of 30. Hwang et al. proposed that the lower rate of \\"all cancers\\" might be due to the exposed populations higher socioeconomic status and thus overall healthier lifestyle, but this was difficult to prove. Additionally, they cautioned that leukaemia was the first cancer type found to be elevated amongst the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, so it may be decades before any increase in more common cancer types is seen. Besides the excess risks of leukaemia and thyroid cancer, a later publication notes various DNA anomalies and other health effects among the exposed population: > There have been several reports concerning the radiation effects on the > exposed population, including cytogenetic analysis that showed increased > micronucleus frequencies in peripheral lymphocytes in the exposed > population, increases in acentromeric and single or multiple centromeric > cytogenetic damages, and higher frequencies of chromosomal translocations, > rings and dicentrics.

Radon therapy  Intentional exposure to water and air containing increased amounts of radon is perceived as therapeutic and \\"radon spas\\" can be found in United States, Czech, Poland, Germany, Austria and other countries. Effects of no radiation Given the uncertain effects of low-level and very- low-level radiation, there is a pressing need for quality research in this area. An expert panel convened at the 2006 Ultra-Low-Level Radiation Effects Summit at Carlsbad, New Mexico, proposed the construction of an Ultra-Low- Level Radiation laboratory.\\"Ultra-Low-Level Radiation Effects Summit.\\" January 2006. ORION International Technologies, Inc. (ORION) and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) 03 Apr. 2008. The laboratory, if built, will investigate the effects of almost no radiation on laboratory animals and cell cultures, and it will compare these groups to control groups exposed to natural radiation levels. Precautions would be made, for example, to remove potassium-40 from the food of laboratory animals. The expert panel believes that the Ultra-Low-Level Radiation laboratory is the only experiment that can explore with authority and confidence the effects of low-level radiation; that it can confirm or discard the various radiobiological effects proposed at low radiation levels e.g. LNT, threshold and radiation hormesis.http://www.orionint.com/ullre/report-2006.pdf The first preliminary results of the effects of almost no-radiation on cell cultures was reported by two research groups in 2011 and 2012; researchers in the US studied cell cultures protected from radiation in a steel chamber 650 meters underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico and researchers in Europe reported the effects of almost no-radiation on mouse cells (pKZ1 transgenic chromosomal inversion assay).

In the middle is a stage with two giant pink 'L‚Äô symbols flanking it. A large flood light is visible behind it. A concert tour (or simply tour) is a series of concerts by an artist or group of artists in different cities, countries or locations. Often concert tours are named to differentiate different tours by the same artist and to associate a specific tour with a particular album or product (for example: Celine Dion's Courage World Tour or U2's The Joshua Tree Tour named after the albums). Especially in the popular music world, such tours can become large-scale enterprises that last for several months or even years, are seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and bring in millions of dollars (or the equivalent) in ticket revenues. A performer who embarks on a concert tour is called a touring artist. Different segments of longer concert tours are known as \\"legs\\". The different legs of a tour are denoted in different ways, dependent on the artist and type of tour, but the most common means of separating legs are dates (especially if there is a long break at some point), countries and/or continents, or different opening acts. In the largest concert tours it has become more common for different legs to employ separate touring production crews and equipment, local to each geographical region. Concert tours are often administered on the local level by concert promoters or by performing arts presenters. Usually, small concert tours are managed by a road manager whereas large concert tours are managed by a tour manager. Logistics The main challenge in concert tours is how to move the performance's logistics from one venue to another venue, especially for a transcontinental tour. Tour logistics should be very organized and everything has to happen on time and in the right order as planned. Autoweek magazine estimated 30 to 50 trucks were required by Taylor Swift's 1989 World Tour to bring all the stage, sound equipment, instruments, props, and clothes. When Beyonc√© visited the United Kingdom with her 2016 Formation World Tour, it took seven Boeing 747 air freighters and a fleet of more than 70 trucks to get her stage set and other gear to the venues. The logistics phase of that tour didn't include transportation of the backstage staff, musicians, performers, and the singer herself. Boxscore , the highest-grossing concert tour of all time is Ed Sheeran's √∑ Tour, with a gross revenues of $775.6 million. In second place is the U2 360¬∞ Tour, with a gross of $736,137,344. The third-highest-grossing concert tour of all time is The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour, which earned approximately $558 million between 2005 and 2007. Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour, which earned $408 million in 2008 and 2009 was the highest-earning tour by a female artist. According to the 2014 report from Billboard Boxscore, five acts having made over US$1 billion in touring since 1990 were The Rolling Stones, U2, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna and Bon Jovi. Global touring revenue reported to Billboard Boxscore exceeded $5.5 billion in 2016. Due to the collapse of record sales in the 21st century, concert tours have become a major income for recording artists. Besides the tickets, touring also generates money from the sales of merchandise and meet-and-greet packages. Response The mobility of concert tours requires a lot of costs, times, and energy. British singer Adele expressed her unhappiness of concert tours, saying \\"Touring is a peculiar thing, it doesn't suit me particularly well. I'm a real homebody and I get so much joy in the small things.\\" A concert residency concept is offered as an alternative to performers who just need to stay in one venue and the fans come to see them. American singer Lady Gaga, who cancelled the 2018 European leg of her Joanne World Tour, signed for a Las Vegas residency to help managing her fibromyalgia illness, which can be exacerbated by touring. The 2015 study by charity Help Musicians UK found that over 60% of musicians suffered from depression or other psychological issues, with touring an issue for 71% of respondents.

The Ashuwillticook (ash-oo-will-ti-cook) Rail Trail runs parallel to Route 8 through the towns of Cheshire, Lanesborough and Adams, Massachusetts and is used for biking, walking, roller-blading, and jogging. The trail is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). Its first two phases opened in 2001 and 2004, with a 1.2-mile northerly extension opening in May 2017. The southern end of the trail begins at the entrance to the Berkshire Mall, off of Route 8 in Lanesborough, and travels north to the center of Adams. The Ashuwillticook Rail Trail passes through the Hoosac River Valley, between Mount Greylock and the Hoosac Mountains. Cheshire Reservoir, the Hoosic River, and associated wetland communities flank much of the trail. The word Ashuwillticook (ash-oo-will-ti-cook) is from the American Indian name for the south branch of the Hoosic River and literally means ‚Äúat the in- between pleasant river,‚Äù or in common tongue, ‚Äúthe pleasant river in between the hills.‚Äù History of the rail corridor Built during the industrial boom of the 1800s, the railway proved to be a vital commercial link from the Atlantic Seaboard to communities which would have otherwise been isolated in the Berkshire Hills. In 1845, the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad developed this corridor with the goal of extending the Housatonic Railroad north to Rutland, Vermont. While the track was under construction, the company was acquired by the Western Railroad, which later became part of the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&A;), as their North Adams Branch. Mineral traffic developed on the line and a number of limestone operations went into business. The New York Central Railroad took over the B&A; in 1900, and upgraded the line, which was sold to the Boston and Maine Corporation in 1981. As a connection to an existing track in North Adams, Boston and Maine ran the line with declining success until they abandoned rail service in 1990.

He served as Premier of the state of Queensland from 1932 to 1942. He came to dominate politics in the state during the 1930s, and his populism, firm leadership, defence of states' rights and interest in state development make him something of an archetypal Queensland Premier. He represented the Labor Party. Early life and career Born in Scotland, he apprenticed himself to a painter and decorator in Glasgow. He took an early interest in politics, and his labour movement sympathies were probably influenced by his observations of the poor conditions in the Clydeside shipyards and other working-class areas in Glasgow. He emigrated to Queensland in 1912, where he had an aunt. He settled in Mackay and became involved in trade unionism and Labor politics. Mackay is the centre of the sugar industry in Queensland and sugar remained a major priority for Forgan Smith throughout his career. Despite the fact that he was only 28 and had been in Queensland only three years, he was pre-selected to run for the seat of Mackay in the 1915 election as the Labor candidate. The election saw a decisive victory for Labor under T. J. Ryan, and Forgan Smith won the seat and entered Parliament.Smith, William Forgan (Bill) (1887‚Äì1953), ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography Despite his youth and inexperience, it did not take Forgan Smith too long to adjust. When Prime Minister Hughes called for conscription to be introduced, Forgan Smith joined Premier Ryan in opposing it. This gave him recognition in the Queensland Labor Party, but made him a lifelong enemy in Hughes. Hughes misnamed him as \\"Hogan Smith, an Irishman from Glasgow\\" and accused him of speaking \\"Gaelic treason\\" Forgan Smith read heavily on Parliamentary procedure, and as such was made a temporary Chairman of Committees in 1917, a position which became permanent in 1920. Soon after, he entered Cabinet as a Minister without portfolio assisting the Premier. Both roles gave him ample opportunity to build a profile in Parliament and the party. In 1922 he became Minister for Public Works, where he administered a new system of unemployment relief and earned the respect of the Unions. In 1923 he was elected to the Queensland Central Executive of the Labor Party, a position which gave him considerable power. In 1925 he became Minister for Agriculture and Stock under Premier Gillies. By the end of 1925 he was Deputy Premier after only ten years in Parliament. Labor suffered a surprising election loss in 1929, and Forgan Smith was elected leader of the party unopposed. As the Great Depression deepened, Forgan Smith knew that he had a good chance of victory in the next election. He concentrated on keeping his party held together, while trying to prevent the pro-Lang faction from gaining influence. He concentrated his criticism of the government of A. E. Moore on its decision to closely follow the Premiers' Plan, which Forgan Smith believed to be only making the depression worse. Forgan Smith campaigned furiously in the lead-up to the 1932 election, travelling broadly around the state. He was rewarded when he came into government with a seven-seat majority. Not content with the premiership, he also served as treasurer. Caucus elected a cabinet of generally moderate members ‚Äì the radicalism of the Ryan Government had largely gone from the Queensland ALP by this time. Premiership Smith in around 1933 Once in power, Forgan Smith was confronted most immediately with the problem of how to respond to the Great Depression: in particular, the need to reduce unemployment. Notwithstanding his earlier rebukes of A.E. Moore's administration, he followed (as Moore had done) the principles of the Premiers' Plan, while simultaneously insisting that the federal government meet its contractual obligations. Determined to bring jobless figures in Queensland down, he moved to implement something akin to the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, although his term of office predated Roosevelt's presidency by some nine months. Like Roosevelt, he owed much to the economic theory of John Maynard Keynes. Forgan Smith was willing to raise taxes, especially on the wealthy and on corporations, in order to fund unemployment relief programs. He was successful in raising revenue from ¬£5.6 million in 1932‚Äì33 to ¬£8.6 million in 1938‚Äì39; in the process he turned Queensland into Australia's highest taxing state. The Commonwealth Bank also paid Queensland ¬£920,000 as part of a program to aid the states. This money was put towards coupons and relief work. Construction of the Forgan Smith Building at The University of Queensland, 1940. Along with most other Queensland premiers, before and since, Forgan Smith was an advocate of development. As such, he could put the relief work programs to good use building infrastructure and undertaking other capital works projects. He embarked on a number of ambitious schemes, including the Story Bridge, an upgrade of Mackay Harbour, the Somerset Dam (which was not completed until after the end of his premiership) and a new building for the University of Queensland at St. Lucia that now bears his name. The relief work program was unsound over the long term, and was meant as a stop-gap measure. In some cases, local authorities took advantage of it, while in other cases, communities became dependent on it. For example, at one stage half of the workers of Coolangatta on the Gold Coast were on relief work. In 1938 relief work was abolished in favour of a permanent, long-term capital works program. Under Forgan Smith's rule, the weekly payments received by relief workers were raised to the level of the basic wage (a measure financed by a graduated income tax), while a major public works programme was initiated which boosted job opportunities and provided the state which major constructions of lasting worth. When minister of agriculture in 1926, Forgan Smith had established a faculty of agriculture at the University of Queensland. Now that he was premier, he established new faculties at the same university in Dentistry, Veterinary Science, and Medicine. As noted by Ross McMullin, the establishment of these new faculties 'was part of the co-ordinated development of the university and Queensland's health services.' In 1938, Smith claimed that Queensland enjoyed ‚Äòthe highest wage system, the best conditions of labour and the lowest unemployment‚Äô in the country.'Ross McMullin, The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891‚Äì1991 Smith and cabinet, ca 1932 Sometimes Forgan Smith incurred criticism for being authoritarian and dictatorial, although he was neither the first nor the last premier of his state to inspire such accusations. He used his strong and forceful personality to dominate the cabinet and parliament, and his government passed a number of controversial pieces of legislation. He added clauses to the 1936 Racing Bill which made it harder for reporters to find out and divulge information about proposed legislation, which drew heavy criticism from the press. The 1940 Public Safety Bill gave the state government unprecedented powers during wartime. The most authoritarian of his government's measures, though, was probably the Transport Act of 1938, which allowed the Government to declare ‚ÄòState of Emergency‚Äô in any part or all of the state for any time for any reason.State Transport Act 1938, ‚Äî Government of Queensland In such a case, the government's actions were effectively beyond legal challenge. Admittedly, these laws were more or less in line with similar ones passed in other jurisdictions (for example, the Official Secrets Act in the United Kingdom). Also, Forgan Smith never declared a state of emergency himself ‚Äì it would fall to later premiers to take advantage of that power. He would regularly consult with his Ministers to reach a decision, and while he could be heavy-handed in manner, he sometimes took advice from subordinates. The doctrine of states' rights meant a great deal to Forgan Smith, as to many of his predecessors and successors in the premiership. For example, he opposed the Uniform Tax Plan of 1942, even though it had been proposed by a federal ALP government under John Curtin. Many people expected Forgan Smith to make a move to federal politics himself, just as Ted Theodore had done. Nothing came of such notions; he seemed satisfied with his secure position in Queensland. William Forgan Smith's headstone at Brisbane's Toowong Cemetery.Smith, William Forgan ‚Äî Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search The first Queensland premier to make wide use of radio, Forgan Smith was an effective speaker, and he made a good impression on many of those who listened to him. Radio allowed him to reach a wider audience than he could otherwise have done, and he also travelled throughout the state, especially to turn the first sod on a new capital works project. Though never flamboyant (and in fact somewhat dour in manner), he became respected and genuinely popular. Benefiting from a weak and divided parliamentary opposition (A.E. Moore being Country Party leader 1932‚Äì1936, Edward Maher 1936‚Äì41, Sir Frank Nicklin thereafter), Forgan Smith easily achieved re-election in 1935, 1938, and 1941. With no overt antagonists inside his cabinet, he was able to retire of his own volition from the premiership, which he did on 16 September 1942. Two months later he resigned from parliament. For most of his remaining years Forgan Smith ardently pursued his other interests, sugar and education. He became a member and then chairman of the Sugar Board. Subsequently, he became the Chancellor of the University of Queensland in 1944, occupying this position until his death, which occurred in Sydney, in 1953. He was accorded a State funeral, the procession moving from St Andrew's Presbyterian Church to his burial place at Toowong Cemetery.Smith William Forgan ‚Äî Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 7 January 2015. A pragmatic and hard- working politician who rose, step by step, through careful planning, Forgan Smith was not dogmatic, nor did he do anything spectacular, preferring to busy himself with the minutiae of day-to-day administration. He claimed to be a socialist, although he was an ardent critic of communism. By his populism, his interests in education and state development, and his dominance of state politics throughout his time in office, he has sometimes invited comparisons with a later ALP leader of substantial electoral skill, Peter Beattie.

Featuring unusual instrumentation and several notable musicians, the music consisted of innovative arrangements influenced by classical music techniques such as polyphony, and marked a major development in post-bebop jazz. As the title suggests, these recordings are considered seminal in the history of cool jazz. Most of them were originally released in the 10-inch 78-rpm format and are all approximately three minutes long.  Background  Davis (right center) playing in Charlie Parker's quintet, 1947. From 1944 to 1948, Miles Davis played in Charlie Parker's quintet. Davis recorded several albums worth of material with Parker during this period, including Parker's Sessions for the Savoy and Dial labels. Davis' first records released under his own name were recorded with Parker's band, in 1947, and were more arranged and rehearsed than Parker's usual approach to recording.\\"Miles: the Autobiography\\", Miles Davis with Quincy Troupe, 1989, pg.105 By 1948, Davis had three years of bebop playing under his belt, but he struggled to match the speed and ranges of the likes of Gillespie and Parker, choosing instead to play in the mid range of his instrument.Cook, Richard. It's About That Time: Miles Davis On and Off Record. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pg 10 In 1948, Davis, becoming increasingly concerned about growing tensions within the Parker quintet, left the group and began looking for a new band to work with.Chambers, Jack.

At the same time, arranger Gil Evans began hosting gatherings of like-minded, forward-looking musicians at his small basement apartment, located on 55th Street in Manhattan, three blocks away from the jazz nightclubs of 52nd Street. Evans had gained a reputation in the jazz world for his orchestration of bebop tunes for the Claude Thornhill orchestra in the mid-1940s. Keeping an open door policy, Evans' apartment came to host many of the young jazz artists of late-1940s New York. The participants engaged in discussions about the future of jazz, including a proposed group with a new sound. According to jazz historian Ted Gioia: > [The participants] were developing a range of tools that would change the > sound of contemporary music.

Recording  Pete Rugolo produced the sessions for Birth of the Cool. The nonet recorded twelve tracks for Capitol during three sessions over the course of nearly a year and a half. Davis, Konitz, Mulligan and Barber were the only musicians who played on all three sessions, though the instrumental lineup was constant (excepting the omission of piano on a few songs and the addition of Hagood on \\"Darn That Dream\\"). The first session occurred on January 21, 1949, recording four tracks: Mulligan's \\"Jeru\\" and \\"Godchild\\" as well as Lewis's \\"Move\\" and \\"Budo\\". Jazz critic Richard Cook hypothesizes that Capitol, wanting to get a good start, recorded these numbers first because they were the most catchy tunes in the nonet's small repertoire.Cook, Richard. It's About That Time: Miles Davis On and Off Record. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 17 That date Kai Winding replaced Zwerin on trombone, Al Haig replaced Lewis on piano, and Joe Shulman replaced McKibbon on bass. The second recording date came three months later on April 22, 1949 with Davis filling in for Fats Navarro in Tadd Dameron's band with Charlie Parker during the interim. The band returned to the studio with five substitutions in personnel: J. J. Johnson on trombone, Sandy Siegelstein on French horn, Nelson Boyd on bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums, and John Lewis returning to piano. At this session, the nonet recorded Mulligan's \\"Venus de Milo\\", Lewis's \\"Rouge\\", Carisi's \\"Israel\\", and \\"Boplicity\\", a collaboration between Davis and Evans, credited to the pseudonym \\"Cleo Henry\\".Cook, p. 20 The band did not return to the studio again until March 9, 1950. Davis did not call the band for any rehearsals or live performances between the second and third recording dates. The March 1950 date featured Mulligan's \\"Darn That Dream\\", \\"Rocker\\", and \\"Deception\\", and Evans's arrangement of Chummy MacGregor's \\"Moon Dreams\\", which had been released in a jazz arrangement by Glenn Miller and the AAF Band in 1944 on V-Disc. The band saw more substitutions, with Gunther Schuller on French horn and Al McKibbon on bass. Kenny Hagood returned for vocals on \\"Darn That Dream\\".  Composition   Music and style  One of the features of the Davis Nonet was the use of paired instrumentation. An example of this can be heard on the John Lewis arrangement \\"Move\\". In \\"Move\\", Lewis gives the melody to the pairing of trumpet and alto saxophone, baritone saxophone and tuba supply counterpoint, and trombone and French horn provide harmonies.Cook, p.18 Gerry Mulligan's \\"Jeru\\" demonstrates another Nonet hallmark: the use of a unison sound and rich harmony throughout the horns. Davis said, \\"I wanted the instruments to sound like human voices singing ... and they did.\\"Gioia, \\"The History of Jazz\\". p. 282. Though the album is seen as a departure from traditional bop,Gioia, \\"The History of Jazz\\". 281 the recordings do feature tunes that are considered close to the bop style, such as \\"Budo\\" which has the band bookending solos by Davis, Mulligan, Konitz, and Winding, similar to a bebop head arrangement.Cook, p. 19  Thornhill's influence  One of the largest stated influences on the sound of The Birth of the Cool was band leader Claude Thornhill and his orchestra.Hentoff, Nat. \\"The Birth of the Cool.\\" Down Beat, May 2, 1957: 15‚Äì16Chambers, 94Gioia, Ted. The History of Jazz. 281‚Äì282. Out of Thornhill's band came Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan, and Gil Evans, Miles Davis calling the Konitz-Mulligan-Evans incarnation \\"the greatest band\\" only after \\"the Billy Eckstine band with Bird.\\" The Thornhill band was known for its impressionistic style, innovative use of instrumentation, such as the use of tuba and French horn, and a non-vibrato playing style, hallmarks that the Miles Davis Nonet adopted for The Birth of the Cool.Crease, Stephanie. \\"Gil Evans: Forever Cool.\\" Down Beat, May 2012. p. 33 According to Evans: > Miles had liked some of what Gerry and I had written for Claude. The > instrumentation for the Miles session was caused by the fact that this was > the smallest number of instruments that could get the sound and still > express all the harmonies the Thornhill band used. Miles wanted to play his > idiom with that kind of sound.Hentoff, p. 16 Davis saw the full 18-piece Thornhill orchestra as cumbersome and thus decided to split the group in half for his desired sound.Chambers, p. 98-99 As arrangers, both Evans and Mulligan gave Thornhill credit for crafting their sound. Thornhill's band gave Evans the opportunity to try his hand at arranging small-group bebop tunes for big band, a practice few others were participating in. Mulligan recalls Thornhill teaching him \\"the greatest lesson in dynamics, the art of underblowing.\\" Thornhill has also been credited with launching the move away from call and response between sections and the move towards unison harmonies.Klinkowitz, p. 27  Release history  The tracks from the January 1949 session were released soon after recording as two pairs of singles. From the April 1949 date, \\"Israel\\" and \\"Boplicity\\" were doubled together on a 78 and released as well. Of the twelve tracks recorded, Capitol released relatively few. In 1954, after persuasion from Rugolo, Capitol released eight of the tracks on a 10\\" record titled Classics in Jazz‚ÄîMiles Davis (H-459). In 1957 eleven of the tracks (all except for \\"Darn That Dream\\") were released by Capitol as Birth of the Cool. The final track, \\"Darn That Dream\\" (the only song with vocals, by Hagood), was included with the other eleven on a 1972 LP Capitol Jazz Classics, Vol. 1: The Complete Birth Of The Cool (M-11026). Subsequent releases have been based on this last arrangement. The album has since been reissued many times in various formats.Davis, Miles. Miles Davis-Birth of the Cool: Scores from the Original Parts. Ed. Jeff B. Sultanof. Milwaukee, WI.: Hal Leonard Corporation, 2002. p. 2 The recordings of the nonet from its time at the Royal Roost were released as Cool Boppin.Cook, 16‚Äì17 In 1998, Capitol Records released The Complete Birth of the Cool, which was remastered by Mark Levinson and collected the nonet's live and studio tracks onto a single CD. Note from the 2000 Capitol CD reissue producer Michael Cuscuna:  Reception and aftermath  The band's debut performance at the Royal Roost received positive, but reserved reactions.Cook, p. 17 Count Basie, the Roost's headliner during the Nonet's brief tenure, however, was more open to the group's sound, saying, \\"Those slow things sounded strange and good. I didn't always know what they were doing, but I listened, and I liked it.\\"Chambers, p. 106 Winthrop Sargeant, classical music critic at The New Yorker, compared the band's sound to the work of an \\"impressionist composer with a great sense of aural poetry and a very fastidious feeling for tone color... The music sounds more like that of a new Maurice Ravel than it does like jazz ... it is not really jazz.\\"Gioia, The History of Jazz. p. 283 Though he did not recognize the record as jazz, Sargeant acknowledged that he found the record \\"charming and exciting\\". In the short term the reaction to the band was little to none, but in the long term the recordings' effects have been great and lasting. They have been credited with starting the cool jazz movementKernfeld, Barry. \\"Miles Davis.\\" Grove Music Online. Web. Apr 24, 2012. 2.

Birth of the Cool was voted number 349 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). Many members of the Miles Davis Nonet went on to have successful careers in cool jazz, notably Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis, and Lee Konitz. Mulligan moved to California and joined forces with trumpeter Chet Baker in a piano-less quartet, before creating his Concert Jazz Band.Klinkowitz, p. 6-12 Lewis would become music director of the Modern Jazz Quartet, which would become one of the most influential cool jazz groups.Gioia, \\"The Birth and Death of the Cool\\". p. 86 Evans would go on to collaborate with Davis again on the Davis albums Miles Ahead and Sketches of Spain.Crease, p. 35 Capitol Records were at the time disappointed with the sales of the nonet recordings, and did not offer Davis more work. Instead, Davis signed with the new jazz specialty record label, Prestige, for whom he would record his first album in 1951.\\"Miles: The Autobiography\\", Miles Davis with Quincy Troupe, 1989, pg.140  Track listings  Arrangements by the composer unless otherwise noted.

His work has been translated into 20 languages. His grandfather was a historian, and was one of the main influences on his work. He is best known for the children's novel Cue for Treason (1940). Trease is best known for writing children's historical novels, whose content reflects his insistence on historically correct backgrounds, which he meticulously researched. His ground-breaking study Tales Out of School (1949) pioneered the idea that children's literature should be a serious subject for study and debate.Humphrey Carpenter and Mari Prichard, The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature Oxford University Press, 1998. (pp. 541-2). When he began his career, his radical viewpoint was a change from the conventional and often jingoistic tone of most children's literature of the time, and he was one of the first authors who deliberately set out to appeal to both boys and girls and to feature strong leading characters of both sexes. Life and work Trease was born in Nottingham in 1909, third and youngest son of George Trease (1873‚Äì1932), a wine merchant, and his wife Florence Dale (1874‚Äì1955), a doctor's daughter. He won a scholarship to Nottingham High School, where he wrote stories, poems, and a three-act play; awarded a Classics scholarship to Oxford University, he found his tutors dull and after a year, left university without a degree and moved to London. Intent on becoming a writer, he also worked with slum children and joined a left-wing group called the \\"Promethean Society\\" whose members included Hugh Gordon Porteus and Desmond Hawkins.Desmond Hawkins, When I was: a memoir of the years between the wars Macmillan, 1989 (pp. 73-4)The Promethean Society's key influences included Marx, Freud, Trotsky, Wells and Gandhi. Trease noted wryly: \\"We did not worry unduly about reconciling the contradictions\\". Carpenter and Pritchard, (p.541). Trease described his own childhood reading as 'a diet of classist and racist historical adventure' but in 1933, he came across a translation of a Russian book titled Moscow has a Plan, in which a Soviet author dramatised the First five-year plan for young readers. Inspired by this, in 1934 Trease wrote Bows Against the Barons, a left-wing update of Robin Hood that showcased a radical approach to historical literature for young people. This included the use of modern English, rather than linguistic mannerisms, strong male and female characters, often from less privileged levels of society and meticulous attention to detail. An enduring belief in equality and fairness is a theme in many of his books, as are links between the historical settings of his novels and contemporary issues. Bows Against the Barons was translated into Russian and sold immensely well there; his next work, Comrades for the Charter was less successful but Cue for Treason in 1940 proved enduringly popular and remains his best known work. His subjects cover a wide range of historical periods, such as The Crown of Violet, set in Ancient Greece, The Red Towers of Granada, Middle Ages, The Hills of Varna, Renaissance Europe, Cue for Treason and Cloak for a Spy, Elizabethan England, Fire on the Wind and Popinjay Stairs, Restoration London, Thunder of Valmy, French Revolution, The White Nights of St Petersburg, the Bolshevik Revolution and Tomorrow Is a Stranger, World War II. Trease also wrote modern school stories, including the five Black Banner novels set in the Lake District, the first being No Boats on Bannermere), as well as a number of adult novels, history, plays for radio and television, and biographies. Trease authored a guide aimed at teaching creative writing to young adults, The Young Writer: A Practical Handbook. He wrote three books of autobiography: A Whiff of Burnt Boats (1971), Laughter at the Door (1974), and in the last year of his life, the final part, Farewell the Hills. This was written for his family and friends, and published privately after his death. Trease was an acknowledged influence on authors such as Hester Burton and inspired others, such as Rosemary Sutcliff and Leon Garfield. While in some ways they outpaced him, he continued to write and published 113 books before 'calling it a day' at the age of 88 because of illness. Many were translated for foreign markets, including Asia and Europe. In the United States he won the New York Herald Tribune Book Award for the Children's Spring Festival 1966 for This is Your Century. He married Marian Boyer (1906-1989) in 1933 and they spent most of their marriage in Colwall, near the Downs School, Great Malvern. They had one daughter, Jocelyne and moved to Bath to be closer to her, shortly before Marian's death.

Considered an outstanding preacher as well as a strong polemical writer defending Anglicanism, Stillingfleet was known as \\"the beauty of holiness\\" for his good looks in the pulpit, and was called by John Hough \\"the ablest man of his time\\".David C. Douglas, English Scholars (1939), p. 254. Life Edward Stillingfleet was born at Cranborne, Dorset, seventh son of Samuel Stillingfleet (d. 1661), of Cranborne Lodge, Dorset, a member of a landowning family originally of Yorkshire, and his wife Susanna, daughter of Edward Norris, of Petworth, West Sussex.https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-26526Burke's Family Index, ed. Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 1976, p. 179A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland for 1852, vol. II, P-Z, J. Bernard Burke, Colburn & Co. Publishers, 1852, p. 1306-1307 He went at the age of thirteen to St John's College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1652, and became vicar of Sutton, Bedfordshire in 1657. In 1665, after he had made his name as a writer, Stillingfleet became vicar at St Andrew, Holborn. He preached at St Margaret, Westminster on 10 October 1666, the 'day of humiliation and fasting' after the Great Fire of London, with such an attendance that there was standing room only. Samuel Pepys recorded that he could not get in to hear the sermon, eating a meal of herrings in a pub instead.Adrian Tinniswood, By Permission of Heaven: The Story of the Great Fire of London (2003), p. 181. Stillingfleet then held many preferments, including a Royal Chaplaincy, and the Deanery of St Paul's (1678), the latter involving him in work connected with the building of the new St Paul's Cathedral. He became Bishop of Worcester in 1689. He was a frequent speaker in the House of Lords, and had considerable influence as a churchman. He supported Richard Bentley, who lived in his household as a tutor for a number of years, from shortly after his graduation in 1693. Bentley would later be his chaplain and biographer, and describe him as \\"one of the most universal scholars that ever lived\\".http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45118 british-history.ac.uk In 1691, at Stillingfleet's request, Queen Mary II wrote to the magistrates of Middlesex, asking for stronger enforcement of the laws against vice. This was an early move in the campaign of the Society for the Reformation of Manners.Deborah Payne Fisk, The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre (20000, p. 212. At his death Stillingfleet left a library of some 10,000 printed books, which were purchased by Narcissus Marsh and today are part of Marsh's Library in Dublin, Ireland. His manuscript collection was purchased by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (1661‚Äì1724), and passed with the Harleian Manuscripts to the British Museum in 1753 as one of the foundation collections. Patronage, politics and views Stillingfleet had to wait many years for a bishopric, a fact linked to his disfavour at Court in the 1680s. He never, though, lacked for well-connected patrons. The first was Sir Roger Burgoyne, 2nd Baronet, a barrister and MP in the Long Parliament, in whose gift was Sutton, Bedfordshire, his living; followed by Francis Pierrepont, a Parliamentarian colonel and younger brother of Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester (a Royalist) and William Pierrepont (like Francis a Parliamentarian). These both offered him tutoring positions. He was also supported by Harbottle Grimstone, who as Master of the Rolls gave him a preaching position in the Rolls Chapel.John Trevor Cliffe, The Puritan Gentry Besieged, 1650-1700 (1993), p. 40. The transition at the Restoration was certainly problematic. Earl of Southampton presented Stillingfleet to St Andrew, Holborn. Humphrey Henchman, Bishop of London, employed him to write a vindication of William Laud's answer to John Percy (alias Fisher). According to Jon Parkin, Stillingfleet was a leader within the Church of England of the \\"latitudinarians\\", the group of Anglicans thus defined pejoratively. Latitudinarism as doctrine was considered to have grown from the teaching of the Cambridge Platonists, but in practical terms conditions at the Restoration did not favour it. Quite a number of its Cambridge adherents left an unpromising career in religion for the law, or had to rely for patronage on those who had done so.Parkin, p. 27. Stillingfleet was most closely associated, in his attitudes, with such as Isaac Barrow, Robert South and John Tillotson. They agreed, for example, on a literal interpretation to Biblical exegesis, discarding allegorical readings.B. W. Young, Religion and Enlightenment in Eighteenth-Century England: Theological Debate from Locke to Burke (1998), p. 190. With Tillotson he favoured the so-called Erastian view, that the ruler had great powers over the Church, from the days of 1660; after the Glorious Revolution they became Low Church moderates.Tony Claydon, Europe and the Making of England, 1660-1760 (2007), p. 330. With Gilbert Burnet, Benjamin Hoadly, Simon Patrick, William Powell and William Whiston, he held some High Church views also.William Gibson, Altitudinarian Equivocation: George Smalridge's Churchmanship, p. 57 in William Gibson, Robert G. Ingram (editors), Religious Identities in Britain, 1660-1832 (2005). With Thomas Tenison, Stillingfleet and Tillotson preached on behalf of reason and natural religion. They are described as influential Arminian Anglicans. They adopted an Arminian scheme of justification in opposition to the Calvinist's one, and took the stock of core beliefs to be a small set of fundamentals. In Stillingfleet's case, it supported reconciliation with Presbyterians. Stillingfleet and Tillotson In 1674 they met with Richard Baxter and Thomas Manton, in an attempt to draft a reconciliation with the nonconformists.newblehome.co.uk They were largely sympathetic with the new science of their times. Stillingfleet did draw the line at the materialist tendency in the views of Edmond Halley, whom he examined with the help of Richard Bentley in 1691, when Halley applied for the Savilian Chair of Astronomy.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article Halley, Edmond, pp. 376-9. Works A keen controversialist, he wrote many treatises, with a general but learned concern to defend Anglican orthodoxy. Doctrine and the Church His first book was The Irenicum (1659) advocating compromise with the Presbyterians; following a Latitudinarian approach, he there shows the influence of John Selden and takes a close interest in the synagogue as a model of church structure.James E. Force, Richard Henry Popkin (editors), Newton and Religion: Context, Nature, and Influence (1999), p. 157. The philosophical basis was natural law and the state of nature. The arguments of the Irenicum were still live in the 1680s, when Gilbert Rule produced a Modest Answer.John Robertson, A Union for Empire: Political Thought and the British Union of 1707 (1995), p. 160. It was followed by Origines Sacrae, Or, A Rational Account of the Grounds of Christian Faith, as to the Truth and Divine Authority of the Scriptures, and Matters Therein Contained (1662) and A Rational Account of the Grounds of Protestant Religion (1664). It included an attack on Catholicism, and Edward Meredith replied on the Catholic side. A Discourse Concerning the Idolatry Practised in the Church of Rome (1671) formed part of a controversy with the recusant Catholic Thomas GoddenCostas Douzinas, Lynda Nead, Law and the Image: The Authority of Art and the Aesthetics of Law (1999), p. 109. and noted Church scholar Serenus de Cressy. The Mischief of Separation (1687) originally a sermon, was followed up by The Unreasonableness of Separation: Or, An Impartial Account of the History, Nature and Pleas of the Present Separation from the Communion of the Church of England (1680). These attacks on the separatists among non-conformists prompted a large-scale response from dissenters, many of whom were disappointed with the harsher line from an Anglican who had in the past held out an olive branch.John Marshall, John Locke: Resistance, Religion and Responsibility (1994), p. 95. His opponents included Richard BaxterRichard Baxter's Answer to Dr Edward Stillingfleet's charge of separation (1680) and John Owen. John Howe took the line that \\"latitude\\" was not compatible with a \\"mean narrow\\" approach.Richard Ashcraft, Latitudinarianism and Toleration, p. 159 in Richard W. F. Kroll, Richard Ashcraft, Perez Zagorin (editors), Philosophy, Science, and Religion in England, 1640-1700 (1991). Stillingfleet was also criticised from the conforming side, for coming too close to the arguments of Thomas Hobbes.Tony Claydon, Europe and the Making of England, 1660-1760 (2007), p. 298. An Answer to Some Papers (1685) attempted to deal with the embarrassing publication of papers, allegedly written by the King, Charles II, arguing that one true church was that of Roman Catholicism. In the ensuing controversy, he issued A Vindication of the Answer to some Late Papers (1687) attacking John Dryden, whom he called a \\"grim logician\\". Dryden retaliated, and incorporated the \\"grim logician\\" phrase as self-description in his poem The Hind and the Panther (1687), which alludes to Stillingfleet. Philosophical controversy A Letter to a Deist (1677) was the first prolonged attack on deism to appear in English.A Letter to a Deist It also engaged with the thought of Baruch Spinoza, in Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, though he was named only as a \\"late author mightily in vogue\\".Jonathan Israel, The Radical Enlightenment (2001), p. 603. In 1697, Stillingfleet issued A Discourse in Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity (1697) It had three intentions: repelling the Unitarians, shoring up the unity of the orthodox trinitarians, and doctrinal defence of the Trinity. Under the third heading, Stillingfleet took on John Locke, and his Essay on Human Understanding. He wrote Three Criticisms of Locke (1697) Stillingfleet engaged in a debate through correspondence (later published) with Locke. He argued in favor of dualism, and claimed that Locke's Essay argued against dualism as he understood it. He also considered that the epistemology of the Essay opened the door to Unitarianism.John Marshall, Locke, Socinianism, \\"Socinianism\\", and Unitarianism, p. 111 in M. A. Stewart (editor), English Philosophy in the Age of Locke (2000), Locke himself had taken an interest in Stillingfleet (with James Tyrrell and Sylvester Brounower) from 1681.libraries.psu.edu The controversy drew in the playwright Catherine Cockburn, who wrote in defence of Locke, but to the detriment of her career as author.Richard H. Popkin, The Pimlico History of Western Philosophy (1999), p. 768. Antiquarian scholarship Origines Sacrae (1663) began with a comprehensive analysis of flaws in ancient historians, as a way of defending the account in the Book of Genesis.Margaret T. Hodgen, Early Anthropology in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1971 edition), pp. 248-9. It argued against the Pre- Adamite theories of Isaac La Peyr√®re, and took a very critical line with the older theories of ancient British origins, and the writings of Annius of Viterbo.Colin Kidd, British Identities Before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800 (1999), p.40 and p. 59. Another work going back to the roots was Origines Britannicae: Or, The Antiquities of the British Churches (1685). The Discourse of the True Antiquity of London appeared in 1704 bundled with The Second Part of Ecclesiastical Cases. It was a work of high scholarship on Roman London; it however ignored the new archaeological evidence that was available but not yet in literary form.Joseph M. Levine, Dr. Woodward's Shield: History, Science and Satire in Augustan England (1977), pp. 136-7.

Lyre is the last of three connected novels of the Cornish Trilogy. It was preceded by The Rebel Angels (1981) and What's Bred in the Bone (1985). Plot In The Lyre of Orpheus, the executors of the will of Francis Cornish (the subject of What's Bred in the Bone) find themselves at the head of the \\"Cornish Foundation\\". The 5 directors of the Foundation, the 3 remaining Frank Cornish's estate executors, being Professor the Reverend Simon Darcourt, Arthur Cornish, and Maria Cornish, and Professor Clement Hollier and Stratford actor Geraint Powell, are called upon to decide what projects deserve funding. They decide that a hitherto-unfinished opera by E. T. A. Hoffmann (aka ETAH) will be staged at Stratford, Ontario; to this end, they hire a brilliant young composition student, Hulda Schnakenburg, to complete the opera as the work necessary to qualify her for a PhD., while Darcourt is charged with the completion of the libretto, which James Planch√© had attempted to write. The opera to be completed is King Arthur or the Magnanimous Cuckold. The storyline follows the writing and then production of the opera, and the plot of the story arcs in a way that parallels the legend of King Arthur, and in particular the triangle of King Arthur, his queen, Guenevere, and Lancelot. Geraint Powell, an actor who serves on the Board of the Cornish Foundation, by deception fathers a child by Maria Cornish, forcing Arthur Cornish to choose between a generous or vindictive response. The Lyre of Orpheus explores not only the world of early eighteenth century opera, but also follows Darcourt's research into the life of the benefactor and artist, Francis Cornish, leading to a discovery that forces Darcourt to conclude that a painting previously attributed to an unknown fifteenth century painter, known only as \\"The Alchemical Master\\", was in fact the work of Francis Cornish himself. This painting, entitled The Wedding at Cana, features the portraits of many of the people who appeared as characters from Blairlogie, the fictional town in Ontario that was the setting of the second book of the trilogy, What's Bred in the Bone. A further plotline involves the sexual and artistic flowering of PhD candidate Hulda Schnakenburg (\\"Schnak\\") under the hand of Gunilla Dahl-Soot, a distinguished Swedish musicologist who serves as Schnak's academic advisor and becomes her lover. The book explores a number of themes, including the pursuit of life beyond the ordinary or comfortable routine and which is exemplified in the artistic quest to produce the opera or in Darcourt's quest to uncover the truth behind the painting of The Wedding at Cana. The theme of marriage is examined through the relationship between Arthur and Maria Cornish, a relationship that must withstand the test of infidelity. And the modern approach to relationships is mocked in the dysfunctional common-law situation of two minor characters, Al and Mabel, who present themselves in Toronto to monitor and record the production of the opera from start to finish. As often happens in Davies' novels, all is not simple; for example, the ghost of Hoffman (ETAH), trapped in Limbo as a result of the unsatisfactory state of his artistic work, attends and comments on the ongoing proceedings. Nor is all peaceful among the characters, as they react to Powell's seduction of Maria Cornish, Dahl-Soot's seduction of Schnak, and the inevitable tensions created by the effort to mount an operatic production.

The paper was established in 1991 by the Oxford University Student Union (Oxford SU) and is published every Friday during term time. Articles are also published daily on the paper's website and social media pages regardless of term dates. The paper is the University's most widely circulated student paper, with over 15,000 copies distributed across Oxford each edition.  Structure  The Oxford Student is owned by the Oxford SU and run through the Student Union's commercial subsidiary, Oxford Student Services Ltd (OSSL). The newspaper's constitution grants the paper editorial independence. It enjoys close relations with Oxide Radio, also owned by Oxford SU. Two Editors-In-Chief are appointed each term by the Oxford SU Media Board, a panel of former Editors- In-Chief, student sabbatical officers, and SU staff. The Editors-In-Chief are current students of the University who have complete editorial autonomy over the paper. After their appointment in the finals weeks of term, they are responsible for releasing editorial team applications for the upcoming term, inviting applicants to interview. Applications are competitive, and a team of anywhere from 30-80 students are accepted to help publish the paper. Current sections of the newspaper include: News, Comment, Investigations, Features, Pink, Identity, Profile, Science & Technology, Culture (consisting of Life and Entertainment sub-sections), Food & Drink, OxYou, E-Sports and Sports. In addition, there is a Broadcasting Team which produces video content for the paper's website and social media platforms. In response to the Covid-19 global pandemic and the resulting lack of sports fixtures within the University, the Sports section was temporarily changed to E-sports and Gaming in Trinity 2020 but will remain alongside Sport for Michaelmas 2020 due to its popularity. Inclusivity The Oxford Student is generally recognised for its efforts to promote equality and representation amongst the student body, chiefly through its platforming of minorities groups. In Michaelmas 2016, the newspaper introduced Pink (aimed towards LGBTQIA+ members of the University) as a sub- section of Features; due to its popularity, in Hilary 2017, Pink was launched as its own section. Edited and written by non-heterosexual or non-cisgender students, the newspaper regularly anonymises the Pink articles in order to protect the identities of writers who do not feel comfortable publicly authoring articles relating to LGBTQIA+ issues. In January 2020, a new section was created called Identity, described as being \\"dedicated to spotlighting the issues, opinions and experiences of BAME students within the University\\". Structured similarly to Pink, the editors of Identity - as well as those who submit writing to be published in the section - are BAME students at the University. Accolades The Oxford Student was named \\"Student Newspaper of the Year\\" at the Guardian Student Media Awards in 2001, was shortlisted in 2004 and 2012, and awarded the runner-up prize in 2007. Controversies In 2004, the newspaper gained national publicity when two reporters broke University rules to expose security flaws in the University's computer network; the student journalists responsible, Patrick Foster and Roger Waite, were rusticated by the University Court of Summary Jurisdiction, but on appeal their punishment was reduced to a fine.http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-14376487-oxford-students- suspended-for-hacking.do Foster now works as Media Correspondent for The Times, and Waite worked for the Sunday Times for a few years after graduating. In 2014, shortly after Amelia Hamer became editor, the paper ran a news storyhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10934144/Oxford-Union-rape- victim-knew-her-claim-was-false.html/ about the Ben Sullivan controversy which caused an outcry amongst students as it \\"reinforced rape myths in the press\\". It garnered negative attention in other student media, and also led to calls for Hamer to resign. Three months later, on 24 September, Hamer was removed from her role because of pressure from student activists. In 2019, the newspaper published articles about the Canadian-British poet Dr. Todd Swift, one of those in the contest to be appointed the University's next professor of poetry. The articles reportedly contained a number of serious and unfounded allegations against Dr. Swift, including allegations made by a former student from the University of Glasgow. Politics The Oxford Student expresses no political sympathies and has no party political line. As part of the SU, the newspaper prides itself on being an inclusive platform which welcomes all members of the University, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation. Contributors Former contributors include Laura Barton and Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian, Mark Henderson and Rob Hands of The Times, and Karl Smith of The Independent.

What can be known through the categories is called phenomena and what is outside the categories is called noumena, the unthinkable \\"things in themselves\\". New mysterians In his (famous) essay \\"What Is It Like to Be a Bat?\\" Thomas Nagel mentions the possibility of cognitive closure to the subjective character of experience and the (deep) implications that it has for materialist reductionist science. Owen Flanagan noted in his 1991 book Science of the Mind that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness will never be completely explained. Flanagan called them \\"the new mysterians\\" after the rock group Question Mark and the Mysterians. According to McGinn, the solution to the mind-body problem cannot be grasped, despite the fact that the solution is \\"written in our genes\\". Emergent materialism is a similar but different claim that humans are not smart enough to determine \\"the relationship between mind and matter.\\" Criticism While the nature of consciousness is complex, according to some philosophers, that does not imply closure, thus, McGinn's argument is flawed.

Brownmiller argues that rape had been previously defined by men rather than women, and that men use it as a means of perpetuating male dominance by keeping all women in a state of fear. The New York Public Library selected Against Our Will as one of 100 most important books of the 20th century. Personal life Brownmiller was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Mae and Samuel Warhaftig, a lower-middle-class Jewish couple. Her father was a salesman in the Garment Center and later a vendor in Macy's department store, and her mother was a secretary in the Empire State Building.Susan Brownmiller Papers, Harvard Library catalog listing (accessed June 3, 2010).Susan Brownmiller, \\"An Informal Bio\\", susanbrownmiller.com; accessed June 4, 2010. She later took the pen name Brownmiller, legally changing her name in 1961. In 1972, Brownmiller signed her name to the Ms. campaign: ‚ÄúWe Have Had Abortions‚Äù which called for an end to \\"archaic laws\\" limiting reproductive freedom, they encouraged women to share their stories and take action. She describes herself as \\"a single woman\\", even though \\"I was always a great believer in romance and partnership.\\"Author bio, bookreporter.com (accessed June 3, 2010). \\"I would like to be in close association with a man whose work I respect,\\" she told an interviewer, attributing her unmarried status to the fact that she was \\"not willing to compromise.\\"Mary Cantwell, \\"The American Woman\\", Mademoiselle, June 1976. Education As a child Brownmiller was sent to the East Midwood Jewish Center for two afternoons a week to learn Hebrew and Jewish history. She would later comment, \\"It all got sort of mishmashed in my brain except for one thread: a helluva lot of people over the centuries seemed to want to harm the Jewish people. ... I can argue that my chosen path - to fight against physical harm, specifically the terror of violence against women - had its origins in what I had learned in Hebrew School about the pogroms and The Holocaust.\\"Susan Brownmiller, statement recorded by the Jewish Women's Archive, \\"Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution\\", jwa.org; accessed June 4, 2010. She had \\"a stormy adolescence\\",Susan Brownmiller, Against Our Will (1975). attending Cornell University for two years (1952 to 1954) on scholarships, but not graduating. She later studied acting in New York City. She appeared in two off-Broadway productions.Ariel Levy, Female Chauvinist Pigs (2005), chapter 2. Career Brownmiller's path into journalism began with an editorial position at a \\"confession magazine\\". She went on to work as an assistant to the managing editor at Coronet (1959‚Äì60), as an editor of the Albany Report, a weekly review of the New York State legislature (1961‚Äì1962), and as a national affairs researcher at Newsweek (1963‚Äì1964). In the mid-1960s, Brownmiller continued her career in journalism with positions as a reporter for NBC-TV in Philadelphia (1965), staff writer for The Village Voice (1965), and as a network news writer for ABC-TV in New York City (1966‚Äì68). Beginning in 1968, she worked as a freelance writer; her book reviews, essays, and articles appeared regularly in publications including The New York Times, Newsday, The New York Daily News, Vogue, and The Nation. In 1968, she signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\", New York Post, January 30, 1968. Brownmiller volunteered for Freedom Summer in 1964, wherein she worked on voter registration in Meridian, Mississippi. According to her own account: > Jan Goodman and I were in the second batch of volunteers for Mississippi > Freedom Summer....When no one else at the Memphis orientation session > volunteered for Meridian, Jan and I accepted the assignment. Between us, we > had a good ten years of organizing experience, hers in Democratic primaries > and presidential campaigns, mine in CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, > and both of us together in voter registration drives in East Harlem. The > night we arrived in Meridian, a field secretary called a meeting, asking to > see the new volunteers. Proudly we raised our hands. 'Shit!' he exploded. 'I > asked for volunteers and they sent me white women.' Returning to New York, she began writing for The Village Voice and became a network TV newswriter at the American Broadcasting Company, a job she held until 1968. She continues to write and speak on feminist issues, including a recent memoir and history of Second Wave radical feminism. In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution (1999). Her papers have been archived at Harvard, in the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Against Our Will Against Our Will (1975) is a feminist book in which Brownmiller argues that rape \\"is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.\\" In order to write the book, after having helped to organize the New York Radical Feminists Speak-Out on Rape on January 24, 1971, and the New York Radical Feminists Conference on Rape on April 17, 1971, she spent four years investigating rape. She studied rape throughout history, from the earliest codes of human law up into modern times. She collected clippings to find patterns in the way in which rape is reported in various types of newspapers, analyzed portrayals of rape in literature, films, and popular music, and evaluated crime statistics. Against Our Will was a highly controversial book. Brownmiller's basic premise was contested by some sections of the left wing, who considered it untrue that \\"all men benefit\\" from the culture of rape, and who believed rather that it was possible to organize both women and men together to oppose sexual violence. The book also received criticism from Angela Davis, who thought Brownmiller disregarded the part that black women played in the anti-lynching movement and that Brownmiller's discussion of rape and race became an \\"unthinking partnership which borders on racism\\". In 1995, the New York Public Library selected Against Our Will as one of 100 most important books of the 20th century.

She first became involved in the Women's Liberation Movement in New York City in 1968, by joining a consciousness-raising group in the newly formed New York Radical Women organization. Brownmiller went on to coordinate a sit-in against Ladies' Home Journal in 1970, began work on Against Our Will after a New York Radical Feminists speak-out on rape in 1971. In 1977, Brownmiller became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. She co-founded Women Against Pornography in 1979. Honors Brownmiller won an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship in 1973 to research and write about the crime of rape. She is featured in the feminist history film She's Beautiful When She's Angry (2014).

It is also sometimes called the double exponential distribution, because it can be thought of as two exponential distributions (with an additional location parameter) spliced together back-to-back, although the term is also sometimes used to refer to the Gumbel distribution. The difference between two independent identically distributed exponential random variables is governed by a Laplace distribution, as is a Brownian motion evaluated at an exponentially distributed random time. Increments of Laplace motion or a variance gamma process evaluated over the time scale also have a Laplace distribution. Definitions Probability density function A random variable has a \\\\textrm{Laplace}(\\\\mu, b) distribution if its probability density function is :f(x\\\\mid\\\\mu,b) = \\\\frac{1}{2b} \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{|x-\\\\mu|}{b} \\\\right) \\\\,\\\\\\\\! :: = \\\\frac{1}{2b} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{\\\\mu-x}{b} \\\\right) & \\\\text{if }x < \\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{b} \\\\right) & \\\\text{if }x \\\\geq \\\\mu \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. Here, \\\\mu is a location parameter and b > 0, which is sometimes referred to as the diversity, is a scale parameter. If \\\\mu = 0 and b = 1, the positive half-line is exactly an exponential distribution scaled by 1/2. The probability density function of the Laplace distribution is also reminiscent of the normal distribution; however, whereas the normal distribution is expressed in terms of the squared difference from the mean \\\\mu, the Laplace density is expressed in terms of the absolute difference from the mean. Consequently, the Laplace distribution has fatter tails than the normal distribution. Cumulative distribution function The Laplace distribution is easy to integrate (if one distinguishes two symmetric cases) due to the use of the absolute value function. Its cumulative distribution function is as follows: :\\\\begin{align} F(x) &= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!f(u)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}u = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac12 \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{b} \\\\right) & \\\\mbox{if }x < \\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-\\\\frac12 \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{b} \\\\right) & \\\\mbox{if }x \\\\geq \\\\mu \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\sgn(x-\\\\mu) \\\\left(1-\\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{|x-\\\\mu|}{b} \\\\right ) \\\\right ). \\\\end{align} The inverse cumulative distribution function is given by :F^{-1}(p) = \\\\mu - b\\\\,\\\\sgn(p-0.5)\\\\,\\\\ln(1 - 2|p-0.5|).

One way to show this is by using the characteristic function approach. For any set of independent continuous random variables, for any linear combination of those variables, its characteristic function (which uniquely determines the distribution) can be acquired by multiplying the corresponding characteristic functions. Consider two i.i.d random variables X, Y \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Exponential}(\\\\lambda). The characteristic functions for X, -Y are :\\\\frac{\\\\lambda }{-i t+\\\\lambda }, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\lambda }{i t+\\\\lambda } respectively. On multiplying these characteristic functions (equivalent to the characteristic function of the sum of the random variables X + (-Y)), the result is :\\\\frac{\\\\lambda ^2}{(-i t+\\\\lambda ) (i t+\\\\lambda )} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda ^2}{t^2+\\\\lambda ^2}. This is the same as the characteristic function for Z \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Laplace}(0,1/\\\\lambda), which is :\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{t^2}{\\\\lambda ^2}}. Sargan distributions Sargan distributions are a system of distributions of which the Laplace distribution is a core member. A pth order Sargan distribution has densityEveritt, B.S.

Occurrence and applications The Laplacian distribution has been used in speech recognition to model priors on DFT coefficients and in JPEG image compression to model AC coefficients generated by a DCT. *The addition of noise drawn from a Laplacian distribution, with scaling parameter appropriate to a function's sensitivity, to the output of a statistical database query is the most common means to provide differential privacy in statistical databases. Fitted Laplace distribution to maximum one-day rainfalls CumFreq for probability distribution fitting *In regression analysis, the least absolute deviations estimate arises as the maximum likelihood estimate if the errors have a Laplace distribution. *The Lasso can be thought of as a Bayesian regression with a Laplacian prior. * In hydrology the Laplace distribution is applied to extreme events such as annual maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges. The blue picture, made with CumFreq, illustrates an example of fitting the Laplace distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis. : The Laplace distribution, being a composite or double distribution, is applicable in situations where the lower values originate under different external conditions than the higher ones so that they follow a different pattern.A collection of composite distributions Computational methods Generating values from the Laplace distribution Given a random variable U drawn from the uniform distribution in the interval \\\\left(-1/2, 1/2\\\\right), the random variable :X=\\\\mu - b\\\\,\\\\sgn(U)\\\\,\\\\ln(1 - 2|U|) has a Laplace distribution with parameters \\\\mu and b.

A \\\\textrm{Laplace}(0, b) variate can also be generated as the difference of two i.i.d. \\\\textrm{Exponential}(1/b) random variables. Equivalently, \\\\textrm{Laplace}(0,1) can also be generated as the logarithm of the ratio of two i.i.d. uniform random variables. History This distribution is often referred to as Laplace's first law of errors. He published it in 1774 when he noted that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of its magnitude once its sign was disregarded.Laplace, P-S. (1774).

As of 2017, the city had a population of 39,800. The city has experienced steady population growth since the early 2000s, though this has slowed in recent years. Before the construction of the highway between the latter cities in the late 1950s, Fondi had been an important settlement on the Roman Via Appia, which was the main connection from Rome to much of southern Italy. Geography Fondi is the main town of the Plain of Fondi (Piana di Fondi in Italian), a small plain between the Ausoni and Aurunci mountains and the Tyrrhenian Sea. The plain includes three lakes and is agriculturally very fertile. Most in evidence are greenhouses for the production of early crops for sale in Rome. The long sandy beach stretches from Sperlonga in the south-east to Terracina in the north- west and lies along the Gulf of Gaeta, with views (when the weather is clear) to the Pontine Islands. It is marked by a somehow well-preserved, typical Mediterranean coastal dune landscape. The territory of Fondi is partially included in the Regional Natural Park of Monti Aurunci. History Fondi has an ancient history, beginning with early settlements about 1000 BC: later the area was settled by the Italic tribes of Aurunci and, subsequently, Volsci. According to the legend, it would have been founded by Hercules in memory of the killing of Cacus. The first historical reference to Fondi dates to 338 BC, at the time of the Latin War, when its inhabitants (together with those of the nearby Formia) gained minor Roman citizenship status (civitas sine suffragio). After a failed attempt of revolt led by Vitruvius Vaccus (330 BC), Fondi remained a Roman prefecture; later (188 BC) it received full citizenship, with a government led by 3 aediles. The importance of Fondi lay in its position across the old Via Appia. Begun in 312 BC, it was for more than two millennia the main roadway from Rome to southern Italy. Today the historical centre and surrounding wall of Fondi still form a square, as in the Roman camp walls, whose decumanus was formed by the city tract of the Via Appia. After the Gothic War and the Lombard conquest of Italy, Fondi remained a dominion of the Eastern Roman Empire. Later a part of the Papal States, in 846 it was burnt out by the Saracens coming from their fortress of Garigliano: they settled there until they were defeated in the Battle of Circeus of 877, and Fondi was passed to the Duchy of Gaeta. In 1140 Fondi passed to the Dell'Aquila family, of Norman heritage, and then, in 1299, to the powerful Caetani barons (in the person of Loffredo Caetani, nephew of Pope Boniface VIII), who for two centuries made Fondi the centre of their power, and a centre of artistic development as well. Here in 1378 the powerful Count Onorato I Caetani summoned the conclave in which the cardinals elected Clement VII against Urban VI (Western Schism). The Caetani lost Fondi after Charles VIII of France's expedition to southern Italy, and it was assigned to the condottiero Prospero Colonna. Under the Colonna the city met another period of artistic and cultural splendour, thanks of the court held by Giulia Gonzaga, who lived in Fondi between 1526 and 1534. In 1534, Fondi was sacked by Barbarossa, who was seeking to kidnap the beautiful Giulia and bring her as a gift to his emperor Suleiman. However, she managed to escape. Another sack followed in 1594, starting the decline of the city, which had in the meantime passed to the Carafa of Stigliano. In 1720 Fondi was acquired by the di Sangro family. In 1818 the declining city, surrounded by malaria-infested marshes malaria and brigandage, lost the bishopric seat existing there since the very early years of Christianity. After the Armistice of 8 September 1943, the anti-Fascist novelist Alberto Moravia and his wife Elsa Morante took refuge in Fondi; the experience inspired Moravia's book La Ciociara (\\"The Woman from Ciociaria\\") (1958). Economy Agriculture in the area around Fondi has always been favoured by the presence of abundant water sources and by the climatic conditions. The traditional production of citrus has been recently supplanted by that of vegetables and fruit of all kinds. Fondi is the seat of an important market for agriculture and food products which distribute millions of tons of agricultural products every year. The Fondi seaside and plain towards Terracina. Main sights Fondi's main sights include: *The Castle, with a characteristic round tower standing more than , symbol of the city. The castle was built in the 14th century by Onorato I Caetani over a stretch of ancient Roman walls. In the 16th century it was the seat of Giulia Gonzaga's court of literates and artists. Since 1987 it houses the City's Museum. *The adjacent Palazzo del Principe (\\"Prince's Palace\\"), constructed in 1466-77 is attributed to the Catalan architect Matteo Forcimanya.

Political roles Jay Warren was elected mayor of the last remaining British dependency in Oceania in the general election held on 15 December 2004, defeating Brenda Christian, who had held the mayoralty in an interim capacity following the dismissal from the post of her brother, Steve Christian, by the British authorities on 30 October 2004, following his rape convictions. Warren was expected to take up his duties sometime around Christmas, when he was to return from Tahiti, where his daughter Darylynn was hospitalized and recovering from a longboat accident in which her arm was nearly severed. Besides Darylynn, he has another child, Charlene. Jay Warren was no stranger to the post to which he was elected. From 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1999, he served in an almost identical capacity as Magistrate, as the chief elected official was known prior to a constitutional revision in 1999. Previously, after a brief stint as a member of the Island Council in 1982, he had assumed the second-most influential position on the island in 1985, as chairman of the Internal Committee. He continued to hold this office up to his election to the office of magistrate in late 1990. As magistrate throughout most of the 1990s, Warren had executive, legislative, and judicial authority, serving ex officio as chairman of the Island Council, which doubles as the dependency's legislature and court. Following the constitutional review and the replacement of the magistrate by a mayor in 1999, Steve Christian was elected to the new position. Warren remained politically active, however, and served two further terms (in 2000 and 2002) as chairman of the Internal Committee. Warren's election to the mayoralty in 2004 was welcomed by British Deputy Governor Matthew Forbes. \\"We appointed Jay as chairman of the (island's) internal committee in the period after the trials and before this election,\\" Forbes told Radio New Zealand from his office at the British High Commission (the equivalent of an embassy in Commonwealth countries) in Wellington. \\"He's very experienced and I'm sure he'll make a very good mayor.\\" He was succeeded by Mike Warren as mayor in December 2007.The Peerage Charges and acquittal On 24 October 2004, Warren was acquitted of an indecent assault charge. He was the only one of seven defendants in the Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 to be found not guilty. He is the brother of Meralda Warren, who has also held political office and is one of the most vocal defenders of the islanders' traditional acceptance and practice of sexual activity from puberty onwards. Meralda Warren was elected to the council on 15 December 2004 also.

Unger (; born April 25, 1942) is a contemporary American philosopher and professor at New York University. His main interests lie in the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and the philosophy of mind. Biography Unger attended Swarthmore College at the same time as David Lewis, earning a B.A. in philosophy in 1962, and Oxford University, where he studied under A. J. Ayer and earned a doctorate in 1966. Unger has written a defense of profound philosophical skepticism. In Ignorance (1975), he argues that nobody knows anything and even that nobody is reasonable or justified in believing anything. In Philosophical Relativity (1984), he argues that many philosophical questions cannot be definitively answered. In the field of applied ethics, his best-known work is Living High and Letting Die (1996). In this text, Unger argues that the citizens of first-world countries have a moral duty to make large donations to life-saving charities (such as Oxfam and UNICEF), and that once they have given all of their own money and possessions, beyond what is needed to survive, they should give what belongs to others, even if having to beg, borrow, or steal in the process. In \\"The Mental Problems of the Many\\" (2002), he argues for substantial interactionist dualism on questions of mind and matter: that each of us is an immaterial soul. The argument is extended and fortified in his 2006 book All the Power in the World. In Empty Ideas (2014), he argues that analytic philosophy has delivered no substantial results as to how things are with concrete reality.

The trilogy consists of The Rebel Angels (1981), What's Bred in the Bone (1985), and The Lyre of Orpheus (1988). The series explores the life and influence of Francis Cornish. In each novel, Davies looks at how underlying medieval patterns surface in modern lives. The Rebel Angels The story of The Rebel Angels is set in motion by the death of eccentric art patron and collector Francis Cornish. University professors Clement Hollier, Urquhart McVarish, and Simon Darcourt are the executors of Cornish's complicated will, which includes material that Hollier wants for his scholarly work in Medieval Studies. The deceased's nephew Arthur Cornish, who stands to inherit the fortune, is also a character. All three executors (and Arthur) are intrigued by Maria Theotoky, Hollier's half-Polish, half-Gypsy graduate student, while the plot revolves around John Parlabane: ex-monk, skeptic philosopher, famulus, and general mischief-maker. The intuitive theme in this novel is the Tarot. What's Bred in the Bone What's Bred in the Bone is the life story of Francis Cornish, whose death and will were the subject of The Rebel Angels. His was a full life, and we follow him through his childhood as a wealthy and precocious misfit in a small Ontario town, his education in Toronto (in which we meet Dunstan Ramsay from the Deptford Trilogy) and Oxford, his unusual apprenticeship as a restorer and painter in Nazi Germany, his wartime experiences in England, and his later career as a collector and a patron of the arts in Toronto. Cornish's life story develops as related by Cornish's daemon, a Mercurial influence who intervenes at crucial moments to ensure that Cornish becomes a great man, although that may be seen only after his death. Intuition in this novel is expressed through astrology. What's Bred in the Bone was shortlisted for the 1986 Booker Prize. The Lyre of Orpheus In the third novel, Simon Darcourt, Arthur Cornish, and Maria Cornish find themselves at the head of the \\"Cornish Foundation\\" and are called upon to decide what projects deserve funding. Their first assay into the world of humanist patronage is to support a precocious composer in completing an unfinished opera by E.T.A. Hoffmann entitled Arthur of Britain, or the Magnanimous Cuckold, and then bringing it to the stage at Stratford, Ontario. The novel follows the course of this project from inception to completion. At the same time, the archetypes in the opera are reflected in the personal lives of those involved: Arthur and Maria as the central \\"ruling\\" couple, Arthur's best friend Geraint Powell, a Welsh actor- turned-director as Lancelot, Simon Darcourt as the household cleric and writer, and so on. In this final novel, archetypes tie together the three levels of Arthurian, Romantic, and modern characters.

Despite his later career as a senator under the Second French Empire, D'Anth√®s is mostly known for fatally wounding the eminent Russian poet Alexander Pushkin in a duel in 1837. Career Born in Colmar to aristocratic Alsatian parents, the first boy among six children, he was destined for a military career. He was therefore sent to Saint-Cyr, the premier French military academy, and, in 1830, as cavalry officer, he supported Charles X's party during the July Revolution. After the exile of Charles X, d'Anth√®s refused to serve under the July Monarchy, resigned from the army and withdrew to his father's home in Alsace. As he was authorized by the French government to serve abroad without losing his nationality, he set off first for Prussia, then for Russia. In St. Petersburg, he succeeded in entering the Knights Guards of the Empress as cornet. Two years later, in 1836, he became lieutenant. His family ties and good looks gave him access to St. Petersburg high society. It was there that he met the Dutch plenipotentiary to the court, Baron Heeckeren, who, after a lengthy correspondence and a journey to Alsace, proposed to d'Anth√®s's father that he adopt his son as his own heir. After the agreement of the King of the Netherlands, Georges-Charles d'Anth√®s took the name of Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anth√®s. From booklet by Prince A. Trubetskoy: \\"...d'Anth√®s was known for his antics, quite inoffensive and appropriate to youths except the one, of which we learnt much later. I don't know what to say: whether he took Heeckeren or Heeckeren took him... All in all, ... in the intercourse with Heeckeren he was ever a passive partner\\". D'Anth√®s' grave. Soultz. June 2009 Grave of Yekaterina Goncharova D'Anth√®s met Pushkin and his wife, Natalia, a beautiful and flirtatious young woman who had many admirers. D'Anth√®s courted her in a compromising way. Soon after he was refused by Natalia Pushkina, a number of Pushkin's closest friends, as well as Pushkin himself, received copies of an anonymous lampoon on Pushkin. The lampoon was a mock letter awarding Pushkin the title of Deputy Grand Master and Historiographer of the Order of Cuckolds. Pushkin accused Heeckeren to be the lampoon's author, though the true author has never been established. Expert research ruled out Heeckeren authorship as the lampoon (written in French) contained errors extremely unlikely for a native speaker, and such authorship would have been too risky for a diplomat. In the complicated affair that ensued, D'Anth√®s married Natalia's sister, Yekaterina Goncharova, on 10 January 1837. It has been suggested that d'Anth√®s's engagement and marriage to Natalia's sister was devised to contradict society gossip that he was in pursuit of Natalia. In any event, this was not enough to settle the conflict between the two new brothers-in-law. After marrying Yekaterina, D'Anth√®s continued to behave provocatively with Natalia, instigating a new duel challenge. On the evening of 27 January 1837, d'Anth√®s fired first, mortally wounding Pushkin in the stomach. Pushkin, who had fought several duels, managed to rise and shoot at d'Anth√®s, but only wounded him lightly in the right arm. As he lay on his deathbed, Pushkin sent a message to d'Anth√®s pardoning him of any wrongdoing. Pushkin died two days later, after which d'Anth√®s was imprisoned at Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. Dueling was illegal in Russia, and d'Anth√®s was called to court, but he was pardoned by the Emperor. Stripped of his rank, he was escorted back to the frontier and ordered to leave Russia permanently. In Berlin, he was joined by his wife, and the couple returned to France, in his father's region. There he began a successful political career: as first president of the local assembly, then member of the National Constituent Assembly from 1848 to 1852, and, at last, irremovable senator from 1852 to 1870. His wife died on 15 October 1843 while giving birth to their fourth child. He died on 2 November 1895 at his family house of Soultz-Haut-Rhin (Sulz/Oberelsa√ü), then part of the German Empire.

After the case collapsed, the question of whether Curtin could continue as a judge became the focus of political and legal dispute. An impeachment motion was launched in the D√°il in 2004 by Minister for Justice Michael McDowell. Curtin resigned in 2006 on grounds of ill health, and the motion lapsed. Early life and career Curtin is the only child of a builder and his wife, who had emigrated from near Tralee in county Kerry to south London where Brian was born and raised, attending St Joseph's Roman Catholic Primary School, Putney Bridge Road, Wandsworth, as well as the Salesian College, in Surrey Lane, Battersea. In the 1970s he attended Trinity College Dublin, and qualified from King's Inns in 1976. As a barrister he worked on the Kerry Babies Tribunal, and developed a high profile in Kerry. Curtin married Miriam McGillicuddy, a solicitor and later mayor of Tralee. They have one daughter, and separated in c.1998. Curtin was involved in amateur drama, and presented a Sunday morning show on Radio Kerry. He was politically active in Fianna F√°il, and later the Progressive Democrats, for which party stood unsuccessfully for election to Tralee Town Council. Curtin was appointed to the Garda Complaints Appeals Board in May 2001; to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in August 2001; and to the circuit court in November 2001. He heard cases on the Southwestern Circuit, encompassing his home county of Kerry. Trial and acquittal In May 2002, the Garda S√≠och√°na launched Operation Amethyst, a major investigation based on details received from Interpol in August 2001 of Irish credit card transactions made in 1999 to a child-pornography website in Texas. The operation led to numerous arrests and convictions. Detectives executed a search warrant on Curtin's private residence, seized his computer and reported finding 273 pornographic images of children on the hard disk. Curtin was charged in January 2003. Following delays due to the judge's ill-health, the trial took place in April 2004. At the trial, Curtin claimed that the search was illegal because it had taken place outside the limit of the 7-day warrant. The Garda√≠ claimed that the delay was due to Curtin's extended absence from his home and that when it took place at 2:20pm on 27 May 2002, it was still within the 7-day limit. The trial judge ruled that the search was illegal. As a result, the computer evidence found could not be used. Without that evidence Curtin was found not guilty, the judge declaring that the case was \\"crystal clear\\". Attempted impeachment There was considerable public outcry in response to the acquittal. Online opinion polls showed little support for his continuing to serve on the bench. Curtin refused a Government request to step down, claiming that under the Constitution of Ireland he could only be removed for \\"stated misbehaviour\\". The Irish Times urged him to resign to prevent a constitutional crisis. In June 2004 Justice Minister McDowell moved an impeachment motion in the D√°il, saying Curtin was \\"unsuitable to exercise the office of a judge of the Circuit Court\\". This was only the second judicial \\"impeachment\\" motion under the 1937 Constitution ‚Äî the first, in 1941, had been withdrawn. The D√°il suspended McDowell's motion and established a joint Oireachtas select committee to examine the evidence. This inquiry was challenged by Judge Curtin in the courts. The challenges were unsuccessful and following a Supreme Court ruling in March 2006 upholding the process, the select committee took custody of the computer from the Garda√≠ and hired experts to examine it. Curtin suggested that malware could have downloaded the pornographic images his computer without his knowledge. The process took longer than expected but they planned to issue a report to the Oireachtas in late 2006 to facilitate a debate and vote. In November 2006, Judge Curtin resigned from the judiciary on health grounds, ending the investigation. This occurred days before he was to give evidence in private to the committee, and days after he had completed five years on the bench, the minimum sufficient to qualify for a pension.

Works In 1599 appeared The Life and Death of Thomas Wolsey, cardinall. ‚Ä¶ By Thomas Storer, student of Christ Church in Oxford. At London printed by Thomas Dawson. The poem is written on the model of Thomas Churchyard's legend on the history of Wolsey in The Mirrour for Magistrates. It consists of three parts, \\"Wolseius aspirans\\", \\"Wolseius triumphans\\", and \\"Wolseius moriens\\"; these contain respectively 101, 89, and 51 seven-line stanzas of decasyllabic verse (rhyming , as in rhyme royal). The volume is dedicated to John Howson, Queen Elizabeth's chaplain, and there are introductory verses by Charles Fitzgeffrey and Thomas and Edward Michelborne, and a poem in fifteen eight-line stanzas addressed to the author by his fellow-collegian John Sprint. The poem is based on the narratives of George Cavendish (Life of Woolsey) and Raphael Holinshed, and contains a felicitous characterisation of Richard Foxe. It was praised by Alberic Gentilis in his Laudes Academi√¶ Perusin√¶ et Oxoniensis (1605). The Life was reprinted in Thomas Park's Heliconia (1815, vol. ii.), and reissued separately in 1826 from the press of David Alphonso Talboys at Oxford. This poem was brought up as a possible influence on Shakespeare's composition of the play Henry VIII, from the end of the 18th century onwards.

Auel about prehistoric times. It is the first book in the Earth's Children book series, which speculates on the possibilities of interactions between Neanderthal and modern Cro-Magnon humans. Setting The novel references the advance of the polar ice sheets, setting the story before 19,950 years Before Present (BP) or 18,000 years BCE, when the farthest southern encroachment of the last glacial period of the current ice age occurred. Auel's time-frame, sometime between 29,950 and 26,950 years BP or 28,000 and 25,000 BCE, corresponds generally with archaeological estimates of the Neanderthal branch of mankind disappearing.  Plot summary  A five-year-old girl, Ayla, who readers come to understand is Cro-Magnon, is orphaned and left homeless by an earthquake that destroys her family's camp. She wanders aimlessly, naked and unable to feed herself, for several days. Having been attacked and nearly killed by a cave lion and suffering from starvation, exhaustion, and infection of her wounds, she collapses, on the verge of death. The narrative switches to a group of people who call themselves \\"Clan\\" and who we come to understand are Neanderthal. Their cave was destroyed in the earthquake and they are searching for a new home. The medicine woman of the group, Iza, discovers the ailing girl and asks permission from Brun, leader of the group, to help her, despite the child being clearly a member of \\"the Others,\\" the distrusted antagonists of the Clan. The child is adopted by Iza and her brother Creb. Creb is the group's \\"Mog-ur\\" or shaman, despite being deformed as a result of a difficult birth caused by his abnormally large head, and the later loss of an arm and eye after being attacked by a cave bear. The Clan worships spiritual representations of Earthly animals, called \\"totems\\", that they believe can influence their lives by sending good or bad luck, and for whom Mog-ur acts as an intermediary. Brun allows Iza to treat the dying child and agrees to adopt her providing Creb can discover her personal totem spirit. Through meditation, Creb comes to believe that the child may be protected by the spirit of the cave lion, a powerful totem never given to a woman and only to very few men. He cites the cave lion attack the girl experienced shortly before being discovered as proof that its spirit marked her so that she could be adopted into the Clan. The people call her Ayla, the closest they can come to pronouncing her birth name. After traveling with them for a while and starting to heal, Ayla wanders away from the group when they stop to discuss what they should do since they haven't found a new home, and discovers a huge, beautiful cave, perfect for their needs. Many of the people begin to regard Ayla as lucky, especially since good fortune continues to come their way as she lives among them. In Auel's books, Neanderthals possess only limited vocal apparatus and rarely speak, but have a highly developed sign language. They do not laugh or even smile, and they do not cry; when Ayla weeps, Iza thinks she has an eye disease. Ayla's different thought processes lead her to break important Clan customs, particularly the taboo against females handling weapons. She is self- willed and spirited, but tries hard to fit in with the Neanderthals, although she has to learn everything first-hand; she does not possess the ancestral memories of the Clan that enable them to do certain tasks after being shown only once. Iza is concerned that when Ayla grows up nobody will want her as their mate, making her a burden to the group. She therefore trains Ayla as a medicine woman of her line, the most prestigious line of medicine women of the entire Clan. This will give Ayla her own status, independent of whether or not she is mated. It takes Iza much longer to train Ayla than it will her own daughter, Uba, since Ayla does not possess the memories of the Clan. Ayla's main antagonist in the novel is Broud, son of the leader Brun, who feels that she takes credit and attention away from him. As the two mature, the hatred in Broud's heart festers. When they are young adults, he brutally rapes Ayla in a bid to demonstrate his total control over her, and he continues to assault her multiple times a day. She sinks into a depression that leaves her despondent and disinterested, and quickly becomes pregnant. Iza explains to Ayla that her unattractive appearance compared to a Clan woman will likely preclude her from obtaining a mate before she gives birth - a circumstance Iza's people believe will bring the group bad luck. Having dreamed of being a mother for most of her life and convinced that this may be her only chance due to her powerful totem, Ayla refuses Iza's suggestion that she take medicine to lose the child. Following a difficult pregnancy and a near-fatal labor, Ayla rejoices in the birth of a son but because he has a number of Cro-Magnon features, he is classified by the Clan as deformed and is almost taken away from her. The book ends with Creb's death, Broud's succession to the leadership and his banishment of Ayla, who sets off to find other people of her own kind. Her son Durc remains with the tribe. Sequels The sequel, The Valley of Horses, continues Ayla's story, which is further developed in other books of the Earth's Children series, which include The Mammoth Hunters; The Plains of Passage; The Shelters of Stone; and the sixth and final installment in the series, The Land of Painted Caves. Background The archaeological and paleontological research for this book was carried out by Auel from her public library, by attending archaeological conventions, and touring extensively on sites with briefings by working field archaeologists.Auel, various Series forwards, appreciations and credits, esp. \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" appreciations make it plain she'd outlined six book series in detail and visited digs in the various locales before this first book, and reprised such visits at various times since. Some of the descriptions are based on the first adult Neanderthal skeletons found in Iraq from the cave burial at Shanidar, dating between 60-80,000 years BP. Other data is clearly linked to the widespread Aurignacian culture and Gravettian culture, and their tell-tale Venus figurines which Auel uses as one center of her Cro-Magnon religious practices.Tools and carvings characteristic of these cultures and maps delineating the actual basis dig sites are located within the inside cover art of most of the sequels. Film and television adaptations In 1986, the novel was adapted into a film directed by Michael Chapman and starring Daryl Hannah. In 2014, the Lifetime television network ordered a pilot episode, based on the series of novels. Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Jean M. Auel, and Linda Woolverton are executive producers, with Woolverton writing the teleplay. The launch was slated for some time in 2015.Lifetime Orders Drama Pilot 'The Clan of the Cave Bear' Despite reports of plans to shoot a pilot for a series to have started in 2016, with Ireland as one location. This plan was canceled by Lifetime and has been shopped around to various networks with no luck, and presumed to be dead, as of March 2016.

Early life and education Al-Khalidi was born in Jerusalem in 1842.Scholch, p.67. His father, Muhammad Ali al-Khalidi, served as the head of the sharia court in Jerusalem for about sixty years. Members of the Khalidi family, one of the two politically prominent, old families of the local nobility (the other being the al-Husayni clan), continuously held the office through the 18th and 19th centuries. Although the Husayni clan was larger and wealthier, the Khalidis were more united and noted for their intellect. As a teenager, al-Khalidi may have been influenced by the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856. At the age of 17, he wrote of his thoughts about the state of the world, personal dignity and the individual's quest to become free. He viewed the Ottoman Empire as being increasingly surrounded by European powers pilfering the region of its wealth and identified the cause of the situation to be the disparity in knowledge between the region and Europe. Yousef's initial attempt to receive an education in Egypt was unsuccessful and his following attempt to attend a school in Europe was denied by his father. Afterward he and his cousin Husayn left Jerusalem without the family's permission and reached Malta where they were enrolled into the Protestant college through the mediation of the Anglican bishop Gobat of Jerusalem.Scholch, p.68. There, he studied English and French, and then continued to study Semitic languages in the Oriental Academy of Vienna.Before Their Diaspora: Photographic History of Palestine). Walid Khalidi. Yousef's brother Yasin persuaded him after two years in the Protestant college to attend the Imperial Medical School in Constantinople, capital of the Empire. Yousef was dissatisfied with his time at the medical school after a year, finding no \\"salvation, he enrolled in an American school outside of the capital, Robert College. He remained there for a year and a half before returning to Jerusalem because of the death of his father. Career Al- Khalidi played a key role in the opposing political factions established to prohibit the Ottoman Empire's attempts to violate the constitution. He also wrote the first Kurdish-Arabic dictionary. In 1899 he wrote a letter to the Zadok Kahn, the chief rabbi of France in which he stated \\"Who can deny the rights of the Jews to Palestine? My God, historically it is your country!‚Äù, however, he then suggested that, since Palestine was already inhabited, the Zionists should find another place for the implementation of their political goals. \\" ... in the name of God,\\" he wrote, \\"let Palestine be left alone.\\" Kahn showed the letter to Theodore Herzl, the founder of political Zionism. On 19 March 1899 Herzl replied to al-Khalidi in French assuring him that, if the Zionists were not wanted in Palestine, \\"We will search and, believe me, we will find elsewhere what we need.\\" Al-Khalidi died on January 25, 1906.

Sometimes the complete catalog of a label would appear: the complete masters of Milt Gabler's Commodore Records were contained in three sets consisting of some 66 LPs.

In 2006, the company began a third line, Mosaic Singles, a series dedicated to reissuing individual albums on CD that have not previously been available in US editions, or at all. In 2009, Mosaic returned to the vinyl format with the HQ Vinyl Series and began issuing three and four LP sets of 2,500-5,000 copies. Mosaic's sets are primarily sold and distributed directly to customers, initially promoted through leading jazz publications, then mail order catalog, and now the internet. The first three years of releases did not sell particularly well. In 1986, Cuscuna reached out to a record-producing acquaintance, Fred Seibert, for help.

Early history The grape vine is an extremely variable species and some varieties, such as Pinot, mutate particularly frequently. At the same time, the wine and table grape industries have been important since ancient times, so large sums of money can depend on the correct identification of different varieties and clones of grapevines. The science of ampelography began seriously in the 19th century, when it became important to understand more about the different species of vine, as they had very different resistance to disease and pests such as phylloxera. Many vine identification books were published at this time, one of which is Victor Rendu's Amp√©lographie fran√ßaise of 1857, featuring hand-colored lithographs by Eugene Grobon. Pierre Galet Until the Second World War, ampelography had been an art. Then Pierre Galet of the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure agronomique de Montpellier made a systematic assembly of criteria for the identification of vines. The Galet system was based on the shape and contours of the leaves, the characteristics of growing shoots, shoot tips, petioles, the sex of the flowers, the shape of the grape clusters and the colour, size and pips of the grapes themselves. The grapes are less affected by environmental factors than the leaves and the shoots, but are obviously not around for as long. He even included grape flavour as a criterion, but this is rather subjective. Galet then published the definitive book, Amp√©lographie pratique, in 1952, featuring 9,600 types of vine. Amp√©lographie pratique was translated into English by Lucie Morton, published in 1979 and updated in 2000. Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography In 2012, Italian publisher L'Artistica Editrice published Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography, a three volume set which contains the most important books edited in France and Italy between 1800 and 1900: the Amp√©lographie of Pierre Viala and Victor Vermorel, the grapes section of Pomona Italiana by Count Giorgio Gallesio and the Ampelografia Italiana of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture. The book collects 551 color plates of grapes from all over the world, with texts in Italian and English, which describe the morphological and agricultural characteristics of each vine variety, as well as their synonyms and historical curiosities.Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography InfoWine. Retrieved: 2012-08-24. DNA Carole Meredith at the University of California, Davis, pioneered the use of genetic fingerprinting for vine identification. Famous successes with the technique include proving the identity of Zinfandel, Primitivo, and Crljenak Ka≈°telanski, and identifying the parents of Sangiovese as Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. Such exercises are giving valuable insight into historical patterns of trade and migration. DNA fingerprinting uses segments of DNA that do not affect the look or taste of the grapes. More recent work has identified the genes responsible for the differences between grape varieties, such as the VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2 genes that control grape colour, or the VvGAI1 gene that is mutated in some cells of Pinot Meunier compared to Pinot noir.Paul K.

She is particularly remembered for her Lives of the Queens of England (12 vols, 1840‚Äì1848). Biography The daughter of Thomas Strickland and his wife Elizabeth ( Homer), Agnes was born in Rotherhithe, at that time in Surrey, where her father was employed as a manager of the Greenland Dock. She was christened at St Mary's Church, Rotherhithe on 18 August 1796. The family subsequently moved to Thorpe Hamlet, Norwich, and then Stowe House, near Bungay, Suffolk, before settling in 1808 at Reydon Hall, Reydon, near Southwold, also in Suffolk.Cooper 1946. Agnes' siblings were Elizabeth, Sarah, Jane Margaret, Catharine Parr Traill, Susanna Moodie (1803‚Äì1885) and Samuel Strickland. Agnes and her elder sister Elizabeth were educated by their father to a standard more usual for boys at that time. All the children except Sarah eventually became writers.Mitchell 2004. Agnes began her literary career with a poem, Worcester Field, followed by The Seven Ages of Woman and Demetrius. Abandoning poetry, she produced Historical Tales of Illustrious British Children (1833), The Pilgrims of Walsingham (1835) and Tales and Stories from History (1836). Her chief works, however, are Lives of the Queens of England from the Norman Conquest, and Lives of the Queens of Scotland, and English Princesses, etc.. (8 vols., 1850‚Äì1859), Lives of the Bachelor Kings of England (1861), and Letters of Mary Queen of Scots, in some of which she was assisted by her sister Elizabeth. Strickland's researches were laborious and conscientious, and she remains a useful source. Her style is engaging and anecdotal, not as objective as most modern historians, but gives a valuable insight into the mores of her own time. Much of the Strickland sisters' historical research and writing was done by Elizabeth. Elizabeth, however, refused all publicity, and Agnes was named as sole author. Their biographical works are fine representations of the biographies written by Victorian women, many of which focused on female subjects and included aspects of social history such as dress, manners, and diet.Maitzen 1995. Agnes' sisters Susanna Moodie and Catharine Parr Traill became particularly well known for their works about pioneer life in early Canada,https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/roughing-it-with-moodie-and-traill where they both emigrated with their husbands in 1832.

Taylor's own sister tipped off police in June 1989 after 11-year-old Charla King was found raped and strangled to death in Washington Terrace, Utah. His fingerprints were found at the crime scene, which was located in an apartment complex where he had been staying. In December 1989, Taylor was sentenced to death and placed on death row at Utah State Prison. Taylor gave up appealing his sentence after his request for retrial was rejected by the Utah Supreme Court. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Taylor said he chose this method of execution to embarrass the state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor's execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad. Background John Albert Taylor was born in Ogden, Utah to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who separated during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado at the age of nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: \\"But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated me for a long time. I was the whipping post.\\" At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida. In 1977, Taylor was arrested in Florida and charged with burglary and carrying a concealed weapon after he was caught with a stolen gun. He was convicted and imprisoned until December 1981, when he was released on parole. In March 1982, he was arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for armed burglary, armed robbery, and sexual assault. He had been diagnosed at the age of 17 as \\"a remorseless pedophile.\\" He was acquitted of the charges in September 1982, but was sentenced to 15 additional years in prison for parole violations. In 1989, Taylor was released and departed for Utah to be with his sisters and biological father, who he discovered was still alive. Murder of Charla King At around 3:20 p.m. on June 23, 1989, Sherron King returned from work to her apartment in Washington Terrace, Utah to find the body of her daughter Charla in the bedroom with a nightgown wrapped around her head and panties stuffed in her mouth. After calling the police, she was instructed to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation and discovered that Charla had been strangled to death with a telephone cord. Charla's foster grandmother Bertha Poster stated that she had dropped Charla off at the apartment at about 1:30 p.m. after visiting the mall. Charla had been planning to celebrate her 12th birthday at an amusement park on the next day. Prosecutors believe that Taylor entered the house with intent on sexually molesting the girl. When she caught him in the house, prosecutors believe, he chased her into the bedroom, and placed her underwear in her mouth. He raped her, placed a nightgown over her head, and strangled her to death. Arrest On June 25, a tipster, who was later revealed to be Taylor's sister Laurie Galli, contacted Washington Terrace Police officer Marcia Gathercole with information connected to the murder. Taylor's fingerprints were found on a telephone in the King residence and matched to records provided by authorities in Fort Lauderdale. He was arrested at about 9 p.m. on June 28 at the home of his half-sister/incestous lover Tresa Taylor in Ogden, Utah and charged with first-degree burglary, first- degree child rape, and first-degree murder the next morning. Taylor had arrived from Florida four days before the murder and had been staying with another sister in the same apartment complex. Sherron King moved out of the apartment complex on June 28. She was upset that the neighbors who came forward as witnesses did nothing when they heard her daughter screaming. Murder trial On November 27, 1989, the trial commenced under District Judge David Roth after Taylor waived his right to a jury. Taylor testified on his own behalf that he only entered the apartment in the act of burglary while no one was home, leaving his fingerprints on the phone when he found money underneath it. Weber County deputy attorney William Daines stated that Taylor previously denied being in the apartment and that two witnesses placed him at the scene at the time of the crime. Prison inmate Mike Gallegos testified that he had a brief conversation in which Taylor told him that he killed a girl by accident, and masturbated on the corpse. Duane Moyes and James Gaskill of the Weber State College crime laboratory testified that the person who cut the telephone cord with a knife and wrapped it around the neck of the victim was likely the same as the one who left behind fingerprints on the phone. Lab director Gaskill stated that the prints, three of which were matched to fingers on Taylor's left hand, were the only evidence that placed Taylor at the crime scene. Gaskill said there was no evidence in the apartment to indicate a burglary took place or that any other person was connected to the murder. On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor guilty of the first- degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his half-sister Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years to be sent to death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that the facts of the case outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral. Appeals Taylor's appeals were rejected by the Utah Supreme Court. The case was automatically appealed to the Utah Supreme Court, which upheld Taylor's conviction and sentence in October 1991. Taylor's execution was initially scheduled for January 15, 1992. The date was rescheduled to June 24 when Taylor's attorney Martin Gravis requested to withdraw from the case. On June 17, Judge Roth granted a stay of execution after Taylor's new defense attorney Ron Yengich requested more time to prepare an appeal. At issue was a new 1992 law in Utah that established the sentence of life imprisonment without parole. While incarcerated at Utah State Prison, Taylor kept busy in an effort to overcome his claustrophobia and boredom. He earned his high school diploma and studied to be a paralegal until his educational grant money ran out. In October 1995, Taylor decided to end further appeals after the Utah Supreme Court rejected his argument that his legal counsel was ineffective. He fired defense attorney Ed Brass, stating: \\"If I don't fight for my appeal, I don't need an attorney.\\" Taylor said he was prepared to die partly because of his failing health, including an enlarged heart, bleeding ulcers, and swollen legs and feet. Taylor earned his high school diploma and was studying to be a paralegal at Utah State Prison. Judge Roth ordered Taylor to choose a method of execution. Taylor chose to be executed by firing squad to make the process more difficult for Utah state officials. In an interview with the Deseret News, he stated: \\"I didn't commit the murder, and I'm not going to submit to letting them kill me on that table.\\" Regarding the option of lethal injection, Taylor said, \\"I don't want to go flipping around like a fish out of water on that table.\\" Execution For his last meal Taylor ordered a large Ambassador pizza with thin crust, onions, mushrooms, hot peppers, sausage, pepperoni, ham and extra cheese. He also asked for a Coke. When Taylor ordered a last meal of pizzas \\"with everything,\\" some law enforcement veterans recalled that the same request was made by Barton Kay Kirkham, the last man to be hanged in Utah. Like Taylor, Kirkham had selected his method of execution with the goal of inconveniencing the state. On January 25, 1996, Taylor spent his final evening sharing his pizza with his uncle Gordon Lee while joined by former attorney Ed Brass and Catholic priest Reyes Rodriguez, who administered the Last Rites. Taylor, whose stomach had been doing \\"flip-flops\\" earlier in the day, requested antacid medication and declined deputy warden Wally Schulsen's offer for more pizza, soda, and coffee. He gave his glasses to warden Hank Galetka and said, \\"There is no need for them.\\" Taylor refused an offer to be sedated before his execution, but was allowed his first cigarette in six years. Five police officers, who volunteered to carry out the execution, were each paid $300. The shooters used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One chosen at random was loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil were difficult to distinguish from those of a real cartridge. Media coverage Taylor was executed by firing squad in a warehouse at Utah State Prison at 12:03 a.m. on January 26, 1996. Over 168 news and television crews from around the world were on hand to report the execution, which was set up inside a warehouse at Utah State Prison in Draper. Nine media witnesses were allowed to record the actual event. Actor and activist Mike Farrell appeared as a commentator for the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to the death penalty. Elliott King, the uncle of Charla King, was the sole member of the victim's family to arrive as a witness and expressed that he had no sympathy for Taylor. Sister Helen Prejean, the author of Dead Man Walking, wrote Taylor a letter that was delivered right before his execution. Death Shortly before midnight, Taylor was led into the execution chamber and strapped to a chair 17 feet away from the shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852. Aftermath After an autopsy, Taylor's remains were cremated and shipped to his uncle Gordon Lee in Oregon. The Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office said it would specify homicide as the cause of death on Taylor's death certificate because the execution met the state's definition of \\"death by another's hand.\\" A commemorative coin was created to recognize the staff who had participated in the execution. Eight hours after Taylor's execution, Utah State Representative Sheryl Allen first introduced a bill to eliminate the firing squad, and later succeeded in passing HB180, which removed the right of the condemned to choose their method of execution after February 2004.

Today, thousands of individuals identify with various Algonquian peoples. Historically, the peoples were prominent along the Atlantic Coast and into the interior along the Saint Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes. This grouping consists of the peoples who speak Algonquian languages. A 16th- century sketch of the Algonquian village of Pomeiock. Before Europeans came into contact, most Algonquian settlements lived by hunting and fishing, although quite a few supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans and squash (the \\"Three Sisters\\"). The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice. The Algonquians of New England (who spoke Eastern Algonquian) practiced a seasonal economy. The basic social unit was the village: a few hundred people related by a clan kinship structure. Villages were temporary and mobile. The people moved to locations of greatest natural food supply, often breaking into smaller units or gathering as the circumstances required. This custom resulted in a certain degree of cross-tribal mobility, especially in troubled times. In warm weather, they constructed portable wigwams, a type of hut usually with buckskin doors. In the winter, they erected the more substantial longhouses, in which more than one clan could reside. They cached food supplies in more permanent, semi-subterranean structures. In the spring, when the fish were spawning, they left the winter camps to build villages at coastal locations and waterfalls. In March, they caught smelt in nets and weirs, moving about in birch bark canoes. In April, they netted alewife, sturgeon and salmon. In May, they caught cod with hook and line in the ocean; and trout, smelt, striped bass and flounder in the estuaries and streams. Putting out to sea, they hunted whales, porpoises, walruses and seals. The women and children gathered scallops, mussels, clams and crabs, all the basis of menus in New England today. From April through October, natives hunted migratory birds and their eggs: Canada geese, brant, mourning doves and others. In July and August they gathered strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and nuts. In September, they split into small groups and moved up the streams to the forest. There, they hunted beaver, caribou, moose and white-tailed deer. In December, when the snows began, the people created larger winter camps in sheltered locations, where they built or reconstructed longhouses. February and March were lean times. The tribes in southern New England and other northern latitudes had to rely on cached food. Northerners developed a practice of going hungry for several days at a time. Historians hypothesize that this practice kept the population down, according to Liebig's law of the minimum. Northerners were food gatherers only. The southern Algonquians of New England relied predominantly on slash and burn agriculture.Stevenson W. Fletcher, Pennsylvania Agriculture and Country Life 1640-1840 (Harrisburg: Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, 1950), 2, 35-37, 63-65, 124.New England and New York areas 1580-1800, 1953.

Author notes on page 8 that Indians often augmented lightning fires. 1979 Author found no strong evidence that Indians purposely burned large areas, but they did burn small areas near their habitation sites.

Reprinted in 1937 by the Facsimile Text Society, Columbia University Press, New York. Notes that the Lenni Lenape (Delaware) in New Jersey used fire in ecosystems. They cleared fields by burning for one or two years of cultivation, after which the village moved to another location. This is the reason the English found the region relatively cleared and ready for planting. By using various kinds of native corn (maize), beans and squash, southern New England natives were able to improve their diet to such a degree that their population increased and they reached a density of 287 people per 100 square miles as opposed to 41 in the north. Scholars estimate that, by the year 1600, the indigenous population of New England had reached 70,000‚Äì100,000. Colonial period At the time of the first European settlements in North America, Algonquian peoples occupied what is now New Brunswick, and much of what is now Canada east of the Rocky Mountains; what is now New England, New Jersey, southeastern New York, Delaware and down the Atlantic Coast through the Upper South; and around the Great Lakes in present- day Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Iowa. The homeland of the Algonquian peoples is not known. At the time of the European arrival, the hegemonic Iroquois Confederacy, based in present-day New York and Pennsylvania, was regularly at war with Algonquian neighbours. Tribal identities Canada The French and later English encountered the Maliseet of present-day Maine, Quebec and New Brunswick; the Abenaki of Quebec, Vermont and New Hampshire; the Mi'kmaw band governments of the Maritimes lived primarily on fishing. Further north are the Betsiamite, Atikamekw, Anishinaabe and Innu/Naskapi. The Beothuk of Newfoundland might have been Algonquians, but as their last known speaker died in the early 19th century, little record of their language or culture remains. New England area Colonists in the Massachusetts Bay area first encountered the Wampanoag, Massachusett, Nipmuck, Pennacook, Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, and Quinnipiac. The Mohegan, Pequot, Pocumtuc, Podunk, Tunxis, and Narragansett were based in southern New England. The Abenaki were located in northern New England: present-day Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont in what became the United States and eastern Quebec in what became Canada. They had established trading relationships with French colonists who settled along the Atlantic coast and what was later called the Saint Lawrence River. The Mahican were located in western New England in the upper Hudson River Valley (around what was developed by Europeans as Albany, New York). These groups practiced agriculture, hunting and fishing. Midwest The French encountered Algonquian peoples in this area through their trade and limited colonization of New France along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The historic peoples of the Illinois Country were the Shawnee, Illiniwek, Kickapoo, Menominee, Miami, Sauk and Meskwaki. The latter were also known as the Sac and Fox, and later known as the Meskwaki Indians, who lived throughout the present-day Midwest of the United States. During the nineteenth century, many Native Americans from east of the Mississippi River were displaced over great distances through the United States passage and enforcement of Indian removal legislation; they forced the people west of the Mississippi River to what they designated as Indian Territory. After the US extinguished Indian land claims, this area was admitted as the state of Oklahoma in the early 20th century.

It is east of Oldham, and east-northeast of the city of Manchester. It lies in a broad rural area in the southern edge of the South Pennines. To the east of the village Dovestone Reservoir, Chew Reservoir and Greenfield Reservoir lie within the Peak District National Park, though no part of the village itself lies within the Peak Park boundary.Ordnance Survey map Region 8 Lying within the ancient county boundaries of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Greenfield is mainly situated on and around two roads in the Chew Valley. One of these roads is the main A635 road from Ashton-under-Lyne to Holmfirth. History A Roman road passes along the Saddleworth hills, from the fort of Ardotalia in Glossop to Castleshaw Roman fort. The route of the Roman road passes through Greenfield and crosses Chew Brook at Packhorse Bridge. The old stone houses of Saddleworth date from the 17th century and were home to farmers and hand loom weavers in the woollen trade. The first industrial looms were also designed and built in Saddleworth. England's highest church 'The Heights' and canal tunnel 'Standedge Tunnel' are also here, the latter dating from the end of the 18th century and being a Thomas Telford project. The world's first rock climbers' sit harness was invented in Saddleworth in the 1970s, variations of it now forming the basis of almost all the world's climbing sit harnesses. The poem Jone o Grinfilt was written about a fictional inhabitant of the village with the aim of ridiculing countryside dwellers. The poem was written in the Oldham dialect of English, and was very popular in the 19th century. The author was probably Joseph Lees of Glodwick and it was written in the first decade of the 19th century. In 1849 the Boarshurst Silver Band was formed as the village band. This brass band is still in existence.website Governance Greenfield is in the historic county of Yorkshire and prior to 1974 was administered by the West Riding County Council. In that year governance was transferred to the new Greater Manchester County Council. When that body was abolished in 1986 Greenfield came under the auspices of Oldham Borough Council. Administration under the West Riding County Council led to problems, as Greenfield came under the local administration of Holmfirth for such things as the fire service, despite Holmfirth being significantly further away than Oldham. This was particularly problematic in the winter months, as the roads into the village often become blocked or dangerous due to snow and ice coupled with the village's exposed position on the Pennine moorland. Geography Greenfield is at the western end of the Chew Valley in the south west edge of the South Pennines and is fringed by the Peak District to the east. The village contains four reservoirs, three of which are linked to one another: Greenfield, Yeoman Hey and Dovestones. The fourth is Chew Reservoir at the head of Chew Valley, which is the highest man-made reservoir in England.Geograph.org.uk - Chew Reservoir There is a yachting club on Dovestone Reservoir, the largest of these, and a set of walking paths round the first three. A steep walking path also connects Dovestones to Chew Reservoir. Much of the area covered by the reservoirs lies within the boundary of the Peak District National Park. Saddleworth Moor rises above Greenfield and leads over impressively barren and disorientating moorlands to Holmfirth. The area includes some of the sites used by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, known as the 'Moors murders', to bury their child victims in the early to mid 1960s. The sinister nature of the crimes was the subject of a song by the Smiths in 1984. Greenfield is also the home of an amateur rugby league side, Saddleworth Rangers, as well as Greenfield Cricket Club and Saddleworth Cricket Club. There are two junior and infant schools, and three churches (one Methodist and two Anglican). Landmarks Pots and Pans is a locally well-known hill overlooking the village. It is the site of the Saddleworth war memorial (a Grade II listed building), constructed in 1923. Approximately above sea level,Ordnance Survey Landranger Map 110 it is visible from seven of the ten villages that comprise Saddleworth. A service is held there on Remembrance Sunday each year. Transport Rail Greenfield railway station, Saddleworth and Oldham's only remaining railway station Since the Oldham Loop closed, Greenfield is the only place in Saddleworth and the whole Metropolitan Borough of Oldham which has a railway station. Grotton & Springhead, Delph and Grasscroft stations closed in 1955, whilst Diggle and Saddleworth stations closed in 1968. Greenfield railway station lies along the Huddersfield Line with services running towards Huddersfield via Marsden and Slaithwaite and towards Manchester Victoria via Mossley, Stalybridge and Ashton-under-Lyne. A second line, known as the Micklehurst Line, cut through the village and was mainly used for freight. This closed in 1966 and the viaducts were removed in the mid 1970s, the former route now occupied, in the main, by a bridleway. Bus The main bus services in Greenfield are run by First Greater Manchester. The terminus in Greenfield, at the Clarence Hotel, runs a half-hourly Monday-Saturday daytime service and hourly evening and Sunday service to Manchester Piccadilly via Oldham. There is also an hourly weekday service (two hourly on a Sunday) to Huddersfield via Diggle. Culture Greenfield is one of the towns and villages which holds an annual Whit Friday brass band contest and the annual Road End Fair is held every Maundy Thursday in the centre of the village. Notable residents Hervey Rhodes, Baron Rhodes, Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire (from 1968 to 1971) and Deputy-Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester in 1974, was from Greenfield. Also Sir W.

In 1746 he was appointed to the Iroquois' Onondaga Council and remained so until he was banished from the frontier in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War.Greenwood, 46. Emigrating from Ireland to Pennsylvania in 1741, he had become an important trader by going to the villages of Native Americans, learning their languages and customs, and working on the frontier where previously mostly French had been trading. During and after King George's War of the 1740s, he helped negotiate new treaties and alliances for the British with Native Americans. Croghan was appointed in 1756 as Deputy Indian Agent with chief responsibility for the Ohio region tribes. He assisted Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern District, who was based in New York and had strong alliances with the Iroquois. Beginning in the 1740s and following this appointment, Croghan amassed hundreds of thousands of acres of land in today's western Pennsylvania and New York by official grants and from Native American purchases. Beginning in 1754, he was a rival of George Washington for influence in Ohio Country and remained far more powerful there for more than 20 additional years. During the American Revolutionary War in 1777, he was falsely accused of treason. He was acquitted the following year but patriot authorities did not allow him back in the Ohio territory. Ohio's recorded history begins with Croghan's actions in the mid-1740s as fur trader, Iroquois sachem, and go-between for Pennsylvania, according to historian Alfred A. Cave. Cave concludes that the treason charge that ended Croghan's career was trumped up by his enemies.Cave, 12 Western Pennsylvania became the focal point in August 1749 when Croghan purchased 200,000 acres from the Iroquois, exclusive of two square miles at the Forks of the Ohio for a British fort.Wainwright, 41 Croghan soon learned that his three deeds would be invalidated if part of Pennsylvania, sabotaged that colony's effort to erect the fort, and led the Ohio Confederation to permit Virginia's Ohio Company to build it and settle the region.Greenwood, 5-7 Late in 1753 Virginia sent George Washington to the Ohio Country, who would eventually end Croghan's influence there. Braddock's Defeat in 1755 and French control of Ohio Country, which they called the Illinois Country, indicating the area of their greater settlement, found Croghan building forts on the Pennsylvania frontier. Following which he manned the farthest frontier post in present-day New York as Deputy Indian agent under Sir William Johnson, called the \\"Mohawk Baron\\" for his extensive landholdings and leadership with the Mohawk and other Iroquois. Croghan briefly lived until 1770 on a quarter of a million New York acres. He resigned as Indian agent in 1771 to establish Vandalia, a fourteenth British colony to include parts of present-day West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania, and eastern Kentucky, but continued to serve as a borderland negotiator for Johnson, who died a British loyalist in 1774. While working to keep the Ohio Indians neutral during the Revolutionary War, Croghan served as Pittsburgh's president judge for Virginia and chairman of its Committee of Safety. General Edward Hand, the local military commander, banished Col. Croghan from the frontier in 1777 on suspicion of treason. Despite his acquittal in a November, 1778 trial, Croghan was not allowed to return to the frontier.Wainwright, 307 His death in 1782, shortly after the end of the Revolutionary War, received little if any notice. Although often quoted by historians, the story of Croghan's 30 years as the pivotal figure in Ohio Country history is only found in the handful of biographies. Early life and career Little is known of Croghan's early life, including the names of his parents.Wainwright, 3. He was born in Ireland around 1718. The best evidence for Croghan's age is found in the treasonous Filius Gallicae letters, written early in 1756 by an otherwise anonymous author. \\"France's friend\\" claimed to be nearly 38 years old, among other self-descriptions that pointed to Croghan, but a secret British investigation exposed the fraud.Wainwright, 107. Croghan testified to his Irish origins in meetings in London in the 1760s. Croghan is a corruption and Anglicization of an older native Irish surname Mac Conchruachahttps://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/surname/index.cfm?fuseaction=Go.&Surname;=Croghan Apparently Croghan's father died young and his widowed mother married again, to Thomas Ward. Croghan emigrated as a young man from Dublin, Ireland to the province of Pennsylvania in 1741. His mother and step-father, his half-brother Edward Ward, and cousin Thomas Smallman also emigrated, the men working for him in America. Among relatives remaining in Ireland were a merchant, Nicholas Croghan (likely a brother of George);Wainwright, 260 an aunt, Mrs. Smallman; and George's grandfather Edmund Croghan.Wainwright, 207. Within a few years Croghan became one of Pennsylvania's leading fur traders. A key to his success was establishing trading posts in Native American villages, as the French traders did, and learning their languages and customs. At the time, the usual British practice was to set up a post at a site for their own convenience, generally at a major crossroads, and wait for Native Americans to come to them.Michael J. Mullin, \\"Croghan, George\\", American National Biography Online, February 2000. Croghan learned at least two Native languages, Delaware (an Algonquian language common to the Lenape of the mid-Atlantic region) and probably Seneca (an Iroquoian language spoken by the westernmost Seneca nation of the Iroquois), whose territory extended into what colonists called Pennsylvania. They also had hunting grounds in the Ohio Valley. These were the languages of the two major nations of Native Americans in the region. Croghan also learned Native American customs, rapidly adopting the practice of exchanging gifts when he met with the people. He established his first trading base and wintered in a mostly Seneca village at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on Lake Erie. (This area later developed as Cleveland, Ohio.) During the early years, Croghan's primary business partner was William Trent, also a trader. The son of the founder of Trenton, New Jersey, Trent likely supplied capital to acquire trade goods and set up their business. Marriages and families Croghan married in the 1740s and had a daughter, Susannah Croghan (1750-1790). He later married again, while serving as Deputy Indian agent to Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Northern District. His second wife was a Mohawk woman, Catherine (Takarihoga), daughter of Mohawk chief Nickus Peters (Karaghaigdatie). Their daughter Catherine (Adonwentishon) Croghan (1759-1837) would assume her mother's hereditary role as head of the Turtle clan. She later was the third wife of Joseph Brant, the prominent Mohawk war leader who led his people during their migration and settlement in Canada on lands granted by the Crown after the American Revolutionary War. Brant's sister Molly was a long-term consort of Sir William Johnson, so Croghan was doubly connected to influential British and Mohawk families in the East. Elizabeth Brant a daughter of Joseph Brant and Catherine (Adonwentishon) Crogan married William Johnson Kerr-a grandson of Sir William Johnson and Molly Brant. King George's War, 1744‚Äì1748 Britain's blockade of French ports made the few French trade goods reaching Ohio Country prohibitively expensive; this resulted in a bonanza for the Pennsylvania British traders that alarmed the French. They knew that Native American trade and diplomacy were closely linked, and Croghan's activities from his base on the Cuyahoga River threatened French influence among the regional natives. As Croghan expanded his trading network westward toward Detroit, then held by the French, they encouraged French-allied Native Americans to attack him. The British trader quickly took advantage of wartime conditions, establishing new posts at the Wyandot village of Sandusky and the Miami village of Pickawillany, tribes that had previously traded with the French. His partnership with Trent was temporarily suspended when the latter joined the military to serve in King George's War (1744‚Äì48). The two men bought property on Conedogwinet Creek in present-day Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Croghan developed a plantation there which served as his home and base of operations from about 1745 until 1751.Wainwright, 8‚Äì13. In April 1745 the Seneca protected Croghan from capture, but elsewhere French-allied Natives robbed a canoe-load of Croghan's furs.Wainwright, 8. Croghan was adopted by the Seneca and in 1746, according to his testimony before the Lords of Trade in 1764, was one of their hereditary sachems among the 50 chiefs comprising the Six Nations' Onondaga Council. Already on it was William Johnson, the future British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Northern District, Croghan's superior. Their principal French competitor for influence among the Native Americans in the Ohio region was Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, son of the French fur trader Louis-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire (1670‚Äì1740),Wainwright, 13 another Seneca appointee to the Onondaga Council two decades earlier. That these men were members of the tribes they represented cannot be overemphasized in understanding their roles in American history. Early in 1747, Seneca and Wyandot warriors murdered five French traders at the Wyandot village of Sandusky. This was the start of a regional Indian revolt against the French fomented by Croghan.Wainwright, 3 The Wyandot chief Nicholas Orontony led it at first. He was followed by Memeskia (or \\"Old Briton\\" as Croghan named him),Anderson, 28-29 known by the French as La Demoiselle, who was a Piankeshaw Miami chief. Unsuccessful in driving out the French, the participating bands became more closely aligned with the British. Reports claimed that Croghan had encouraged the uprising so that the Natives would trade with him and not the French. Old Briton relocated to Pickawillany on the Great Miami River, where Croghan built a stockade and trading post.Wainwright, 14‚Äì15. Aided by local Iroquois chiefs Tanacharison (Half King) and Scarouady sent to oversee the Mingo and dependent Ohio Country nations, Croghan organized the Ohio Confederation of the region's tribes in 1748; they lit a \\"council fire on the Ohio River, independent of the Six Nations.\\"Aquila,194. Greenwood believes this was Croghan's initiative, as shown by earlier and subsequent events.Greenwood, 3. At the same time Croghan brought the Miami into an alliance with Great Britain, formalized in a July, 1748 treaty at Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Andrew Montour, a conference interpreter, became Croghan's closest associate until his death in 1772. The other interpreter, Conrad Weiser, had been appointed as British Indian agent for Pennsylvania. Weiser held a conference in August 1748 at Logstown, on the Ohio River near its confluence in today's western Pennsylvania, to inform the recently allied tribes of the Ohio Confederation gathered at their capital that Britain had signed a peace treaty with France ending the war. As a result, the English had no more war supplies for them and he distributed gifts instead. Pennsylvania approved Weiser's recommendation that the colony appoint Croghan as its negotiator with the Ohio Country Indians.Wainwright, 18‚Äì21 His success in that role should surprise no one. The French attacked pro-British tribes left hanging by the peace without arms and ammunition to defend themselves. Celeron de Bienville led a 1749 expedition to claim the Ohio Valley for France and drive out the English traders; Governor James Hamilton (Pennsylvania), sent Croghan to Logstown to investigate.Wainwright, 27 Days before Celeron reached Logstown, its chiefs sold Croghan in the area, excluding at the Forks of the Ohio reserved for construction of a British fort.(A map accompanying the text for the first Pennsylvania Croghan historical marker may be found on the Critical Comments page of the ohiocountry.us website). Biographer Wainwright said gaining this huge amount of land was \\"a momentous event in his [Croghan's] life,\\"Wainwright, 28 a gross understatement of its impact on history, namely the otherwise unlikely penetration of Virginia into Ohio Country. Virginia's Ohio Company, which acted on behalf of the Commonwealth, sent agents Col. Thomas Cresap and Hugh Parker into the region, who made overtures to the Miami at Pickawillany. In a November,1749 letter to Pennsylvania's governor, Croghan offered to oppose them.Wainwright, 30 Not long thereafter he learned that his in Indian grants were against Pennsylvania statutes, as the colony tried to protect the natives, but were permitted in Virginia.Anderson, 30 By 1750 he and Montour were aiding the Virginia Commonwealth, guiding its scout Christopher Gist on a tour of Ohio Indian villages. Croghan had already informed Pennsylvania Governor Hamilton that the Ohio Confederation wanted a British fort at the Forks of the Ohio. During a Logstown conference at the end of May 1751, he formally recorded the request and sent Andrew Montour to the Pennsylvania Assembly to confirm it. Montour, however, denied that the Indians wanted a fort, claiming that it was all Croghan's idea. The colony's plans for a fort evaporated as Pennsylvania \\"defaulted its leadership in the West to Virginia's Ohio Company.\\"Wainwright, 41-44 Croghan protested and among other things had Montour retract his testimony before the Pennsylvania Assembly, but no one believed it. Evidence of the underhanded charade is found in the Native American conference held in June 1752 at Logstown, with Croghan serving on the Indian Council and Andrew Montour acting as translator. The Ohio Confederation gave Virginia's Ohio Company permission to build a fort and settle one hundred families on in today's Western Pennsylvania. Midway during the conference, a French force led by Charles Langlade made a Raid on Pickawillany, killing a few British traders and 13 Miami, including Old Briton. Early in the spring of 1753, Canada's Governor Duquesne \\"opened his campaign to drive the English out of the Ohio Valley.\\"Wainwright, 49-50 That October during a conference held at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Scarouady officially appointed Croghan as the representative of the Ohio Confederation in communications to and from Pennsylvania, and authorized him to receive its gifts for the tribes. His biographer Wainwright says this suggests that he organized his own appointment.Wainwright, 55 When the year ended with 21-year-old George Washington making his diplomatic journey to the French at Fort Le Boeuf, Croghan, about 35, had been operating in Ohio Country for twelve years, and was the leading figure among its British traders, Native American tribes and bands, and colonial agents. Soon after Washington returned from delivering Virginia Governor Dinwiddie's summons to the French, Croghan was in Ohio Country gathering intelligence for Pennsylvania, helping to build the Ohio Company stockade commanded by William Trent, and supplying the Indians with food, rum, and weapons. When the French reached the Forks of the Ohio early that spring, Croghan's half-brother Ensign Edward Ward was in charge of the garrison and forced to surrender. Seven Years' War The Seven Years' War (1756-1763) in North America, or French and Indian War as this front was known in the colonies, unofficially began in 1754 with the Battle of Jumonville Glen and effectively ended in 1760 with the British capture of Montreal. French forces occupied the Ohio Country and expelled or arrested British fur traders. By the end of May, Croghan and Montour were in Winchester, Virginia, where Governor Dinwiddie commissioned them as captains under Col. George Washington. Croghan was to supply flour for the expedition and advise Washington on Indian affairs. Washington alienated his Indian allies during a crucial conference at Gist's plantation and blamed Croghan for the subsequent defeat at Fort Necessity.Wainwright, 65 The Half King and Queen Aliquippa took their people to Croghan's plantation on Augwick Creek, seeking refuge. The Queen died and the Half-King became fatally ill and died that October, followed by the Queen in late December.Wainwright, 75-78 During the Braddock Expedition in 1755, Croghan, assisted by Montour, led eight Indian scouts, the same group who had been with the Half King at Jumonville Glen a year earlier. General Braddock alienated the other friendly Indians, yet Montour and the handful with Croghan attended the gravely wounded general. Teamsters Daniel Boone and Daniel Morgan fled on horseback as Croghan pressed Braddock to relinquish commandWainwright, 93 and, despite the general's refusal, apparently took charge. He got Braddock off the battlefield with the help of Braddock's aide, the 23-year-old Washington. Washington's account differs and his biographer James Flexner does not mention Croghan being present.Flexner, 129-130 Captains Croghan and Montour were there, outranked the General's aide, and worked together to save Braddock, with Croghan the more likely leader in the emergency. It was a familiar role, one Croghan assumed on the Pennsylvania frontier a year earlier,Volwiler, 800 and during the almost continuous crises in Ohio Country before and after until 1777. In 1755, friendly Indians again sought refuge at Augwick. Croghan fortified it as Fort Shirley, one of four forts he built on the frontier. In 1756, he relocated to the western edge of the New York frontier, beginning a 15-year career as Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs under Sir William Johnson. Johnson appointed him to deal with the Susquehanna and Allegheny Indians. With Montour at his side and in command of 100 Indians on an overlooking hilltop, Croghan witnessed in July 1758 General James Abercrombie's calamitous frontal assault on Fort Ticonderoga. Afterward Croghan wrote Johnson that he feared a similar \\"thrashing\\" for Gen. John Forbes advance forces nearing Fort Duquesne, unaware that Major James Grant had been defeated five days earlier.Wainwright, 145 Claiming to be one himself, Croghan used his influence on the Indians at Easton, Pennsylvania, where the treaty that stripped the French of their local allies was negotiated, assuring Forbes' success. He then joined Forbes on November 20 with fifteen Indian scouts in his usual role at the head of the military column, likely the first to see that the French had burned Fort Duquesne to prevent it being used by the British.Wainwright, 151 Forbes assigned Croghan and Montour to bring in the regional Delaware warriors for a peace treaty with the British.Wainwright, 153 Still under Col. Henry Bouquet's command early in 1759, Croghan gathered intelligence about the French force at Venango, \\"700 troops and about 950 Indians.\\" About to overwhelm Pittsburgh in July, these French forces were ordered to relieve Fort Niagara, where they were ambushed and defeated by Sir William Johnson.Wainwright, 165 After Montreal capitulated to the British, Croghan accompanied Major Rogers to Detroit. During 1761 and 1762, Croghan negotiated preliminary treaties with thirteen western tribes on behalf of the British Crown, gaining their acceptance of its assumption of rule in areas ceded by the French. These treaties were formalized in the September 1761 conference at Detroit, which was presided over by Sir William Johnson. Croghan countered Seneca efforts to enlist the western Indians in an anti-British alliance; as he had in 1748, he organized the western groups into a confederacy independent of the Six Nations.Wainwright, 182 General Jeffery Amherst did not understand Native American culture, calling the practice of gift giving foolish, akin to bribery. He considered the cost of maintaining peace with the Indians exorbitant, and cut Indian Department expenses to the bone. By stopping gift giving, he insulted the Native Americans. (Croghan covered some expenses and wrote that he served \\"the King for nothing\\").Wainwright, 195 Amherst also severely limited the gunpowder and lead available to the Indians, thinking it would forestall future uprisings. But the friendly Native Americans needed these supplies to hunt and acquire game for survival, as well as to trade the skins and furs for necessities. Amherst ignored Croghan's intelligence that as a result, an Indian war was imminent. The Indians were furious to learn that the French had ceded all Indian territory to the British in the Treaty of Paris. After having achieved relatively amicable relations with the French, who had learned about their culture and with whom they had relations for a long time, they resented the patronizing and insulting treatment by Amherst and his officers. They complained he treated them like slaves and dogs. They joined Pontiac's Rebellion to expel the British from their territory. Pontiac's Rebellion When Indian attacks engulfed Ohio Country in 1763, Croghan was in Philadelphia advising Governor Hamilton on Indian affairs and selling real estate. He galloped to Lancaster where word reached him that his business partner Col. Clapham had been killed in the region's initial attack, their Sewickley Creek trading post burned along with Croghan Hall near Pittsburgh, and that Fort Pitt was under siege.Wainwright, 196-198 General Amherst in New York ordered Croghan to Fort Pitt to investigate the causes of the uprising and Col. Bouquet to relieve it with a few hundred men. Croghan provided Bouquet with the latest intelligence from Carlisle. At Shippensburg he helped calm fearful residents by recruiting and arming 25 men to garrison abandoned Fort Lyttleton. He also hired locals to carry ammunition and supplies from Fort Loudon to Bedford. He reached Bedford on June 12 and, believing further travel west too dangerous, he fed starving families and bolstered the garrison of seven soldiers under Captain Lewis Ourry. A few weeks later Indians attacked fifteen men mowing Croghan's fields within a mile of the fort, scalping two. Croghan refused Bouquet's order to march with his column when it left Bedford on July 27. Instead on August 2 he set out for Philadelphia to pursue private interests.Wainwright, 198-200 Denied leave by General Amherst to travel to London, Croghan resigned as Deputy Indian agent, angering Amherst. The general sailed to London on his own business. Croghan, accompanied by two officers recently besieged in Ft. Detroit and recalled to testify about the Indian rebellion, set sail on the Britannia. The ship wrecked off the Normandy coast in January 1764.Wainwright, 204 He survived, visiting Normandy historical sites on his journey to Le Havre, where he crossed the Channel to London. In this period, Philadelphia was invaded by 250 Paxton Boys, frontiersmen bent on killing hundreds of friendly Indians who had taken refuge in the city. Fifty Paxton Boys had recently murdered 22 Conestoga Indians (Susquehannock), a Christian band. The Paxton Boys were seeking further vengeance for Pontiac's War and earlier Indian raids, but were halted by city officials, including Benjamin Franklin. Croghan later wrote a \\"Narrative of the Late Massacres.\\"Silver, 203 The vigilante Black Boys also operated in Pennsylvania, creating a challenge for Croghan after his return. While in London, Croghan was described as \\"the personification of wealth and power.\\"Wainwright, 206 The Lords of Trade declined Croghan's request to transfer his Indian grant of from the Ohio to the Mohawk River valley, refused to compensate traders for war losses, or to permit an Illinois colony. But the Lords agreed to free the Indian Department from military control and to consider moving the Proclamation Line of 1763, which was intended to prevent westward settlement by British colonists and keep peace with Native Americans, from the Appalachian Mountains to the Ohio River.Wainwright, 207-208 As the months waiting on the Lords dragged by, a planned trip to Ireland to claim the estate of his grandfather, Edmund Croghan, was put aside, significant for showing that Croghan's extreme ethnic pride and possible homesickness were now secondary to his life in America. Upon Croghan's return, Sir William Johnson ordered him to accompany Col. Bouquet's expedition against the Ohio tribes, but furnishing newly purchased Monckton Hall near Philadelphia was a higher priority. He assigned the negotiations to his assistant, Alexander McKee.Wainwright, 210-211 Col. Bouquet, traveling east after his victorious 1764 Ohio campaign, was outraged to learn in a letter from Croghan to McKee that the Indian Department was now independent of local military control. Further incensed when the report was confirmed, Bouquet called Croghan \\"illiterate, imprudent [or \\"impudent,\\" sources vary], and ill bred\\" in a letter to British General Thomas Gage complaining of the agent.Wainwright, 120 Although Bouquet soon recanted, saying that Croghan was the best person to pacify Illinois Country,Volwiler, 177 his ill-considered and untrue characterization of Croghan has endured. From 1764 onward, despite continual provocations, the tribes were kept at peace on the frontier, largely due to the herculean efforts of Croghan. The exceptions were isolated incidents and Dunmore's War in 1774 on the Shawnee, when the former Indian agent worked to keep the Delaware and other Indian nations neutral. Seen as a 1765 prelude to the Revolutionary War, Croghan's first shipment of Indian presents and trade goods to Pittsburgh provoked armed rebellion by frontiersmen led by James Smith. Played by John Wayne in Hollywood's 1939 version of the incident, Allegheny Uprising, Smith's hatred of Indians was long standing. At nineteen, as a captive in Fort Duquesne, Smith was traumatized by the screams of Braddock's captured soldiers being slowly tortured to death by Indian allies of the French. There were two justifications for leading the Black Boys in the attack on the British convoy, burning most of Croghan's gifts, and threatening his life if he ever returned to Cumberland County.Volwiler, 179 Pennsylvania had proscribed trade with the Ohio Indians before a peace was established under a new treaty and as a Crown Indian agent, Croghan was prohibited from engaging in Indian trade. Without the trade and gifts, no peace treaty was possible and Croghan was quick to point out the threat to British rule.George Croghan's Journal, 18-19 Despite Black Boy opposition, Croghan accumulated enough goods to open trade with the Ohio Indians in Pittsburgh; he set off for Illinois Country. His party was attacked near the mouth of the Wabash River by eighty Kickapoo and Mascouten warriors. Two of Croghan's men and three Indians were killed, Croghan tomahawked, the camp plundered and the survivors marched to Vincennes and eventually Ouiatenon.Volwiler, 185-186 In a conference on July 13, Croghan reconciled the Ottawa, Piankashaw, Miami, Ouiatenon, Mascouten, and Kickapoo Indians to British rule, a peace confirmed shortly afterward in a grand council that included Chief Pontiac. The principals journeyed to Detroit, where Croghan conducted an even larger conference that brought the Potawatomi, Ojibway, Wyandot, and Wea tribes into the British economic orbit, with Pontiac \\"playing an important part in the proceedings.\\"Volwiler, 188 At the time, Croghan was celebrated as a national hero for negotiating with Pontiac and ending the Indian war. Croghan led a group of speculators, including Benjamin Franklin and his son William Franklin, in pursuing land in the Ohio Country, the Illinois Country, and New York. On September 6, 1765, Croghan was awarded a grant of . George Croghan's Otsego Patents By Spring 1766 Croghan resumed his mission to the Illinois tribes on the Mississippi. Seventeen bateaux left Pittsburgh on June 18, one carrying Croghan and his party, another carrying Captain Harry Gordon and Ensign Thomas Hutchins on a river mapping expedition, two carrying provisions for Fort Chartres, and thirteen carrying Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan trade goods.Volwiler, 195 They traveled north from the Ohio River on the Mississippi to reach the former colonial French settlement of Fort Chartres. During his August conferences there, Croghan successfully negotiated with 22 tribes, soon augmented by three Indian nations under French influence.Volwiler, 197 Weak from malaria, Croghan accompanied Gordon and Hutchins to New Orleans. From there he sailed for New York with stops at Mobile, Pensacola, Havana, and Charleston. Later life His ship reached New York on January 10, 1767 and two days later Croghan joined Samuel Wharton in urging Gen. Gage to establish an Illinois colony. When Gage refused, Croghan publicly resigned as Deputy Indian agent.Wainwright, 239 Laid low by illness, he spent February recuperating at Monckton Hall near Philadelphia. In March he went to New York to visit with Sir William Johnson, who convinced him to withdraw his resignation. Sent to Fort Pitt in May, Croghan defused an Indian war over squatters and illegal trade. Governor John Penn detained Croghan in Philadelphia on his return east, with questions about the Indians to accompany the survey of borders between the colonies by Mason and Dixon, to settle the borders of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia). He said of Croghan: \\"It would be very difficult to manage this business without his assistance.\\"Wainwright, 244 The Indians halted the survey before it was completed, in what was a vain attempt by Croghan to protect his 1749 grant by the Seneca for 200,000 acres from being included in Pennsylvania. A hard year for Croghan's Indian diplomacy followed: the Black Boys' pledged in March to kill Croghan on his way to an Indian conference in Pittsburgh,Wainwright, 251 and hostile Lord Hillsborough was appointed in London to the government portfolio for American affairs.Wainwright, 253 Croghan established a quiet retreat at his large parcel of land at Lake Otsego. Its outlet is the headwater of the Susquehanna River. He built a six- chimney \\"hutt\\" and had Croghan Forest's surveyed in September 1768 prior to final discussions by Sir Johnson with the Six Nations of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix.Wainwright, 256 As noted above, before completion of the Fort Stanwix Treaty in November 1768, the Six Nations sold Croghan in New York bordering Lake Otsego, plus numerous tracts for his friends. At the large conference, attended by more than 3100 Iroquois, the Six Nations demanded (on his part) that the Crown recognize these and other pre-treaty sales. They also asked that a grant by them of on the Ohio to Trent and his associates be made part of the treaty. Third, they wanted to ensure that should Pennsylvania seize the which the Indians had granted to Croghan at the Forks of the Ohio, they requested that the Crown grant Croghan as much land elsewhere. Sir William Johnson was censured by the Crown for aiding Croghan's private land dealings, and the government refused to ratify these private requests.Wainwright, 257 Facing bankruptcy, Croghan \\"drew bills payable on Samuel Wharton in London\\" for thousands of pounds in order to patent his New York land.Wainwright, 267 Crippled with gout and hounded by creditors, Croghan sought refuge in Croghan Forest, which totaled more than . Its remote setting did not protect him when the Wharton bills were returned for nonpayment in February 1770.Wainwright, 271 Croghan Hall gave the ailing Croghan a refuge from lawsuits and debtors' prison, but he could do little more than watch as settlers poured into the Ohio Country on land he considered to be his. Pennsylvania appointed officials for newly established Bedford County in 1771.Wainwright, 277 Among those buying land from Croghan's 1749 Indian grant was George Washington through his agent William Crawford.[13] \\"I am likely to sell another tract to Coll. Washington and his friends,\\" Croghan wrote to Joseph Wharton, Jr. and to Michael Gratz, \\"I have sold a parcel of lands to Coll Washington,\\"[14], but there were no further sales to him beyond in today's Perryopolis, Pennsylvania. Crawford surveyed land near Chartiers Creek for Washington that Croghan claimed when his survey of an Indian deed fell far short of the called for and he had it redone. More than twenty years later, in 1784, Washington won a court case against Chartiers Creek families who had bought their land from Croghan. Washington's document was dated July 5, 1775, two years after his land dispute with Croghan began.[15] It was made out by Lord Dunmore aboard a British warship on the James River, signed a few days after Washington had assumed command of the Continental army besieging Boston.[16] Croghan's luck appeared to change when the Crown agreed to a new inland colony, Vandalia, appointing him as Indian agent and its largest land owner. Crown agents were restricted from forming such ventures, however, so Croghan resigned from the Indian Department on November 2, 1771.Wainwright, 281 Alexander McKee took his place as deputy agent, with Croghan \\"on call when Indian affairs were critical.\\"Wainwright, 282 He took his cousin Thomas Smallman into a fur trading partnership and Croghan \\"made a major effort to liquidate his debts.\\" Although failing to sell any of his New York acres, Barnard and Michael Gratz remained Croghan's agents, creditors, primary suppliers and friends. He felt great sorrow at the loss of his friend Andrew Montour, murdered in January 1772. The British abandoned Fort Pitt that fall, and Croghan had McKee tell the Indians that it was done to please them. 1772 ended with \\"the news that the Privy Council had overruled Lord Hillsborough and approved Vandalia.\\"Wainwright, 283-284 A year passed with Vandalia still in limbo. Croghan borrowed money and pawned his plate (silver), spending ¬£1,365 for provisions and gifts for 400 Indians who attended his November conference regarding the proposed colony. \\"Convinced that the powerful Vandalia project had fallen through, Lord Dunmore, governor of Virginia, decided to make good his colony's western claims. Presumably, when Dunmore visited Pittsburgh in the summer of 1773, he met Croghan, for he agreed to recognize the validity of Croghan's Indian grant.\\"Wainwright, 286 Dunmore appointed an associate and nephew of Croghan as his western agent. Dr. John Connolly, fully supported by Croghan, \\"claimed Pittsburgh for Virginia in January, 1774, and called up the militia. The first men to appear at the parade ground for the initial muster came from Croghan Hall.\\"Wainwright, 287 Virginia's claim was opposed by Pennsylvania's General Arthur St. Clair, the colony's chief official west of the Alleghenies.Wainwright, 283 Dunmore's War Dunmore's War broke out in the Pennsylvania area in the spring of 1774, when frontiersmen led by Michael Cresap killed two Shawnee warriors, and Daniel Greathouse led other pioneers to kill the family of Logan, old Shikallamy's son. Croghan kept the Seneca and Delaware neutral, but his cooperation with St. Clair in defending the frontier prompted Connolly to accuse him of deserting Virginia. Shawnee chief Cornstalk, not wanting war, had three chiefs escort the traders from his villages to Croghan Hall. Connolly ordered 40 militiamen to capture or kill the Indians and they succeeded in shooting one of the Shawnee chiefs after they had escaped across the Allegheny. St. Clair, echoing other Pennsylvanians, said that Croghan was \\"indefatigable in endeavoring to make up the breeches.\\"Wainwright, 189-191 That August deputies of the Six Nation brought the news of Sir William Johnson's death. He had died in July, the day before a sheriff's sale put over of Croghan's New York land on the auction block. Bids totaled ¬£4,840 despite the pall Johnson's death cast over the proceedings. Many of the bids were never paid and the sheriff absconded with most of the money collected, leaving only ¬£900 for Croghan. He raised $6,000 in Virginia to buy directly from the Iroquois on the eastern bank of the Allegheny River. Samuel Wharton sent encouraging news about Vandalia, including the arrival of a large shipment of goods for gifts to the Indians and land payments, temporarily stored at Georgetown because of Dunmore's War.Wainwright, 292-293 Governor Dunmore reached Pittsburgh in September, pausing in his campaign against the Shawnee to grill Croghan concerning \\"Connolly's accusations about inciting the Shawnees to attack Virginia and siding with Pennsylvania against Virginia. Croghan easily disproved the charges and was reinstated in Dunmore's good graces.\\"Wainwright, 294 After bringing his war to a successful close that fall, Dunmore left 75 militia under Connolly to garrison Fort Pitt, renamed Fort Dunmore. The Virginia governor also adjourned the Augusta county court from Staunton to Pittsburgh, where he appointed Croghan to serve as president judge. American Revolution Croghan chaired Pittsburgh's Committee of Correspondence formed in May 1775 after the battles of Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts. The following month he was hosting an Indian conference to ratify Governor Dunmore's treaty of peace when Connolly was arrested by Pennsylvanians and taken to prison at Hannastown. Croghan and his committee objected and Connolly was released; he escaped to join Lord Dunmore and other Loyalists aboard a British man-of-war.Wainwright, 295 On July 10, 1775 Croghan purchased from the Six Nations between the Allegheny and Beaver rivers. Two days later, Congress established an Indian Department and appointed trader Richard Butler as its Pittsburgh agent. When Butler retired in April 1776, Croghan lobbied for his position. But, George Morgan was chosen as Indian agent and, still resentful for the failed Illinois trading venture a decade earlier, \\"had absolutely no use for Croghan.\\"Wainwright, 296-299 During the summer of 1777, Croghan visited Williamsburg, Virginia at the expense of the Gratz brothers to obtain a clear title to land he had sold them. After conferring with Governor Patrick Henry about frontier defenses, he returned to Pittsburgh with dispatches for General Edward Hand, who greeted him with suspicion. What was believed to be a Loyalist conspiracy had been uncovered. Colonel George Morgan, the Indian agent, Alexander McKee; Simon Girty, and others were under arrest. General Hand examined Thomas Smallman's papers and although there was nothing to indicate Croghan was disloyal, Hand ordered him to Philadelphia. Two weeks after he reached the city, it was captured by the British. Croghan, too ill with gout to escape, was hauled before General Howe and castigated for chairing Pittsburgh's Committee of Safety and keeping the Lake Indians neutral. Ordered to take lodgings in town, where he was kept under constant supervision by two British officers, Croghan learned that Monckton Hall was burnt after the battle of Germantown, \\"another severe financial blow.\\"Wainwright, 300-301 When the British evacuated Philadelphia in June 1778, they left Croghan behind on parole. Returning Pennsylvania officials accused him of collaborating with the enemy, but Croghan was acquitted in a November 12, 1778 trial.Wainwright, 302-303 General Hand refused to let him return to Croghan Hall in western Pennsylvania, and Croghan spent the next two winters in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In an effort to pay off debts, Croghan mortgaged Croghan Hall to Joseph Simon. He deeded of his Indian grant to the Gratzes, who paid his bills and financed another trip to Williamsburg to seek to have his Indian titles recognized by the state of Virginia, without success. Bedridden with gout upon his return, Croghan wrote few letters to family and friends. In May 1780, he moved to Philadelphia, where he learned his western properties were within the boundaries of the new state of Pennsylvania.Wainwright, 305-305 Croghan died at his home in Passyunk Township, on August 31, 1782. By then he was such an obscure figure that his death was not reported in newspapers. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. The marker on his grave was deteriorated by the elements, and the location was unmarked for many years.Wainwright, 310; Volwiler, 334. Volwiler, writing in 1926, did not know where Croghan was buried. Croghan's estate Historical marker honoring Croghan in Cooperstown, New York. While the total value of his personal estate was valued at only ¬£50 13s.6d, his extensive land holdings were \\"conservatively estimated at ¬£140,000.\\" Except for some specific bequests, his June 12, 1782 will left his entire estate to his daughter Susannah. Susannah Croghan Prevost died in 1790, survived by six of her twelve children.Wainwright, 307-307 For decades, they pursued their claims to Croghan's often clouded deeds in numerous lawsuits. \\"For some years, the hopeless involvements of his estate kept courtrooms abuzz, and, when that ceased and his contemporaries died off, the man's name and fame faded away into the obscurity from which he had emerged.\\"Wainwright, 310 Since the late 20th century, historians have re-evaluated Croghan's role and begun to assert his importance in the Ohio Country. He was a flamboyant character like William Johnson, brash and grasping, but also with a talent for diplomacy and relations with the Native Americans. History continues to be made by Croghan descendants. To this day the female line of Croghan's Mohawk daughter Catherine are inheritors of her position and power in the Turtle Clan. \\"Catharine Adonwentishon was head of the Turtle clan, the first in rank in the Mohawk Nation. Her birthright was to name the Tekarihoga, the principal sachem of the Mohawk nation.\\"[80] Speculation in western New York lands and clouded titles resulted in many unscrupulous transactions. In 1786 William Cooper and his partner Andrew Craig \\"by questionable methods . . . purchased the Otsego lands [40,000 of Croghan's acres] for only ¬£2,700.\\"Volwiler, 329-330 Cooper laid out the town of Cooperstown, New York and built his mansion, Otsego Hall, on the former site of Croghan's residence. William Franklin and the Prevost heirs watched bitterly as the property increased in value twentyfold. \\"Andrew Prevost, Jr., wrote Franklin on December 12, 1812: 'We have lost an immense property from the infamous advantage taken by Cooper and others without your knowledge by a forced Sale under your Title.'\\"Volwiler, 331 William Cooper's son, the author James Fenimore Cooper, presented his family's side of the dispute in his Chronicles of Cooperstown (1838). Pronunciation of name There has been disagreement as to how to pronounce Croghan's name. The governor of Canada, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, in a letter to the Minister of France on August 8, 1756, referred to ‚ÄúGeorge Craon‚Äôs fort‚Äù,Stevens and Kent, 94 which appears to be a phonetic spelling. Although biographer Robert. G. Crist concludes that, given the Gaelic origins of the surname, the pronunciation was ‚ÄúCrone,\\" his evidence is less than conclusive: a financial account that one of Croghan's clerks labeled as \\"Crohan and Trent;\\" and \\"a Frenchman who recorded his name as \\"Croan,\\" apparently the way it sounded. Descendants have used the hard \\"g\\" pronunciation favored by Croghan scholar Margaret Pearson Bothwell, but Crist dismisses them and \\"the practice in Ireland today,\\" where the name is pronounced \\"CROG-han.\\" \\"CRO-ghan\\" seems to be the standard English pronunciation. Crist cites Nicholas B. Wainwright's \\"Crowan\\" as an intermediate step between \\"something like 'Crohan,' and in further simplification, 'Crone.'\\"Crist, 3 A study of Crogan's dialect by Michael Montgomery, a linguist specializing in Irish, written more than thirty years after Crist, does not find the name pronunciation dispute worth mentioning.

In its later years, the company began to expand into furniture, electronics, entertainment, convenience groceries and fragrance and beauty products. The company was founded in 1928 by a group of U.S. entrepreneurs, and had a total of 163 stores mainly located in high streets or shopping centres by the time of its closure in 2016, as well as 74 international stores across 18 separate territories. BHS was previously a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but was bought by Sir Philip Green in 2000 and taken private. The company became part of Green's Arcadia Group in 2009. Following a number of loss-making years, the company was sold to the consortium Retail Acquisitions Ltd led by the serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell, in March 2015 for the nominal price of ¬£1. In April 2016, 13 months after the purchase by Retail Acquisitions, the company entered administration following unsuccessful attempts to continue trading. It was eventually wound down, and all stores were closed by late August 2016 following failed attempts to find a buyer. The overseas franchises and digital business were sold during the administration period to Al Mana Group, who closed down the website in June 2018. History Origins British Home Stores was founded in 1928 by a group of U.S. entrepreneurs who wanted to follow the successful model set by Woolworths. They did not want go into direct competition with Woolworths, so set their highest price at a shilling. The first store opened in Brixton, and by 1929 the price limit had been lifted to five shillings to allow the business to offer more goods. The business expanded by opening further branches, all offering small cafeterias and grocery departments, and in 1933 the business went public. After the war, the business continued to grow, and by the end of the 1960s had 94 stores nationwide. Expansion A BHS branch in pre-1995 branding seen in Darlington in 2009. The company expanded in the 1970s and 1980s, including the opening of stores in the newly-developing wave of indoor shopping centres (such as Broadway Shopping Centre and Lakeside Shopping Centre). A joint venture was launched with supermarket retailer Sainsbury's to create hypermarkets using the SavaCentre brand. Sainsbury's took full control of SavaCentre in 1989, and later converted the stores to the Sainsbury's branding. A downturn in business in the early 1980s was fought with a revamp of the stores and the selling of goods with higher profit margins. The company closed its only overseas store, in Dublin, Ireland, during this time (although there was a rapidly aborted re-entry in 1996 via a franchise store in Dublin's Jervis Centre). In 1985, the first overseas franchise store opened in Gibraltar. Such stores, not directly owned by the BHS company itself, have operated over Europe and the Middle East. In 1986, BHS merged with Habitat and Mothercare to form Storehouse plc. Soon afterwards, the British Home Stores registered company name and branding across its shops was replaced with \\"BhS\\" (later \\"Bhs\\", and since reverted to the all-caps \\"BHS\\", which the company used in addition to the full British Home Stores name prior to the full rebrand) and a new corporate logo. The exception was in stores that displayed a \\"historic\\" fascia, such as that in Edinburgh's Princes Street, which continued to feature the British Home Stores name in its original Roman type etched into the granite shop front. British Home Stores, like many other major retailers, followed a trend of opening stores at out-of-town locations since the 1980s. One of these was the two- level store at Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the West Midlands (which formed part of an Enterprise Zone). This store opened on 14 November 1989, ultimately replacing the store in nearby Dudley, which closed in June 1990 after a directly related sharp fall in turnover. The nearby West Bromwich store closed around the same time, its fortunes also affected by the Merry Hill development and smaller developments around nearby Oldbury, which had begun with the SavaCentre hypermarket in 1980. Takeover by Philip Green Logo used from 1995 to 2010 A branch in 1995-2010 branding seen in Wakefield in 2013. In the mid-1990s, the brand saw a further reinvention under guidance from retail design house '20:20'. The new look was showcased with the launch of the \\"millennium concept\\" shopfit, initially at the Grafton Centre, Cambridge during 1995. With its softer Bhs \\"signature\\" logo and warm interior lighting, the concept attempted with varying degrees of success to meet the needs of the modern, more sophisticated (female) shopper. During the late 1990s, the stores which formed Storehouse Plc fell on hard times; BHS and Mothercare were the worst affected. Following a number of years of tough trading, Philip Green bought BHS from Storehouse Plc in May 2000 for ¬£200 million. He then changed the company from public (Plc) to private (Ltd). In 2002, Green went on to acquire the Arcadia Group of high street retailers, which included Topshop, Burton, Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis among others, to form Britain's second largest clothes retailer, after Marks and Spencer. Alan Smith, chairman of Storehouse at the time of the Bhs sale, commented, \\"He [Philip Green] had a crystal-clear vision and strategy. He had the guts to do the deal, to make it work when nobody else thought he could.\\" Return to British Home Stores In May 2005, Green, owner of BHS, purchased Etam UK from its French owner, Etam D√©veloppement. The Etam UK brands included Etam, Amelie May, and Tammy. The girls' fashion retailer Tammy was the strongest brand in terms of sales and consumer recognition. For this reason, and to help improve girls' perception of BHS as a whole, from September 2005 stand-alone stores were closed and the brand integrated into BHS stores. A now closed branch in 'British Home Stores' branding in Kirkstall, Leeds In 2005, BHS resurrected its British Home Stores fascia, more than 20 years after it had disappeared from the UK high street. The move followed the purchase of several former Allders at Home sites from the department store chain. These projects were designed to build upon the success of the homewares and lighting that BHS stores currently offered and to tap into new areas of business such as furniture, curtains, rugs, and wall art. Brands sold included Denby, Maxwell Williams, Typhoon, Brabantia, Terence Conran and Jasper Conran. In 2005, Green's wife, a Monaco resident, received a ¬£1.2 billion dividend from Arcadia. On 27 February 2009, it was announced that the company would be integrated into the Arcadia Group. Central support functions were merged and selected BHS stores housed selected Arcadia brands; for example, in July 2009, BHS stores in Solihull in the West Midlands and Bexleyheath in South London both opened Evans and Wallis concessions. In August 2009, the Canterbury branch opened Wallis and Evans concessions within the store. Other stores with Arcadia insertions included Tunbridge Wells, Oxford, Peterborough, Watford, Kilmarnock, Nottingham, Camberley, Norwich and Aberdeen. Leadership changes Logo used from 2010 to 2015 (2010-2013 variant had no stripe) Mike Goring was appointed managing director to the chain in May 2009, and in July, Jacquie Gray was appointed Creative Director. In 2010, BHS changed its logo, resurrecting the uppercase form of the abbreviation that had not been used since the Storehouse rebrand and the later rebrand in the 1990s. A new e-commerce website was launched, and a new store design was gradually introduced across the estate. Goring left BHS in 2012 to take up the position of Retail Director for Debenhams. After he left, former Marks and Spencer Menswear Trading Director, Richard Price was appointed managing director. Gray left in 2014. In January 2015, Green confirmed that he was considering selling the company following sustained losses, and that he had received a number of approaches. Sale and restructuring On 12 March 2015, it was announced that BHS had been sold to Retail Acquisitions for a nominal price of ¬£1. It was also confirmed that Richard Price had left his post as managing director for a position with the clothing arm of Tesco; former BHS Chief Operating Officer Darren Topp was confirmed as the interim Chief Executive. Shortly after the takeover, 51 of the company's 171 stores were reported as being under threat of closure. Lincoln in 2015. In September 2015, BHS owners Retail Acquisitions announced another rebrand, as part of a ¬£60m rejuvenation plan, which resulted in the full British Home Stores name being resurrected on the high street for the first time since 1986. A programme of modernising stores with the new branding was announced, while plans to roll out food halls were to continue. By early 2016, periodic store closures had seen the company withdraw entirely from several city centres including Bath, Cardiff, Carlisle, Oxford, Reading and Southampton. Plans were also being made to reduce the size of the flagship Oxford Street branch by leasing excess space to other retailers. In March 2016, the company sought a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to allow it to restructure the business. As part of its application, it revealed a deficit in its pension scheme of ¬£207 million, and sought to transfer its schemes to the Pension Protection Fund. A consortium led by the banker Nicholas de Scossa was involved in negotiations to buy the company. Administration and closure BHS on Foregate Street, Chester in July 2016, during their closing down sale On 24 April 2016, Dominic Chappell (owner of Retail Acquisitions) announced that administrators would be appointed the next day. It was announced that the chain had entered administration on 25 April 2016, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Duff & Phelps were appointed administrators and sought to sell the business as a going concern. It at this point had debts of ¬£1.3 billion including ¬£571 million in pension liabilities, meaning either individual assets (such as stores) would have to be sold or the chain would be in new ownership. UK sports chain Sports Direct was reported to be in talks to buy a number of BHS stores, but no buyer was found for the company, resulting in the closure of BHS stores. Head office staff were made redundant on the announcement that no buyer had been found, with stores expected to last up to 8 weeks selling the remaining stock. On 23 July 2016, the administrators Duff and Phelps shut 20 stores, and the next week another 30. Closure of the final outlets was on 28 August 2016. The insolvent part of the company finally went into liquidation on 2 December 2016, with the remainder of winding up proceedings commencing on that date. alt= The Qatari Al Mana Group purchased the company's international franchise stores and online operations in June 2016. The group formed a new business, BHS International (UK) Limited, based in London. It launched a website, bhs.com, under the new brand name \\"The British Home Store\\" in September 2016. Al Mana announced that the website would close by 27 June 2018, shifting focus to their international franchise business.  Successor  , the bhs.com website is operated by Litecraft Group Limited, using the BHS logo and \\"BritishHomeStore London 1928\\" brand name under licence. The website sells lighting and selected homewares only. Products  Clothing  In December 2014, New Zealand-based childrenswear brand Pumpkin Patch was introduced into larger stores and online. Furniture The company had an independent furniture website, bhsfurniture.co.uk. The stores and website sold a number of leading brands including Italsofa, G-Plan, Relyon and Silentnight. Larger homes stores, such as the Barton Square branch in the Trafford Centre, Greater Manchester, also sold the Welle cabinet range and had Sharps showrooms. Electrical goods In its stores, BHS sold a mixture of basic electricals based primarily on kitchen products such as kettles and toasters. Latterly the range had begun to increase, particularly in the designated Home stores and larger high street branches. Ranges introduced included Breville, Russell Hobbs, De'Longhi and Vax. In addition, BHS began to sell larger electrical items through a separate website, bhsdirect.co.uk. The service was run through a third party company, Buy it Direct, and was not directly controlled by BHS. This allowed the company to expand its product range to laptops, tablets, large kitchen appliances such as fridge-freezers, TVs and air-conditioners. Food store The Watford BHS branch sporting new branding, announcing the opening of its Food Store In January 2014, it was announced that the chain would sell branded food products; the service was to be trialled in 50 stores with the intention of making this a permanent addition in up to 150 stores. The first of three trial stores opened in Staines in March 2014, and was shortly followed by another in Warrington and a third in Romford. International franchises The BHS brand has been franchised since 1985 to stores around the world and, although they are not directly owned, products and support were supplied by BHS. The Tammy brand was available as a separate franchise. In early 2006 a new franchise, \\"Bhs Kids\\", was launched in the Middle East, carrying many best-selling children's lines from BHS stores. In 1995, BHS was the first high street retailer to open a branch in Moscow. The ¬£3 million venture was the largest in the international portfolio and was quickly followed by the opening of a second store in St Petersburg. Further stores opened in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 1998, and there were stores in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Dubai, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. By 2000 the chain also had stores in Greece, Tenerife, Gibraltar, Malta and the Far East. In 2011, a store in Armenia opened. In 2013, a franchised concession opened in the Falkland Islands and a store was opened in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

Croghan married Serena Livingston, a granddaughter of Robert Livingston (1718‚Äì1775) of Clermont Manor in New York. Education and career Croghan studied at the College of William and Mary and joined the army after he graduated in 1810. He fought at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. He also served at Fort Meigs (modern Perrysburg, Ohio) with distinction. For his defense with a small garrison against a British attack during the Battle of Fort Stephenson, Ohio, in 1813 during the War of 1812, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He later led a troop that was defeated in the Battle of Mackinac Island. Following the war, Croghan resigned from the army during a reduction in force and was appointed as a postmaster in New Orleans. In 1825, he became one of the two inspector generals in the army. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Croghan fought as a colonel at Monterrey. Croghan died in the cholera epidemic of 1849, which had high mortality rates. Former President of the United States James K. Polk also died in the epidemic. It is believed that later in life Croghan had a problem with alcoholism. But he was cordial and considered to be very much a gentleman. Legacy and honors Colonel Croghan is buried at the site of Fort Stephenson, in what is now Fremont, Ohio. The former fort site was preserved in a parklike setting, where the main public library was constructed. Croghan's tomb and a soldiers' memorial to the war installed by the DAR in 1903 are both located on the library grounds near Croghan Street, which was renamed in his honor. The village and town of Croghan, New York are also named after him.

Rescue ships were typically small freighters with passenger accommodation converted to rescue service. This involved enlarging galley and food storage areas and providing berthing and sanitary facilities for approximately 150 men. Preparation for service included the installation of scrambling nets along the sides, and the substitution of boats suitable for open sea work for normal lifeboats. Rescue ships normally included a small operating room for an embarked naval doctor and sick bay staff.Hague 2000 p.90 Service The first specially-equipped rescue ship went into service in January 1941. When rescue ships were unavailable, large, ocean-going tugboats or converted trawlers were sometimes designated to perform rescue duty.Hague 2000 p.92 By the end of the war 30 rescue ships had been built or converted. They participated in 797 convoys and rescued 4,194 survivors from 119 ships. Six rescue ships were lost, five to enemy action (three to U-boats and two to aircraft). Origins In 1940 Admiral Sir Max Kennedy Horton (later Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches Command) broached the concept of rescue ships with the Admiralty. The concept was to have merchant vessels that would accompany convoys but not carry cargo; they would instead have the role of saving the lives of seamen from ships sunk by enemy action. The rescue ship would take its position at the rear of one of the central columns of ships. From this position it could observe damaged ships falling astern of the convoy and quickly rendezvous to transfer survivors. The rescue ships would also be able to provide surgical or other treatment as required. This would free the cargo vessels of the convoy to continue on their way, and escorts to focus on countering the attacking U-boats or aircraft. The convoy rescue ship was a response to early experience. Each merchant ship in a convoy was assigned a station so that the convoy formation would consist of several columns of three to five ships. The lead ships of the columns were spaced at intervals of 1,000 yards (910 m) along a line perpendicular to the convoy course. Each ship in the column followed the ship ahead at a distance of .Seth 1962 p.78 The typical convoy would be approximately wide and long. The rescue plan for early convoys was to have the last ship of each column rescue survivors of other ships in that column.Hague 2000 p.89 If the last ship in column was hit, the rescue task fell to the escorting warships. In practice, the escorting warships performed rescue tasks more often than the 25% suggested by random hits on a four-ship column because some merchant ships refused to leave the protection of the convoy formation to fall back and remain a stationary target while rescuing survivors. Furthermore, merchant ships were not well suited to maneuver to pick up survivors, and those attempting rescue were hampered by lack of suitable rescue equipment. For the role the Admiralty sought out small, quick, manoeuvrable vessels; it drew many from among the Clyde Shipping Company's coastal passenger transports. The requisitioned passenger ships had a speed of 11 to 12 knots, which enabled them, after completing their rescue operations, to catch up with the convoys travelling at 10 knots. Although these vessels had not been built for the Atlantic or the Arctic, none was lost to Atlantic storms; one did ice-up and founder off the coast of Newfoundland. The rescue ships were not hospital ships and so were legitimate targets as far as German submarines or bombers were concerned. Consequently, the Admiralty armed them with AA guns for protection when they were separated from the convoy and vulnerable to enemy attack. In addition to equipment for rescuing and treating survivors, rescue ships carried High Frequency radio Direction Finding equipment (abbreviated to HF/DF and known as \\"Huff-Duff\\") to assist in the location of U-boats. The rescue ship's position at the rear of the convoy provided good triangulation in combination with the HF/DF installed on the escort leader typically patrolling in front of the convoy.

Explanation The courts powers derive in large part from the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, and in particular section 25(2) which sets out the statutory checklist of factors that should be taken into account. The court can order lump sum payments, property adjustment orders (e.g. requiring a property is transferred into the ownership of a husband or wife), periodical payments (known as 'maintenance') and (from 2000) pension sharing orders. Maintenance orders can be given on nominal or specific terms. Nominal orders operate on the basis that if the court makes no order for maintenance (known as \\"periodical payments\\") at the time of the final order, it cannot later come back and make an order. If, on the other hand, it makes an order, it can later vary it. This is why an order for periodical payments at the rate of 5 pence per year (the usual nominal order) is known as a nominal order - it gives the recipient the right to come back and make an application for a substantive monthly sum at a later date. Following a 1984 amendment, the court is obliged to consider whether the parties' financial relationship should be terminated ('clean break').la.c.c.part.102 Legal rulings The leading cases are now the House of Lords decisions of White v White 2001 1 A.C. 596 and Miller/ McFarlane.

It is also known as Dingle Park which means wooded valley. The park was donated to the people of Halifax by Sir Sandford Fleming. The centrepiece of the park is an impressive tower that commemorates Nova Scotia's achievement of representative government in 1758. Constructed between 1908 and 1912, the Memorial Tower was erected during the same period of building other commemorative towers in the British Commonwealth, notably Cabot Tower in Bristol, England (1898) and Cabot Tower in St. John's (1900).Brian Cuthbertson. \\"Symbolizing in Stone\\"an event of \\"Imperishable Importance:\\" Halifax's Memorial and Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Representative Government. Journal of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society, Vol. 12, 2009. p. 28 History Sir Sandford Fleming: Introduced Standard Time to North America During the 1880s Sir Sandford Fleming, famous for introducing standard time to North America, established a summer retreat on property fronting Halifax's Northwest Arm, after he finished constructing the Intercolonial Railway. He called his retreat The Dingle, the name that is still used today. The park contains two walking trails passing through forests, heath barrens, saltwater marsh, and a large pond (Frog Pond). As well, the park also hosts a small sandy beach. The water quality of the beach had been a long, contentious issue due to decades of raw sewage being dumped into the Northwest Arm. Following the completion of new sewage treatment facilities in 2008, many of these concerns were allayed. Swimmers should check the municipality's website, and note that users should not swim at the Dingle beach for three days after heavy rainfall.  Dingle Tower  Restored tower, Spring 2018In 1908, Fleming donated the property to the citizens of Halifax for use as a park and proposed the construction of a tower within it to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the establishment of representative government in Nova Scotia, the province having held on 2 October 1758 the first elected assembly in what is now Canada.Catherine Buckie, Parliamentary Democracy in Nova Scotia: How it Began, How it Evolved, Province of Nova Scotia, 2009 An ardent imperialist, Fleming also intended the proposed tower to serve as a memorial to the development of parliamentary institutions in the British Empire, now the Commonwealth.

The Memorial Tower is architecturally important because it combines Italianate influences with local construction methods and materials.Cutherbertson, p. 20 The ten-storey stone \\"Dingle Memorial Tower\\" plan was accepted by the City of Halifax and the local Canadian Club undertook a fundraising drive to pay for construction. Donations were received from throughout the British Empire and plaques commemorating the contributions, as well as stones from all of the countries of the Empire were placed on the interior walls. It was formally dedicated in an impressive ceremony in August 1912 by Canada's Governor General the Duke of Connaught who was also Queen Victoria's son Prince Arthur. The presence of members of the Royal Family and dignitaries from other parts of the Empire emphasized the importance of the occasion. In 1913, two large bronze lions at the foot of the tower were donated by the Royal Colonial Institute of London. Designed by British sculptor Albert Bruce-Joy, they are similar to Sir Edwin Landseer's lions at Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square.  Restoration  The Memorial Tower was restored between 2010 and 2013. It was partially reopened at the beginning of August 2012 when the 100th Anniversary was celebrated at the opening ceremony. The bulk of the restoration was done by Coastal Restoration and Masonry with the involvement of a number of other specialist firms. The restoration included repointing the entire tower interior and exterior, rebuilding the copper roof, installing new stainless steel grilles on the Observation Deck to keep birds out and people in, reinforcing and refinishing the internal stairs, installing new interior and exterior lighting, refurbishing the window openings and installing new windows, and refurbishing the 35 plaques on the interior walls and the two bronze lions guarding the entrance. The total cost was approximately $2.3 million. The Dingle Memorial Tower is open to the public in the summer months and has views of the city and Northwest Arm.

Thus he will build a group and naturally from that group he will get a great many individual preclears.\\" This was, however, not how the program was to be presented to the general public: \\"A great many miracles will follow in his wake and he is later to become a subject of the press himself. However, in handling the press we should simply say that it is a mission of the Church to assist those who are in need of assistance.\\" The Volunteer Ministers program is also intended to operate as a recruitment activity. As Hubbard puts it, :As the benefits of the Volunteer Minister program begin to spread throughout the society, a rank and file of people that have been helped will begin to accumulate. These people will begin to feed into missions and Churches of Scientology from wherever the Volunteer Minister has been at work. Organizational aspects Scientology volunteer minister tent in Sweden, October 2008 In recent years, the Church of Scientology has heavily promoted and greatly increased the profile and size of the Volunteer Ministers program. Church publications say that there are over 95,000 Volunteer Ministers - more than the Peace Corps, Americorps and United Nations volunteer programs combined.The Bridge, Magazine of the Church of Scientology of Sydney. Issue 385, April 2006 The Church has set a target of recruiting as many Volunteer Ministers as there are policemen in each of the principal countries in which Scientology is active. In 2001, the Church announced a number of target quotas for Volunteer Minister recruitment, as follows:\\"Cause\\" magazine, Magazine of the International Ecclesiastical League of Pastors (I HELP), December 2001 {- align=right Country Total inhabitants Quota for VMs |- align=right Australia 18,783,551 58,229 |- align=right Austria 8,139,299 5,231 |- align=right Canada 31,006,347 6,118 |- align=right Denmark 5,356,845 6,603 |- align=right France 58,978,172 82,831 |- align=right Germany 82,087,361 254,469 |- align=right Italy 56,735,130 175,878 |- align=right Sweden 8,911,296 27,624 |- align=right United States 272,639,608 845,184 |} However, an ARIS demographic study by the City University of New York (CUNY) estimated in 2000 that there may only be 55,000 Scientologists in the whole of the United States. Recent activities Scientology Volunteer Ministers in Haiti 2010Scientology Volunteer Ministers in Haiti 2010Scientology Volunteer Minister Ship Hornbeam arriving in HaitiVolunteer Ministers have frequently been sent to the scenes of major disasters, where they distribute Scientology pamphlets and purport to heal or relieve pain using Scientology techniques such as \\"Locationals,\\" \\"Nerve assists\\" and \\"Touch assists.\\" Volunteer Ministers have been sent to the site of relief efforts in Southeast Asia in the wake of the December 2004 tsunamiDeseret News, \\" .\\" 26 February 2005 and to London Underground stations that were attacked in the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Eight hundred were sent to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina.Associated Press, \\"Scientology missions spring up in hurricane-damaged areas.\\" 15 May 2006 In 2012, news broke that Volunteer Ministers were providing purification rundowns in Vietnam to people who had been exposed to Agent Orange; doctors and researchers criticized the Agent Orange treatments as \\"unscientific and unproven\\" and said that they \\"could be harmful\\". Volunteer Ministers have provided assists to relief personnel following September 11 attacks in New York. The Volunteer Ministers have also worked in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, in the Pakistan flood in 2010, in the Fukushima earthquake in 2011, and the May 2014 floods in Bosnia. Controversy As with many of the Church of Scientology's programs, the Volunteer Ministers have generated controversy and criticism. The organization provides \\"spiritual relief\\" parallel with medical treatment, but also does simple tasks such as helping cleanup or fetch food and generally assist the disaster effort as seems indicated. They have been accused of attempting to take advantage of disasters in order to promote Scientology to a grief- stricken populace. Church of Scientology insists that assists are given parallel to medical treatment, not in place of it; the Handbook for Scientology Assists stresses in its basic guidelines: \\"Always seek first aid and medical attention when needed. An assist is not a substitute for medical attention or treatment by a qualified doctor. First, call the doctor. Then assist the person as you can.\\"L. Ron Hubbard \\"Assists Processing Handbook\\" page 8 The Volunteer Minister program most heavily promoted by Scientology took place in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Critics of Scientology accused the organization of attempting to take advantage of the disaster in order to promote Scientology to the grief-stricken populace in the area. The National Mental Health Association issued a public warning in response to the conduct of Scientologists in the immediate aftermath of September 11, claiming that Scientologists were \\"Intentionally confusing [the] public\\" by presenting themselves as mental health service providers. According to NMHA President Michael M. Faenza, \\"The public needs to understand that the Scientologists are using this tragedy to recruit new members. They are not providing mental health assistance.\\" In Russia, after the Beslan school hostage crisis tragedy in 2004, the Health Ministry ordered Scientologists out of the area, saying \\"that various psychological tactics the groups use, including what it called hypnosis, may be harmful not only for adults, but for children that have already suffered severe mental shock.\\" In the United Kingdom, Volunteer Ministers played a similar role in the aftermath of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, targeting the families of victims and emergency workers. As in the United States in 2001, this resulted in controversy, and it was reported that Volunteer Ministers had been removed from the vicinity of survivors of the bus bombing in Tavistock Square. It later emerged that the Metropolitan Police had agreed to give the Church of Scientology privileged access to the Police Message Broadcasting System, enabling the Church to dispatch Volunteer Minister rapid-response teams in the event of future emergencies in the capital. Paul Fletcher, director of the London branch of CCHR and Stefania Cisco, a Director of Special Affairs for Scientology, admitted to an undercover BBC reporter that the purpose of the volunteer ministers was to keep the psychiatrists away, and called this \\"spiritual security\\". After the Virginia Tech massacre, April 16, 2007, 20 Volunteer Ministers were on the campus. Bulletins to Scientology members said that help had been requested by the university provost, the Salvation Army and the Red Cross, but these organizations denied that any requests had been made. The activities of the Volunteer Ministers at Virginia Tech was reported to have received strong criticism from local pastors.

It is known for its many diverse restaurants, coffee shops and Asian markets, especially along Nicollet Avenue (also known as \\"Eat Street\\"). The neighborhood is home to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, and the Children's Theatre Company. While the neighborhood is officially part of the greater Powderhorn community, it is separated from most of those areas by Interstate 35W, and also lies further north than the rest of the community area. Most of Powderhorn is east of Interstate 35W and south of Lake Street; the Whittier neighborhood is west of I-35W and north of Lake Street. Whittier is often associated with adjacent neighborhoods, such as Lowry Hill East in the Calhoun-Isles community to the west and Stevens Square neighborhood in the Central community to the north. History In the 1800s, Mdewakanton Dakota occupied the area from Saint Anthony Falls toward the Minnesota River following their migration from Mille Lacs Lake and the onward expansion of the quarreling Ojibwa. Temporary Dakota camps were photographed in Whittier which are in the MNHS catalog. The Charles S. Pillsbury mansion built in 1913 at 100 22nd Street East in the Washburn- Fair Oaks Mansion District. He was one of two sons of Charles Alfred Pillsbury, the founder of the Pillsbury Company and Pillsbury \\"A\\" Mill. In 1849 at the age of 21, John T. Blaisdell moved from Maine and squatted on land just south of downtown Minneapolis. His brothers eventually came and together they lived in a log house which became Blaisdell School. Following the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux which opened lands to the United States, Blaisdell developed the area south of Downtown Minneapolis into Blaisdell's Addition. For capital, he sold timber to the booming lumber industry and leased land for the Morrison Farm in the east, which the Morrisons eventually purchased.  Blaisdell to Whittier  After the Blaisdell brothers returned from the Civil War in 1865, Minneapolis began growing in population again. Annexations in 1867 and 1883 turned Blaisdell's Addition into South Minneapolis. Entrepreneurs and businessmen soon moved out of Downtown East and built their mansions in the present Washburn-Fair Oaks Mansion District. Much of the Morrison's farm was sold for this expansion. Fair Oaks Park, at the center of this district, was formerly the site of William D. Washburn's mansion. Meanwhile, the southern end of Whittier grew as an agricultural and industrial job center with working-class housing along the Hastings and Dakota tracks of the Milwaukee Road rail line along 29th Street which shipped grain from southern Minnesota. Blaisdell Road became Blaisdell Avenue, extending past the neighborhood to the southern boundaries. In 1882, Blaisdell built his manor at Nicollet and 24th Street West. The family moved out of Blaisdell School. A year later, Blaisdell, Longfellow and Irving Schools across the southern prairie were annexed to the Minneapolis school system from Hennepin County. In naming tradition with the other schools, the board renamed the school Whittier after the 19th century poet and abolitionist, John Greenleaf Whittier. Like other areas of the city, families would soon call their neighborhoods after the primary school. Called the \\"millionaire pioneer of the city\\" by the New York Times, John T. Blaisdell died in 1898. Midtown Greenway at Nicollet Avenue looking west Into the 20th century, Thomas Lowry and his partners assumed control of the insolvent McCrory's Motor Line. Whittier filled along Lowry's new Nicollet Ave. and 4th Ave. streetcar routes. The increasingly residential nature of southern Minneapolis brought contention with the Milwaukee Road as neighbors petitioned the City Council from 1905 to 1909 to alleviate the effects of the crossings which was blamed for several deaths. The Milwaukee Road offered a failed proposal to elevate the tracks and returned with a $1.3 million plan to depress the tracks and construct a dozen road bridges. After a legal battle with the businesses affected by loss of rail access, the project was upheld and completed in 1916. Post-War Decline The neighborhood maintained a dense population and high rental occupancy up towards the city's population peak in the 1950s. The latter 20th century followed with other inner core neighborhoods as the postwar boom of the 1960s depleted Whittier's population. The routing of Interstate 35W was modified following city concerns over expensive land acquisition of apartments and mansions including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. In November 1967, Interstate 35W was built around the neighborhood to spare the Mansion District which was later preserved in its current historic district. Whittier experienced decline as middle-class residents moved out. The demolition of Nicollet Ball Park in Lyndale neighborhood led to retail failure on the neighborhood's south end. Abandoned buildings and adult bookstores prompted the city to establish the Nicollet/Lake Economic Development District in 1972. Several years passed without activity as Target and Herberger's refused to build. K-Mart finally agreed to become a tenant on the grounds that the City close Nicollet Avenue at Lake Street, and the project was done in 1978. However a boon for the city, the closing accelerated the neighborhood's problems and Nicollet north of Lake Street was stifled of car traffic. Crime and prostitution became common. Neighbors who stayed had formed a neighborhood association in response to bitter protests over the K-Mart project. The Whittier Alliance was established in 1977 to monitor the weakened community and rehabilitate housing. WA operated as a Community Development Corporation, developing housing for many years in order to sustain its operations in community outreach. The City attempted to bring about a citizen participation model to assist neighborhoods until with the Legislature's assistance created the Neighborhood Revitalization Program in 1987 to formally address urban issues with funding. The city began designating official neighborhood boundaries at this time and Whittier was formalized. Millennial rebirth Several factors had sown seeds for Whittier's comeback from the post-war suburban flight. Nicollet Avenue had not suffered completely. An authentic German restaurant opened in 1965 at the corner of 26th and Nicollet, becoming the avenue's main restaurant anchor for decades. As Whittier gained a bohemian culture for its cheap housing, the Artist Quarter jazz club was opened in the 1970s on the adjoining corner establishing a music anchor in the region. During this time, Chinese and Vietnamese businesses began opening on Nicollet following the Vietnam War. The Hip Sing Tong branch headquarters at 2633 Nicollet may explain the presence. Mexican businesses too opened but later in the 1980s on as they became a growing proportion of the immigrant population. Recognizing the street's potential, the Whittier Alliance and Business Association created a new branding scheme called Eat Street. It was completed in 1997 with a street scape reconstruction along the entire corridor. The abandoned Milwaukee Road trench also gained renewed interest during this time for re-use as a rails to trails transportation corridor. The Midtown Community Works and Midtown Greenway Coalition formed and federal funds were acquired for redevelopment. The first phase of the new Midtown Greenway was built in 1999 and entirely finished in Minneapolis by 2005. In the 2000s, after nearly two decades of private sector disinvestment, three major condominium projects were completed along Nicollet Avenue. In 2011 a major development came to the corner of 26th and Nicollet including a major indoor climbing facility and several new restaurants. In 2012, Whittier Alliance and the City of Minneapolis began working to move Kmart and restore Nicollet Avenue including a possible streetcar system. Demographics As of the 2010 census, 13,689 people live in Whittier. Census race groups consist of Caucasians (51.3%), Hispanics (Latinos) (20%), African Americans (19.8%), Native Americans (1.8%), Asian Americans (3.9%), and other (0.2%) (who are largely Somali in origin). About 86% of households rent. Whittier is the most populous neighborhood in Minneapolis, and second only in density to its neighbor Stevens Square. As reported single ancestry in the 2000 Census, the top five ancestries were German (1,780 people), Subsaharan African (1,070 people), Norwegian (870 people), Irish (830 people), and Somali (490 people). Government Whittier was part of Ward 6 under Councilmember Robert Lilligren (elected 2005) until redistricting in 2013, which placed Whittier in Ward 10. The neighborhood is currently officially represented by the Whittier Alliance, a community organization founded in 1977, which is recognized by the City of Minneapolis and its Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP). These NRP funds allow the Whittier Alliance to work with individuals, families, and businesses to build the community in terms of safety, economic development, and livability. Another informal organization is the Whittier Neighbors, founded in 1996. The Fifth Police Precinct (Precinct Inspector Kris Arneson in 2007) serves the neighborhood under Sector One. Whittier is in Minnesota Senate District 61, represented by Jeff Hayden with portions in Minnesota House district 61A (Karen Clark) while the southern end is in Minnesota House 61B (Paul Thissen). Minneapolis Public Schools Area 23. Education The Minneapolis College of Art and Design is in Whittier. In the 1990s, the City of Lakes Waldorf School and Watershed High School moved into Whittier. Both schools renovated the American Hardware Mutual Insurance Company building (constructed 1922) at the corner of 24th Street and Nicollet Avenue. Behind this building, at the corner of 24th Street and Blaisdell Avenue, the \\"play yard\\" occupies the former site of a Dayton's family mansion. Whittier School had moved to Blaisdell Avenue and closed in the 1960s. The Whittier Alliance led an effort with its NRP capital to build the new Whittier International School, constructed on the east half of Whittier Park in 2001.

It was contributed to by people of various nationalities from every single one of fifteen union republics, although a majority of the influenced was made by Russians. The Soviet state supported cultural institutions, but also carried out strict censorship. History Lenin years The main feature of communist attitudes towards the arts and artists in the years 1918‚Äì1929 was relative freedom, with significant experimentation in several different styles in an effort to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. In many respects, the NEP period was a time of relative freedom and experimentation for the social and cultural life of the Soviet Union. The government tolerated a variety of trends in these fields, provided they were not overtly hostile to the regime. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time, but other authors, many of whose works were later repressed, published work lacking socialist political content. Film, as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, received encouragement from the state; much of cinematographer Sergei Eisenstein's best work dates from this period. Education, under Commissar Anatoliy Lunacharskiy, entered a phase of experimentation based on progressive theories of learning. At the same time, the state expanded the primary and secondary school system, and introduced night schools for working adults. The quality of higher education was affected by admissions policie that preferred entrants from the proletarian class over those from bourgeois backgrounds, regardless of the applicants' qualifications. Under NEP, the state eased its active persecution of religion begun during war communism but continued to agitate on behalf of atheism. The party supported the Living Church reform movement within the Russian Orthodox Church in hopes that it would undermine faith in the church, but the movement died out in the late-1920s. In family life, attitudes generally became more permissive. The state legalised abortion, and it made divorce progressively easier to obtain, whilst public cafeterias proliferated at the expense of private family kitchens. Stalin era Arts during the rule of Joseph Stalin were characterised by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of Socialist realism, with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions. For many notable Mikhail Bulgakov's works were not repressed, although the full text of his The Master and Margarita was published only in 1966. Many writers were imprisoned and killed, or died of starvation, examples being Daniil Kharms, Osip Mandelstam, Isaac Babel and Boris Pilnyak. Andrei Platonov worked as a caretaker and was not allowed to publish. The work of Anna Akhmatova was also condemned by the regime, although she notably refused the opportunity to escape to the West. During the time when the Party was trying to make Soviet regime more palatable to Ukrainians, a great deal of national self-determination and cultural development was tolerated. After this short period of the renaissance of Ukrainian literature ended more than 250 Ukrainian writers died during the Great Purge, for example Valerian Pidmohylnyi (1901‚Äì1937), in the so-called Executed Renaissance. Texts of imprisoned authors were confiscated by the NKVD and some of them were published later. Books were removed from libraries and destroyed. In addition to literature, musical expression was also repressed during the Stalin era, and at times the music of many Soviet composers was banned altogether. Dmitri Shostakovich experienced a particularly long and complex relationship with Stalin, during which his music was denounced and prohibited twice, in 1936 and 1948 (see Zhdanov decree). Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian had similar cases. Although Igor Stravinsky did not live in the Soviet Union, his music was officially considered formalist and anti-Soviet.

In the late Soviet Union, Soviet popular culture was characterised by fascination with American popular culture as exemplified by the blue jeans craze. In arts, the liberalisation of all aspects of life starting from the Khrushchev Thaw created a possibility for the evolution of various forms of non-formal, underground and dissident art; still repressed, but no longer under the immediate threat of Gulag labor camps. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who wrote the critical One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and subsequently exiled from the Soviet Union. Greater experimentation in art forms became permissible in the 1970s, with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced. The regime loosened the strictures of socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Iurii Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. In music, although the state continued to frown on such Western phenomena as jazz and rock, it began to permit Western musical ensembles specialising in these genres to make limited appearances. But the native balladeer Vladimir Vysotsky, widely popular in the Soviet Union, was denied official recognition because of his iconoclastic lyrics.

It repeated the formula of the original, featuring famous middle-aged women talking about their pet hates. The grumpy old men and women together made a series, Grumpy Old Holidays, in which they talk about the frustrations of air travel, packing and so on. This was first shown on 18 June 2006. A companion book to the series written by the original series producer Stuart Prebble, Grumpy Old Men (The Official Handbook), was published in 2004, followed by Grumpy Old Men: The Secret Diary in 2005 and Grumpy Old Christmas in 2006, also by Prebble. The first series and its accompanying Christmas special was released on DVD and an audiobook based on the first two series was also made available, read by Arthur Smith. Following the success of Grumpy Old Men/Women, the producers, Liberty Bell TV, have made a number of other series based on the same format, including Grumpy Old Holidays, It's Grim Up North, My Appalling School Report, He Says, She Says and The Meaning Of Life. All of these were broadcast on BBC2, except the last-named which was on BBC1. The Grumpy Guide to Christmas was shown on BBC2 on 23 December 2009.

He was also a notable Christian pacifist, anti-war campaigner, and Welsh nationalist. He is often referred to by his first name only. Life Waldo Goronwy Williams was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, the third child of John Edwal Williams (1863‚Äì1934), headmaster of Prendergast primary school in Haverfordwest, and his wife Angharad Williams (1875‚Äì1932). His father spoke both Welsh and English, but his mother only spoke English, as did Waldo himself in his early years. In 1911 Waldo's father was appointed head of the primary school at Mynachlog-ddu, Pembrokeshire. There Waldo learnt to speak Welsh. In 1915 his father moved again, to be head of Brynconin School, the primary school at Llandissilio, Pembrokeshire. Waldo was raised as a Baptist and baptised as a member of Blaenconin Baptist Chapel in 1921 at the age of 16. After attending the grammar school at Narberth, Pembrokeshire, Williams studied at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he graduated in English in 1926. He then trained as a teacher and worked in various schools in Pembrokeshire and the rest of Wales and England, including Kimbolton School, Huntingdonshire. He also taught night classes for the Department of Extra- Mural Studies at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. In the 1920s and 1930s, Williams was a friend and supporter of Willie Jenkins (Hoplas), one of the pioneers of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and the Labour Party in Pembrokeshire. Jenkins was a pacifist, who had been imprisoned as a conscientious objector in the First World War. He stood as Labour candidate for Pembrokeshire in four elections between 1922 and 1935. Williams's famous poem \\"Cofio\\" (Remembering) was written in 1931 during a visit to Willie Jenkins's farm at Hoplas, Rhoscrowther, near Pembroke.Williams's friendship with Jenkins and the inspiration for \\"Cofio\\": Robert Rhys' entry on Waldo in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography and the Waldo Williams Society website, and . Williams married Linda Llewellyn in 1941. Her death in 1943 caused him anguish and distress. He never remarried. Later he would describe his two-year marriage as \\"fy mlynyddoedd mawr\\" ‚Äì \\"my great years\\".See \\"The Waldo Tour\\" (2013), Eirwen George and Damian Walford Davies, published by Waldo Williams Society (especially entry 18, Botwnnog). A pacifist, he was a conscientious objector in the Second World War, which led to his dismissal from a headmastership. During the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) he refused to pay his income tax on pacifist grounds as a protest against the war and forced military conscription ‚Äì a protest he continued until compulsory military service ended in 1963 and all the conscripted had been released. His goods were sequestrated by bailiffs and he was twice imprisoned in the early 1960s for refusing to pay his income tax. Meanwhile in the 1950s he joined the Quakers at Milford Haven. Williams's volume of poetry Dail Pren (Leaves of the Tree) was published in 1956 by Gwasg Gomer. It has been described as the most outstanding work of Welsh language poetry published since 1945.Davies, John A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, (Revised edition 2007, ) By the 1950s, partly influenced by his friend D. J. Williams, he had become a supporter of Plaid Cymru and stood for it as a parliamentary candidate in the Pembrokeshire constituency at the 1959 General Election, winning 4.32 per cent (2,253) of the votes.. Pembrokeshire had returned a Labour M. P., Desmond Donnelly, to the Commons since 1950. Donnelly's views differed from those of Willie Jenkins and Waldo Williams ‚Äì Donnelly was a supporter of German rearmament in 1954 and a strong opponent of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament from 1958. In the late 1960s, Williams taught Welsh to children of 10‚Äì11 at the Holy Name Catholic School, Fishguard, Pembrokeshire. He is said to have been a mesmerising teacher, passionate and enthusiastic, who used wooden silhouettes of farm animals with their names painted in Welsh on one side. Death and legacy Williams died in 1971 at St Thomas's Hospital, Haverfordwest, and was buried at Blaenconin Chapel burial ground in Llandissilio. There is a memorial at Rhos-fach, near to his childhood home in Mynachlog-ddu. In 2019, Waldo Williams Primary School in Haverfordwest was named in his honour. Poetry Waldo Williams memorial, Rhos-fach, Mynachlog-ddu Waldo Williams's poetry shows many influences, ranging from William Wordsworth and Walt Whitman to Welsh hymns and the strict alliterative metres of traditional Welsh poetry, known as cynghanedd. Waldo Williams belonged, first of all, to the Welsh tradition of the or folk poets who served a locality by celebrating its life and people in verse. But he was also inspired by a mystic revelation he had experienced in his youth about the unity of humankind. This was realised in the cooperative, harmonious living he witnessed in the farming communities in the Preseli Hills and reflected in feelings of belonging, knowing and desiring that people live together in peace ‚Äì constant themes in his poetry. This moment of revelation inspired some of his greatest poetry, including \\"Mewn dau gae\\" (In two fields, 1956), perhaps his greatest of all. Other well-known poems of his include \\"Cofio\\" (Remembering, 1931), \\"Y tangnefeddwyr\\" (The peacemakers, 1941), \\"Preseli\\" (1946), and \\"Pa beth yw dyn?\\" (What is it to be human? 1952).

It lies between Carlisle to the west and Darlington to the east. It is bounded to the north by the Tyne Valley and to the south by the Stainmore Gap. Overview The North Pennines was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1988 for its moorland scenery, the product of centuries of farming and lead-mining, and is also a UNESCO Global Geopark. At almost , it is the second largest of the 49 AONBs in the United Kingdom. The landscape of the North Pennines AONB is one of open heather moors between deep dales, upland rivers, hay meadows and stone-built villages, some of which contain the legacies of a mining and industrial past. The area has previously been mined and quarried for minerals such as barytes, coal fluorspar, iron, lead, witherite and zinc. Geology The North Pennines are formed from a succession largely of sedimentary rocks laid down during the Palaeozoic era, later intruded by the Whin Sill and affected by glaciation during the Quaternary period. Mud and volcanic ash deposited during the Ordovician and Silurian periods were buried and subsequently faulted and folded during the Caledonian orogeny, the mudstone becoming slaty. These rocks which are between 500 and 420 million years old are now exposed along the great scarp which defines the western edge of the area and also in an inlier in upper Teesdale. Unseen at the surface but proved in boreholes is the Weardale Granite, a batholith emplaced as molten rock into the slates and other rocks around 400 million years ago. Its presence beneath the region results in it being an upland area since granite is relatively less dense and therefore ‚Äòbuoys up‚Äô the North Pennines. This uplifted area is known as the Alston Block and is partly defined by major faults; the Stublick and Ninety-Fathom faults to the north and the Pennine Fault to the west. To the south is the Stainmore Trough. Overlying the early Palaeozoic rocks and granite are a succession of limestones, shales and mudstones dating from the Carboniferous period. At this time the part of the Earth‚Äôs crust which would later become England lay in the equatorial zone and was covered from time to time by shallow tropical seas. Repeated cycles of inundation led to the development of a series of cyclothems; the laying down of layers of limestone, shale and sandstone with occasional coal seams. Shortly afterwards, (c. 295 million years ago) molten rock once again intruded the sedimentary succession, this time resulting in the emplacement of the doleritic Whin Sill within the Carboniferous sequence. Known as whinstone locally, it baked the rocks with which it came into contact, resulting in the Sugar Limestone found in upper Teesdale. Cooling of the sill itself resulted in the formation of columnar joints, characteristic of its outcrop at places like High Cup. The sill has been dated at between 301 and 294 million years old this straddling the Carboniferous/Permian boundary. Around the start of the Permian period, about 290 million years ago, mineral-rich waters, associated with the still warm granite, circulated within the Carboniferous succession and gave rise to mineral-rich veins which have formed the basis of a lead mining industry since at least Roman times. During the rest of this period and into the Triassic at the start of the Mesozoic era, desert sands characterised the area; these are now seen as the New Red Sandstone of the Vale of Eden, the eastern parts of which form the lower slopes of the Pennine scarp and are within the AONB. There is no bedrock of younger age to be found within the North Pennines; for much of the time since the deposition of the Triassic sandstones, it is likely the area was above sea level and subject to erosion. A series of major global climate cycles during the current Quaternary period resulted in a series of ice ages, evidence for the last ice age is found within the North Pennines both in term of erosional and depositional features. Glacial till is widespread and drumlin are encountered, both indicative of the presence of moving ice within the landscape. It may be that some higher ground was not over-ridden by ice but remained exposed through subject to harsh climatic conditions. Glacial meltwater carved channels and rivers have continued to shape the landscape in the post-glacial era. Economy Besides farming, mining and quarrying have been a mainstay of the local economy over centuries. In 2013, a Canadian mining company were allowed to test drill for zinc around Allenheads and Nenthead. They said the region was sitting on a \\"world-class\\" deposit of zinc and predicted that a new mine in the area could produce of zinc ore per year. Natural history In the North Pennines are: 40% of the UK's upland hay meadows; 30% of England's upland heathland and 27% of its blanket bog; 80% of England's black grouse (and also breeding short-eared owl, ring ouzel, common snipe and common redshank); 36% of the AONB designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest; red squirrels, otters and rare arctic alpine plants; 22,000 pairs of breeding waders and one of England's biggest waterfalls ‚Äì High Force. The area shares a boundary with the Yorkshire Dales National Park in the south and extends as far as the Tyne Valley, just south of Hadrian's Wall in the north. The AONB is notable for rare flora and fauna, including wild alpine plants not found elsewhere in Britain. It is also home to red squirrels and diverse birds of prey. The impressive landscape of the North Pennines ‚Äì from High Force on the River Tees to the sweeping valley of High Cup Gill above Dufton ‚Äì are the product of millions of years of geological processes. The worldwide significance of the geology found in the area was recognised in 2003 when the AONB became Britain's first European Geopark. A year later the area become one of the founding members of the UNESCO-assisted Global Geopark family and in 2015 it was accorded official status as a UNESCO Global Geopark. Geoparks are areas with outstanding geological heritage where this is being used to support sustainable development. Another of the North Pennines' oddities is that it is home to England's only named wind, the Helm Wind. It has caught out many walkers traversing the plateaux around Cross Fell, the Eden Valley fellside, and the valleys between Alston and Dufton. Recreation One of the many walking routes in the North Pennines is Isaac's Tea Trail, a circular route of around the area, running from Ninebanks via Allendale, Nenthead and Alston. In addition to this, a large section of the Pennine Way falls in the AONB, including one of the most celebrated stretches through Teesdale, a lush valley with dramatic river scenery including the twin attractions of High Force and Cauldron Snout. Culture The great English poet W. H. Auden spent much time in this area and some forty poems and two plays are set here. Auden visited the area in 1919 and \\"five years later was writing poems about Alston Moor and Allendale.\\" He referred to the region as his \\"Mutterland\\", his \\"great good place\\", and equated it with his idea of Eden. Scores of Pennine place-names are found in his work, including Cauldron Snout and Rookhope.

He was the brother of Norwegian publisher Harald Grieg (1894‚Äì1972) and was distantly related to composer Edvard Grieg. In 1940, he married actress Gerd Egede-Nissen (1895‚Äì1988). He studied at the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo) and spent time travelling abroad, sometimes as a tourist and sometimes as a sailor. Receiving the 1924 Norway Scholarship, Grieg spent a year at Wadham College at Oxford, England, studying history and literature. At least one of Grieg's poems, \\"Kapellet i Wadham College\\" was inspired by his stay there, where he was a contemporary of Cecil Day-Lewis.  Career   Poet, playwright and journalist  Grieg debuted in 1922 with his first book of poetry Omkring Kap det gode Haab, based on his seagoing experiences ‚Äì as was Skibet gaar videre (1924). The latter book aroused controversy for its exposure of sailors' harsh living and working conditions. Grieg spent 1927 as a newspaper correspondent in China, where he witnessed firsthand the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communists. The same year Grieg's plays En ung manns Kjaerlighet and Barabbas were produced. The latter was a modern revolutionary interpretation of New Testament character Barabbas.Nordahl Grieg (NRK) The 1929 poetry collection Norge i v√•re hjerter expressed deep love for his country and his people in their poverty and misery and attracted critical acclaim. His 1935 play V√•r √¶re og v√•r makt depicted the lives of Norwegian sailors during World War I in which Norway remained neutral and traded with both sides. The work was an attack on the shipping industry's exploitation of seafarers. From 1936 to 1937, Grieg published the magazine Veien Frem, which initially succeeded in attracting prominent writers, but as the magazine adopted an increasingly Stalinist position relating to the Moscow Trials, most of them severed ties with it and it ceased publication. Grieg as a war correspondent in Spain in 1937, with Gerda Grepp and Ludwig Renn His 1937 dramatic play Nederlaget was about the Paris Commune. The Spanish Civil War was the subject of Spansk sommer (1937) and partly also of Ung m√• verden ennu v√¶re, whose plot shifts between Spain and the Soviet Union. The war also inspired the 1936 poem Til ungdommen, one of his most well-known works, which was set to music in 1952 by Danish composer Otto Mortensen and was performed on numerous occasions (see Til ungdommen).Nordahl Grieg (NRK Forfatter)  Communism  Compassion for the poor and exploited led Grieg to join the Norwegian Communist Party. From 1933 to 1935, he lived in the Soviet Union, where he was officially invited to study the techniques of Soviet stage and film. On returning to Norway, he became an ardent supporter of Joseph Stalin's policies, and became the chairman of the Friends of the Soviet Union (1935‚Äì1940). In 1937, he famously wrote a defence of the Moscow Trials, attacking Norwegian authors who had criticized them. His novel Ung m√• verden ennu v√¶re was also a defence of Stalin and the Moscow Trials. In many articles, he criticized the supporters of Leon Trotsky, who lived in Norway from 1937 to 1939.Hoem, op. cit., p. 220His biography Til ungdommen: Nordahl Griegs liv (For the youth : the life of Nordahl Grieg). Gyldendal, 1989.  World War II  Grieg with wife, actress Gerd Grieg. The outbreak of World War II, and especially the German invasion and occupation of Norway, led Grieg to oppose Stalin's policies. In 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany and, until the 1941 Nazi invasion, instructed Communists worldwide to regard the ongoing war as an \\"Imperialist\\" war in which they should not take part. Grieg was a staunch anti-Nazi and Norwegian patriot and committed himself in 1940 to the struggle against the Nazi occupation. In the winter of 1939‚Äì40, Grieg served in the Norwegian Army in Finnmark on neutrality guard during the Russo-Finnish Winter War. In 1940, after serving during the Norwegian Campaign against German forces, he escaped to the United Kingdom aboard the same vessel that carried the Norwegian Royal family and the National Gold reserves.Nordahl Grieg (Dagbladet Forfatter)  War correspondent  Once in Britain, Grieg served the Norwegian government in exile, and participated in making patriotic radio programs. He was commissioned in the Norwegian Armed Forces and served as a war correspondent. His work involved visiting and reporting on Norwegian units around Britain. He met Norwegian servicemen on duty in Iceland and other remote outposts. In the summer of 1942 Grieg spent several weeks on the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen in the North Atlantic during which time he wrote the poem √òya i Ishavet. As with other war correspondents, he joined operational missions over occupied Europe. In the course of one of these he lost his life, carrying the rank of captain.  Final mission  Crash site of LM316 in Kleinmachnow south of Berlin. On the night of 2‚Äì3 December 1943, Grieg was one of several observers for an Allied air raid on Berlin. He was attached to 460 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which was based at RAF Binbrook. Grieg joined the crew of a Lancaster Mk.III (serial number LM316, squadron code \\"AR-H2\\") captained by Flying Officer A. R. Mitchell, RAAF. Berlin was well-defended. It lay in the east of the country, requiring crews to test the limits of their fuel supply and of their own endurance. The long journey took them over the ranges of many night fighters. 460 Squadron lost five aircraft that night, including LM316. 37 airmen had been on board these aircraft, but only eight survived, none of them from LM316. The survivors spent the rest of the war in a POW camp. In addition to Grieg, the seven crew members (four Australians and three Britons) were killed in the crash.Nordahl Griegs grav funnet (NRK) Grieg was neither the only correspondent shot down that night, nor the only Norwegian.They were Gunnar H√∏verstad, captain of a Handley Page Halifax from No. 35 Squadron RAF that was part of the elite Pathfinder Force (and was awarded a War Cross with sword posthumously for this mission), and another crew member, Arne Storm (taken POW), of the same aircraft. (See: Chris Titley, \\"The day Arthur's war was over\\", newsquest.co.uk, 1 December 2003. Grieg's burial place went unrecorded after the crash. In the early 2000s, the grave was believed to be located under a highway between Potsdam and Berlin. A new theory emerged in 2013, when journalist Asbj√∏rn Svarstad stated that he believed that Grieg had been first buried in Berlin in 1944, and then exhumed and reburied at the Berlin Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery at Heerstra√üe in 1949. In response to the new information, the leader of the Norwegian Socialist Left Party, Audun Lysbakken, declared that Grieg should be exhumed and reburied in Bergen, Norway. Nordahl Grieg Memorial in Kleinmachnow, Brandenburg, Germany, erected next to the site where his plane crashed during a bombing mission south of Berlin Statue of Nordahl Grieg erected beside Den Nationale Scene Theatre in Bergen  Legacy  Grieg became a hero in Norway because of his resistance to the Nazi Occupation. Grieg is still popular in Norway, especially for his anti-fascist poetry. The pre-war controversies in which he was involved were overshadowed by his war record. Grieg was a friend of English novelist Graham Greene, who wrote about various aspects of Grieg's life and wartime career in his 1980 biographical work Ways of Escape. The two met when Grieg turned up unannounced at Greene's cottage at Chipping Campden in 1931. In 1945, a collection of his war poems, Friheten was published and remained a best-selling Norwegian poetry collection. In 1957, a statue of Grieg by Roar Bjorg (1912‚Äì1984) was unveiled at Den Nationale Scene in Bergen. In 1990, the musical Nordahl Grieg i v√•re hjerter written by Erling Gjelsvik with music by Knut Skodvin, debuted in Bergen.Erling T. Gjelsvik.

Other successful bands, such as Chevelle, emerged from Squint's brief creative life.

The book focuses on twenty cases investigated by the author. It has been translated into seven foreign languages. General approach Stevenson describes his general approach as following an \\"almost conventional pattern\\": Stevenson set up a network of volunteers to find these spontaneous past life recall cases as soon as the children began to speak of them. He then would carefully question both the family of the living child and the family of the deceased to ensure that they had no contact and that no information would be passed between them. He would obtain detailed information about the deceased, including information not fully known to anyone involved, such as details of the will, that he would use to verify that the child actually did know the information required. The publication of the book was delayed when it was discovered that one of Stevenson's interpreters had been accused of dishonesty. Stevenson claimed that the translator was dishonest in some matters, but \\"did not think the man had deceived him\\". Nevertheless, he returned to India, where the interpreter had been used, and examined the cases in question again, with different interpreters. He found them to be even stronger evidence for reincarnation than he had previously thought. Published results Stevenson concluded that reincarnation was the \\"best possible explanation\\" for the following reasons: * The large number of witnesses and the lack of apparent motivation and opportunity, due to the vetting process, make the hypothesis of fraud extremely unlikely. * The large amount of information possessed by the child is not generally consistent with the hypothesis that the child obtained that information through investigated contact between the families. * Demonstration of similar personality characteristics and skills not learned in the current life and the lack of motivation for the long length of identification with a past life make the hypothesis of the child gaining his recollections and behavior through extra-sensory perception improbable. * When there is correlation between congenital deformities or birthmarks possessed by the child and the history of the previous individual, the hypothesis of random occurrence is improbable. Reception In 1977, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease devoted most of one issue to Stevenson's work in which psychiatrist Harold Lief described Stevenson as \\"a methodical, careful, even cautious, investigator, whose personality is on the obsessive side...Either he is making a colossal mistake, or he will be known . . . as 'the Galileo of the 20th century.\\"Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children When philosopher Leonard Angel criticized one of the cases in Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation personally handled by Stevenson,Skeptical Inquirer: Empirical evidence for reincarnation? examining Stevenson's ' most impressive ' case Stevenson published a rebuttal which argued the critique itself was flawed. Another Look at The Imad Elawar Case Mainstream scientists tended to ignore or dismiss Stevenson's research.

It has been widely exported, and remains in service with the CIS and many other nations. History The R-60 was initially developed for the MiG-23. Work began on the weapon, under the bureau designation K-60 (izdeliye 62), in the late 1960s. Series production began in 1973. It entered service with the designation R-60 (NATO reporting name \\"Aphid-A\\"). When introduced, the R-60 was one of the world's lightest air-to- air missiles, with a launch weight of . It has infrared guidance, with an uncooled Komar (Mosquito) seeker head. Control is by forward rudders with large rear fins. The distinctive canards on the nose, known as \\"destabilizers,\\" serve to improve the rudders' efficiency at high angles of attack. The R-60 uses a small, tungsten expanding-rod surrounding a high explosive fragmentation warhead. Two different types of proximity fuze can be fitted: the standard Strizh (Swift) optical fuse, which can be replaced with a Kolibri active radar fuse. Missiles equipped with the latter fuse were designated R-60K.Gordon, Yefim, Soviet/Russian Aircraft Weapons Since World War Two (Hinckley, England: Midland Publishing, 2004), pp. 29‚Äì32. According to Russian sources, practical engagement range is about , although \\"brochure range\\" is at high altitude. The weapon was one of the most agile air-to-air missiles until the advent of thrust vectored missiles like the R-73 (missile) and AIM-9X. The R-60 can be used by aircraft maneuvering at up to 9g against targets maneuvering at up to 8g. A tactical advantage is the short minimum range of only . Soviet practice was to manufacture most air-to-air missiles with interchangeable IR-homer and semi-active radar homing (SARH) seekers ‚Äì however, an SARH version of the R-60 was never contemplated due to the small size of the missile which makes a radar-homing version with an antenna of reasonable size impractical. An inert training version, alternatively designated UZ-62 and UZR-60, was also built. An upgraded version, the R-60M (NATO reporting name: \\"Aphid-B\\"), using a nitrogen-cooled seeker with an expanded view angle of ¬±20¬∞, was introduced around 1982. Although its seeker is more sensitive than its predecessor, the R-60M has only limited all-aspect capability. Minimum engagement range was further reduced, to only .Mladenov, Alexander, \\"Air-to-air missiles for the fighter 'Flogger'\\", International Air Power Review vol. 14, 2004, pp. 90‚Äì91. The proximity fuzes had improved resistance to ECM, although both optical and radar fuzes remained available (radar-fuzed R-60Ms with the Kolibri-M fuze are designated R-60 km). The R-60M is longer, and has a heavier, continuous-rod warhead, increasing launch weight to . In some versions the warhead is apparently laced with about of depleted uranium to increase the penetrating power of the warhead.\\"Health Risks of Using Depleted Uranium,\\" Venik's Aviation, 2001. The inert training version of the R-60M was the R-60MU. MiG-29K Since 1999, a modified version of the weapon has been used as a surface-to-air missile (SAM) as part of the Yugoslav M55A3B1 towed anti-aircraft artillery system. It has also been seen carried on a twin rail mount on a modified M53/59 Praga armored SPAAG of (former) Czechoslovakian origin. These missiles have been modified with the addition of a first stage booster motor, with the missile's own motor becoming the sustainer. This was done in lieu of modifying the missile's motor for ground launch, as in the case of the US MIM-72 Chaparral. The current Russian dogfight missile is the R-73 (missile) (AA-11 \\"Archer\\"), but large numbers of R-60 missiles remain in service. Operational history Soviet Union On 20 April 1978, two R-60 missiles were fired at Korean Air Lines Flight 902 after a navigational error had caused it to fly into Russian airspace. One missile hit, detaching 4 meters of the left wing and killing 2 passengers. The plane made an emergency landing on a frozen lake. On 21 June 1978, a PVO MiG-23M flown by Pilot Captain V. Shkinder shot down two Iranian Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters that had trespassed into Soviet airspace, one helicopter being dispatched by two R-60 missiles and the other by cannon fire. Syria Several Russian reports affirm the AA-8 was widely used during the 1982 Lebanon war, and it was the main weapon used by the Syrians in air-to-air combat. Some Russian reports affirm that the R-60 was the most successful air- to-air missile deployed by the Syrians in Lebanon over the Bekaa Valley in 1982SyAAF MiG-23 comabat record. According to Israeli reports, the vast majority of air-to-air combat consisted of visual range dogfights, and this has been also confirmed by Russian sources. The Russian reports also mentioned that several F-4s, F-16, IAI Kfirs were destroyed by R-60s among other aircraft. Israel claims some F-4s and Kfirs were lost in 1982, but lists SAMs as responsible for all Israeli aircraft losses. Iraq On 19th January 1991, during the Gulf War, Iraqi air force pilot Jameel Sayhood claimed to have shot down a Royal Air Force Panavia Tornado with a R-60 missile, however according to the Royal Air Force the aircraft crashed on 22nd January 1991 on a bombing mission in Ar Ruthba. Angola/Cuba On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, two Cuban FAR MiG-23MLs intercepted Captain Arthur Piercy's Mirage F1CZ, which was damaged by either an R-23 or an R-60 fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft's drag chute and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy was able to recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy's ejection seat to fire, but he failed to separate from the seat and suffered major spinal injuries. On 7 August 1988, a BAe-125 owned by the Botswana government was carrying the President of Botswana, Quett Masire, and his staff to a meeting in Luanda. An Angolan MiG-23 pilot fired two R-60s at the plane. One missile hit the no. 2 engine, causing it to fall off the aircraft. The second missile then hit the falling engine. The crew was able to make a successful emergency landing on a bush strip at Cutio Bie. India An Indian Air Force MiG-21 used an infrared homing R-60 to bring down a Pakistani Navy Breguet Atlantic in 1999 which intruded over Indian airspace. Part of the wreckage was found in contested territory, this incident is widely known as the Atlantique incident.

Symptoms  * Swelling of the outer portion of the upper lid, with possible redness and tenderness * Pain in the area of swelling * Excess tearing or discharge * Swelling of lymph nodes in front of the ear Complications Swelling may be severe enough to put pressure on the eye and distort vision. Some patients first thought to have dacryoadenitis may turn out to have a malignancy of the lacrimal gland. Causes  Acute dacryoadenitis is most commonly due to viral or bacterial infection. Common causes include mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, staphylococcus, and gonococcus. Chronic dacryoadenitis is usually due to noninfectious inflammatory disorders. Examples include sarcoidosis, thyroid eye disease, and orbital pseudotumor. Diagnosis Dacryoadenitis can be diagnosed by examination of the eyes and lids. Special tests such as a CT scan may be required to search for the cause. Sometimes biopsy will be needed to be sure that a tumor of the lacrimal gland is not present. Prevention Mumps can be prevented by immunization. Gonococcus, bacteria can be avoided by the use of condoms. Most other causes cannot be prevented. Treatment If the cause of dacryoadenitis is a viral condition such as mumps, simple rest and warm compresses may be all that is needed. For other causes, the treatment is specific to the causative disease. Prognosis Most patients will fully recover from dacryoadenitis. For conditions with more serious causes, such as sarcoidosis, the prognosis is that of the underlying condition.

The show was essentially a talk show where the host would interview ordinary people with an extraordinary story to tell. There was also considerable correspondence with its listeners. Home Truths was based on a previous show called Offspring (which aired from 1995 to 1997), also hosted by Peel. Home Truths took essentially the same format as its predecessor, but widened the remit from talking about the relationship between parents and children to discussion of all aspects of life. After Peel's death, the programme was presented by a series of guest presenters including Paul Heiney, writer David Stafford, comedian Linda Smith and musician Tom Robinson.

The Lumbee Tribe is the largest state tribe in North Carolina, the largest state tribe east of the Mississippi River, and the ninth largest non-federally recognized tribe in the United States. The Lumbee take their name from the Lumber River which winds through Robeson County. Pembroke, North Carolina, is the economic, cultural and political center of the tribe. The Lumbee Tribe was recognized as a Native American tribe by the United States Congress in 1956, under conditions that it agreed to at the time, which did not allow them to have benefits available to other federally recognized tribes. According to the 2000 United States Census report, 89% of the population of the town of Pembroke, North Carolina, identify as Lumbee; 40% of Robeson County's population identify as Lumbee. The Lumbee are one of eight state-recognized Native American tribes in North Carolina;\\"Native American Heritage.\\" State Library of North Carolina. Retrieved 8 Nov 2009. they have been recognized by the state since 1885. They participate at the state level in many ways, including in the North Carolina Commission of Indian Affairs. They also participate in such national organizations as the National Congress of American Indians and the National Indian Education Association. History Early historical references Archaeological evidence reveals that the area now known as Robeson County (central to modern Lumbee territory) has been continuously occupied by Native people for at least 14,000 years. Every named era found elsewhere in pre-European-contact North Carolina is also present in the archaeological record of Robeson County (artifacts from Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian cultures). Robeson Trails Archaeological Survey: Reconnaissance in Robeson County. Native American Resource Center Publications; 1988Robeson Crossroads Archaeological Survey: Phase II Testing in Robeson County. Native American Resource Center Publications; 1993 All modern vicinities of Lumbee occupation contain numerous archaeological sites as recent as the Late Woodland period (mid-1700s), and oral traditions about the history of some Lumbee families extend back as far in Robeson County as the mid-1700s. The Lumbee In Context: Toward An Understanding. Native American Resource Center Publications; 2000 The earliest European document referring to Indian communities in the area of the Lumber River is a map prepared in 1725 by John Herbert, the English commissioner of Indian trade for the Wineau Factory on the Black River. Herbert identifies the four Siouan-speaking communities as the Saraw, Pee Dee, Scavano, and Wacoma. Modern-day Lumbees claim connection to those settlements, but none of the four tribes is located within the boundaries of present-day Robeson County. When this area was first surveyed by the English in the 1750s, they reported that \\"No Indians\\" lived in Bladen County, which then included parts of present-day Robeson County. Colonial Welsh timber survey parties of the same areas also reported, \\"No Hostile Indians, in fact No Indians to be found at all.\\" The adjacent Anson County was identified as \\"a frontier to the Indians.\\" In 1754, colonial authorities organized the territory: everything north of the Lumber River was made part of Bladen County, and everything south of the Lumber River was made part of Anson County. Anson County's border stretched west to known Cherokee territory. Historical records are unclear as to which parts of Anson County were occupied by Indians in the early colonial period. A 1772 proclamation by the governor of North Carolina, Arthur Dobbs, derived from a report by his agent, Colonel Rutherford, head of a Bladen County militia, listed the names of inhabitants who took part in a \\"Mob Railously Assembled together,\\" apparently defying the efforts of colonial officials to collect taxes. The proclamation declared the \\"Above list of Rogus [sic] is all living upon the Kings Land without title.\\" A later colonial military survey described \\"50 families a mixt crew, a lawless People possess the Lands without Patent or paying quit Rents.\\"Colonial Records: North Carolina 1890; 768 and North Carolina 1887; 161, respectively The surnames of some of the families are the same as modern-day Lumbees, but each family must be traced separately to identify individual ancestors, particularly since extensive intermarriage took place. The families were classified then as \\"mulattos,\\" a term that then had several different meanings. Today, it is most commonly used to describe mixed- race persons of African-European ancestry. However, at the time, the term was also used across the South to describe any non-white individual. They included full-blooded Native Americans not living within a confined reservation and mixed-race persons of Native American-European ancestry. Following the Reconstruction Era, white-dominated legislatures in the South imposed legal racial segregation. They required all non-white people or people of color to attend black schools in which most students were freedmen's children. In 1885, Democratic state representative Hamilton McMillan supported an effort to gain separate schools for the Indian children in the state since they and their ancestors had always been free and refused to send their children to black schools. In making his case, McMillan wrote that Lumbee ancestor James Lowrie had received sizable land grants early in the century and, by 1738, possessed combined estates of more than 2,000 acres (810 ha). Adolph Dial and David Eliades claimed that another Lumbee ancestor, John Brooks, held the title to over 1,000 acres (400 ha) in 1735 and that Robert Lowrie gained possession of almost 700 acres (280 ha).Dial and Eliades, pp. 28‚Äì29. However, a state archivist noted in the late 20th century that no land grants were issued during these years in North Carolina. The first documented land grants made to individuals claimed to be Lumbee ancestors did not take place until the 1750s, more than a decade later.Hoffman None of the various petitions for federal recognition by the Lumbee people has relied on the McMillan, Dial, or Eliades claims.Thomas Land patents and deeds filed with the colonial administrations of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina during that period show that individuals who claimed to be Lumbee ancestors migrated from southern parts of Virginia and northern parts of North Carolina. In the first federal census of 1790, the ancestors of the Lumbee were enumerated as Free Persons of Color, another term used for a wide variety of non-White people including, non- reservation American Indians, mixed race of American Indian/European, and mixed race African/European. In 1800 and 1810, the families were classified as \\"all other free persons\\" in the census (after \\"white\\" and \\"black\\"). Land records show that in the second half of the 18th century, persons since identified as ancestral Lumbees began to take titles to land near Drowning Creek (Lumber River) and prominent swamps such as Ashpole, Long, and Back. According to James Campisi, the anthropologist hired by the Lumbee tribe to support their petition for federal recognition, the area \\"is located in the heart of the so-called old field of the Cheraw documented in land records between 1737 and 1739.\\"Campisi, Dr. Jack. \\"Testimony before the Committee on Indian Affairs United States Senate.\\" Legislative hearing on S. 660. 12 July 2006. p. 3 3 (retrieved 8 November 2009) The location of the Cheraw Old Fields is documented in the Lumbee petition for recognition based on Siouan descent, prepared by Lumbee River Legal Services in the 1980s. Other researchers have noted that the Cheraw Old Fields were only a few miles south of Robeson County North Carolina, into present-day Marlboro County South Carolina.Cheraws' North Carolina, General. Roots Web. (retrieved 8 Nov 2009) In 1771, a convicted felon, by the name of Winsler Driggers, captured \\"near Drowning Creek, in the Charraw settlement,\\" was reported as hanged under the Negro Act.South Carolina Gazette. October 3, 1771 That mention, along with no evidence that a new settlement was established or the old settlement was abandoned, is not sufficient to confirm that the settlement on Drowning Creek in 1754 was a Cheraw settlement. American Revolution and federal era Pension records for veterans of the American Revolutionary War in Robeson County listed men with surnames later associated with Lumbee families, such as Samuel Bell, Jacob Locklear, John Brooks, Berry Hunt, Thomas Jacobs, Thomas Cummings, and Michael Revels. In 1790, other men with surnames since associated with Lumbee- identified descendants, such as Barnes, Braveboy (or Brayboy), Bullard, Chavers (Chavis), Cumbo, Hammonds, Lowrie (Lowry/Lowery), Oxendine, Strickland, and Wilkins, were listed as inhabitants of the Fayetteville District; they were all \\"Free Persons of Color\\" in the first federal census.U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1790 Antebellum Following the Nat Turner Slave Rebellion of 1831, the state legislature passed amendments to its original 1776 constitution, abolishing suffrage for free people of color. This was one of a series of laws passed by North Carolina whites from 1826 to the 1850s which the historian John Hope Franklin characterized as the \\"Free Negro Code,\\" creating restrictions on that class. Free people of color were stripped of various political and civil rights which they had enjoyed for almost two generations. They could no longer vote or serve on juries, bear arms without a license from the state, or serve in the state militia.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1995-2005, accessed 9 Mar 2008 As these were obligations traditionally associated with citizenship, they were made second-class citizens. In 1853, the North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state's restrictions to prevent free people of color from bearing arms without a license. Noel Locklear, identified as a free man of color in State v. Locklear, was convicted for the illegal possession of firearms.Dial and Eliades, p.45Evans, p.108Hauptman, p. 77. In 1857, William Chavers from Robeson County was arrested and charged as a free person of color for carrying a shotgun without a license. Chavers, like Locklear, was convicted. Chavers promptly appealed, arguing that the law restricted only \\"free Negroes,\\" not \\"persons of color from Indian blood.\\" The appeals court reversed the lower court, finding that \\"free persons of color may be, then, for all we can see, persons colored by Indian blood\\".State v. Chavers, 50 N.C. (5 Jones) 11 (1857). Civil War A yellow fever epidemic in 1862‚Äì1863 killed many slaves working on the construction of Fort Fisher near Wilmington, North Carolina, then considered to be the \\"Gibraltar of the South\\". As the state's slave owners resisted sending more slaves to Fort Fisher, the Confederate Home Guard intensified efforts to conscript able-bodied free persons of color as laborers. There does not appear to be documentation of conscription among the free people of color in Robeson County.Evans, pp. 3‚Äì18.Dial and Eliades, pp. 46‚Äì47.Hauptman, pp. 78‚Äì80. Some Lumbee ancestors are believed to have been forced to aid the Confederacy as laborers. Others are documented as drawing Confederate pensions for their service. The community says that many men tried to avoid such forced labor by hiding in the swamps. During that period, some men from Robeson County operated as guerrillas for the Union Army, sabotaging the efforts of the Confederacy and robbing local whites. Lowrie War Early in the Civil War, North Carolina turned to forced labor to construct her defenses. Several Lowrie cousins had been conscripted as laborers to help build Fort Fisher, near Wilmington. Henry Berry Lowrie and several of his relatives took to the swamps where Indians resorted to \\"lying out\\" to avoid being rounded up by the Home Guard and forced to work as impressed laborers. The Lowrie gang, as it became known, resorted to crime and conducting personal feuds, committing robberies and murders against white Robeson County residents and skirmishing with the Confederate Home Guard. They grew bolder as the war turned against the Confederates. In December 1864, the Lowrie gang killed James P. Barnes after he had drafted workers, including the Lowries, for work on local defenses. Barnes had earlier accused Henry's father, Allen Lowrie, of stealing hogs. Next, the gang killed James Brantley Harris, a Confederate conscription officer who had killed a Lowrie relative. The Confederates struck back, searching Allen Lowrie's home in March 1865, where they found forbidden firearms. The Home Guard convened a summary court, convicted Allen Lowrie and his son William of illegally possessing firearms as men of color, and executed them. After the Civil War, the Lowrie gang continued their insurgency, committing robberies and murders. The authorities' raids and attempts to capture gang members became known as the Lowry War. The gang consisted of Henry Lowrie, his brothers Stephen and Thomas, cousins Calvin and Henderson Oxendine, two of Lowrie's brothers-in- law, two escaped slaves who had joined the Lowries, a white man of unknown identity who was likely a Confederate deserter, and two other men of unknown relation and identity. On December 7, 1865, Henry Lowrie married Rhoda Strong. Arrested at his wedding, Lowrie escaped from jail by filing his way through the jail's bars. Lowrie's gang continued its activities into the Reconstruction Era. Republican governor William Woods Holden declared Lowrie and his men outlaws in 1869, and offered a $12,000 reward for their capture: dead or alive. Lowrie responded with more revenge killings. Eluding capture, the Lowrie gang persisted after Reconstruction ended and conservative white Democrats gained control of North Carolina government, imposing segregation and white supremacy. The Lowrie gang gained the sympathy of local Indian families and even some poor whites, who refused to cooperate with efforts to stop them. Records of the pursuit of the Lowrie gang provide the first documentation of the local people's claims on mixed Indian ancestry. These early accounts refer to the Lowries and the other local Indian families as being mixed Tuscarora/white. More than 150 years before, a large number of the Tuscarora people, who spoke an Iroquoian language, migrated north to New York to join their Iroquois cousins. The Tuscarora tribe in New York considers the migration complete by the year 1722; all the Tuscarora who remained in North Carolina are not considered under the same council fire, or tribal fraction. The large migration of Tuscarora people was a result of their defeat by the Carolina colonists and their Indian allies in the Tuscarora War. In February 1872, shortly after a raid in which he robbed the local sheriff's safe of more than $28,000, Henry Berry Lowrie disappeared. It is claimed he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his double-barrel shotgun. As with many folk heroes, the death of Lowrie was disputed. He was reportedly seen at a funeral several years later. Without his leadership, all but two members of the Lowrie gang were subsequently hunted down, and either captured or killed. State recognition as Indians During Reconstruction, the legislature established public education for the first time, providing for white and black schools. All children of color were assigned to black schools, which were dominated by the children of freedmen (freed slaves). The Indian people of Robeson County had always been free and did not socially associate or interact with Blacks. They refused to send their children to school with the free Blacks and demanded for separate Indian schools. In the 1880s, as the Democratic Party was struggling against the biracial Populist movement which combined the strength of poor whites (Populist and Democrats) and blacks (mostly Republicans), Democratic state representative Hamilton MacMillan proposed to have the state recognize these Indian people of Robeson County as the \\"Croatan Indians\\" and to create a separate system of Croatan Indian schools. By the end of the 19th century, the \\"Indians of Robeson County\\" (as they then identified) established schools in eleven of their principal settlements.Ross, pp.115-116; 124-125. An Indian school system In 1887, the Indians of Robeson County petitioned the state legislature to establish a normal school to train Indian teachers for the county's Indian schools. With state permission, they raised the requisite funds, along with some state assistance, which proved inadequate. Several tribal leaders donated money and privately held land for schools. Robeson County's Indian Normal School eventually developed as Pembroke State University and subsequently as the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.Ross, pp. 115-116; 124-125 In 1899, North Carolina Congressional representatives introduced the first bill in Congress to appropriate federal funds to educate the Indian children of Robeson County. They introduced another bill a decade later,H.R.19036, 61st Congress, 2nd Session and yet another in 1911.S.3258, 62nd Congress, 1st Session The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, T. J. Morgan, responded to Congress and the Croatan Indians, writing that, \\"so long as the immediate wards of the Government [Indians on reservations] are so insufficiently provided for, I do not see how I can consistently render any assistance to the Croatans or any other civilized tribes.\\" [sic, civilized tribes were defined in contrast to Indians on reservations, who were wards of the government.]Dial and Eliades, 93 Those Indians in the Southeast and elsewhere who were not on reservations, such as those in Robeson County, were considered to be United States citizens and thus the responsibility of state governments. The federal government funded Indian education only for Indians on reservations. By the first decade of the 20th century, a North Carolina Representative introduced a federal bill to establish \\"a normal school for the Indians of Robeson County, North Carolina,\\" to be paid for by the federal government. Charles F. Pierce, U.S. Supervisor of Indian Schools in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, opposed the legislation since, \\"[a]t the present time it is the avowed policy of the government to require states having an Indian population to assume the burden and responsibility for their education, so far as is possible.\\"Jefferson, NC: McFarland (1994), pages 179-186 Ku Klux Klan conflict During the 1950s, the Croatan Indians (as they were then called) made nationwide news when they came into conflict with the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organization headed by Klan Grand Dragon James W. \\"Catfish\\" Cole. Cole began a campaign of harassment against the Lumbee, claiming they were \\"mongrels and half-breeds\\" whose \\"race mixing\\" threatened to upset the established order of the segregated Jim Crow South. After giving a series of speeches denouncing the \\"loose morals\\" of Lumbee women, Cole burned a cross in the front yard of a Lumbee woman in St. Pauls, North Carolina, as a \\"warning\\" against \\"race mixing\\". Emboldened, Cole called for a Klan rally on January 18, 1958, near the town of Maxton. The Lumbee, led by recent veterans of the Second World War, decided to disrupt the rally. The \\"Battle of Hayes Pond\\", also known as \\"the Klan Rout\\", made national news. Cole had predicted more than 5,000 Klansmen would show up for the rally, but fewer than 100 and possibly as few as three dozen attended. Approximately 500 Lumbee, armed with guns and sticks, gathered in a nearby swamp, and when they realized they possessed an overwhelming numerical advantage, attacked the Klansmen. The Lumbee encircled the Klansmen, opening fire and wounding four Klansmen in the first volley, none seriously. The remaining Klansmen panicked and fled. Cole was found in the swamps, arrested and tried for inciting a riot. The Lumbee celebrated the victory by burning Klan regalia and dancing around the open flames.\\"Bad Medicine for the Klan\\", Life magazine, 1958 The Battle of Hayes Pond, which marked the end of Klan activity in Robeson County, is celebrated as a Lumbee holiday. Early efforts to gain federal recognition The people achieved state recognition as \\"Croatan Indians\\" in the 1880s. In 1911, at the request of the tribe, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation changing their name to \\"Indians of Robeson County.\\" In 1913, over the objections of the existing federally recognized Cherokee Nation tribes in Oklahoma, the North Carolina legislators, based on a petition lobbied for and created by the Croatans, added \\"Cherokee\\" to the name of the Robeson County tribe. The tribe petitioned for federal recognition as \\"Cherokee\\" Indians, but it was denied. From 1913 to 1932, North Carolina legislators introduced bills in Congress as petitioned for by the Croatan faction to change the name of the people to Cherokee and gain federal recognition, but did not succeed. In the early 20th century, North Carolina requested federal assistance to collect information related to the status of Indians in the state. The Southeast tribes had been subject to Indian removal in the 1830s, and were assigned to reservations in Oklahoma. Those Indians remaining in the state were considered state and federal citizens; there were no Indian reservations in the state. The legislature was chiefly reviewing issues related to the state's treatment of the Cherokee descendants who lived in the state. In 1915, the report of Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was sent to the North Carolina legislature. He primarily reported on the Cherokee in the state. He noted that the Indians of Robeson County had developed an extensive system of schools and a political organization. He thought that, as state-recognized Indians, they were eligible to attend federal Indian schools. But, as they were highly assimilated, spoke English, and already worked in the common state culture, he doubted that the federal Indian schools could meet their needs. Congress did not provide any additional funding to support education for Indians in North Carolina.McPherson In 1924, the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina petitioned for federal recognition as \\"Siouan Indians\\"; their request was rejected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Congressional committees continued to refuse to have the federal government assume educational responsibility for the Indians of Robeson County, as they were state citizens and part of that jurisdiction's responsibility. Federally commissioned reports In the 20th century, numerous federally commissioned studies related to the Lumbee were conducted by anthropologists, ethnologists, and historians. They reflect changing concepts of what constituted Indian identity. In 1912, legislation was introduced to the US Senate to establish a school for the Indians of Robeson County. When the bill was sent to committee, it requested information from the Department of the Interior. The Indian Office sent Charles F. Pierce, the Supervisor of Indian Schools, to Robeson County to conduct a study of the tribe. Pierce reported that the state and county were providing funds to educate the 1,976 school-age Indian children. He also stated in his report that \\"one would readily class a large majority [of the Lumbee] as being at least three-fourths Indian. On April 28, 1914, the Senate called for an investigation into the status and conditions of the Indians of Robeson and adjoining counties. The Indian Office sent Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson to the county to obtain information regarding the educational system of the tribe. In his report, submitted to the Senate on January 4, 1915, he wrote: > While these Indians are essentially an agricultural people, I believe them > to be as capable of learning the mechanical trades as the average white > youth. The foregoing facts suggest the character of the educational > institution that should be established for them, in case Congress sees fit > to make the necessary appropriation, namely the establishment of an > agricultural and mechanical school, in which domestic science shall also be > taught. John R. Swanton, a noted anthropologist-historian, reported on possible origins of the Indians of Robeson County in his work on Southeast Indians. He wrote: > The evidence available thus seems to indicate that the Indians of Robeson > County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from > certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and > Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and > Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and > Cape Fears. It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of > Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, > but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant.

Therefore, if the name of any tribe > is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, > that of the Cheraw would, in my opinion, be most appropriate. In 1935, Indian Agent Fred Baker was sent to Robeson County in response to a proposed resettlement project for the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County. At the time, the people were attempting to organize as a tribe under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, which largely applied to Indians on reservations to encourage their self-government. Baker reported: > I find that the sense of racial solidarity is growing stronger and that the > members of this tribe are cooperating more and more with each other with the > object in view of promoting the mutual benefit of all the members. It is > clear to my mind that sooner of later government action will have to be > taken in the name of justice and humanity to aid them. D'Arcy McNickle, from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, came to Robeson County in 1936 to collect affidavits and other data from people registering as Indian under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. McNickle stated, \\"there are reasons for believing that until comparatively recently some remnant of language still persisted among these people.\\" In the 1960s, Smithsonian ethnologists Dr. William Sturtevant and Dr. Samuel Stanley described the Lumbee as \\"larger than any other Indian group in the United States except the Navajo\\", and estimated their population as 31,380 Lumbee (from North and South Carolina) in 1960. Indian New Deal The federal Indian Reorganization Act in 1934 was chiefly directed at Native American tribes on reservations. It encouraged them to re-establish self-government, which had been diminished since the founding of reservations and the supervision by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. At this time, the Indians of Robeson County renewed their petition for federal recognition as a tribe. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) sent John R. Swanton, an anthropologist from the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Indian Agent Fred Baker to evaluate the claim of the Indians of Robeson County to historical continuity as an identified Indian community. In 1934, the future Lumbee revived their claim to Cherokee identity, joining the National Congress of American Indians under the name, \\"Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.\\" Swanton speculated that the group were more likely descended in part from Cheraw and other eastern Siouan tribes, as these were the predominant Native American peoples historically in that area. The Indians of Robeson County split in terms of how they identified as Native Americans: one group supported the Cheraw theory of ancestry. The other faction believed they were descended from the Cherokee, although the tribe had historically occupied territory in the mountains and western part of the state rather than the area of Robeson County. North Carolina's politicians abandoned support for the federal recognition effort until the tribal factions agreed on their identity. In 1952, under the leadership of D.F. Lowrie, the tribe voted to adopt the name \\"Lumbee.\\" The North Carolina legislature recognized the name change in 1953. The tribe petitioned again for federal recognition. Lumbee Act The Lumbee Act, also known as H.R. 4656 (), passed by Congress in late May 1956 as a concession to political lobbying and signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, designated the Lumbee as an Indian people. It withheld full recognition as a \\"Tribe\\", as had been agreed to by the Lumbee leaders. The Lumbee Act designated the Indians of Robeson, Hoke, Scotland, and Cumberland counties as the \\"Lumbee Indians of North Carolina.\\" It provided further, \\"as requested by the Lumbee HR 4656 stipulated that '[n]othing in this Act shall make such Indians eligible for any services performed by the United States for Indians because of their status as Indians.'\\" It also forbids a Government relationship with the Lumbee and forbids them from applying through the BARS, the BIA administrative process to gain recognition. This restriction as to eligibility for services was a condition which tribal representatives agreed to at the time in order to achieve status as a recognized tribe and have the Lumbee name recognized. The Lumbee had essentially assimilated into early colonial life prior to the formation of the United States. They lived as individuals, as did any other colonial and U.S. citizens. Lumbee spokesmen repeatedly testified at these hearings that they were not seeking federal financial benefits; they said they only wanted a name designation as Lumbee people. Petitioning for full federal recognition In 1987, the Lumbee petitioned the United States Department of the Interior for full federal recognition. This is a prerequisite to receive the financial benefits accorded federally recognized Native American tribes. The latter have generally been those tribes who had signed treaties with the federal government and had reservations established, and a history of a tribal relationship with the federal government.The petition's authors were Julian Pierce, Cynthia Hunt- Locklear, Wes White, Jack Campisi and Arlinda Locklear. The petition was denied because of the Lumbee Act. The Lumbee resumed lobbying Congress, testifying in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1993 in efforts to gain full federal recognition by congressional action. All of these attempts failed in the face of opposition by the Department of Interior, the recognized Cherokee tribes (including North Carolina's Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), some of the North Carolina Congressional delegation, and some representatives from other states with federally recognized tribes. Some of the North Carolina delegation separately recommended an amendment to the 1956 Act that would enable the Lumbee to apply to the Department of Interior under the regular administrative process for recognition. In 2004 and 2006 the tribe made renewed bids for full recognition, to include financial benefits. In 2007, US Senator Elizabeth Dole from North Carolina introduced the Lumbee Recognition Act. It was not enacted. Lumbee Tribal Chairman Jimmy Goins appeared before the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in September 2007 to lobby for federal recognition of the tribe. Goins testified on the Lumbee's decades-long efforts to gain recognition. The Committee meeting was also a part of the 2008 documentary Looking For Ms. Locklear, made by Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal. On January 6, 2009, US Representative Mike McIntyre introduced legislation (H.R. 31) to grant the Lumbee full federal recognition. The bill gained support of more than 180 co-sponsors, including that of both North Carolina US Senators (Richard Burr and Kay Hagan). On June 3, 2009, the United States House of Representatives voted 240 to 179 for federal recognition for the Lumbee tribe, acknowledging that they are descendants of the historic Cheraw tribe. The bill went to the United States Senate. On October 22, 2009, the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs approved a bill for federal recognition of the Lumbee. The bill includes a no-gaming clause. The Senate adjourned for 2010 without taking action on the bill. Theories of origins Lost Colony of Roanoke In 1885, the Democratic politician Hamilton MacMillan proposed the theory that the Native inhabitants of Robeson County were descendants of England's \\"Lost Colony of Roanoke\\", who intermarried with what he described as the \\"Croatan Indians.\\"See Hamilton MacMillan, Sir Walter Raleigh's Lost Colony: An Historical Sketch of the Attempts of Sir Walter Raleigh to Establish a Colony in Virginia, with the Traditions of an Indian Tribe in North Carolina (Wilson, NC: Advance Press, 1888) The Roanoke colony disappeared during a difficult winter, but the colonists reportedly left the word \\"Croatan\\" carved into a tree, hence the name MacMillan gave the proto Lumbee. MacMillan's theory was part of a Reconstruction era effort to woo the proto Lumbee to the Democratic Party by creating an \\"Indian\\" school system that would free these new \\"Croatan Indians\\" from sending their children to school with the children of the recently emancipated slaves. By the early 1900s, Robeson County whites used \\"Cro\\" as a racial epithet to describe their \\"Indian\\" neighbors. The Lost Colony theory of origins fell out of favor in the early twentieth century. \\"Croatan\\" was dropped from their tribal name and replaced by \\"Indians of Robeson County\\", although Lumbee historian Adolph Dial continued to advocate for the theory in the 1980s.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1987-08-18-8703030008-story.html Cherokee descent The proto Lumbee first began identifying as Cherokee Indians in 1915, when they changed their name to the \\"Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.\\" Four years earlier, they had changed their name from the \\"Croatan Indians\\" to the generic \\"Indians of Robeson County.\\" But the Cherokee occupied much further to the west and in the mountains during the colonial era. In his unpublished 1934 master's thesis, graduate student Clifton Oxendine theorized that the Lumbee descended from Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee. Citing \\"oral traditions,\\" Oxendine suggested that the Lumbee were the descendants of Cherokee warriors who fought with the British under Colonel John Barnwell of South Carolina in the Tuscarora campaign of 1711‚Äì1713. He said the Cherokee settled in the swamps of Robeson County when the campaign ended, along with some Tuscarora captives.Oxendine, p. 4 The Oxendine theory of Cherokee origin has been uniformly rejected by mainstream scholars. First, no Cherokee warriors are listed in the record of Barnwell's company.Rights, pp. 54-55 Second, the Lumbee do not speak Cherokee or any other Indian language. Third, Oxendine's claims of oral traditions are completely unsubstantiated; no such oral traditions survive or are documented by any other scholar. The Lumbee have abandoned this theory in their documentation supporting their effort to obtain federal tribal recognition. The federally recognized Cherokee Nation categorically rejects any connection to the Lumbee, dismissing the Oxendine claims as \\"absurd\\" and disputing even that the Lumbee qualify as Native American. Cheraw descent Shortly after abandoning the Croatan label and changing their name to the generic \\"Indians of Robeson County\\", the proto Lumbee seized on the speculations of Indian agent McPherson that they may be related to the defunct Cheraw, a band of Siouan-speaking Indians that had been reduced by war and disease to 50 or 60 individuals by 1768. The 1915 McPherson Report said in reference to the Cheraw (quoting the Handbook of American Indians, 1906): > Their numbers in 1715, according to Rivers, was 510, but this estimate > probably included the Keyauwee. Being still subject to attack by the > Iroquois, they finally‚Äîbetween 1726 and 1739‚Äîbecame incorporated with the > Catawba ... They are mentioned as with the Catawba but speaking their own > distinct dialect as late as 1743 (Adair). The last notice of them in 1768, > when their remnant, reduced by war and disease to 50 or 60, were still > living with the Catawba.Handbook of American Indians (1906) The Catawba are a federally recognized tribe. The McPherson Report does not explain how or when the remaining four or five dozen Cheraw identified in 1768 separated from the Catawba and became the ancestors of the Lumbee. Siouan descent After repeated rejections under the Croatan, Cherokee and Cheraw labels, the proto Lumbee petitioned the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1924 for recognition as \\"Siouan\\" Indians. This petition was rejected largely on the grounds that Siouan was a language, not a tribe. Moreover, there was no record of the Lumbee or their ancestors having ever spoken the Siouan or any other Indian language. Keyauwee descent In 1933, John Swanton wrote that the Siouan-speaking Keyauwee and Cheraw of the Carolina Piedmont were the most likely Indian ancestors of the people known from 1885 to 1912 as Croatan Indians and later as the Indians of Robeson County.Chavis, Dean. \\"The Lumbee Story\\" , Red Hearts website (retrieved 8 Nov 2009) He suggested that surviving descendants of the Waccamaw and the Woccon likely lived in the central coastal region of North Carolina. In the 21st century, these tribes are extinct as groups, except for a small band of Waccamaw that live on Lake Waccamaw and have been recognized by the state. Swanton traced the migration of Southeast tribes.Rights, p. 59 In addition to the Keyauwee, Cheraw, Bear River, Waccamaw, and Woccon already mentioned, he noted that the Eno and Waxhaw migrated from Piedmont, South Carolina northeast to the north- central part of North Carolina, then back south again to a point on the Pee Dee River just south of the border of the two Carolinas. According to Blu, by the 1770s remnant Indians, from the once distinct tribal communities of the Cheraw, Keyauwee, Hatteras, Waxhaw, Sugaree, Eno, and Shakori, gathered along the Lumbee River, near the border that now divides North and South Carolina. Some of these Indians moved further southward to join with the few surviving Catawba, but the majority settled near the pines, web of wetlands, and river that bear the name of the Lumbee. Over time in a process of ethnogenesis, they identified as a common people.Blu 1980:36  Settlements  The Lumbee are heavily concentrated in Robeson County on the southern border of the state. Over the years, the Lumbee have migrated to other areas primarily for employment. Sizeable Lumbee settlements are in Cumberland, Sampson, Hoke, Scotland, and Columbus counties; in Greensboro, Charlotte, Detroit, Baltimore, and Claxton, Georgia (settled from 1865 to the 1920s to work turpentine and cotton). Culture and traditions Language The Lumbee language is not a Native American language, but rather a form of American Indian English. In 2020, the ISO 639-3 language code lmz was retired from use, as it was determined that no separate Lumbee language has ever existed. Linguists have speculated that the ancestors of the Lumbees had been native peoples who had originally spoken the Cheraw Dialect of the Eastern Siouan language prior to adopting English sometime before the early 1700s.https://iso639-3.sil.org/sites/iso639-3/files/change_requests/2019/2019-025.pdfhttps://blogs.commons.georgetown.edu/ling-487-spring2012-dch52/files/2012/04/schilling- estes-constructing-ethnicity1.pdf The Lumbees emerged as an English-speaking tribal group with a Native American identity in the colonial era. Lumbee Homecoming Lumbee Homecoming is a celebration held annually in Pembroke, NC since 1968. Homecoming is important in bringing together members of families, many from great distances, for a weeklong celebration of Lumbee culture. Festivities include a parade, a pow wow, pageants, and other cultural events. 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the homecoming and saw crowds of over 20,000 spectators, including the current Governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper. Communities Lumbee communities were linked together by their extensive kinship ties, church affiliations, their sense of themselves as Indians, and their control of their educational system, all of which served as a mechanism for defining tribal membership and maintaining tribal boundaries. Communities are basically self-governing. One form of self-governance in the early 20th century was exhibited by a fraternal organization known as the Red Men's Lodge. By 1914, lodges existed in Prospect, Magnolia, Pembroke, Saddletree, Oxendine, and Union Chapel. Lodge members maintained social order, carried out ceremonies, marched in parades, and conducted funerals. The 1987 Lumbee Petition states that, \\"[w]ith so many prominent leaders it is easy to understand how the lodges could maintain order and, at the same time, protect the tribal members from organized violence from whites in the area\\"., Lumbee Tribe website Lumbee patchwork Lumbee patchwork is a traditional Lumbee craft. Drawing on the abundant flora around them, they worked the Long Leaf Pine cone into a design for their blankets, rugs, and clothing. Patchwork can be seen at the UNCP Native American Resource Center, powwows, cultural events, quilting bees, and culture classes around Robeson County. In 1993, the Lumbee patchwork dress was recreated for Miss Lumbee Natascha Wagoner, who was chosen as the 8th Miss Indian USA. The dress, designed by Hayes Alan Locklear and sewn by Kat Littleturtle, set a standard for the Lumbee women and became a cultural symbol. Religion Today the Lumbee primarily practice Christianity, and attending church is an important social activity. Churches have Sunday schools, youth organizations, senior citizens' programs, Bible study programs, and choir practices. Gospel songs are popular. Ministers are highly respected. When a sizeable number of Lumbee people move to a city, they tend to settle in a particular section or neighborhood and establish a church. This took place in Lumbee communities in Baltimore, Greensboro, Fayetteville, Charlotte, and Claxton, Georgia.Stilling, Glenn Ellen Starr. \\"North Carolina's Lumbee Indians in Literature, Art, and Music\\" , Lumbee Indians. Retrieved 1 July 2013 A study has documented Lumbee Methodism back to 1787. Lumbees created two church conferences of Indian congregations ‚Äî the Burnt Swamp Baptist Association, founded around 1880, and the Lumbee River Conference of the Holiness Methodist Association in 1900. In 1984 Bruce Barton documented 104 Lumbee churches. Prospect Methodist Church, with 1,008 members in 2017, has purportedly the largest congregation of Native Americans in the United States. Government According to its constitution, adopted in 2000, the Lumbee tribal government is organized into three branches: the tribal chairperson (executive), the 21-member Tribal Council (legislative), and Supreme Court (judicial). The tribal chairperson and the Tribal Council are elected to three-year terms. Harvey Godwin was elected Tribal Chairman in December 2015. Services After state recognition, the tribe established a normal school to train teachers for Indian schools in Robeson County. The Lumbee Tribe operated primary and high schools for its children. The normal school was developed as a four-year college and later university, and it has been integrated into the state's University of North Carolina system. The University at Pembroke is open to all races. Veteran Affairs Veterans Affairs of the Lumbee Tribe offers assistance with educational benefits, community resources, and assistance for homeless veterans. They can also help with concerns such as: how to get into the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, how to get prescription medications from the Veterans Affairs pharmacy, and how to arrange transportation to the VA Medical Center for appointments. It is not affiliated with, supported, nor endorsed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Elder Services The mission of The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina Elder Services is to assist Elders in maintaining an independent, healthy, and productive life by providing opportunities for services through a network of various community resources. Elder Services will support and uphold quality of life for our Elders though love, respect, and honor. Youth Services Youth Services provides the children of the Lumbee Tribe a healthy, positive environment. The Lumbee Tribe is committed to protect and support the tribal youth through their growth into becoming contributing members in the community. Programs offered include: *Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina Boys and Girl Club (located at multiple locations within Robeson County) *Cultural Enrichment Classes *Tobacco Prevention & Cessation Program *Homicide and Motor Vehicle Death Program Teen Impact/Volunteerism and Community Service Teen Impact is a tribal-based community service club for teenage members of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. The Volunteer Program of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina assists and mentors the teen volunteer as he/she donates service hours to a community cause of their choice Department of Energy The Tribal Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) provides a one-time payment to assist eligible American Indian families pay their heating cost. The application process is held the first two weeks of November each year. Housing The mission of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina Housing Program is to provide opportunities for affordable, safe and sanitary housing options for Lumbee Indian families in the service areas of Cumberland, Hoke, Robeson and Scotland Counties. Programs offered under the Lumbee housing program include: *Housing/Rehabilitation Program *Section 184 Loan Guarantee Program *Down Payment Assistance Program *Home- ownership Program *New Construction Program *Transitional Housing Program *37-Stock Program *Emergency/Rental Assistance Program *Mortgage Assistance Program *Housing RFP's Lumbee Tribal Vocational Rehabilitation Services This program provides vocational rehabilitation to any Lumbee Indian with a disability living in the Lumbee Tribal area. The objective of the program is to prepare for, obtain or retain gainful employment. It is their goal to improve the quality of life for Lumbee Indians with disabilities.

The ANARE Name HMAS Wyatt Earp leaving Melbourne; Their voyage would be the first to operate under the banner of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) The name ANARE fell out of official use in the early 2000s. However current and former Australian Antarctic expeditioners continue to use the term informally as a means of identification with the long and continuous history of Australian expeditions to Antarctica. Australia has had a long involvement in south polar regions since as early as Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911. Further Australian exploration of the Antarctic continent was conducted during the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE), which was conducted over the years 1929‚Äì1931. The Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions were established in 1947 with expeditions to Macquarie Island and Heard Island. In 1948 the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) was established to administer the expedition program. ANARE Symbols Soon after being appointed Antarctic Division director in 1949, Dr. Phillip Law saw the need for a recognisable symbol for the fledgling ANARE. His wife, Nel, was an artist and produced the distinctive and enduring circular emblem that Dr Law described as \\"...a circular badge whose centre is the Antarctic Continent with the Australian sector shaded. Surrounding this is an annular set of designs depicting flora and fauna of Antarctica and the Sub-Antarctic Islands\\". The main ANARE emblem was, in Dr Law's words, \\"too complex to reproduce as a lapel badge or as a logo on aircraft, vehicles or flags.\\" Dr Law saw potential in the leopard seal as a simplified ANARE symbol. \\"I was struck with the possibility of formalising a sketch of the creature to produce a geometrical pattern of straight lines....I drew it in the national colours of gold and green.\\" That symbol served until 1985, when a new 'globe' logo based on the Australian and Antarctic continents was developed by the AAD (Bowden, 'The Silence Calling' 1997: 373). At the same time the term ANARE fell out of official use the 'globe' logo was also discarded in favour of the Australian coat of arms to bring the livery of the AAD in line with the rest of the Australian Public Service. However like the ANARE name the logo continues to be used on an informal basis by expeditioners each year in the production of Antarctic Station badges, T-shirts and other memorabilia. ANARE Club The ANARE Club is a membership organisation established in 1951 for current and previous members of Australian Antarctic expeditions. Its headquarters are in Melbourne, Australia, with branches in most Australian capital cities. Membership is open to anyone who has travelled to Antarctic or subantarctic regions with the Australian Antarctic Program. It provides a social focus for current and former expeditioners. The club's membership is well over 1,000. Its emblem is the emperor penguin on a map of Antarctica.

Streetball (or street basketball) is a variation of basketball, typically played on outdoor courts and featuring significantly less formal structure and enforcement of the game's rules. As such, its format is more conducive to allowing players to publicly showcase their own individual skills. Streetball may also refer to other urban sports played on asphalt. It is particularly popular and important in New York City. Some places and cities in the United States have organized streetball programs, operated similarly to midnight basketball programs. Many cities also host their own weekend-long streetball tournaments, with Hoop-It- Up and the Houston Rockets' Blacktop Battle being two of the most popular. Since the mid-2000s, streetball has seen an increase in media exposure through television shows such as ESPN's ,Street Basketball' and City Slam, as well as traveling exhibitions such as the AND1 Mixtape Tour, YPA, and Ball4Real. It is also popular in other countries like Philippines. Most of their streets have their own basketball court. Tournaments are also organized especially during summer and holiday season. Divisions are divided into 4 brackets, Mosquito (ages 7 to 13), Midget (ages 14 to 17), Junior (ages 18 to 25), and Senior division (ages 26 and up). Rules and features Children playing streetball in Paris in winter Streetball rules vary widely from court to court. Players typically divide into teams by alternating choices. No referees are employed, so almost invariably a \\"call your own foul\\" rule is in effect, and a player who believes he has been fouled, simply needs to call out \\"Foul!\\", and play will be stopped, with the ball awarded to the fouled player's team (free throws are not awarded in streetball). It is also standard that the hands are considered part of the ball. Calling fouls is generally disfavored. The etiquette of what rightly constitutes a foul, as well as the permissible amount of protestation against such a call, are the products of individual groups, and of the seriousness of a particular game. Other violations which are enforced include traveling, double-dribble, carrying, kicking, out of bounds, goaltending, and backcourt violation. Half-court play The majority of streetball games are played 3-on-3 on a half court. Special rules have been developed for half-court play: At the beginning of the game and after each made basket, play begins at the top of the key. A \\"checking\\" system is used to ensure that both teams are ready to begin play. This involves the offensive player saying \\"check\\" while throwing the ball to his defender. The defender then makes sure his/her team is ready and then throws the ball back to begin play. If the ball goes out of bounds during play, the ball can either be checked from out of bounds near where the ball went out or at the top of the key, depending on the rules established before the game. FIBA recently had to add the ‚Äòcheck clock‚Äô rule into play in their streetball tournaments due to some players taking excruciatingly long amounts of time to check the ball, interrupting the flow of play. This ‚Äòcheck clock‚Äô means that when the defending player has been checked the ball, he has to return it within 5 seconds. Also the \\"shot clock\\" rule can be implemented as well to prevent longer possessions. If the defending team gains possession of the ball, they must clear the ball pass the three-point line before they can score a basket. This does not need to be at the top of the key and no checking is required.  Game structure  A common feature of street basketball is the pick up game. To participate in most streetball games around the world, one simply goes to an outdoor court where people are playing, indicates a wish to participate, and from all the players who were at the court before one has played, two players acting as \\"captains\\" will get to pick their team out of the players available and play a game. Generally, the team captains alternate their choices, but different courts have differing rules in regards to player selection. Many games play up to 7, 11, 13, 15, or 21 points with the scoring system of 2-point baskets and 3-point baskets counting for 1 and 2 points respectively. It is possible to do (1's only), (2's only), (1's and 2's), (2's and 3's) or (1's, 2's, and 3's) * 1's only ‚Äì each basket counts as 1 point * 2's only ‚Äì each basket counts as 2 points * 1's and 2's ‚Äì each basket counts as 1 point inside the arc and 2 points outside the arc * 2's and 3's ‚Äì each basket counts as 2 points inside the arc and 3 points outside the arc * 1's, 2's, and 3's ‚Äì You need at least 3 teams for this, baskets count as 1 or 2 points until one of the 3 teams score a certain number of points, then the other 2 teams play for second place with baskets counting for 2 and 3 points Players often play 'win by 2' which, as in tennis, means that the team has to win by a margin of at least 2 points. Sometimes a local \\"dead end\\" limit applies; for instance a game may be played to 7, win by 2, with a 9-point dead end, (referred to as \\"7 by 2's, 9 straight\\") which would mean scores of 7‚Äì3, 8‚Äì6, or 9‚Äì8 would all be final, while with scores of 7‚Äì6 or 8‚Äì7, play would continue. The most common streetball game is 3-on-3 played half court, though 4-on-4 and 5-on-5 full court can be found. Sometimes in a half-court game, a \\"winner's ball\\" or \\"make it, take it\\" rule is used. This means that if a team scores, it gets the ball again on offense; one team could end up never getting the ball on offense if the other team scores on every possession. Full court basketball is not played with these rules, but, in most instances, the winning team gets to choose which basketball and usually which direction (which basket) they get to use. Also, if the ball goes out of bounds players must check up. Another possible streetball feature is having an MC call the game. The MC is on the court during the game and is often very close to the players (but makes an effort to not interfere with the game) and uses a microphone to provide game commentary for the fans. One on One play If the player loses the match of a one-on-one, the losing player is given a second chance to shoot a shot at the three point line. This either results with the match continuing or if the match is close enough resulting in a tie. In a game of 1-on-1 at a close game, the game cannot end on a bank shot. If a bank shot happens on the last point of the game it is a replay of possession (refer as the \\"no bankshot\\" rule.) Another common variation to the rules is the \\"skunk\\" rule. This merely means that if a player reaches a certain point without the other player scoring, the game is over. The skunk rule limit can vary, but is often used at the score 7 to 0. Variations  21  A popular variation of street basketball is 21, also known as Hustle, American, St. Mary's, V or Varsity, Roughhouse, 33, 50 or Crunch, or \\"New York.\\" 21 is played most often with 3-5 players on a half court. However it is possible to play \\"21\\" with only two players or more. Further, in some forms, players can freely enter the game after it has begun, starting at zero points or being \\"spotted\\" the same number as the player with the lowest score. \\"21\\" is an \\"every player for himself\\" game, with highly variable rules. The rules of \\"21\\" are usually agreed by the players at the beginning of the game. The typical rules of \\"21\\" are: * one player \\"breaks\\" to begin the game by shooting from 3 point range. Sometimes players agree that the \\"break\\" must not be a successful shot, in order to give every player an equal chance at rebounding to gain the 1st possession of the game * the normal foul rule is in effect * baskets are scored as 2's and 3's (NBA Style) * after a successful shot, the shooter can take up to three 1-point free-throws (or play the \\"shoot til you miss\\" variation, where the shooter continues to shoot the ball until he misses), but as soon as he misses, the ball may be rebounded by anyone; conversely, if he makes all three free throw shots, he then gets to keep the ball and \\"check up\\" or start play again at the top of the arc * In some games 1 point free throws start at the charity stripe and then move to the 3 point line at the score 11 and so on (called 11 long or if at the 3 point line from the first score for free throws is called \\"long all day\\") * the last person with a shot attempt should be the first person to step out on defense * after any change of possession, the ball should be cleared past the 3 point line (or at times just out of the key) * in order to win, a player must make exactly 21 points; if he goes over then he restarts back at either 11, 13 or 15 points, depending on the rules in use * whoever wins the game starts with the ball at the beginning of the next game * only serious fouls are called (commonly referred to as \\"No blood, No foul\\") * other typical basketball rules, such as out-of-bounds, are also frequently ignored in the game \\"21\\"; this is to avoid confusion on possession of the ball Common additional rules include: * a player can attempt a 5-point bonus in lieu of attempting three free-throws but if the basket misses then the player won't be awarded. * if a missed shot is tipped in to the basket by another player without their feet touching the ground, then the shooter's score reverts to 0 (or 13 if their score was over 13); this rule may not apply on free-throws. (This is referred to as \\"playing with tips\\") * if a player who has 13 points misses their next shot, regardless of whether it is a free-throw, then their points revert to 0. (This is referred to as \\"poison points\\") * whoever wins the game must shoot a three-pointer in order to start with the ball at the beginning of the next game; if he makes it, he gets the three points, but doesn't have to take free-throws, and starts with the ball. * players with less than 13 points at the end of a game keep their points into the next game using the \\"handicap system\\" for when there is a wide variation in skill amongst the players. \\"21\\" is considered a very challenging game, especially because the offensive player must possibly go up against several defenders at the same time. For this reason, it is exceedingly difficult to \\"drive to the hole\\" and make lay-ups in \\"21.\\" Therefore, and also because of the emphasis on free-throws, \\"21\\" is very much a shooter's game, and because a successful shot means you keep the ball, it is possible for there to be come- backs when a player recovers from a large deficit by not missing any shots (this can also result in failure when they miss their final free-throw at 20 points and revert to 13 or 15). \\"21\\" is popular because it allows an odd number of people to play, unlike regular basketball or other variants. King of the Court Another less common streetball variant, often referred to as \\"King of the Court\\", or \\"Boston\\", results in essentially a one-on-one (or sometimes two-on-two) tournament between any number of players. Each match is played following normal one-on-one rules, including violations (such as fouls and out-of-bounds) to just one point. The winner remains on the court and gets to take the ball out while the loser returns to the end of the line of players waiting to step on the court. The first player to win a set number of matches (usually 7 or 11) wins the game.Can only take one shot per turn  H-O-R-S-E  H-O-R-S-E is a game played by two or more people on a basketball court. The goal of the game involves matching baskets. The player who makes more shots that the opponent can't duplicate, wins the game. For example: The second person shooting must match the first person's shot if it is made. If the second shooter misses, he or she receives the letter H. If the first person shot is missed, the second shooter may attempt any shot. The game continues until one person accumulates 5 letters of H-O-R-S-E.

It is the city with the tenth highest population in Borsod-Aba√∫j-Zempl√©n county and the second biggest in the Miskolc agglomeration. Location Fels≈ëzsolca is situated next to Miskolc, from the outskirts of Miskolc (the centres of the two cities are about from each other). The town is situated at the eastern tip of the B√ºkk Mountain, on the left bank of the river Saj√≥, and in the Borsod region bordered by the eastern side of Aba√∫j. The topography is flat, mildly hilly. Transport It is accessible by roads 3 and 37, by train on the Budapest-Miskolc-S√°toralja√∫jhely line, and on the Miskolc-Hidasn√©meti line. The railway station is from the town. Public transit for Fels≈ëzsolca is provided by the neighboring Transport Company of Miskolc, (MVK Zrt.) Now, one bus service, line 7, serves the citizens.

There was a lake, called Pond Priest, between Miskolc and Fels≈ëzsolca that has a legend associated with it. According to the legend, a church had sunk into the pond. The pond was pumped out in 2008, and the area has been built on. In June, 2010 an historic flood hit Fels≈ëzsolca. Out of a total of 2200, about 1800 houses were damaged, and over 200 houses collapsed. The restoration is in progress now. History The area has been inhabited since Neolithic times. The town was first mentioned in 1281 in a document about territory disputed between Zsolca and Miskolc. The document states that the border of the two towns shall always remain the river Saj√≥. In the Middle Ages Zsolca had been a prospering village until occupying Turks destroyed it. The village suffered significantly again during the revolution against the Habsburgs in 1848-49 when Russian forces (allies of the Habsburgs) burned it down. In 1867 a monument was erected commemorating the Battle of Zsolca which made the village the second place in the country where a monument for the revolution was erected. During the 20th century the county became an important industrial area, the population of Fels≈ëzsolca was growing rapidly due to its proximity to Miskolc. By 1980 it had more than 7,000 residents and in 1997 it was granted ‚Äúcity‚Äù status. Unlike many villages in the area, Fels≈ëzsolca managed to avoid being annexed by Miskolc mostly because of the river Saj√≥ which acts as a natural border between them. The two cities exist in symbiosis. Despite being a sovereign city outside the boundaries of Miskolc, Fels≈ëzsolca is directly connected to Miskolc by the bus lines of MVK Zrt., (the official Miskolc mass transport company). Before World War II, there was a Jewish community in Fels≈ëzsolca. At its height, there were 82 Jews in the community most of them were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. Ethnical groups 91% of the population has Hungarian nationality, and 9% of the inhabitants has Roma nationality. Out of this, Bulgarian and Polish minority also live in Fels≈ëzsolca.

She was launched on 20 March 1994 sponsored by Mrs. Diane C. Kent. History Tucson was originally supposed to be commissioned on 18 August 1995, however, Hurricane Felix threatened the Virginian coastline, and the U.S. Navy decided to sortie the fleet, to prevent damage to ships in port if the hurricane made landfall. Tucson was the last ship to leave port, in case the prediction for landfall changed. As it turned out, the hurricane never did make landfall, but Tucson was at sea on 18 August. Upon returning to port, the commissioning ceremony was quickly rescheduled for 19 September 1995. At the new commissioning ceremony, the commanding officer, Commander Duane M. Baker, declared that for the next two hours, it was officially 18 August. In June 1996, Tucson was struck by the Military Sealift Command vehicle cargo ship while moored in port at Newport News. A sudden windstorm caused Gilliland to break free from her mooring and cross the harbor, colliding with Tucson and the destroyer damagecontrolmuseums.org USS DEYO (DD 989) and USNS GILLILAND (T-AKR 298), Collision, June 1996 moored behind her. While Deyo suffered the most damage, Tucson suffered minor damage to her AN/BRA-34 antenna. From September 1996 to October 1996, Tucson changed her home port. Tucson left Norfolk, Virginia, passed through the Panama Canal and stopped in San Diego, California for five days. VIPs from Tucson, Arizona, were allowed to ride on three separate short cruises, and then busloads of tourists from the city of Tucson came for tours of the submarine while in port. Following this port visit, Tucson continued on to arrive in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Tucson left for her first deployment ever, to the Western Pacific Ocean, in February 1998. At that time, tensions between the United Nations and Iraq had escalated drastically. In the 30 days leading up to departure, the government of Iraq had blocked access to the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and had withdrawn cooperation with the UNSCOM monitoring teams. The ship traveled as far west as the Persian Gulf before returning to Pearl Harbor in August 1998. It was during this period of time that the PBS series Nova filmed the episode \\"Battlegroups\\" aboard Tucson. On 19 May 2004, Tucson departed for a Western Pacific deployment.

The home video also features a performance with former guitarist Dave Mustaine on March 19, 1983, shortly before his ousting from the band for heavy drug and alcohol abuse. The video is a retrospective on the 3 and a half years that Cliff Burton was in Metallica, presented as a collection of bootleg footage shot by fans, some professional filming and TV shots that were never used and some of his best bass solos, personal photos and live concerts. Photos and narrations by the band (Ulrich, Hetfield and Hammett drinking beer) are placed between songs, which focus on Burton before fading into a title card of a performance. The video ends with the melodic interlude of \\"Orion\\" as pictures of Burton are shown. With this video, the band tries to show the unique personality and style he had. While ostensibly the film focuses on Burton, it also has given fans a rare glimpse of Metallica's less-documented early career.

The population of the civil parish (including Whitwell Common) taken at the 2011 Census was 3,900. Although Whitwell celebrated its 1,000th anniversary in the 'Whitwell 1000' celebrations of 1989, it is much older than this celebration suggests. The earliest written references to Whitwell are from the Anglo-Saxon charters. However, many of its historical sites predate this period. Within the parish are several Iron Age burial mounds, an Iron Age fort and settlement, the remains of a Roman villa, medieval field systems, and both a Norman and Saxon church. The World Heritage Site of Creswell Crags was until recently within the parish. Whitwell Old Hall is a medieval manor house. Whitwell is a thriving village with strong community spirit. The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club. Although being quite a small village, Whitwell has six public houses. It previously had as many as 11. The current pubs are the Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Working Men's Club), New Middle Club, The Boot And Shoe, The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer just outside the village is La Farge Works (formerly Steetley Company), which run a quarry which supplies limestone and other products all around the world. View over Whitwell Whitwell Wood Whitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long-term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The spring is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A Three Shires Oak once stood in a field beside Whitwell Wood, traditionally marking the meeting point of the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire.  Whitwell Gap (Hwitan Wylles Geat) ‚Äì Creswell Crags  Until Creswell village was developed by the colliery company in the late 19th Century, Creswell Crags was known locally as Whitwell Crags. Until this time, there were only a few farms around the entrance to the Crags. The nearest Anglo-Saxon villages were Whitwell, Elmton and Thorpe (Salvin). According to a local resident whose relatives lived in the farms close to the Crags, Creswell was only the name of the farm nearest to the new colliery site, and used as a drop off point for materials used in the building of the colliery. The original name of the Crags (Whitwell Crags) may be the location referred to by the Anglo Saxon poets who recorded King Alfred's grandson, King Edmund, conquering the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls in 942 AD, reaching as far as Dore & \\"Hwitan Wylles Geat\\" (the Whitwell Gap). Whitwell Gap would have to be a significant landscape feature to warrant mention in an Anglo Saxon chronicle, and be easily identifiable. Famous Whitwellians One of Whitwell's most famous sons was Joe Davis, world snooker and billiards champion from the 1920s to the 1940s. His Whitwell home (on Welbeck Street) bears a plaque commemorating him. Les Jackson, England cricketer and Wisden Cricketer of the YearLes Jackson at CricketArchive.com in 1959, played for Whitwell Cricket Club and came to watch their games on a Saturday afternoon until his death in 2007. Also from the village are Chris Adams, the Sussex and England cricketer and Ian Bennett, a professional goalkeeper who currently plays for Huddersfield Town, whose family still lives in the village. Celebrated Great War poet William Streets was also from the village. The village is the birthplace and childhood home of J. T. Edson the author, whose various escapism-adventure series sold over 27 million copies globally; the Edson family lived in Whitwell from Victorian times.

Some geologists use the term plutonic rock synonymously with intrusive rock but other geologists subdivide intrusive rock, by crystal size, into coarse-grained plutonic rock (typically formed deeper in the Earth's crust in batholiths and other plutons) and medium- grained subvolcanic or hypabyssal rock (typically formed higher in the crust in dikes and sills). Formation Intrusive rock forms within Earth's crust from the crystallization of magma. Many mountain ranges, such as the Sierra Nevada in California, are formed mostly from large granite (or related rock) intrusions; see Sierra Nevada batholith. Related forms Intrusions are one of the two ways igneous rock can form; the other is extrusive rock, that is, a volcanic eruption or similar event. Technically speaking, an intrusion is any formation of intrusive igneous rock; rock formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of the planet. In contrast, an extrusion consists of extrusive rock; rock formed above the surface of the crust. Related terms Large bodies of magma that solidify underground before they reach the surface of the crust are called plutons. Plutonic rocks form 7% of the Earth's current land surface. Coarse-grained intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the earth are called abyssal while those that form near the surface are called subvolcanic or hypabyssal. Intrusive structures are often classified according to whether or not they are parallel to the bedding planes or foliation of the country rock: if the intrusion is parallel the body is concordant, otherwise it is discordant. Intrusive suite An intrusive suite is a group of plutons related in time and space.Glazner, Allen F., Stock, Greg M. (2010) Geology Underfoot in Yosemite.

Variations Intrusions vary widely, from mountain-range-sized batholiths to thin veinlike fracture fillings of aplite or pegmatite. Structural types Diagram showing various types of igneous intrusion country rock, Baranof Island, Alaska, United States Intrusions can be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes: :Batholith: a large irregular discordant intrusion :Chonolith: an irregularly-shaped intrusion with a demonstrable base :Cupola: a dome-shaped projection from the top of a large subterranean intrusion :Dike: a relatively narrow tabular discordant body, often nearly vertical :Laccolith: concordant body with roughly flat base and convex top, usually with a feeder pipe below :Lopolith: concordant body with roughly flat top and a shallow convex base, may have a feeder dike or pipe below :Phacolith: a concordant lens-shaped pluton that typically occupies the crest of an anticline or trough of a syncline :Volcanic pipe or volcanic neck: tubular roughly vertical body that may have been a feeder vent for a volcano :Sill: a relatively thin tabular concordant body intruded along bedding planes :Stock: a smaller irregular discordant intrusive :Boss: a small stock  Characteristics  An intrusion (pink Notch Peak monzonite) inter-fingers (partly as a dike) with highly metamorphosed black-and-white-striped host rock (Cambrian carbonate rocks) near Notch Peak, House Range, Utah A body of intrusive igneous rock which crystallizes from magma cooling underneath the surface of the Earth is called a pluton. If the pluton is large, it may be called a batholith or a stock.Intrusive and Extrusive Rocks: Intrusive and Extrusive Rocks, accessdate: March 28, 2017. Intrusive rocks are characterized by large crystal sizes, and as the individual crystals are visible, the rock is called phaneritic. This is formed as the magma cools underground, and while cooling may be fast or slow,Sciencing: Characteristics of Intrusive Rocks Sciencing, accessdate: March 28, 2017. cooling is slower than on the surface, so larger crystals grow. If it runs parallel to rock layers, it is called a sill. If an intrusion makes rocks above rise to form a dome, it is called a laccolith. How deep-seated intrusions burst through the overlying strata cause intrusive rock to be characterised: Veins spread out into branches, or branchlike parts result from filled cracks, and the high temperature is evident in how they alter country rock. As heat dissipation is slow, and as the rock is under pressure, crystals form, and no vitreous rapidly chilled matter is present. The intrusions did not flow while solidifying, hence do not show lines. Contained gases could not escape through the thick strata, thus they form cavities, which can often be observed. Because their crystals are of roughly equal size, these rocks are said to be equigranular.rocks and minerals: Geology - rocks and minerals, accessdate: March 28, 2017. There is typically no distinction between a first generation of large well-shaped crystals and a fine-grained ground-mass. The minerals of each have formed in a definite order, and each has had a period of crystallization that may be very distinct or may have coincided with or overlapped the period of formation of some of the other ingredients. Earlier crystals originated at a time when most of the rock was still liquid and are more or less perfect. Later crystals are less regular in shape because they were compelled to occupy the spaces left between the already-formed crystals. The former case is said to be idiomorphic (or automorphic); the latter is xenomorphic. There are also many other characteristics that serve to distinguish the members of these two groups. For example, orthoclase is typically feldspar from granite, while its modifications occur in lavas of similar composition. The same distinction holds for nepheline varieties. Leucite is common in lavas but very rare in plutonic rocks. Muscovite is confined to intrusions. These differences show the influence of the physical conditions under which consolidation takes place. Intrusive rocks formed at greater depths are called plutonic or abyssal. Some intrusive rocks solidified in fissures as dikes and intrusive sills at shallow depth and are called subvolcanic or hypabyssal. They show structures intermediate between those of extrusive and plutonic rocks. They are very commonly porphyritic, vitreous, and sometimes even vesicular. In fact, many of them are petrologically indistinguishable from lavas of similar composition.

Description The tompot blenny is a relatively large blenny with an elongated body, large head and large eyes which grows to up to in length. The eyes are bicoloured with their top part being brown and the bottom part is white. There is a single branched tentacle over each of its eyes. It is mainly yellow-brown in colour, although occasionally it is greenish and is marked with at least seven dark bars starting at the dorsal fin and which reach the belly. As well as the tentacles over the eyes there are also tentacles over the nostrils. The lateral line is continuous but becomes broken towards the tail. The breeding males become chocolate brown in colour and develop bulb-like glands on the spines of the anal fin. The dorsal fin runs the length of its body and is divided into two halves by a shallow notch. The anterior portion of the fin is contains the spiny rays while the posterior portion contains the soft rays. The dorsal fin has 13-14 spines and 17-20 ray while the anal fin has 2 spines and 19-23 rays. It has relatively large pectoral fins. Each individual has a unique set of markings on the scales of the face which mean that studies of their biology can identify individuals. Distribution The tompot blenny is found along the Atlantic coast of Europe from southern England and Ireland to Morocco. It is also found throughout the Mediterranean Sea to the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. In Great Britain it is mainly recorded off the south and west coasts and is largely absent from the North Sea coasts, although it has been seen on wrecks off the North Norfolk coast. and off eastern Scotland as far north as the Shetland Islands. Pseudocapillaria bainae, parasite of Parablennius gattorugine. Caudal extremity of the male Habitat and biology Habitat Tompot blennies are very territorial and their territories are centred around a crevice in the rocky reef which the fish uses for shelter. They occur in shallow seas at depths of although smaller specimens occur in rockpools. They may be found above the low tide mark at very low tides, sheltering under boulders or among exposed vegetation. Feeding Tompot blennies have sharp, comb-like teeth which they use to scrape food from the substrate. They feed on sea anemones and on other invertebrates such as prawns and other crustaceans. They are crepuscular, being active mainly at dawn and at dusk. Parasites As most fish, tompot blennies harbour several species of parasites, including the capillariid Nematode Pseudocapillaria bainae. This parasite has been found in the intestine of specimens caught off Italy and Montenegro.Justine, J.-L. & Radujkoviƒá, B. M. (1988). Capillaria bainae n. sp. (Nematoda: Capillariinae) parasite du Poisson Parablennius gattorugine en mer Adriatique. Bulletin du Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle. Paris, 4¬∞ S√©rie, 10 (A), 15-24. Its biology is unknown.Moravec, F. (2001). Trichinelloid nematodes parasitic in cold-blooded vertebrates. Praha: Academia. Parablennius gattorugine Breeding Tompot blennies spawn in March to May the males mate with a number of females and guards their eggs. The eggs are demersal and like those of all blennies they stick to the substrate by a filamentous adhesive patch. The male guards the eggs until the larvae hatch, usually about a month after laying. The males defend their territories from other males and often fight each other, frequently receiving injuries. When breeding the males develop pale cauliflower like glands on their anal fins which are believed to play a role in attracting females and in cleaning the eggs. Name The specific name was first used by Francis Willughby in 1688 after he had observed these blennies in Venice and heard them called gatto ruggine which he translated as \\"rusty cat\\" or \\"rust colour\\", although he was afraid that he did not fully understand the name. However the actual name is ' or gotto rosula which is a local name for blennies in general along the Adriatic coast of Italy and which is a diminutive of gotto roso meaning \\"thick throat\\". Miscellany In the mid-1990s there was a minor acoustic indie-folk band called Tompot Blenny, who released a few E.P.s in the 1990s and a full album called Found under Blankets in 2000.

A politician, he was appointed as a county judge and later served two terms in the United States Congress, representing Otsego County and central New York. He was the father of James Fenimore Cooper, who became a noted writer of historical novels related to the New York frontier. Life William Cooper was born in 1754 in a log house in Smithfield (now Somerton) in the Province of Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, the son of English Quaker parents, James Cooper (b. Byberry, Philadelphia, 1729‚Äì1795) and Hannah (Hibbs) Cooper. He appears to have first worked as a wheelwright in and around Byberry. There is no record of his attending school. He later settled in Burlington, New Jersey, a Quaker city. Marriage and family On December 12, 1774, in Burlington, he was married by a civil magistrate to Elizabeth Fenimore, daughter of Richard Fenimore, a Quaker of Rancocas. Career During the early 1780s, Cooper became a storekeeper in Burlington, New Jersey, located along the Delaware River. By the end of the decade, he was a successful land speculator and wealthy frontier developer in what is now Otsego County, New York. Soon after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, he acquired a tract of land several thousand acres in extent within the borders of New York state and lying along the head waters of the Susquehanna River at Otsego Lake. He founded the Village of Otsego at the foot of the lake in 1786, creating a traditional plan for the village inspired by that of Burlington. He moved his family there, arriving on November 10, 1790. The judge and other investors also founded De Kalb, New York, near the east end of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, in 1803, platting approximately 64,000 acres and selling the parcels on. His brother James took care of the holdings, which were tied up in litigation for years, both before and after the death of Judge Cooper in 1809. The Cooper family holdings were all gone by 1817. In 1852 a village was named Cooper's Falls north of De Kalb. James stayed in the area, and his son William grew up in De Kalb and was a carpenter. The existing De Kalb Historical Society building was built by the judge's nephew, William, and some of his descendants may still live in the area. After 1791, when Otsego County was split off from Montgomery County, Cooper was appointed as a county judge. He was later elected to two terms in Congress, representing the Federalist Party in the 4th (March 4, 1795 ‚Äì March 3, 1797) and the 6th United States Congresses (March 4, 1799 ‚Äì March 3, 1801). In 1796, Cooper determined to make his home permanently in the town he had founded, which by that time promised to become a thriving settlement. It attracted many land-hungry migrants from New England. He began the construction of a mansion, completed in 1799, which he named Otsego Hall. For many years it served as his manor house; it was by far the most spacious and stately private residence in central New York. Cooper family tradition has it that Judge Cooper was killed by a blow to the head sustained during an argument with a political opponent after a public meeting in Albany, New York on December 22, 1809. No evidence of this can be found, and the story appeared to arise in 1897. A great-grandson of the judge published this account, which historians consider implausible. They believe that Judge Cooper died of natural causes. Cooper was buried at the Episcopal Christ Churchyard in Cooperstown. His son James Fenimore Cooper, a popular author of historical novels, was buried there many years later. A great- grandson, Paul F. Clark, became a Nebraska State Representative. A 2xgreat- grandson, writer Paul Fenimore Cooper, is known for the children's adventure, Tal: His Marvelous Adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom (1929, reprint 1957 and 2001).

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,503, virtually unchanged from 1,504 at the 2001 census.Office for National Statistics: Kettering (Non-Metropolitan District) Retrieved 9 November 2009 The village contains an Eleanor cross. The monument dates from 1294, when the crosses were raised as a memorial by Edward I (1239‚Äì1307) to his late wife, Eleanor of Castile (1241‚Äì1290). There were originally 12 monuments, one in each resting place of the funeral procession as they travelled to Westminster Abbey. The Geddington cross is one of only three Eleanor crosses still standing; the other two being in Hardingstone (near Northampton) and Waltham Cross, although remnants and reconstructions of the lost ones can also be seen at other sites. The village was also formerly home to a Royal hunting lodge which was used as a base by monarchs for hunting within the Royal forest of Rockingham. The building has subsequently been lost; however, the \\"King's Door\\" within the church of St Mary Magdalene, Geddington in the village remains, it was the entrance through which the King could enter the building while staying at the lodge. The old main road runs through the village and crosses the River Ise by a spectacular mediaeval bridge. The bridge, built in 1250, has five arches and three pedestrian refuges. A more recent ford also runs alongside the bridge. The village is famous for its annual boxing day squirt in which a barrel attached to a rope across the river is squirted from one side of the ford to the other by competing fire crews from Geddington and Kettering. Geddington has two public houses and a small post office/ newsagents that is open on a part-time basis. Transport The nearest mainline railway station is Kettering railway station, a distance of from the village. Corby railway station is from the village. There is a partial cycle path from the village to the nearby town of Kettering and the village of Weekley, however cycling remains an underused mode of transportation.

A member of the second generation of the Hudson River School of artists, Kensett's signature works are landscape paintings of New England and New York State, whose clear light and serene surfaces celebrate transcendental qualities of nature, and are associated with Luminism. Kensett's early work owed much to the influence of Thomas Cole, but was from the outset distinguished by a preference for cooler colors and an interest in less dramatic topography, favoring restraint in both palette and composition.Barringer and Wilton, 25 The work of Kensett's maturity features tranquil scenery depicted with a spare geometry, culminating in series of paintings in which coastal promontories are balanced against glass-smooth water.Barringer and Wilton, 204‚Äì209 He was a founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Biography He was born on March 22, 1816. Kensett attended school at Cheshire Academy, and studied engraving with his immigrant father, Thomas Kensett, and later with his uncle, Alfred Daggett. He worked as engraver in the New Haven area until about 1838, then went to work as a bank note engraver in New York City. In 1840, along with Asher Durand and John William Casilear, Kensett traveled to Europe in order to study painting. There he met and traveled with Benjamin Champney. The two sketched and painted throughout Europe, refining their talents. During this period, Kensett developed an appreciation and affinity for 17th century Dutch landscape painting. Kensett and Champney returned to the United States in 1847. Postcard c. 1914, of Contentment Island. By the early 1870s Kensett was spending considerable time at his home on Contentment Island, on Long Island Sound near Darien, Connecticut. Established studio Kensett painting in his studio, ca. 1866 After establishing his studio and settling in New York, Kensett traveled extensively throughout the Northeast and the Colorado Rockies as well as making several trips back to Europe. Kensett is best known for his landscape of upstate New York and New England and seascapes of coastal New Jersey, Long Island and New England. He is most closely associated with the \\"second generation\\" of the Hudson River School. Along with Sanford Robinson Gifford, Fitz Henry Lane, Jasper Francis Cropsey, Martin Johnson Heade and others, the works of the \\"Luminists\\", as they came to be known, were characterized by unselfconscious, nearly invisible brushstrokes used to convey the qualities and effects of atmospheric light. Such effects stemmed from Transcendentalist philosophies of sublime nature and contemplation bringing one closer to a spiritual truth. In 1848 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1849. In 1851 Kensett painted a monumental canvas of Mount Washington that has become an icon of White Mountain art. Mount Washington from the Valley of Conway was purchased by the American Art Union, made into an engraving by James Smillie, and distributed to 13,000 Art Union subscribers throughout the country. Other artists painted copies of this scene from the print. Currier and Ives published a similar print in about 1860. This single painting by Kensett helped to popularize the White Mountain region of New Hampshire. Kensett's style evolved gradually, from the traditional Hudson River School manner in the 1850s into the more refined Luminist style in his later years. By the early 1870s Kensett was spending considerable time at his home on Contentment Island, on Long Island Sound near Darien, Connecticut. It was during this time that Kensett painted some of his finest works. Many of these were spare and luminist seascapes, the prime example being Eaton's Neck, Long Island (1872) now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The artist was widely acclaimed and financially successful during his lifetime. In turn, he was generous in support of the arts and artists. He was a full member of the National Academy of Design, the founder and president of the Artists' Fund Society, and a founder and trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Death Kensett contracted pneumonia (perhaps during the attempted rescue of Mary Lydia (Hancock) Colyer, the wife of his friend and fellow artist Vincent Colyer in Long Island Sound) and died of heart failure at his New York studio in December 1872. Kensett is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. In 1874 Kensett's brother Thomas gave thirty- eight of his paintings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of which half remain in the collection.Barringer and Wilton, 208 Legacy The first complete biography and factual study of Kensett's work was written by Ellen H.

The AEU is Australia's third largest trade union, with 191,221 registered members in 2018, consisting of educators who work in public schools, colleges, early childhood and vocational settings in all states and territories of Australia. Members include teachers and allied educational staff, principals and administrators mainly in government school and TAFE systems. Teachers working in the private schools system are covered by the Independent Education Union of Australia (IEU). In some states the AEU shares coverage of some members with the National Tertiary Education Union, Community and Public Sector Union and United Workers Union. Through the Federation of Education Unions, the AEU works closely with the two other Federal unions which cover educators in non-government schools and universities. The AEU is also internationally affiliated to the Education International, which the AEU claims is \\"the largest non-government organisation in the world.\\" National organisation The Federal Office sees its core business as, \\"the maintenance of comprehensive industrial protection and representation through industrial awards and agreements in all industrial tribunals in Australia. This involves industrial research, negotiation and advocacy over a wide range of matters including salaries and teaching and learning conditions.\\" History In the 19th century the Colonial governments, which would later form the Commonwealth of Australia as states, established a variety of state schools. These schools were both demanded by the Australian trade union and labour movement, for the free education of the working class, and also used as a way to control the education and free time of the children of the Australian working class. Schools systems were highly stratified, with most children only receiving infants or primary education. Selection for Technical or Academic high school was highly competitive, and biased towards the children of agriculturalists, industrialists, business owners and professionals. Teachers were low-paid government employees and controlled by a series of moral codes that restricted their professional, personal and sexual conduct. Teachers were primarily educated in Technical colleges, fully funded by the governments, and indentured to Government employment in rural or remote districts for a long period. Buildings and teaching materials were notoriously bad, and often resulted in injuries to teachers or children. University educated teachers were a rarity, and tended to go into the private schools system. The private school system itself was split between two main groups: a British-style system of schools for the elite, and a massively underfunded Catholic church-run system. The Catholic education system usually shared the poor working and teaching conditions of the state schools. During the 1950s teachers in the state school system became more unionised and better organised. These women and men had received free University education on the condition that they teach in the state school system, or had received University training as a result of their status as Second World War veterans and had chosen to teach. These teachers, and those following them, campaigned to increase teacher's salaries, to transform the structure of Australian education, and to improve the curriculum. This militancy achieved its peak in the 1970s when teachers won salaries equivalent to state parliament backbenchers, a massive and systemic initiative for building improvements, and massive curriculum reform. The Australian Teachers Union was established in 1984, and following a series of union mergers with the ACT Teachers' Federation, the Northern Territory Teachers' Federation, the South Australian Institute of Teachers and the Australian Teachers' Federation, changed its name to the Australian Education Union in 1993. Indigenous education The AEU has a designated Indigenous position on its Federal Executive, an Indigenous observer position on the AEU TAFE Executive, and runs an annual seminar on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education. In 2010, the AEU made a submissionAEU submission on the draft 'Indigenous Education Action Plan 2010‚Äì2014' (authorised by Angelo Gavrielatos, AEU Federal President) to the Australian Government's draft Indigenous Education Action Plan 2010‚Äì2014. The submission included 40 recommendations on improving Indigenous education, and stated: \\"The realistic timeframe that should be considered to achieve outcomes for Indigenous people equal to the rest of the community is to focus on the outcomes that should be expected for the children to be born in 20 to 25 years from today\\".

The Smith normal form of a matrix is diagonal, and can be obtained from the original matrix by multiplying on the left and right by invertible square matrices. In particular, the integers are a PID, so one can always calculate the Smith normal form of an integer matrix. The Smith normal form is very useful for working with finitely generated modules over a PID, and in particular for deducing the structure of a quotient of a free module. It is named after the British mathematician Henry John Stephen Smith. Definition Let A be a nonzero m√ón matrix over a principal ideal domain R. There exist invertible m \\\\times m and n \\\\times n-matrices S, T such that the product S A T is \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha_1 & 0 & 0 & & \\\\cdots & & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\alpha_2 & 0 & & \\\\cdots & & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\ddots & & & & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & & & \\\\alpha_r & & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & & 0 & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & & & \\\\ddots & \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & & & \\\\cdots & & & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. and the diagonal elements \\\\alpha_i satisfy \\\\alpha_i \\\\mid \\\\alpha_{i+1}\\\\;\\\\forall\\\\;1 \\\\le i < r. This is the Smith normal form of the matrix A. The elements \\\\alpha_i are unique up to multiplication by a unit and are called the elementary divisors, invariants, or invariant factors. They can be computed (up to multiplication by a unit) as : \\\\alpha_i = \\\\frac{d_i(A)}{d_{i-1}(A)}, where d_i(A) (called i-th determinant divisor) equals the greatest common divisor of all i\\\\times i minors of the matrix A and d_0(A):=1.  Algorithm  The first goal is to find invertible square matrices S and T such that the product S A T is diagonal. This is the hardest part of the algorithm. Once diagonality is achieved, it becomes relatively easy to put the matrix into Smith normal form. Phrased more abstractly, the goal is to show that, thinking of A as a map from R^n (the free R-module of rank n) to R^m (the free R-module of rank m), there are isomorphisms S:R^m \\\\to R^m and T:R^n \\\\to R^n such that S \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot T has the simple form of a diagonal matrix. The matrices S and T can be found by starting out with identity matrices of the appropriate size, and modifying S each time a row operation is performed on A in the algorithm by the corresponding column operation (for example, if row i is added to row j of A, then column j should be subtracted from column i of S to retain the product invariant), and similarly modifying T for each column operation performed. Since row operations are left-multiplications and column operations are right- multiplications, this preserves the invariant A'=S'\\\\cdot A\\\\cdot T' where A',S',T' denote current values and A denotes the original matrix; eventually the matrices in this invariant become diagonal. Only invertible row and column operations are performed, which ensures that S and T remain invertible matrices. For a in R \\\\ {0}, write Œ¥(a) for the number of prime factors of a (these exist and are unique since any PID is also a unique factorization domain). In particular, R is also a B√©zout domain, so it is a gcd domain and the gcd of any two elements satisfies a B√©zout's identity. To put a matrix into Smith normal form, one can repeatedly apply the following, where t loops from 1 to m. Step I: Choosing a pivot Choose jt to be the smallest column index of A with a non-zero entry, starting the search at column index jt-1+1 if t > 1\\\\. We wish to have a_{t,j_t} eq0; if this is the case this step is complete, otherwise there is by assumption some k with a_{k,j_t} eq 0, and we can exchange rows t and k, thereby obtaining a_{t,j_t} eq0. Our chosen pivot is now at position (t, jt). Step II: Improving the pivot If there is an entry at position (k,jt) such that a_{t,j_t} mid a_{k,j_t}, then, letting \\\\beta =\\\\gcd\\\\left(a_{t,j_t}, a_{k,j_t}\\\\right), we know by the B√©zout property that there exist œÉ, œÑ in R such that : a_{t,j_t} \\\\cdot \\\\sigma + a_{k,j_t} \\\\cdot \\\\tau=\\\\beta. By left-multiplication with an appropriate invertible matrix L, it can be achieved that row t of the matrix product is the sum of œÉ times the original row t and œÑ times the original row k, that row k of the product is another linear combination of those original rows, and that all other rows are unchanged. Explicitly, if œÉ and œÑ satisfy the above equation, then for \\\\alpha=a_{t,j_t}/\\\\beta and \\\\gamma=a_{k,j_t}/\\\\beta (which divisions are possible by the definition of Œ≤) one has : \\\\sigma\\\\cdot \\\\alpha + \\\\tau \\\\cdot \\\\gamma=1, so that the matrix : L_0= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\sigma & \\\\tau \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\gamma & \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} is invertible, with inverse : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & -\\\\tau \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\sigma \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} . Now L can be obtained by fitting L_0 into rows and columns t and k of the identity matrix. By construction the matrix obtained after left-multiplying by L has entry Œ≤ at position (t,jt) (and due to our choice of Œ± and Œ≥ it also has an entry 0 at position (k,jt), which is useful though not essential for the algorithm). This new entry Œ≤ divides the entry a_{t,j_t} that was there before, and so in particular \\\\delta(\\\\beta) < \\\\delta(a_{t,j_t}); therefore repeating these steps must eventually terminate. One ends up with a matrix having an entry at position (t,jt) that divides all entries in column jt. Step III: Eliminating entries Finally, adding appropriate multiples of row t, it can be achieved that all entries in column jt except for that at position (t,jt) are zero. This can be achieved by left-multiplication with an appropriate matrix. However, to make the matrix fully diagonal we need to eliminate nonzero entries on the row of position (t,jt) as well. This can be achieved by repeating the steps in Step II for columns instead of rows, and using multiplication on the right by the transpose of the obtained matrix L. In general this will result in the zero entries from the prior application of Step III becoming nonzero again. However, notice that each application of Step II for either rows or columns must continue to reduce the value of \\\\delta(a_{t,j_t}), and so the process must eventually stop after some number of iterations, leading to a matrix where the entry at position (t,jt) is the only non-zero entry in both its row and column. At this point, only the block of A to the lower right of (t,jt) needs to be diagonalized, and conceptually the algorithm can be applied recursively, treating this block as a separate matrix. In other words, we can increment t by one and go back to Step I. Final step Applying the steps described above to the remaining non-zero columns of the resulting matrix (if any), we get an m \\\\times n-matrix with column indices j_1 < \\\\ldots < j_r where r \\\\le \\\\min(m,n). The matrix entries (l,j_l) are non-zero, and every other entry is zero. Now we can move the null columns of this matrix to the right, so that the nonzero entries are on positions (i,i) for 1 \\\\le i\\\\le r. For short, set \\\\alpha_i for the element at position (i,i). The condition of divisibility of diagonal entries might not be satisfied. For any index i for which \\\\alpha_i mid\\\\alpha_{i+1}, one can repair this shortcoming by operations on rows and columns i and i+1 only: first add column i+1 to column i to get an entry \\\\alpha_{i+1} in column i without disturbing the entry \\\\alpha_i at position (i,i), and then apply a row operation to make the entry at position (i,i) equal to \\\\beta=\\\\gcd(\\\\alpha_i,\\\\alpha_{i+1}) as in Step II; finally proceed as in Step III to make the matrix diagonal again. Since the new entry at position (i+1,i+1) is a linear combination of the original \\\\alpha_i,\\\\alpha_{i+1}, it is divisible by Œ≤. The value \\\\delta(\\\\alpha_1)+\\\\cdots+\\\\delta(\\\\alpha_r) does not change by the above operation (it is Œ¥ of the determinant of the upper r\\\\times r submatrix), whence that operation does diminish (by moving prime factors to the right) the value of :\\\\sum_{j=1}^r(r-j)\\\\delta(\\\\alpha_j). So after finitely many applications of this operation no further application is possible, which means that we have obtained \\\\alpha_1\\\\mid\\\\alpha_2\\\\mid\\\\cdots\\\\mid\\\\alpha_r as desired. Since all row and column manipulations involved in the process are invertible, this shows that there exist invertible m \\\\times m and n \\\\times n-matrices S, T so that the product S A T satisfies the definition of a Smith normal form. In particular, this shows that the Smith normal form exists, which was assumed without proof in the definition.  Applications  The Smith normal form is useful for computing the homology of a chain complex when the chain modules of the chain complex are finitely generated. For instance, in topology, it can be used to compute the homology of a simplicial complex or CW complex over the integers, because the boundary maps in such a complex are just integer matrices. It can also be used to determine the invariant factors that occur in the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, which includes the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups. The Smith normal form is also used in control theory to compute transmission and blocking zeros of a transfer function matrix.  Example  As an example, we will find the Smith normal form of the following matrix over the integers. : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -6 & 6 & 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 10 & -4 & -16 \\\\end{pmatrix} The following matrices are the intermediate steps as the algorithm is applied to the above matrix. : \\\\to \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -6 & 18 & 24 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 10 & -24& -36 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\to \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 18 & 24 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -24& -36 \\\\end{pmatrix} : \\\\to \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 18 & 24 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -6 & -12 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\to \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 6 & 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 18 & 24 \\\\end{pmatrix} : \\\\to \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 6 & 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -12 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\to \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 6 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 12 \\\\end{pmatrix} So the Smith normal form is : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 6 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 12 \\\\end{pmatrix} and the invariant factors are 2, 6 and 12.  Similarity  The Smith normal form can be used to determine whether or not matrices with entries over a common field are similar. Specifically two matrices A and B are similar if and only if the characteristic matrices xI-A and xI-B have the same Smith normal form. For example, with : \\\\begin{align} A & {} =\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, & & \\\\mbox{SNF}(xI-A) =\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & (x-1)^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\ B & {} =\\\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, & & \\\\mbox{SNF}(xI-B) =\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & (x-1)^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & {} =\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\end{bmatrix}, & & \\\\mbox{SNF}(xI-C) =\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & (x-1)(x-2) \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{align} A and B are similar because the Smith normal form of their characteristic matrices match, but are not similar to C because the Smith normal form of the characteristic matrices do not match.

Over more than half a century, he recorded several thousand sessions, with musicians including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Lee Morgan, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, Horace Silver and Grant Green. He worked with many different record companies, and recorded almost every session on Blue Note Records from 1953 to 1967. He worked on albums including John Coltrane's A Love Supreme, Miles Davis's Walkin', Herbie Hancock's Maiden Voyage, Sonny Rollins's Saxophone Colossus, and Horace Silver's Song for My Father. He is regarded as one of the most influential engineers in jazz.[ \\"Rudy Van Gelder\\"] by Steve Huey for AllMusic.com; accessed 31 July 2007 Early life Van Gelder was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. His parents, Louis Van Gelder and the former Sarah Cohen, ran a women's clothing store in Passaic. His interest in microphones and electronics can be traced to a youthful enthusiasm for amateur radio. He was also a longtime jazz fan. His uncle, for whom Rudy was named, had been the drummer for Ted Lewis's band in the mid-1930s. Van Gelder took lessons on the trumpet.Skea, Dan (2002). \\"Rudy Van Gelder in Hackensack: Defining the Jazz Sound in the 1950s\\". Musicological Studies 71/72, Spring 2001‚ÄìSpring 2002. pp. 54‚Äì76, 56, 57. Van Gelder trained as an optometrist at Philadelphia's Pennsylvania College of Optometry because he did not think he could earn a living as a recording engineer.\\"Rudy Van Gelder\\" , Biographical article at the All About Jazz website, 1 December 2007 He received an O.D. degree from the institution in 1946. Thereafter, Van Gelder maintained an optometry practice in Teaneck, New Jersey until 1959.\\"Remembering Rudy Van Gelder, OD‚Äô46\\", salus.edu, August 31, 2016. Career In the evenings after work, Van Gelder recorded local musicians who wanted 78-rpm recordings of their work. From 1946, Van Gelder recorded in his parents' house in Hackensack, New Jersey, in which a control room was built adjacent to the living room, which served as the musicians' performing area.Davis, Miles, with Quincy Troupe (1989). Miles: The Autobiography, New York: Simon and Schuster. . See pp. 176‚Äì177 on Van Gelder's recording studio in Hackensack. The dry acoustics of this working space were partly responsible for Van Gelder's inimitable recording aesthetic.Eastwood, M. \\"Rudy Van Gelder\\", Eastwood Records: Mini Blog', London, 31 August 2016 \\"When I first started, I was interested in improving the quality of the playback equipment I had,\\" Van Gelder commented in 2005; \\"I never was really happy with what I heard. I always assumed the records made by the big companies sounded better than what I could reproduce. So that's how I got interested in the process. I acquired everything I could to play back audio: speakers, turntables, amplifiers\\".Forlenza, Jeff (2005). \\"Who Cares About Quality? Rudy Van Gelder!\\" Mix, 1 May. One of Van Gelder's friends, the baritone saxophonist Gil Mell√©, introduced him to Alfred Lion, a producer for Blue Note Records, in 1953. In the 1950s, Van Gelder performed engineering and mastering for the classical label Vox Records.Vox LP liner notes and dead wax (matrix) stamps and etchings, LPs STPL 58.520, STPL 514.070, STPL 512.730, STPL 510.330, STPL 511.110.\\"Rudy Van Gelder\\" , Biographical article at the All About Jazz website, 1 December 2007 He became a full-time recording engineer in 1959. In 1959, he moved the Van Gelder Studio to a larger purpose-built facility in Englewood Cliffs, a few miles southeast of the original location.Gitler, Ira (2001). \\"Vangelder's Studio\\". JazzTimes, April. An obituarist in the London Daily Telegraph wrote of \\"Van Gelder's extreme fastidiousness\\" as an engineer, and his insistence on \\"no food or drink in the studio, and on no account was anyone to touch a microphone. He himself always wore gloves when handling equipment\\". Later career Though his output slowed, Van Gelder remained active as a recording engineer into the new century. In the late 1990s he worked as a recording engineer for some of the songs featured on the soundtrack to the TV Show Cowboy Bebop. From 1999, he remastered the analog Blue Note recordings he made several decades earlier into 24-bit digital recordings in its RVG Edition series. He was positive about the switch from analog to digital technology. He told Audio magazine in 1995: > The biggest distorter is the LP itself. I've made thousands of LP masters. I > used to make 17 a day, with two lathes going simultaneously, and I'm glad to > see the LP go. As far as I'm concerned, good riddance.

Van Gelder continued to reside in Englewood Cliffs\\"The State of Jazz: Meet 40 More Jersey Greats\\". The Star-Ledger, September 28, 2004. until his death on August 25, 2016. His final recording session was with the Jimmy Cobb Trio ‚Äî Cobb on drums, Paolo Benedettini on bass and Tadataka Unno on piano ‚Äî on June 20, 2016. The Van Gelder sound Van Gelder was secretive about his recording methods, leaving fans and critics to speculate about his techniques. He would go as far as to move microphones when bands were being photographed in the studio. His recording techniques are often admired by his fans for their transparency, warmth and presence. Richard Cook called Van Gelder's characteristic method of recording and mixing the piano \\"as distinctive as the pianists' playing\\" itself. Blue Note president and producer Alfred Lion criticized Van Gelder for what Lion felt was his occasional overuse of reverb, and would jokingly refer to this trait as a \\"Rudy special\\" on tape boxes. Despite his prominence in recording jazz, some artists avoided Van Gelder's studio. The bassist and composer Charles Mingus refused to record with him. Taking Leonard Feather's \\"blindfold test\\" in 1960, he said that Van Gelder \\"tries to change people's tones. I've seen him do it; I've seen him do it; I've seen him take Thad Jones and the way he sets him up at the mike, he can change the whole sound. That's why I never go to him; he ruined my bass sound\\". Critics of the Van Gelder sound of the 1950s and 1960s have focused on Van Gelder's recording of pianos in particular: Van Gelder has also been criticized for his use of compression and high-frequency boosting, both of which, it is argued, compromise the sound. Journalist and radio producer George Hicks wrote: Writer Stanley Crouch argued in an interview with Ethan Iverson that Van Gelder made particular adjustments to the sound of John Coltrane's tenor saxophone sound when engineering Coltrane's Impulse Records sessions: \\"I know the difference between the sound of someone in person and the recorded sound of an engineer. Coltrane's tone was much darker and thicker than the sound on those Impulse! records engineered by Rudy Van Gelder. But maybe Van Gelder chose that sound because he could hear that Coltrane was an alto player first before switching to tenor.\\" Reputation Within a few years of opening his studio, Van Gelder was in demand by many other independent labels based around New York City, such as Prestige Records. Bob Weinstock, owner of Prestige, recalled the following 1999: \\"Rudy was very much an asset. His rates were fair and he didn't waste time. When you arrived at his studio he was prepared. His equipment was always ahead of its time and he was a genius when it came to recording\\".In \\"The Prestige Story\\" liner notes, quoted by Ira Gitler \\"Vangelder's Studio\\", Jazz Times, April 2001. According to a JazzTimes article in August 2016, \\"jazz lore has formed the brands into a yin and yang of sorts: The Blue Note albums involved more original music, with rehearsal and the stringent, consistent oversight of Lion; Weinstock was more nonchalant, organizing what were essentially blowing sessions for some of the best musicians in jazz history\\". Van Gelder said in 2012, \\"Alfred was rigid about how he wanted Blue Note records to sound. But Bob Weinstock of Prestige was more easygoing, so I'd experiment on his dates and use what I learned on the Blue Note sessions\\". He also worked for Savoy Records in this period, among others. \\"To accommodate everyone, I assigned different days of the week to different labels\\". Writer Fred Kaplan has argued that Van Gelder's reputation with the record-buying public was aided by Blue Note Records' conspicuous mentions of Van Gelder on their album covers: \\"Van Gelder was hardly the only great jazz engineer on the scene in those days; he may not even have been the best. Other stellar figures included Fred Plaut at Columbia, Roy DuNann at Contemporary, Val Valentin at Verve, Roy Goodman at RCA. But the other labels didn't play up their engineers (Columbia covers never so much as mentioned Plaut), while Alfred Lion, Blue Note's proprietor, promoted Van Gelder's sound as a boutique blend‚Äîsomething of a mystique‚Äîand the other labels who hired him followed suit, as if to boast that they too had the special sauce.\\" Awards and honors *In 2013 Van Gelder received the Audio Engineering Society's Gold Medal. *In 2009 he was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts. * In 2012 he received the Grammy Trustees Award.

History New Zealand Stock Exchange 2007 NZX began life as a number of regional stock exchanges during the gold rush of the 1870s. Brokers‚Äô Associations started in Dunedin Brokers‚Äô Association in 1867, Otago in 1868, Auckland in 1872 and Wellington in 1882. The Dunedin Association became a Stock Exchange in 1893, Christchurch gained an exchange in 1900. Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Thames and Wellington formed the Stock Association of New Zealand in 1915, joined by Taranaki in 1916, Invercargill in 1920 and Gisborne in 1922. Merger was investigated from 1976, Christchurch and Invercargill merged in 1978 and a national exchange was formed in 1983. In 1974 these regional exchanges were amalgamated to form one national stock exchange, the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE). On 24 June 1991, NZSE implemented a computerised trading system, and abolished the open outcry market. This computerised system was replaced with the FASTER trading system in September 1999. On 16 October 2002 the Member Firms of the New Zealand Stock Exchange voted in favour of demutualisation, and on 31 December 2002, NZSE became a limited liability company. On 30 May 2003, New Zealand Stock Exchange Limited formally changed its name to New Zealand Exchange Limited, trading as NZX, and on 3 June 2003 listed its own securities on its main equity market. The NZX Centre building in Wellington was originally constructed in 1907 for the C&A; Odlin Timber Company, and is one of the few surviving industrial buildings in the Edwardian style. Mark Weldon was chief executive from 2002 to 2012. In December 2002, the New Zealand Stock Exchange, as it was then known, became a listed company. It officially changed its name to the New Zealand Exchange Limited around six months later and now trades as NZX. In 2009, NZX made a number of acquisitions in the rural sector, including a Feilding-based publications business and the Clear Grain Exchange in Melbourne. In May 2012 Tim Bennett replaced Mark Weldon as NZX's CEO, returning from Singapore to take up the position. In October 2016 Tim Bennett announced that he would step down from his position as CEO on 31 December 2016. NZX's Head of Markets, Mark Peterson, stepped in as interim CEO on January 1, 2017, becoming CEO on a permanent basis from April 2017. In late August 2020, the New Zealand Exchange was subject to online distributed denial-of-service attacks which disrupted trading for five days commencing on 25th August.

Approximately from Wrexham and situated on the A541 road, it is contiguous with the villages of Abermorddu and Hope, though in parts Caergwrle and Hope are separated by a river border. The village lies on the River Alyn and sits at the base of Hope Mountain. At the 2001 Census, the population was 1,650. The population was subsequently absorbed in the community of Hope and only the electoral ward remained. The population of this ward as taken at the 2011 census was 1,619. The ward includes the area of Abermorddu. Further south is the village of Cefn-y-Bedd. History The 13th-century, ruined Caergwrle Castle was first built by Tywysog (Prince) Dafydd ap Gruffydd, in lands agreed with Edward I of England during his invasion of Wales in 1277. Dafydd, in agreeing not to resist the invasion, had extensive improvements made to his castle at Edward's expense. In 1282 however, Dafydd bought his time and raised the banner of revolt, marching on Hawarden Castle controlled by Edward's invaders. Dafydd and his men seized the castle. Dafydd's brother, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd the Prince of Wales, was then drawn into what became the Welsh Wars of Independence. When Llywelyn was beheaded by one of Edward's mercenaries in 1282, Dafydd ap Gruffydd then became Prince of Wales from 11 December 1282 until his execution on 3 October 1283 by King Edward I of England. He was the last independent ruler of Wales until Owain Glyndwr's uprising in the 15th Century. The village originally had the English placename of Corley, but with the addition of the Welsh placename epithet \\"Caer\\", meaning \\"fortress\\", the name gradually took on Welsh characteristics. To explain the name, a myth developed of a giant named Gwrle, who was supposed to have lived in the castle and been buried in the nearby Neolithic burial mound at Cefn-y-bedd. Caergwrle Castle. The 17th-century Packhorse Bridge, which is reputed to be haunted, was nearly destroyed by flooding in 2000, though it has since been restored. There have been many other developments and restorations in Caergwrle. Caergwrle is also home to a Welsh International football player George Alfred Godding who played from 17 March 1923 to 14 April 1923 with two caps for Wales. Caergwrle's long association with the adjacent village of Hope has given rise to a well-known local joke: \\"Live in Hope, die in Caergwrle\\".The AA touring guide to Wales, Automobile Association, 1975, p.205 This was already described as an \\"old saying\\" in the 19th century, when it was recorded by the antiquarian John Askew Roberts.Roberts, J. A. The gossiping guide to Wales, Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co, 1883, p.66 Transport Rail The service from Wrexham Central to Bidston passes through Caergwrle railway station. Bidston provides a connection to Liverpool via the Wirral Line. Caergwrle railway station is managed by Transport for Wales as of Autumn 2018. Bus Caergwrle has bus links giving access to Mold, Broughton, Wrexham and Chester. Food and drink in Caergwrle There are several pubs in Caergwrle, including The Crown Inn, The Halfway Inn and Ye Old Castle Inn. Many of these pubs have their own pool and darts teams. The Bridge Inn, formerly a pub and a fully licensed Chinese restaurant, latterly renamed to Po Po Pang, a fully licensed Malaysian/Chinese restaurant, has closed as a daily business but opens for private bookings. Honey's Bakery to the rear of Po Po Pang is a caf√© which is open daily. The Darby Arms has been closed for some years and is now a private residence. The Caergwrle Bowl 300px The Caergwrle bowl is a unique object dating to the Middle Bronze Age, originally manufactured from shale, tin and gold. It is thought to represent a boat, with its applied gold decoration signifying shields, oars and waves. The incomplete bowl was found in 1823 by a workman digging a drain in a field below Caergwrle Castle. It was donated to the National Museum Wales in 1912, and sent to the British Museum for restoration where it was originally reconstructed from wax with the decoration attached by an adhesive.

Her keel was laid down on 14 June 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in San Francisco, California. She was launched on 27 February 1919 sponsored by Miss Louise C. Bailey, and commissioned on 17 August 1922 with Lieutenant Edwin T. Short in command. Service history Engaged in trials as improved engines were developed for her class, S-35 was ordered to New London, Connecticut, in September, for alterations by the prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company. Decommissioned and delivered to that company on 25 October, she was accepted and recommissioned on 7 May 1923. Exercises along the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea followed and, in early August, she arrived at San Diego, California, her home port until 1925. Then transferred to the Asiatic Fleet, she departed from San Francisco, California, in mid- April and arrived at the Submarine Base, Cavite, Philippine Islands, on 12 July. S-35 operated in Philippine waters, conducting patrols and participating in type, division, and fleet exercises until the spring of 1926. Then she sailed, with her division, for the China coast. Through the summer and into the fall, she conducted similar operations out of Tsingtao; and, in November she returned to the Philippines where, after overhaul, she resumed local operations. She maintained a similar schedule of winter operations in the Philippines and summer deployments in Chinese waters through 1931. On 2 May 1932, she moved east, instead of north, and at the end of the month, arrived at Pearl Harbor where she joined the Pacific Fleet and commenced a schedule of exercises, overhauls, and fleet problems which took her into the 1940s. In 1934, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the highest merit in battle torpedo practice of submarines. In April 1941, she was transferred to San Diego, California, and, for the remaining months of peace, she provided services for the West Coast Sound School. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, S-35 added defensive patrol work to her duties; and, in January 1942, she moved north to Mare Island for limited modernization and overhaul. In late March, she continued northward and, in early April, arrived at the newly established submarine base at Dutch Harbor.  First War Patrol  On 12 April, she cleared Dutch Harbor and moved toward the Kuril Islands for her first war patrol. On 21 and 22 April, snow and fog covered her approach to Paramushiro and Onekotan Strait. On 23 April, she sighted and was sighted by, a large enemy submarine on the surface. Both submarines submerged. Explosions were felt in S-35. The blasts forced her down further than expected, but she regained control at 220 feet, returned to her intended depth; and maneuvered out of the immediate area. The weather cleared on 24 April, and Paramushiro was sighted for the first time. Two days later, however, the S-boat was en route to her secondary station north of Attu. On arrival on 27 April, a ship's cook was discovered to have mumps and a course was set for Dutch Harbor. Isolation was impossible, and half the crew had not had the disease. Three days later, S-35 returned to her Unalaska base. The crew received medical attention, the boat was scrubbed down and refitted; and requests for modern equipment, including sonar and radar, were made.  Second War Patrol  Toward the end of May, the submarine was ready for sea; and, on 28 April, she moved west in response to intelligence reports of a Japanese invasion force bound for the western Aleutian Islands. On station by 30 April, she patrolled on the surface with no contacts, through 2 June. On the morning of 3 June, word of the bombing of Dutch Harbor was received. Aerial contacts, both friendly and enemy became frequent; but the submarine was not attacked. On 11 June, she was ordered back to Dutch Harbor to replenish; thence, she was routed to the western part of the archipelago for offensive operations near Kiska which had been taken by the Japanese. On 14 June, she approached the island and patrolled between there and Segula until 23 June. She then participated in the search for sister ship , which had run aground on Amchitka Island; returned to her patrol area late on 25 June; and, on 29 June, returned to Dutch Harbor. The thick fog which had shielded the Japanese force as it crossed the Bering Sea had remained over the Aleutians during her patrol, impairing visibility and hindering her offensive efforts.  Third War Patrol  On 14 July, S-35 got underway again and, through the end of the month, patrolled the Japanese supply lanes to Kiska. She then headed back toward Dutch Harbor, but was diverted north and west of the island to provide weather reporting services to the force scheduled to bombard Kiska on 7 August. After the raid, she returned to Dutch Harbor, thence proceeded to San Diego, where for six weeks she underwent overhaul and provided services to the sound school.  Fourth War Patrol  On 20 October, she returned to Unalaska; and, on 26 October, she cleared the harbor for her fourth war patrol. From then until her return on 22 November, she battled heavy seas, storms, and problems arising from her inadequate and outmoded equipment as she hunted the Paramushiro-Attu-Kiska convoy routes. On 25 November, she returned to Dutch Harbor.  Fifth War Patrol  Cold weather added icing to the climatic hazards of the northern Pacific Ocean; but, on 11 December, S-35 headed out of Dutch Harbor again. On 15 December, she commenced operations to intercept enemy traffic to Attu and Kiska; but, on 17 December, a case of acute appendicitis forced her to Adak, Alaska, where she was to transfer the sick man to seaplane tender for treatment. On 18 December, she approached the rendezvous point but was sighted by enemy planes. On the morning of 19 December, she completed the transfer; then resumed patrol east of Kiska. On the afternoon of 21 December, she ran into a storm while surfaced off Amchitka; and, by early evening, waves were smashing over the bridge and cascading into the control room. The conning tower hatch was ordered shut. Almost simultaneously, another huge wave crashed over the bridge, flinging the captain, Lieutenant H. S. Monroe, into the hatch. Injured, Monroe retired to his quarters, only to be roused a short time later, about 18:30, by cries of \\"fire\\" in the control room. Electric arcs and blue flames spewed out of the main power cables coming from the forward battery. Smoke filled the room; and water, which had caused the fire by soaking cables and causing a short, rose in the control room bilges. The fire was extinguished in the control room but immediately broke out in the forward battery. Fire extinguishers had no effect. The forward two compartments were abandoned and the battery was secured. Fire again broke out in the control room; and, as in the forward battery, extinguishers were of little help. Smoke filled the control room. The engines were stopped. The room was abandoned and sealed. Short circuits spread. Electrical equipment was disabled. A hole was burned in the top of the Number Two main ballast tank and lines from two air banks were severed. At about 18:55, unsuccessful attempts to reenter the control room, using escape lungs, were made. Shortly thereafter, two volunteers, using oxygen charged lungs, entered the room; flooded the magazines; partially blew the Number Three main ballast tank to gain more freeboard; and shut the auxiliary induction to seal the forward battery. The fight to save the submarine continued. The engines were started again; a fire extinguisher watch was set over the section of cable still arcing; and a bucket brigade was organized to assist in keeping down the water level. By 20:00, all extinguishers had been emptied. But S-35, under manual control, was moving east. The morning of 22 December brought new fires. Twice, at 07:00 and at 11:00, eruptions forced the crew to the bridge. But the same flares apparently contributed to the fire's burning itself out. After the second, the forward battery was sufficiently discharged and the cables sufficiently ruptured to prevent further fire in the control room. Smoke from the forward battery compartment, however, continued to be a problem until she entered Kuluk Bay and the battery was disconnected. Arriving at noon on 24 December, the boat was ventilated; medical help was obtained; four men were hospitalized; and mattresses, bedding, and clothing were dried. On 29 December, S-35 made her way, under escort, into Dutch Harbor. Usable equipment was removed for installation in other S-boats, and, on 14 January 1943 she began the long trip to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs. Arriving at Bremerton, Washington on 29 January, repairs took her into the spring. From 20-31 May, she conducted post repair trials; and, on 3 June, she moved north again. For heroism and devotion to duty in saving the submarine and her crew Lieutenant Commander Stone and Chief Electrician's Mate Frederick H. Barbero were awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for non- combat heroism.  Sixth War Patrol  Arriving at Dutch Harbor on 11 June, she once more made her way west on 17 June. Despite numerous material casualties, which slowed her to an average speed of a little more than 5 knots, she continued toward the Kuril Islands and arrived in her patrol area on 25 June. On 26 June, she transited Onekotan Strait; and, on 27 June, she sighted her first target of the patrol, a large Japanese freighter. The target, however, soon outdistanced the World War I-design submarine and disappeared into the ever-present fog. Material defects continued to cause problems. Her starboard engine soon went out of commission; and, as repair work was started, a freighter and a destroyer were sighted approaching on a course which would bring them over her position. A half hour later, the two enemy ships passed overhead, one to port, the other to starboard. Repair work was then resumed. By dawn of 29 June, the engine was again operable; and, on 30 June, S-35 shifted north to Araido, thence proceeded to the Kamchatka Peninsula, whence she moved back down the coast and covered Shimushu Strait, Paramushiro Strait, and Araido Strait. On 1 July, she found a clear area in the fog and sighted a fishing tender awaiting the return of its trawlers. At 18:02, she fired two torpedoes at ten-second intervals; watched the first hit; and saw the second porpoising haphazardly through the water toward the target. At 18:06, she fired a third torpedo and watched the target explode and list heavily to starboard. By 18:21, the 5430-ton Banshu Maru Number Seven had disappeared, but others remained in the area where she had been. S-35 reloaded and turned to firing position; but, by 18:25, the new targets had receded into the fog. Five minutes later, fast screws were heard; and the submarine began evasive tactics and cleared the area. On 2 July, S-35 received orders to shift to the convoy routes leading to southern Paramushiro. Arriving on 4 July, she remained through 16 July. Clear weather arrived with dawn of the last day, and, that afternoon, the submarine sighted a destroyer patrolling in concert, apparently, with a flying boat. As the flying boat disappeared toward its base, S-35 prepared to attack. At 15:41, she began her approach on the destroyer. At about 15:42, the destroyer sighted her. She went deep. For the remainder of the day and well into the night, the two adversaries maneuvered for position: S-35 evading depth charges and attempting to gain a favorable firing position; the destroyer keeping the submarine on evasive tactics and attempting to pinpoint her location and deliver a decisive depth charge. Success went to neither side. On the morning of 17 July, S-35 cleared the area and headed back toward the Aleutians. On 21 July, she arrived at Attu; and, on 25 July, she moored in Dutch Harbor. During the patrol, she had had only five clear days; four had been partially clear, the remainder had been foggy with poor to very poor visibility.  Seventh War Patrol  On 6 August, S-35 began her seventh war patrol. Standing out of Dutch Harbor, she made for Attu, topped off in Massacre Bay; then proceeded to her patrol area. On 11 August, she sighted a ship, but was unable to close. On 19 August, cracks developed in the port engine crankshaft and couplings; and she turned back for Dutch Harbor. Overhaul followed her return; and on 26 November, she was again ready to hunt in the Kurils. Underway that day, she arrived on station on 8 December, and for the next ten days, encountered heavy seas, snow, and \\"mild icing\\" as she searched waters off Onekotan and in the S≈çya-Araido and Omintao- Mushashi-Kashiwabara shipping lanes. On 19 December, she shifted north; reconnoitered the Kamchatka peninsula; then, headed home. En route, engineering defects again became critical, and almost 20 hours were spent in repairs. On 25 December, she arrived at Attu; and, on 30 December, she entered Dutch Harbor to complete her last war patrol.  Retirement  Fleet submarines now replaced the World War I-designed types. The Aleutian S-boats, as with those operating in other areas, were reassigned to training duty or designated for inactivation. S-35 was assigned to Pearl Harbor where she arrived in mid-February 1944 and immediately commenced training operations. In the spring, she was ordered to the Marshall Islands. Through the summer, she provided training services out of Majuro and Eniwetok, then returned to Pearl Harbor. In January 1945, she proceeded to San Diego for inspection and repairs, and, in February, she returned to Oahu for use as a damage control school ship. Decommissioned on 19 March 1945, she served as a school ship and then as a target ship. Her hulk was sunk by torpedo fire on 4 April 1946. S-35 was awarded one battle star for her service during World War II.

H. White, the third book in the series The Once and Future King. It was first published in 1940, but is usually found today only in collected editions of all four books of the novel. Plot summary Much of The Ill-Made Knight takes place in the fabled Camelot. The Ill-Made Knight is based around the adventures, perils and mistakes of Sir Lancelot. Lancelot, despite being the bravest of the knights, is ugly, and ape-like, so that he calls himself the Chevalier mal fet - \\"The Ill-Made Knight\\". As a child, Lancelot loved King Arthur and spent his entire childhood training to be a knight of the round table. When he arrives and becomes one of Arthur's knights, he also becomes the king's close friend. This causes some tension, as he is jealous of Arthur's new wife Guinevere. In order to please her husband, Guinevere tries to befriend Lancelot and the two eventually fall in love. T.H. White's version of the tale elaborates greatly on the passionate love of Lancelot and Guinevere. Suspense is provided by the tension between Lancelot's friendship for King Arthur and his love for and affair with the queen. This affair leads inevitably to the breaking of the Round Table and sets up the tragedy that is to follow in the concluding book of the tetralogy - The Candle in the Wind. Lancelot leaves Camelot to aid people in need. Along the way, he meets a woman who begs him to climb a tree and rescue her husband's escaped falcon. After he removes his armor and does so, the husband appears and reveals that he only wanted Lancelot to remove his armor so that he can kill the knight. Despite being at a disadvantage, Lancelot manages to kill the man and tells the wife \\"Stop crying. Your husband was a fool and you are a bore. I'm not sorry\\" (though he reflects that he is). Later, he comes across a man attempting to murder his wife for adultery. Lancelot attempts to protect the woman (who denies the charges) by riding in between the two; however the man manages to cut off his wife's head. The man then throws himself at Lancelot's feet and asks for mercy to avoid being killed. It was revealed later that the man was punished by being charged to take his wife's head to the Pope and ask for forgiveness. Finally, Lancelot comes to a town where the inhabitants beg him to rescue a young woman named Elaine, who is trapped in a tower. The tower is full of steam and she is forced to sit in a tub of boiling water. He manages to save her and her father has him spend the night. That night, the servants and Elaine devise a plan in which the servants get Lancelot drunk and trick him into thinking Guinevere is in the house. When he awakens in the morning, he discovers that he actually slept with Elaine. Furious at the loss of his virginity (which he believes also cost him the ability to work miracles) and frightened at the thought that Elaine might have a baby, he leaves. He later confesses the affair to Guinevere, who forgives him. They later discover that Elaine did have a baby, which she named Galahad (Lancelot's real name). She brings the baby to Camelot to show to Lancelot and together they spend time with Galahad. Guinevere is furious at this (as she asked Lancelot not to do that) and Lancelot goes mad and runs from the castle. Two years later he is found by Elaine's father (who does not recognize him) and is kept as a fool until Elaine recognizes him and cares for him. He lives with Elaine for some time, but then returns to Camelot. When Galahad grows older, he is brought to Camelot as well, to be knighted. The Ill-Made Knight also deals with the quest for the Holy Grail. Arthur notices that the drop in crime has caused the Knights of the Round Table to fall back into their old habits (especially Gawaine, Agravaine, and Mordred, who found their mother in bed with one of Sir Pellinore's sons and murdered both in a fit of rage). In order to give the Knights a new goal, he sends them to find the Holy Grail. The quest ends when Sir Galahad, Sir Percival, Sir Bors, and Sir Pellinore's daughter find the grail. Sir Lancelot apparently saw the four in a room, with the Grail, an old man, and several other knights; however he was unable to enter the room himself (when he tried he was knocked out). One of the knights returned with the news that the Grail could not be brought to England and as a result Sir Galahad and the other knight brought it to Babylon (and neither of them could return to England as well). Sir Pellinore's daughter died when she allowed her blood to be taken to cure a dying princess. Later on, Elaine commits suicide after Lancelot tells her that he will not return to stay with her permanently. The book ends with Lancelot performing a miracle, which is a miracle in and of itself due to the fact that he is not a virgin (which had been the requirement for being able to do so). Allusions/references in other works The Lerner and Loewe musical Camelot is largely based on The Ill-Made Knight and The Candle in the Wind. Quotations :‚ÄúThe boy [Lancelot] thought that there was something wrong with him. All throughout his life--even when he was a great man with the world at his feet--he was to feel this gap: something at the bottom of his heart of which he was aware, and ashamed, but which he did not understand ...

Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning American author William Faulkner published it in 1948. Overview The novel focuses on Lucas Beauchamp, a black farmer accused of murdering a white man. He is exonerated through the efforts of black and white teenagers and a spinster from a long-established Southern family. It was written as Faulkner's response as a Southern writer to the racial problems facing the South. Intruder in the Dust is notable for its use of stream of consciousness style of narration. The novel also includes lengthy passages on the Southern memory of the Civil War, one of which Shelby Foote quoted in Ken Burns' documentary The Civil War. The characters of Lucas Beauchamp and his wife, Molly, first appeared in Faulkner's collection of short fiction, Go Down, Moses. A story by Faulkner, \\"Lucas Beauchamp,\\" was published in 1999. Intruder in the Dust was turned into a film of the same name directed by Clarence Brown in 1949 after MGM paid film rights of $50,000 to Faulkner. The film was shot in Faulkner's home town of Oxford, Mississippi. Analysis In her contemporary review of the novel, Eudora Welty noted its humor. In a 1949 contemporary analysis of Faulkner's work, Dayton Kohler noted the particular feature of Intruder in the Dust of its dramatization of the hope of regeneration of the American Southern conscience, with respect to the position of black Americans in Southern American society. John E. Bassett has commented that this novel represents a \\"serious attempt to explore contemporary Southern racism through Gavin and Chick.\\" Jean E. Graham has discussed the contrasting rhetorical styles of Gavin and Chick throughout the course of the novel. Ticien Marie Sassoubre has examined the novel in the context of the social issues related to lynching in the American South, and then-recent American federal law with respect to black Americans. D. Hutchinson has elucidated the unifying literary devices of the novel. Peter J. Rabinowitz has specifically looked at Faulkner's treatment of the form of the detective story, in the context of the genre of the \\"discovery novel,\\" in Intruder in the Dust.
