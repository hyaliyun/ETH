The HIP offers lessees a choice on the works they want to be included in the upgrading of their flats. It also helps lessees deal with common maintenance problems in ageing flats, such as spalling concrete and ceiling leaks, in a systematic and comprehensive manner. Flats are eligible for HIP twice, one at 30 years old and one at 60-70 years old. The HIP is targeted at flats built til 1997. Priority of upgrading programmes is traditionally given to wards held by the ruling People's Action Party, which appoints the Minister for National Development who oversees the Housing Development Board. When asked why opposition wards are penalised by the statutory board at a NUS student forum in 2011, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong responded, \\"The answer is that there has to be a distinction. Because the PAP wards supported the Government and the policies which delivered these good things.‚Äù Scope of Works Essential Improvements These are improvements deemed necessary for public health, safety or technical reasons. They are compulsory if HIP is polled successfully. * Replacement of waste pipes * Repair of spalling concrete * Repair of structural cracks * Replacement of pipe sockets * Upgrading of electrical supply Optional Improvements Owners may opt out of any or all of these improvements, with a corresponding reduction in co-payment. However, to opt out of toilet upgrading, the toilets will have to pass a water test for leaks. This is to prevent ceiling leaks at the flat below. * Upgrading of toilets * Replacement of entrance door * Replacement of entrance grille gate * Replacement of refuse hopper It was also announced in Parliament on 5 March 2012, that HDB will introduce more elderly friendly options under the HIP. These improvements come under the Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) and aims to create a safer and more comfortable living environment for them. * Slip resistant treatment for bathroom floors * Grab bars * Ramps at the main entrance of flats and in the flats HIP Ramp Up With the ramp up in HIP, Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE), which is implemented with HIP, will also be stepped up. Elderly residents will benefit from EASE earlier, and enjoy grab-bars, ramps and slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles to help make their homes elderly- friendly. Construction The construction period for a typical precinct comprising eight to ten blocks will take about one and a half to two years. Works in each flat will take 10 days or less, depending on the improvements chosen.

He is noted for creating and producing the silent Bobby Bumps animated short subject series for early animation producer J.R. Bray's Bray Productions. Hurd and Bray are jointly responsible for developing the processes involved in cel animation, and were granted patents for their processes in 1914. Animator Andy Luckey is a maternal cousin, twice removed, of Hurd's. Career Hurd, a native of Kansas City, Missouri, later worked for Paul Terry's Terrytoons studio before starting his own Earl Hurd Productions studio in 1923. Hurd was also a comic strip artist, illustrating the strips Trials of Elder Mouse (1911‚Äì1915), Brick Bodkin's Pa (1912) and Susie Sunshine (1927‚Äì1929). He worked later at the Ub Iwerks studio and the Walt Disney studio as a storyboard artist. Animation historian Giannalberto Bendazzi has called Hurd \\"probably the best American animator of his time\\" after Bray and said of his films that they \\"display an uncommon visual inventiveness, gentle humour and attention to drawing and scenography\\".

He was the brother of Prince Simeon Olelkovich of Kiev and cousin of Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow. Mikhailo was allegedly involved both in bringing the Judaizer Heresy to Novgorod and the failed defection of the city to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1471. He also organized a coup against Casimir IV Jagiellon, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, but was discovered and executed in 1481. Mikhailo's son Semen continued the family line. Novgorod affair According to the 1456 Treaty of Yazhelbitsy, the Novgorod Republic became dependent on the Grand Duchy of Moscow was not allowed to conduct independent foreign policy. In a bid to regain independence, Novgorod began negotiations for an anti-Muscovite alliance with Casimir IV Jagiellon, Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was alleged in an account purportedly drawn up in the archiepiscopal scriptorium in the mid-1470s that Mikhailo, as regent for Casimir IV, arrived in Novgorod initially to marry Marfa Boretskaya, the matriarch of the pro-Lithuanian faction in the city (or else to have her married to an unnamed Lithuanian nobleman).Gail Lenhoff and Janet Martin. ‚ÄúMarfa Boretskaia, Posadnitsa of Novgorod: A Reconsideration of Her Legend and Her Life.‚Äù Slavic Review 59, no. 2 (2000), 346, 347. Moscow accused Novgorod not only of violation of a political treaty, but also of religious treachery: there were also allegations that the marriage would have brought Novgorod over to Catholicism, but Gail Lenhoff and Janet Martin argue that the pro- Lithuanian, pro-Catholic allegations are highly suspect and, indeed, very unlikely. Mikhailo was Orthodox (as was Marfa Boretskaya) and he and his brother had strong differences of opinion with Casimir IV Jagiellon.Lenhoff and Martin, \\"Marfa Boretskaia,\\" 349. Mikhailo entered Novgorod on November 8, 1470 with a large retinue and remained in the city until March 15, 1471.George Vernadsky, ‚ÄúThe Heresy of the Judaizers and the Policies of Ivan III of Moscow.‚Äù Speculum 8 (1933): 437-38; John I. L. Fennell, Ivan the Great of Moscow (London: Macmillan, 1961), 325. His large retinue included Skhariya (Zechariah) the Jew, who gained a following in Novgorod. The heresy spread from there to Moscow in 1479 when Grand Prince Ivan III transferred several heretical priests to Moscow.Fennell, Ivan the Great, 327. The affair ended when Mikhailo withdrew from the city and Ivan III defeated the Novgorodians in the Battle of Shelon in July 1471. In 1478, Moscow took direct control of the city. Coup of 1481 After the death of his brother Simeon in 1470, the Principality of Kiev was converted into the Kiev Voivodeship and was governed by appointed officials (voivodes). This was a serious setback to the Olelkovich family as it claimed the principality as their possession since Mikhailo's grandfather Vladimir, son of Algirdas. The loss of Kiev could be attributed to Olelkovich's faith (Eastern Orthodoxy rather than Catholicism) and their close kinship with the Grand Princes of Moscow, who threatened Lithuania's eastern borders. For example, in 1479 Mikhailo acted as intermediary in arranging the marriage of Ivan the Young, son of Ivan III, and Elena, daughter of Stephen III of Moldavia. Disappointed by the Lithuanian politics, Mikhailo Olelkovich organized opposition to Casimir IV. In 1481, he together with relatives Iwan Olshanski-Dubrovicki and Feodor Ivanovich Belsky organized a coup against the Grand Duke. However, the plot was discovered, possibly by voivode of Kiev Ivan Chodkiewicz, and Mikhailo and Iwan were executed. Feodor managed to escape to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Mikhailo and twelve other Ruthenian nobles signed a letter to Pope Sixtus IV in 1476, authored by Miseal (Misail Pstruch), Metropolitan of Kiev. The letters expressed loyalty to the Council of Florence and supported a church union between Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. It also contained complains that the Catholics were discriminating the Orthodoxs and asked the Pope for protection. There are doubts whether the letter was authentic and not a later forgery.

History The saga of the Vidyadhari River, which flows through the Deganga area, has been part of local folklore since time immemorial. The river had formed a major navigation route for earlier civilisations. In the 3rd century BC, the nearby river port of Chandraketugarh was on the banks of this river. There still are tell-tale signs of that bygone era, and efforts are on near Berachampa to find more evidence of a lost civilization, possibly Meryan. The source of the river is located near Haringhata in Nadia. Later it winds down through the area before meeting the Raimangal at the confluence of Sundarbans. Geography Berachampa, with the CD Block offices, is located at . Deganga CD Block is bounded by Habra I CD Block in the north, Baduria and Basirhat I CD Blocks in the east, Haroa CD Block in the south and Barasat I and Barasat II CD Blocks in the west. Deganga CD Block is part of the North Bidyadhari Plain, one of the three physiographic regions in the district located in the lower Ganges Delta. The area is full of marshes and salt water lakes. The Bidyadhari has a long course through the central part of the district. The Bidyadhari forms the eastern boundary of Deganga CD Block with Barasat I and Barasat II CD Blocks. Deganga CD Block has an area of 202.09 km2. It has 1 panchayat samity, 13 gram panchayats, 181 gram sansads (village councils), 108 mouzas and 108 inhabited villages, as per the District Statistical Handbook: North 24 Parganas. Deganga police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Deulia. Deganga is an intermediate panchayat (local self- government) under North 24 Parganas district. Village panchayats under it are ‚Äì Amulia, Berachampa I & II, Chakla, Champatala, Chaurashi, Deganga I & II, Hadipur-Jikhra I & II, Kolsur, Nurnagar and Sohai-Shetpur. Social turmoil Land acquisition fear Villagers in West Bengal are greatly worried about acquisition of land for industry. In March 2007, Sasthi Charan Ghosh, Block Development Officer, decided to inspect a fenced-up plot near Kalianibil in Deganga in connection with a plywood company's plans to set up a factory there. Later they were to meet to decide on the company's application. Barely had they finished the inspection when rumours spread that government officials were measuring land for acquisition. Over 1,000 villagers ambushed cars carrying the officials. Police rushed in to rescue them, but failed to stop the mob from setting ablaze two vehicles belonging to the circle inspector and zilla parishad. A number of policemen were injured. 2010 anti-Hindu riots The 2010 Deganga riots began on 6 September when a Muslim mob resorted to arson and violence on the Hindu localities of Deganga, Kartikpur and Beliaghata under the Deganga police station area. The violence began late in the evening and continued throughout the night into the next morning. The district police, Rapid Action Force all failed to stop the mob violence, Central Reserve Police Force was finally deployed. The Central Reserve Police Force staged a flag march on the Taki Road, while Islamist violence continued unabated in the interior villages off the Taki Road, till Wednesday in spite of army presence and promulgation of prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC. The violence finally calmed down on 9 September after Several of Hindu business establishments and residences were looted, destroyed and burnt, dozens of Hindus were severely injured and many muslims also and one Muslim person dead by shooting and several Hindu temples were desecrated and vandalized.

There are |primary health centres at Ajinagar (Hadipur-Jhikra PHC with 6 beds), Chakla (Raypur Chakla PHC with 10 beds), Deganga (Kolsur PHC with 10 beds) and Kartickpur (with 6 beds). Deganga is one of the areas where groundwater is affected by arsenic contamination. In Kolsur in Deganga area, Pal Trockner's arsenic removal technology was used at an expenditure of over Rs 30 million. Experts feel that the entire expenditure has gone waste. Aqua Welfare Society, a non government organization (NGO), has been providing arsenic safe water to the local through rain water harvesting. They are providing the water through modified dugwells, the water which is treated with chlorine regularly. AWS has organised several interactive workshops including one on water at Kolsur High School, on 26 November 2006. The participants were informed that by 2009 the state government had planned to provide water through pipelines that would either be treated river water or water from the third aquifer (deep tubewell) that is arsenic free. However, it was also mentioned that the remote villages where it would be difficult to provide the pipelines the villagers would need to use alternate sources for their drinking water.

The company is headquartered in Paris.  History  A memorandum of understanding between AREVA and MHI effectively creating the entity was signed 19 October 2006 and the name of the joint venture was announced on 3 September 2007. The European Commission cleared the joint venture in October 2007 on the grounds that the activities of Areva and MHI are geographically complementary and Atmea was unlikely to strengthen the competitiveness of each parent company. The completion of the French nuclear industry reorganisation under EDF leadership in 2018 also led to a renewed partnership within ATMEA. ATMEA was initially formed as a joint venture between AREVA NP and MHI to develop the next- generation AT-MEA1 reactor. Under the new structure, there will be fifty-fifty ownership of ATMEA between EDF and MHI, along with a special share owned by Framatome. Thanks to this renewed partnership the ATMEA technology and promotion will be supported by EDF and MHI. This will reinforce the Franco/Japanese new nuclear power offering to many countries recognizing the key role of nuclear energy in the transition towards low-carbon power generation.https://www.mhi.com/news/story/1801052101.html  Governance  David Tersigni is the Atmea Company's President and CEO. Ken-ichi Sonoda is the company's Deputy CEO.http://www.atmea-sas.com/EN/home-310/atmea-ensuring- a-strong-management.html  The ATMEA1 reactor  The ATMEA1 reactor is an about 1200 MWe generation III+ pressurized water reactor with three coolant loops and a thermal power level of 3,150 MWth. The design has high thermal efficiency (typically 10% higher than currently operating reactors), a 60-year service life and a load-following capability. The reactor can be set to a 12- to 24 month operational cycle. The ATMEA1 reactor's systems and components were previously developed by AREVA and MHI for the EPR and APWR, including steam generators with axial economizer and TT690 tubes, advanced accumulators and reactor internals with Heavy Neutron Reflector. The ATMEA1 safety features include three redundant trains of emergency core cooling systems and a core- melt retention system. With a power output of about 1200 Mwe, the ATMEA1, is targeted to attract new-entry countries looking to develop nuclear power. In comparison, Mitsubishi's APWR is slated to have a power of 1700 MWe while Areva's European Pressurized Reactor currently under construction will have an output of 1600 Mwe. Compliance In 2013, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) released a pre-project design review of the ATMEA1 reactor and found the design compliant with CNSC regulatory requirements and expectations for new nuclear power plants in Canada. In 2012 the French Nuclear Safety Authority, (Autorit√© de s√ªret√© nucl√©aire or ASN), released a report finding the safety options and design choice of the ATMEA1 satisfactory and in compliance with French regulations. On 7 July 2008 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) completed the review of the conceptual safety design features for the ATMEA1. The report concluded that the ATMEA1 conceptual design addresses the IAEA's fundamental safety principles and key design and safety assessment requirements. Planned construction On 3 May 2013, Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, signed an outline US$22 billion deal for the construction of the Sinop Nuclear Power Plant in Turkey. Plans for the 4400 MWe plant were ratified by Turkey's government in April 2015. Ownership of the plant will be split between a consortium of Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Itochu, and France's Areva and GDF Suez with 51%, and Turkey's state-run power producer EUAS with 49%. The plant will comprise four ATMEA1 reactors. As of 2015, subject to final agreement, construction was planned to begin in 2017, with the first unit to be in operation by 2023. In 2018 an Environmental Impact Assessment application was submitted to the Environment and Urban Planning Ministry. Location and construction licenses are still to be obtained from the Turkey Atomic Energy Agency. In April 2018, Nikkei reported that Itochu would withdraw from the project, while MHI and other investors were continuing the feasibility study through the summer of 2018. The remaining members of the Japanese consortium abandoned the project in December 2018 after a failure to reach agreement with the Turkish government on financing terms. Construction costs had almost doubled to about $44 billion, because of post-Fukushima safety improvements and the fall in the value of the Turkish lira.

Inspired by R. F. Outcault's Buster Brown, Bobby Bumps was a little boy who, accompanied by his dog Fido, regularly found himself in and out of mischief. Each cartoon begins with a cartoonist's hand drawing Bobby, Fido and the backgrounds. The first two cartoons were released in 1915 by Universal; the next few years' titles were released by Paramount Pictures as part of their Paramount Bray Pictograph and, later, Paramount Magazine short- subjects packages. Mid-1920s episodes were released by Educational Pictures. The series was created by Earl Hurd, who directed and/or animated most of the films. The Bobby Bumps cartoons were the first to be produced using the cel animation process. Previously, animated cartoons were produced using paper animation: a new drawing was made for each frame of film. With cel animation, Bray drew his characters on clear sheets of celluloid, which he placed over still backgrounds during the photography process. Cel animation revolutionized the animation industry, and Hurd and his employer J.R. Bray held a patent for the process (and received licensing payments from all studios using the process) until 1932. A 1918 short, Bobby Bumps Becomes an Ace, reflects the country's concerns about World War I. In this short, Bobby dreams that he shoots down German fighters and tries to sink a U-boat. In 2019, a comprehensive Blu-ray/DVD collection from animation researcher/restorer Tommy Jos√© Stathes, Cartoon Roots: Bobby Bumps and Fido, was released, containing fifteen shorts and much background material.

He was an outfielder over parts of three Major League seasons (1955; 1957‚Äì1958) with the Cincinnati Redlegs, Milwaukee Braves and Detroit Tigers. Hazle was a member of the 1957 World Series champion Braves. For his Major League career, he hit .310 with 9 home runs and 37 runs batted in in 110 games played. Hazle was born in Laurens, South Carolina. He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and . He attended Wofford College and signed with Cincinnati in 1950. 'Hurricane Hazle' helped Braves win 1957 pennant Hazle debuted with the Redlegs late in the 1955 season, but made no impression. He then was traded with Corky Valentine to the Milwaukee Braves in return for George Crowe the following spring, but did not appear in the big leagues. Playing for the Triple-A Wichita Braves, he was hurt and reportedly considered quitting the sport. Hazle is best remembered for his meteoric 1957 performance. He was promoted from Wichita only after outfielder Bill Bruton suffered a season- ending knee injury, and did not play until the Braves' 100th game. In less than three weeks, from August 9 through August 25, Hazle batted .473 with 5 home runs and 19 runs batted in during 14 games, a sudden burst of unexpected offense that earned him the nickname \\"Hurricane.\\" The original Hurricane Hazel had struck the coast of Hazle's home state, South Carolina, in 1954. The first-place Braves swept the second-place Cardinals on August 9‚Äì11, which went a long way towards sealing the National League pennant for Milwaukee; the first two games of the series were blowouts, and Hazle had seven hits and five runs batted in. He batted .556 in his first dozen games. For the season, Hazle batted .403 in 41 games, with 7 home runs and 27 runs batted in. On the next- to-last day of the season, Hazle broke up a no-hit bid by Cincinnati's Johnny Klippstein with a two-out, eighth-inning single. Hazle appeared in four of seven World Series games that year, hitting .154 for the champion Braves. However, both of his hits came in the seventh and deciding game; Hazle scored the first run in a 5‚Äì0 victory. Despite having had just 134 at-bats, Hazle finished fourth in the 1957 NL Rookie of the Year voting. Later career After a bad start in 1958, Hazle was traded to Detroit. After a stint in the minors, he retired in 1960.

Early years  Jones was the youngest of four children born to actress Freda Jones. All three of her siblings, Margaret, Macon, and Marvin Jones, were also child actors. Their relationship was strained by their unequal status in the film world. \\"I constantly heard, 'You've got to be quiet; Marcia Mae has to learn her lines.' It was Marcia Mae this and Marcia Mae that. That's where the jealousy from my siblings came from. They blamed me for it, when it was my mother who was doing it.\\" Career Jones made her film debut at the age of two in the 1926 film Mannequin. She appeared in films such as King of Jazz (1930), Street Scene (1931), and Night Nurse (1931) before rising to child stardom in the 1930s with roles in The Champ (1931) and, alongside Shirley Temple in Heidi (1937) and The Little Princess (1939). She also starred in films such as The Garden of Allah (1936), These Three (1936), and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938). In the 1937 film Mountain Justice she played Bettie Harkins as seen on TCM. Jones blossomed into a wide-eyed, blonde, wholesome-looking teenager, and worked steadily in motion pictures through her late teens. She appeared in First Love (1939), in support of Deanna Durbin. In 1940, Monogram Pictures signed her to co-star with Jackie Moran in a few rustic romances; when this series lapsed, both Jones and Moran joined Monogram's popular action-comedy series starring Frankie Darro. As a young adult, she continued to work in motion pictures, notably in Nine Girls (1944) and Arson, Inc. (1948). Like many familiar faces of the 1940s, she appeared on numerous television programs. In 1951 she appeared as comic foil to Buster Keaton in Keaton's filmed TV series. She went on to work in such top-rated shows as The Cisco Kid, The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Peyton Place, and General Hospital. Her last major role was in the Barbra Streisand film The Way We Were in 1973. She also appeared in the Barnaby Jones; episode \\"Doomed Alibi\\" (1975).

The reserve is situated approximately south- west of and south-east of the village of . The reserve's main feature is Mount Ulandra. Immediately west of the reserve lies an undulating plain that varies between above sea level which rises abruptly at Mount Ulandra to its summit at above sea level. The reserve was dedicated in 1981 to protect stands of Cootamundra wattle. The reserve is used for foraging and reproduction by the threatened superb parrot. It was then progressively added to until 1983. The reserve is listed on the Register of the National Estate. Its Statement of Significance there reads as follows: 'This nature reserve constitutes a highly important remnant of regionally representative open forest in the agricultural district of the south-west slopes, dominated by Callitris endlicheri and a variety of eucalypts. These vegetation types do not survive within the region to any great extent beyond this reserve. The reserve contains the invasive ornamental Acacia baileyana growing in a portion of its relatively restricted natural distribution. The reserve also appears to furnish critical reproductive and foraging resources for the threatened superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii) as well as significant habitat for another vulnerable bird species, the turquoise parrot (Neophema pulchella). Moreover, it represents almost a sole habitat isolate for many species which can be regarded as regionally uncommon due to the extent of clearing, and for irruptive/migratory nectarivorous and insectivorous passerines. Included within Ulandra Nature Reserve is a relatively undisturbed catchment (feeding Merrybundinah Creek); such a phenomenon is a rarity within an agriculturally transformed landscape of this type.'http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi- bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=708  Features  The Ulandra Nature Reserve covers an area of wooded hills known as the Ulandra Range. The terrain is hilly with rough rocky ridges, several steep sided gullies and a catchment which feeds into Merrybundindah Creek. Most of the reserve is above above sea level. Vegetation is mostly open forest of cypress pine and gums. Wattles are also prevalent. There are records of grey kangaroos and swamp wallabies as well as brushtail possums and ringtail possums. There are also an undetermined numbers of bats. As at July 2015, the Atlas of NSW Wildlife recorded 114 bird species within the reserve.http://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au/ The bird species listed as 'vulnerable' in New South Wales, recorded in the reserve, are the little eagle, gang-gang cockatoo, turquoise parrot, brown treecreeper, speckled warbler, varied sittella, hooded robin, scarlet robin, flame robin, and diamond firetail. The reserve contains evidence of historic Aboriginal activity. Stone artifacts and other relics have been recorded at the site. Since European settlement activities within the reserve have included clearing, grazing and minor amounts of timber getting. Evidence of this remains in fence lines, stockyards, buildings and dams.Junee's Heritage Items The reserve shows signs of damage due to previous pastoral clearing and stock water dam construction, as well as continued predation and competition from introduced animals, especially pigs. Infestations of introduced weeds are also a problem. There is an inholding within the reserve on which telecommunications installations have been constructed. These structures are visible from much of the reserve. Note that, being a nature reserve, members of the public can only enter it if they have permission to do so from the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service.http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/conservation-and-heritage/nature- reserves See also * Protected areas of New South Wales  References  Category:Nature reserves in New South Wales Category:Riverina Category:Southern Tablelands Category:1981 establishments in Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1981 ","title":"Ulandra Nature Reserve"},{"id":"13135663","text":"November 1911 issue Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste (English: International Bulletin of the Syndicalist Movement) was a syndicalist periodical published from 1907 by Christiaan Cornelissen and from 1913 by the International Syndicalist Bureau in Amsterdam.

A change in the bonus rule allowed the Braves to send DeMerit to the minor leagues in , and DeMerit spent most of 1958 and 1959 and all of 1960 in the higher reaches of the Milwaukee farm system. Then in , he spent his only full year in the major leagues. He appeared in only 34 games and hit a poor .162 with 12 hits, but those dozen included his first two MLB home runs, hit off five-time All- Star Larry Jackson April 26 and future Baseball Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax September 15. The Braves left him unprotected in the 1961 National League expansion draft, where he was selected by the Mets with their tenth pick, 20th overall, in the lottery's regular phase. He made the 1962 Mets early-season roster and appeared in 14 games during the season's first month. On May 15, he singled, walked and hit his third big-league home run (off Dick Ellsworth), scoring the winning run in a 6‚Äì5 New York triumph.Retrosheet box score: 1962-5-15 Such victories were rare, as the Mets won only 40 games all season. The two hits were the last of DeMerit's career: he retired at age 26, rather than report to Triple-A when the Mets attempted to farm him out a few days later. For his career, DeMerit hit .174 with 23 hits, three doubles, three home runs and seven runs batted in in 93 games played.

It is the terminus of the Franklin Line. It is located near I-495 and Route 140; it serves as a park-and-ride station for Franklin and other communities southwest of Boston. The station has two side platforms serving a single track - a layout unique on the MBTA system. This allows passengers to access trains from the parking lots on both sides of the track. A mini-high platform on the south platform makes the station accessible. History The $10 million station opened on June 2, 1988 as a extension of the Franklin Line from Franklin/Dean College station. It is located not on the former Norfolk County Railroad mainline (which became the Franklin Line), but on the Milford and Woonsocket Railroad which splits from the mainline south of downtown Franklin. Although still an active freight line, the branch had not seen passenger traffic since 1940. The MBTA leased the branch from Conrail for the extension, with the possibility of future purchase. The developer of the adjacent Forge Park industrial park donated of land to build parking lots for the station. The station was not accessible upon opening; the mini-high platform was added in 1989 along with additional parking and the brick station building.

However, he did appear in sixteen games with the Cardinals, and was on their post-season roster. He struck out in his only plate appearance of the 1946 World Series against the Boston Red Sox in game five. He split between St. Louis and Rochester before earning a starting job with the Cards in . Having originally come up with the Cardinals as a second baseman, he played first base for the 1948 Cardinals, with future Hall of Famer Stan Musial shifting to the outfield. He batted .254 with ten home runs and 81 runs batted in in his first full season for the second place Cardinals. Sacramento Solons Jones remained with the Cardinals through . Following the season, he was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the rule 5 draft. He appeared in only eight games for the Phillies in , spending most of the season with their triple A affiliate, the Baltimore Orioles. He returned to the Sacramento Solons in , who were at that point, unaffiliated. He remained with the club through the beginning of the season. The Milwaukee Braves were in second place behind the Cardinals, and purchased Jones' contract when slugging first baseman Joe Adcock went down with an injury. 1957 World Series and controversy The highlight of his season occurred on July 26, when he hit a walk off home run in the eleventh inning to lift the Braves to a 6‚Äì3 victory over the New York Giants. After finishing second to the Brooklyn Dodgers two years in a row, the Braves won the National League in 1957, and faced the New York Yankees in the World Series. Jones is remembered for being involved in a controversial \\"shoe polish incident\\" in the 1957 Fall Classic. He pinch hit in Games 1 and 3, grounding out both times. Both of those games were won by the Yankees. Game 4 went into extra innings, and when the Yankees took a 5‚Äì4 lead in the tenth, the Braves were looking at the possibility of falling three games to one in the series. Jones led off the Milwaukee half of the tenth inning, pinch hitting for Warren Spahn. He jumped back from a low pitch that home plate umpire Augie Donatelli called a ball. Jones protested that it had hit his foot, and he was awarded first base after showing Donatelli a shoe polish mark on the ball to prove it. Yankees manager Casey Stengel vehemently protested the call, but to no avail. The Braves scored three runs in the tenth, including a two-run home run by Eddie Mathews to end the game and even the series at two games apiece. The play was the turning point in the series, as the Braves went on to win the series in seven games.

J. Smith written in the mid- 1990s. The story follows the protagonist, Kaitlyn Fairchild, as she attends, uncovers a plot, and ultimately defeats the Zetes Institute, a place where she went to learn about her own psychic powers. Kait and the four other psychics at the live-in Zetes Institute are the most powerful psychics in the country in their age group. They come from all areas of the U.S. and become best of friends. The trilogy was published as one book in Trade Paperback and eBook format on September 8, 2009.Books - Dark Visions, Simon & Schuster. In October 2010, L.J. Smith announced that she has planned out a sequel to the trilogy, titled Blindsight. Plot summary The Strange Power Kaitlyn Fairchild is a psychic teenager who is believed to be a witch. Her power is seeing the future. She is able to visualize her premonitions through drawings, but she often cannot interpret them until it is too late. She is offered a place by Joyce Piper, at a psychic research center known as the Zetes Institute, and after seeing a child get hurt, as foreseen by one of her premonitions, she agrees to go to the Institute with four other teenagers who have powers of their own. She quickly befriends three of the other teens, Anna Eva Whiteraven, Lewis Chao and Rob Kessler, and forms feelings for Rob; the fifth psychic, Gabriel Wolfe is aloof and reluctant to form friendships with anyone except Kaitlyn. While at the Institute, they are tested on their psychic abilities, but a mysterious man warns Kaitlyn that the Institute is dangerous, and even the sullen housekeeper Marisol warns them to get out as soon as possible, after which she goes into coma. The psychics become suspicious and begin to believe the warnings about the Institute. They investigate and find a secret passageway, which contains plans to turn them into psychic weapons to sell to major corporations, and a file about Project Black Lightning, a previous project in which other psychics were tested upon and 'terminated'. The teens almost get caught by the head of the Institute, Mr. Zetes, and Gabriel locks the five of them into a psychic link to save them. The link allows them to 'hear' each other's thoughts and communicate, but they cannot get rid of it afterwards so they try to find a way to break the link, but discover that the only way is for one of them to die. Eventually, Mr. Zetes talks to Gabriel and invites him to his mansion to discuss his future, as he believes Gabriel is ready to join him in his plans to create psychic weapons. Kaitlyn overhears the conversation and offers to join too, so she can find out what is really happening. At the mansion, Mr. Zetes shows them a giant crystal that will make them powerful weapons by amplifying their psychic powers but he admits that it can warp minds and make them evil, as he found out with 'Project Black Lightning', and Kaitlyn becomes angry. Mr. Zetes traps Kaitlyn for defying him, and he puts the crystal to Gabriel's forehead to force him to join him, which causes Gabriel great pain and knocks him out. The others use the psychic link to track them and save them, with Joyce helping them, but Joyce reveals herself to be on Mr. Zetes' side. Gabriel awakens from his unconscious state and knocks out Mr. Zetes and Joyce. Rob admits to Kaitlyn that he is in love with her, after he realised he couldn't lose her, and the five psychics escape and decide to flee from the Institute.Smith, L.J. (1994). The Strange Power. New York: Archway. The Possessed The second novel of the trilogy is essentially a journey to an unknown place. After Kaitlyn and the other four psychics have escaped from the Zetes Institute, they find themselves homeless. They dream of a place by the sea with a white house, and they believe it is a vision of a place that will be able to help them find a way to break their telepathic web and fight Mr. Zetes. They manage to get a van and supplies from Marisol's brother, Tony Diaz, who is suspicious that Mr. Zetes is the cause of his sister's sudden coma. For his help, they tell him they will do whatever is in their power to heal Marisol. The group begins to travel North searching for this place with only clues from their dreams. Meanwhile, Gabriel has discovered that the crystal has made him much more powerful, but turned him into a 'psychic vampire' which means he has to drain people of their energy to survive. Kaitlyn discovers this when she finds him leeching life energy from an innocent girl and she offers to help him by giving him her energy, which he is reluctant to accept as he wants to keep his vampirism a secret from the rest of the group, but he takes her offer as his need for energy possesses him. Whilst on the journey, the group become victim to psychic attacks and realise that Mr. Zetes is using other psychics to try to break the group apart. One of the psychic traps causes Kaitlyn to crash their van, and forces the group to hitchhike their way to Anna's family home in Washington State to get help. They are picked up by a girl named Lydia who offers to drive them there; however, Kaitlyn feels suspicious of Lydia without knowing why. Once they arrive at Anna's family home, Anna's parents try to take matters into their own hands and call the police to report Mr Zetes. The group stays the night, and during the night, Kait has a premonition telling them that Lydia is with Mr Zetes. Lydia confesses that she is the daughter of Mr. Zetes, but she tells them that she hates her father and that she is there to help them. She also tells them that the police are powerless against Mr Zetes, so she tells them where the white house is and that 'The People Of the Crystal' who live there may be able to help them. They run away from Anna's house to continue their journey. On the journey, Kaitlyn shares her energy with Gabriel and she finds out that Gabriel is falling in love with her, and then Rob finds out about Gabriel's condition and that Kaitlyn has been helping him, and he feels betrayed by her. They tell the group and Gabriel becomes more determined to find The People of the Crystal because he believes they could help him. A few days later they arrive at the house, and the psychics find out that The People of the Crystal are pacifists and cannot help them; they just want them to join their coven so they can protect them. They also turn down Gabriel as he has killed a person with his power before, which leads him to betray them and join Mr Zetes with Lydia. He calls an attack on The People of the Crystal, which kills their leader and shatters their crystal, leaving them defenceless. They give the other four psychics a shard of the crystal, and tell them it can destroy Mr Zetes' crystal, so they set off to defeat Mr Zetes and get Gabriel back. The Passion This is the final part of the series, and Kaitlyn, Lewis, Rob and Anna are trying to create a plan to defeat Mr Zetes. Gabriel has joined Mr. Zetes, and he finds the other four psychics one night with Tony, at Marisol's house. Gabriel tries to attack Kaitlyn and the others to get the shard of the last perfect crystal they are hiding, as he knows it will destroy Mr Zetes and his personal rise to power. However Gabriel holds back because of his feelings for Kaitlyn, and leaves without the shard. Kaitlyn then leaves the others without telling them, as she believes she can independently infiltrate the Institute by using Gabriel's feelings for her. She finds Gabriel after he rescues her from a man attacking her, and she lies to him by telling him that she left everything for him and that she wants to be on his side; the 'winning side'. Gabriel brings her to the Institute, and she is settled in with the previous psychics from project \\"Black Lightning\\", to create a psychic strike team. These psychics are Sabrina Jessica Gallo (Bri), Laurie Frost (Frost), Paul Renfrew (Renny) and John MacCorkendale (Jackal Mac), all of which are mentally twisted and psychic vampires because of the crystal. Kaitlyn tries to convince them all that she is on their side, whilst gathering information on them and trying to find the location of Mr Zetes crystal. Gabriel becomes suspicious of Kait when she refuses to share her energy with him, and he believes she is a spy and threatens to kill her if she gets in his way of his rise to power, after which he shuns her for Frost and regards her coldly. Kaitlyn passes the Institute's test by committing a felony of $20 million with the psychic strike team, which leads them to trust her, except for Gabriel who is waiting for her to get caught out as a spy. Kaitlyn is eventually caught by Mr Zetes when she cracks the code for the location of the crystal, and he puts her in an isolation tank, where he hopes she will be driven to insanity. Gabriel becomes worried about Kaitlyn when he can no longer feel her presence in the psychic link and he reaches out for her with his telepathy. He helps her preserve her mind by showing her memories and communicating with her, and they both confess their true depths of feelings for each other. When Mr Zetes takes Kaitlyn out the isolation tank, he realises his plan has not worked and he takes Kaitlyn to the crystal to destroy her mind. Rob, Anna, Lewis and Tamsin from the fellowship of the crystal, turn up to rescue them, and they succeed in destroying the crystal and Mr Zetes when Gabriel unites the shard with the evil crystal. When the crystal is shattered, Joyce's mind and the other psychic's minds are returned to them, and they realise the mistakes they made in joining Mr Zetes. After that, Kaitlyn realises her affections have shifted from Rob to Gabriel and she is torn between the two, but when Rob is healing Gabriel's injuries from the crystal, he finds cuts and burns on Gabriel's arm and he realises that he had been hurting himself to stay in contact with Kait when she was in isolation. He asks Gabriel if he loves Kaitlyn and he admits he does, so Rob lets go of Kaitlyn and gives her and Gabriel his blessings to be together, and Kait telepathically gives Anna blessings to be with Rob as she knows they are meant to be together. The story ends with Frost and Jackal Mac running away, while Bri, Renny and Joyce decide to go with Tamsin to the Fellowship of the People of the Crystal. Rob, Anna and Lewis also decide to go to the People of the Crystal, as they believe they can help there and Rob feels it's his destiny to heal there, and Marisol returns after being healed by the shard of the crystal. The final scene is of Lewis taking a photograph of everyone linked together Characters Kaitlyn Fairchild Kaitlyn Brady Fairchild, known as Kait, is the 17-year-old protagonist of the series. Her psychic talent is that she (usually subconsciously) creates drawings that are premonitions. Her inability to understand the drawings until too late drives her to attend the Zetes Institute. Her psychic powers and strange appearance make her different and disliked by her classmates in Ohio. Even though she is considered beautiful people believe she is a witch. Because of this, she is strong- willed, stubborn, defensive and dislikes boys in the beginning of the series. As she moves to San Carlos, CA and joins the Institute, she begins to soften. She even falls for the sweet hearted boy Rob, but later on falls in love with Gabriel and they get together and Rob gives them his blessing. Kaitlyn is described as having long red hair, fair skin, and smoky blue eyes with darker rings of blue around the pupil. Kait's Group * Rob Kessler (also seventeen) is a North Carolina native and another attendee of the Zetes Institute. His power is the ability to heal by manipulating life energy (also described as chi or \\"qi\\"). He discovered these powers after a hang-gliding accident when he was fourteen, which left him in a coma for some time. He then attended another psychic research facility in Durham, NC, where he originally met Gabriel Wolfe. The accident also seems to have taken away Rob's awareness of \\"girls\\", and at the start of the trilogy, he is unable to conceive of anything beyond a platonic relationship with a girl. However, by the end of The Strange Power, he and Kait are romantically linked. Rob is described as having blonde hair and golden eyes. His aura is warm, bright and calm. * Gabriel Wolfe (also seventeen) is the ambiguous character that eventually joins the light side. He comes to the Zetes Institute from jail, having previously killed by accident and in self-defense. He is a telepath, and when he uses his power on minds that are weaker than his, he drains those people of their life energy. He later has to drain peoples life energy to stay alive (The Possessed and The Passion), and Kaitlyn helps him by giving him her energy. His power is described as the most powerful of the group.Smith, L.J. (1995). The Possessed. p. 40. New York: Archway. He is antagonistic towards Rob and is indifferent to the others in the group, besides Kait. As the series progresses, Kait's romantic feelings gradually shift from Rob to Gabriel. Gabriel also has romantic interest in Kait but tries to deny it. Gabriel is described as having black hair, pale skin, and dark grey eyes. His aura is aggressive, mysterious and dark. * Anna Eva Whiteraven (also seventeen) is the only other girl at the Zetes Institute and is from Washington State. She is Native American and described as having long black hair. She is very peaceful and gentle girl who becomes Kait's roommate at the Institute. Her psychic abilities allow her to communicate with animals and control them. She has romantic interest in Rob the whole series but respects Kait's prior claim on him; eventually she becomes the love interest for Rob. Her aura is serene and natural. * Lewis Chao (also seventeen) is from San Francisco and is the last of the group at the Zetes Institute. He is Asian-American and described to be friendly and obsessed with technology. He has the ability of psychokinesis, the ability to move (small) objects with his mind; later he uses his abilities to jam radio frequencies, set off telephones, even open hidden doors. He is Rob's roommate at the Institute. He also has an interest for Lydia. He is described as having short black hair and almond shaped eyes. His aura is optimistic and funny. Zetes Institute * Emmanuel Zetes is the villain of the story. He is very wealthy and founded the Zetes Institute for research on psychic phenomena. However, it is revealed that the Institute is actually preparing psychics to perform as a special for-hire task force for criminal activities. He is the owner of a \\"firestone\\" or \\"great crystal\\", which can store and enhance psychic energy. * Joyce Piper is the parapsychologist at the Zetes Institute. At first, she is very friendly and earnest. However, it is revealed at the end of The Strange Power that she is in on a plot to use the psychics for crime. But later, she turns out that she was good after all. * Marisol Diaz is an assistant at the Institute and helps Joyce run experiments as well as perform household duties. Marisol worked for the Zetes Foundation before Joyce and was involved in the mysterious pilot experiment that took place before the Kait and her fellow psychics arrived. Early on, Marisol tries to warn Kait about strange happenings at the Institute and ends up in a coma for most of the series. * Lydia Zetes is the eighteen-year-old daughter of Mr. Zetes. She is sent as a spy into Kait's group in The Possessed and eventually joins, then betrays the group. She is timid and afraid of her father and the dark psychics, but eventually helps Kait in the end. * The Dark Psychics are the psychics that participated in the pilot experiment that preceded Kait and the other's arrival. They were the best young psychics in the San Francisco area, but their powers proved to be insufficient to withstand contact with Mr. Zetes' crystal. They are described as having been reduced to \\"insanity and idiocy.\\" However, once Kait's group leaves the Institute, Mr. Zetes gathers these psychics to find the group and destroy the Fellowship. Because of their use of the crystal, they are psychic vampires and need an outside source of life energy (from other people or from the crystal) to survive. The dark psychics include: ** Sabrina Jessica Gallo's (also known as Bri) psychic power is dowsing, or being able to locate something from afar. She joins Kait's group in the end. ** Laurie Frost's (known as Frost) psychic ability is psychometry, or being able to determine someone's thoughts and feelings by touch. She has an antagonistic relationship with Kait, partially because of her romantic relationship with Gabriel. ** Paul Renfrew (known as Renny) has, like Lewis, psychokinesis and can move objects with his mind. He also joins Kait's group in the end. ** John MacCorkendale (known as Jackal Mac) has the ability to perform astral projection of his own body and to lead others. He is also antagonistic towards Kait and tries to take life energy from her at one point. ** Sasha and Part√© King (real names unknown) lost their minds because of the crystal. Their powers became very strong, but they are no longer aware or human-like. Mr. Zetes uses them as guards of the crystal. The Fellowship The Fellowship are the remaining members of an ancient race of psychics that lived before recorded human history. These members were able to predict the fall of this civilization and went to live in peace and simplicity in Canada. Their civilization used crystals, but unlike the crystal of Mr. Zetes, these crystals were pure and produced no bad side effects. These members have the last remaining pure crystal and are able to live hundreds of years, with the energy of the crystal sustaining them. They are pacifists and invite Kait and the others to live with them and hide from Mr. Zetes. Members of the Fellowship include: * LeShan is the member of the Fellowship that makes contact with Kait and tries to warn her of the dangers at the Zetes Institute. He is one of the younger members and is less set in the traditional ways of the Fellowship. * Timon is one of the oldest members of the Fellowship and a default leader. He is resistant to change at first, but once he senses the evilness of the dark psychics, he realizes that some battles must be fought. * Mereniang is another leader of the Fellowship (though she defers to Timon). She is the most set in the traditional ways of the Fellowship. * Tamsin is one of the youngest members of the Fellowship. Her relative youth allows her to leave the protection of the crystal. She is sent as a messenger at times. References Category:Works by L. J.

Formed in 1898 as a volunteer unit of the colonial Victorian Military Forces, the unit went through a number of changes in name over the course of its 62-year history. During World War I many of its members volunteered for overseas service and saw action at Gallipoli and on the Western Front in France. Following the end of the war, the regiment was reorganised to perpetuate the honours of the 5th Battalion, AIF. During World War II the battalion was employed on garrison duties in Australia, although many of its members volunteered for overseas service and fought in campaigns in North Africa, the Middle East and New Guinea. Following the war, the battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizen Military Forces and undertook the training of national servicemen until 1960 when the unit was disbanded and absorbed into the 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. Today, the regiment's traditions are maintained by 'B' Company, 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. History The Victorian Scottish Regiment (VSR) was first raised on 29 August 1898, following representations by members of the local Scottish Community and Caledonian association for several years, for the establishment of Scottish unit. Notable members of this group were Sir John McIntyre, Sir Malcolm McEachren, Colonel Otter, Richard Linton, W. B. Jarvie and W. J. McKirdie. The regiment was formed at Albert Park, with a parade ground at Victoria Barracks, and was originally raised as a corps of unpaid volunteers as part of the colonial Victorian Military Forces. Initially the regiment was only issued with a limited about of equipment and had to parade in plain clothes for almost a year until uniforms could be provided. In 1902, the volunteer system was changed to a system of partially paid militia and the military forces of the former independent colonies became part of the Commonwealth Military Forces. In 1911 a compulsory training scheme was introduced, which required all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 21 to undertake a period of military training. At this time, the regiment was redesignated as the 52nd Australian Infantry Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment), and voluntary enlistment was restricted to officers and senior non- commissioned officers. Members of the 52nd Australian Infantry Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment) in Melbourne, c. 1914. AWM Image # P00591.017 Upon the outbreak of World War I the decision was made not to deploy the previously existing militia units to the fighting overseas due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 which precluded sending conscripts outside of Australia.Grey 2008, p. 85. An all-volunteer force, known as the First Australian Imperial Force was raised instead and many members of the militia volunteered for overseas service. One of the units raised for overseas service was the 5th Battalion, and many members of the 52nd Australian Infantry Battalion joined this unit, including the battalion's commanding officer, Colonel David Stanley Wanliss, who would later become Chief Justice of New Guinea. This battalion fought at during the Gallipoli campaign and on the Western Front and many of the men continued to wear the VSR's distinctive Glengarry caps. During the war, the militia units remained in Australia on home service, providing security at ports, defence installations and other facilities of importance to the war effort, however, due to the large numbers of militiamen that volunteered for service with the AIF many of these units were greatly depleted and it was not until after the war, in 1919, that the compulsory training scheme began again. In 1921 the AIF was officially disbanded and the following month it was decided to reorganise the militia units and to redesignate them in order to perpetuate the identity of the AIF units that had fought in the war.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result of this decision, and due to the links that the regiment had with the 5th Battalion, AIF, the regiment was redesignated as the 5th Battalion and inherited that unit's battle honours. In 1925 permission was granted for the unit to adopt the traditional title of the regiment. In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was suspended again and a period of austerity followed as the impact of the Great Depression meant that there were few volunteers and few training opportunities as funding for defence was greatly reduced.Grey 2008, p. 138. Members of the 5th Battalion, VSR on parade in April 1940. In early 1940 the battalion was called up for a three-month period of continuous service as part of nation's mobilisation during World War II. AWM Image # 001246 Following the outbreak of World War II the battalion was called up for a three-month period of compulsory training in early 1940, before later being sent to Western Australia and then Darwin, Northern Territory where they carried out garrison duties throughout the war. Many members of the battalion also volunteered for service overseas with the Second Australian Imperial Force, serving with the 2/5th Battalion, which fought in Libya, Greece, Crete, Syria and New Guinea. In 1948, the 5th Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment) was re-raised as part of the Citizen Military Forces (CMF), which was the forerunner to the Australian Army Reserve. Commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel George Warfe, a highly decorated officer that had previously served with a number of commando units during the war, the battalion was headquartered at Hawthorn and had depots at Dandenong, Kew, Armadale and Surrey Hills. National service was reintroduced in 1951 and following this the battalion took on the responsibility of training national servicemen under this scheme. This continued until 1960, when the national service scheme was suspended and the Australian Army was reorganised around the Pentropic division.Grey 2008, p. 228. As a result of this reorganisation the CMF was greatly reduced, as fourteen infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while the seventeen that remained gave up their old regional regimental ties and were reformed as part of the six newly raised State-based regiments. As a result of this, it was decided that the 5th Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment) would be disbanded and its members be absorbed into the newly raised Royal Victoria Regiment, being used to form two companies‚Äî'B' and Support‚Äîof the 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. In 1965, when the decision was made to reintroduce national service and abandon the Pentropic division, the CMF was reorganised again. At the same time the decision was made to reintroduce the designations of the old militia units by splitting the two Pentropic battalions of the Royal Victoria Regiment to form four full battalions and one independent company. As a result, the 5th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment was formed in May 1965, although with the end of national service in 1972 the battalion's numbers began to decline and by 1975 the decision was made to amalgamate the unit into the 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. In 1982, the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (5/6 RVR) was raised in Melbourne, Victoria. Today, 'B' Coy, 5/6 RVR maintains the traditions of the Victorian Scottish Regiment. Colours laid up in Scots' Church In light of the long association between the Victorian Scottish Regiment and Scots' Church, Melbourne the colours reside in the church, identified by three plaques. As such, the centennial of the raising of the Victorian Scottish Regiment was marked by a church parade attended by former members of the regiment and 'B' Company, 5th/6th Battalion, The Royal Victoria Regiment.

A right-hander, he was listed as tall and . He was a member of the 1957 World Series champion Braves. Playing career Minor leagues Born in Hudson, New York, Trowbridge was signed in 1950 by the Boston Braves, and won 16 games in his debut season in the Class C Northern League. He then spent three full seasons (1951‚Äì53) in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. Trowbridge resumed his baseball career in 1954, winning 18 games in the Class A Sally League. Major League Baseball After he followed that by posting a 13‚Äì8 record in Triple-A in 1955, Trowbridge made the Braves' MLB roster in out of spring training. He was used sparingly as a relief pitcher in the season's early weeks and sent back to Triple-A in May to get more work. Recalled at the end of June, he became a \\"swing man\\" on the Milwaukee pitching staff, getting four starts and 13 relief assignments over the rest of the season.

In the 1957 World Series, he appeared in one inning in relief of Game 3. Inheriting a 7‚Äì3 deficit to the New York Yankees, Trowbridge allowed only two hits, but he issued three bases on balls and surrendered five earned runs, three of them coming on a home run by Tony Kubek.Retrosheet box score: 1957 World Series Game 3 It would be his only Fall Classic appearance, but the Braves triumphed in seven games to become world champions.

His final appearance in 1959, and as a Brave, occurred on August 18, five weeks before Milwaukee met the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1959 National League tie-breaker series.

The Illinois Freedom Bell is located in Mount Morris, Illinois, and was cast as a replica of the Liberty Bell in 1862.Illinois Official Freedom Bell Retrieved on September 3, 2007 Following its casting, the bell was transported to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where it was kept in the belfry of a church along the north shore of Geneva Lake. In 1910, the church was destroyed by a fire; the bell fell during the fire but was undamaged; following the fire, the bell was put into storage.Beetler, Dianne L. \\"The Freedom Bell\\", Illinois Magazine, Vol. 30, No. 4, July‚ÄìAugust 1991, p. 15 The church members then decided to reconstruct the church on the south side of the lake. During the winter, as a group of men attempted to drag the bell across the frozen lake, the weight of the bell cracked the ice and it sank to the bottom. The bell remained submerged for over 40 years before a wealthy resident of Lake Geneva decided to surface the bell in 1960. The resident located the bell, and surfaced it with great difficulty, intent on making the future Illinois Freedom Bell the focal point of his new home. After the bell was salvaged he decided it did not suit his purposes. A young farmer from Johnsburg purchased the bell, and it was again kept in storage.Anonymous \\"Village Freedom Bell Has 104-year History\\", Mount Morris Index, No. 2, Thursday, March 10, 1966, p. 1 In 1966, an article was published about the bell's submersion and resurfacing at Geneva Lake. The article interested the people of Mount Morris, Illinois, and they sent 12 members of their Fourth of July Committee to investigate the bell in Johnsburg.Mount Morris' interest in the bell stemmed from the village becoming the first community in Illinois to reinstate bell ringing on Independence Day. See \\"Illinois Official Freedom Bell\\" The people of Mount Morris decided to purchase the bell; a committee was formed and obtained a loan from the Mount Morris VFW. The group also collected donations from local residents to purchase the bell for US$500. By July 4, 1966, the Illinois Freedom Bell hung from the gazebo in its current location, and the two writers who first suggested bell ringing as an annual Independence Day ceremony, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane were on hand for its dedication. Five years later, in 1971, the bell was designated the Official Freedom Bell of the State of Illinois by Illinois Governor Richard B. Ogilvie.Mount Morris, Illinois Retrieved on September 3, 2007 A plaque was added to the tower on July 4, 1972 with an inscription from Governor Ogilvie that reads: Festival On February 17, 1963, an issue of This Week contained an article, \\"Make Freedom Really Ring\\", written by two Connecticut writers, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane. In the article, they suggested that every July 4, all bells in the country ring for four minutes, and radio stations broadcast the ringing for two minutes. Readers across the country took the advice of the magazine's editor, and contacted local officials in support of a nationwide bell-ringing observance. Concurrently, a resolution was proposed in Congress by Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff that called for the ringing of bells nationwide at 2 p.m every July 4. Eastern Daylight Time.

Even though many states sponsored bell-ringings, Hatch and Sloane both credited Mount Morris with making their suggestion a reality. The Illinois Freedom Bell is annually rung in unison, at 1 pm CDT (18:00 UTC) on the Independence Day, July 4, with other bells across the United States. Thousands of people gather in the village to hear the bell each year on Independence Day. In Mount Morris, the annual event is known as the Let Freedom Ring festival. The Mount Morris festival and bell ringing has been attended by several notable individuals.

One of the biggest barriers to antidepressants coming to the market is that the medical insurance system in Japan is national, and the authorities are keen to contain a potentially explosive market for drugs like antidepressants that could be used or abused by persons in various forms of distress. Although large epidemiological studies have not been done in Japan, it is thought that up to 6 million Japanese suffer from depression, with a lifetime prevalence of 13 to 17.3%, which is similar to that seen in Western countries. Market While the market has seen the entry of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and escitalopram; others such as citalopram and fluoxetine are either pending approval or no longer being considered. Prior to year 2000 and possibly even later, clinical developments did not use placebo controlled trials; instead they have pitted candidate drugs against those currently approved for that indication using a \\"non- inferiority\\" method of comparison. This method is known to be subject to placebo effects (e.g. depressive symptoms lifting due to effects other than pharmacologic drug effect.) According to a Japanese medical report in 2002, Trazodone and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were widely available in Japan while only two SSRIs (paroxetine and fluvoxamine) were marketed. Fluvoxamine was the first SSRI to be approved in Japan (1999) sertraline received approval in April 2006, having been pending approval for over 15 years. Life Sciences World - Online resource for biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical devices and life sciences industries. Currently (as of 2017) the three most sold antidepressants in Japan are duloxetine, mirtazapine, and escitalopram (Lexapro). The three most sold antidepressants by the end of 2010 were paroxetine with a value market share of 37%, sertraline with a share of 20% and fluvoxamine with a share of 15%. The Japan algorithm for mood disorders does not include many of the post-tricyclic antidepressants used as first-line antidepressants in Western countries for almost two decades, and recent studies are still comparing SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, even though tricyclics are clearly 2nd or 3rd line treatments in the West. Organon International and Meiji Seika have filed an application for approval of mirtazapine in Japan, a drug on the market in many Western countries since 1994.Antidepressant Mirtazapine (Remeron) Submitted For Approval In Japan. Meiji Seika is commercializing mirtrazapine(brand name Reflex) in Japan which was approved for depression in 2009. SNRI Duloxetine (Cymbalta - Shionogi and Eli Lilly Japan) was first approved in Japan in 2010 for major depressive disorder. In the following years it gained approval for diabetic neuropathy pain, fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis. Citalopram (Lundbeck), an SSRI on the market since the late 1980s is not available in Japan, however on April 22, 2011 escitalopram (the S-isomer enantiomer of citalopram), was approved for use. There is little news, however, on the status of bupropion (Glaxo Smith-Kline), used widely in Western countries since the early 1990s and long in clinical trials in Japan. Takeda and Lundbeck submitted vortioxetine (Trintellix) to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. If approved it may be commercialized in 2019.

She served in the Texas Navy for only about 6 months, capturing the Mexican brig Pelicano loaded with weapons for their army in Texas. Later that year, she sailed to New Orleans accompanying the wounded Sam Houston, where she was repaired. Texas was unable to pay for the repairs and the ship was sold in June, 1836, to pay for the cost of the repairs. This left the Texas Navy with only three ships. History of the schooner before the Texas Navy She was previously the privately owned ship William Robbins which was purchased in November 1835, by the rebellious citizens of Matagorda when the Texas-bound schooner Hannah Elizabeth was captured by the Mexican Navy brig Bravo. Hannah Elizabeth was laden with weapons and ammunition for the Texas Revolution and she was seized and run aground at Pass Cavallo, throwing her cannons overboard during the chase. Days later the Williams Robbins was placed under the command of Captain William A. Hurd who captured the Mexican Man-of-war Correo de Mejico and recaptured the Hannah Elizabeth from the Mexican prize crew and took both ships to Galveston.Texas State Library Archives These actions were controversial in some quarters because they were done before the William Robbins was granted a letter of marque from the fledgling Texas government.Son of the South website The William Robbins was purchased by the Texas government in Galveston on January 5, 1836, for the sum of $3,500 and was christened the Liberty.

Texas State Historical Association Service in the Texas Navy Naval scene from Republic of Texas currency, the $50 bill (1838) Captain William S. Brown, whose brother Jeremiah Brown commanded one of the other Texas ships, Invincible, was appointed commander of the schooner in January 1836. Later that month, he set to sea to harry Mexican naval efforts to blockade the Texas coast from further shipments of arms and volunteers and at the same time to disrupt Mexican supplies from reaching their troops in Texas by sea. On March 6, while on a cruise towards the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Liberty captured the three-gun Mexican schooner Pelicano under the guns of the fortress at Sisal. Pelicano was sailed into Matagorda Bay and she \\"proved to contain 300 kegs of powder and other military supplies concealed inside cargo owned by the New Orleans firm of J.W. Zacharie.

In New Orleans, Liberty undertook repairs. \\"[U]nable to meet her refitting bills, [she] was detained in May 1836 and later sold to satisfy her creditors - an event which illustrated the shoestring budget under which the Texas Navy was forced to work despite the demands on it.\\" With Liberty sold, the Texas Navy now was down to three ships, and peaceful independence was still elusive for Texas. The crew seeks prize money Years later, the crew of the Liberty petitioned the Texas Congress for a share of the prize money of the Pelicano.

It is now the site of a City of Shoalhaven managed picnic area and Danjera Dam. Yalwal is also the name of a modern locality, which includes the former mining town but extends over an extensive area of forests to its south, which largely forms parts of the Morton National Park. It is also the name of a parish, which lies to the north of the former mining town and generally north of the locality of Yalwal, generally in the area of the modern locality of Ettrema. Prior to European settlement this was Wandandian Aboriginal land. Mining Gold was first discovered in the area by Rev W.B. Clarke in 1852. Successful sluicing operations began in 1870 by J. Sivewright and party but were disrupted by the great flood of 1871. In 1872 open cut mining operations were begun at the Pinnacle when the main reef was discovered.A date of 1873 reported in An Introduction to the Geology of New South Wales, C.A. Sussmilch, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1914 The first shafts were sunk in the Homeward Bound mine in 1872 with payable gold found in 1874.According to Rex Fletcher (who lived in the area) in Yalwal Gold, David Glasson, Sprint Print, Ballina, 1987 In 1875, the first stamp battery (5 head) was erected. In 1880 a mail receiving station was opened and in 1884 a public school opened, it closed in 1918, reopened in 1924 and finally closed in 1928. Yalwal Post Office opened on 1 January 1883. In 1895 the nearby Grassy Gully mine was discovered. In 1890 all the usable scrap iron in the town was bought by scrap dealers from Nowra. Further dismantling of the town occurred during the First World War when building materials were used for the war effort. 1934 was the last discovery with the Fountainhead. In 1939 devastating bushfire destroyed most of what was left of the town with only one residence, one shop and the Post Office surviving. There was one fatality. Mining operations after the fire dwindled until 1971 when the Shoalhaven Council finished construction of the Danjera Dam which flooded most of the former town site and the lower mines. Some mine shafts and other diggings, the graveyard (the oldest grave dated 1854) and a stamping battery (five head) can still be seen. Of the 35 or so mine workings accessible by foot (or canoe) some are safe enough for a young child to walk and climb through whilst others are extremely dangerous. If in doubt, don't enter. The main mine workings are about 15 minutes walk from the car park and can entertain for the entire day. There are two maps of the mines known to be in existence with the latter from the mid-1990s, prepared by a local surveyor/town planner is considered the most accurate. The area is now the site of Danjera Dam a part of the Shoalhaven water supply and the site of a picnic area. Canoeing and swimming are allowed on the Dam but power boats are prohibited. The Dam stretches 7 km to the south with some good bass fishing. The previous beautiful upstream grassy river banks have been lost due to a lack of cattle grazing, these areas are now overgrown with blackberries. The valleys of the area cut into Devonian quartzite and phyllites while the plateau consists of Permian sandstones. Rhyolite and granite also outcrop in the area.

The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of regular infantry divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 221st Infantry Brigade was formerly the 38th Infantry Brigade of the 19th Infantry Division, which came to the new division along with the 73rd F√ºsilier Regiment. The 76th Infantry Regiment came from the 17th Infantry Division. The 164th Infantry Regiment was formerly part of the 20th Infantry Division. The 73rd F√ºsiliers and the 164th Infantry were Hanoverian regiments, and the 76th was the regiment of the Hanseatic City of Hamburg.

It fought in several engagements, and was then transferred to the front in the Flanders and Artois region. The division fought in the battle by La Bass√©e and Arras in June 1915, and in the Battle of Loos in September and October 1915. It remained in positional warfare in the Flanders and Artois region into 1916, and fought in the Battle of the Somme. The division remained in the trenchlines in the Somme region into 1917. In April and May, it fought in the Battle of Arras. Later in the year, it fought in the Battle of Passchendaele, also known as the Third Battle of Ypres. In 1918, the division participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the Second Battle of the Somme (1918). It remained in the line except for brief respites until the end of the war.

The character is an adversary of Marvel's mutant characters, including the X-Men. Fictional character biography After learning of Emma Frost's plan to have X-23 leave the school, Cessily Kincaid takes X-23 to Salem Center for coffee to cool Laura down. Facility agents led by the Weapon Plus program (including X-23's former handler Kimura) come for one of them. Laura, believing it is her, begs Cessily to leave, but not before Kimura shoots Cessily with an electric bullet, stopping her from doing anything, and stating that they were actually there for Cessily. After capturing her, Kimura leaves before Laura can recuperate from the grenade blast. At the lab, Cessily questions who they are and what they want but is given no answers. When she replies that her friends will come for her, Kimura informs that \\"The Elephant\\" said the same thing while showing her a picture of his corpse in a cell. Stryker, before dying, had requested a living weapon to combat the coming of the mutant Anti-Christ, predicted by Nimrod. Three huge beasts called \\"Predator X\\" were created and Mercury's metal skin was needed to give them more durability and powers. Gruesome experiments partly stripped the girl of the needed biometal, granting the beasts her powers and leaving her in extreme pain. Two of the beasts are killed, one by the *O*N*E* Sentinels, the other by X-23 and the third escaped. The experiments left her physically and mentally traumatized. The Purifiers began tracking Predator X, in hopes of using it as a weapon against their mutant enemies and William Stryker's predicted \\"Anti- Christ\\" in particular. It was shown to have killed and eaten a rodent-like American mutant. Horribly scarred by Dust's attack, Matthew Risman is fixated on training Predator X to seek out and kill Sooraya by using abayas and niqƒÅbs bearing some recognizable quality of hers (possibly her scent). While being trained to seek out and kill Dust, Predator X senses the mutant it was originally created to destroy, turns and heads off to find it and the Purifiers follow. During the Messiah Complex storyline, Predator X arrived in Cooperstown, Alaska looking for the child with the X-Gene, pausing to feast upon the bodies of Blockbuster and Prism. Predator X continued its search, devouring an unnamed fire-breathing mutant, and later the mutant known as Peepers.X-Factor v3 #26 (Feb 2008) It then made its way to the X-Mansion. Upon arrival, it dug up the graves of dead mutants from the bus attack caused by the Purifiers and began consuming those bodies. Dust, Mercury and Rockslide came across Predator X when Dust went to pay her respects to the dead.X-Factor v3 #27 (Mar 2008) After a brief fight with Rockslide, it headed toward the mansion and came across Trance, Indra and Wolf Cub. Surge jumped in to protect them and instructed any students to head to the infirmary. In pursuit of the wounded mutants, Predator X then managed to get past Surge and attack the infirmary, although Gentle and Armor attempted to stop it. Pixie remembered that X-23 killed a Predator X and teleported the New X-Men, Beast and the injured mutants to Muir Island. Upon arrival Predator X killed and ate Vertigo and immediately tried to attack Cable, the baby and Bishop. Bishop attacked the creature when it got between him and the baby, and Predator X ripped off and swallowed his right arm. X-Force arrived, and in the ensuing battle, Wolverine destroyed Predator X by letting it swallow him and tearing his way out of the Predator's stomach. However, another Predator X has appeared in the pages of Astonishing Tales under the command of Viper, so it remains to be seen how many creatures exist.Astonishing Tales vol. 2 #1-6 Following the events of Utopia, Scalphunter was recently kidnapped by a group of non-mutant superhumans. They proclaim to want to save all of mutantkind, but force him to fly a plane with 5 of the creatures onto Utopia. Nightcrawler is sent to investigate Scalphunter's intentions as he approaches the island. Upon teleporting to the plane, he retreats to the surface screaming for Cyclops to shoot the plane down before it can land.Uncanny X-Men #516 Cyclops manages to shoot the plane down. However, four Predator Xs managed to make it to Utopia. The X-Men, Namor, and Magneto band together to defeat and slay them.Uncanny X-Men #517 Iceman is also seen burning the bodies of the slain Predator Xs.Uncanny X-Men #518 A sixth Predator X has been revealed to be prowling the sewers of New York as it attacks an unidentified Mutant girl.Uncanny X-Men #519 Wolverine, Psylocke, and Colossus fly there to hunt it down, but discover that Fantomex has already killed it.Uncanny X-Men #520 Powers and abilities Created by the scientists of the Facility and having absorbed some of Mercury's bio-metal skin, Predator X is highly resistant to physical damage, being able to draw in materials from the surrounding environment to help reform itself. The beast also possesses superhuman strength and endurance, as well as the ability to track mutants by their genetic signature alone. Predator X is essentially tireless, able to track and pursue prey without pause for great distances and lengths of time, eventually wearing the target down before going for the kill. A new ability was seen in the Messiah Complex, where it was seen to project a toxic acidic saliva over the X-Man Hepzibah. The creature was reported to run at speeds of for nineteen hours without slowing down.New X-Men #43 This, combined with its regenerative abilities, means that the creature can hunt down even a determined and powerful mutant and come out victorious. Predator X does appear to be vulnerable to energy blasts, as the two other creatures were swiftly dispatched by the energy weapons of an O.N.E. Sentinel or Hellion's telekinesis. The Predator's insides are not as durable as its skin; Wolverine killed it by ripping it apart from the inside out. Victims of Predator X So far the main Predator X, as well as later ones, are responsible for the deaths of some mutants, as well as others. These mutants include in order: * MammomaxNew X-Men #34 * An unnamed rodent-like mutant. * Eaten the bodies of Prism and Blockbuster.X-Men: Messiah Complex #1 * An unnamed fire-breathing mutant.New X-Men #44 * PeepersX-Factor #26 * Eaten many of the unidentified bodies of the students killed in the Purifier's bus attack. * VertigoNew X-Men #46 * An unnamed mutant girl living in the New York City Subway system.

History Greg Jackson was born in Washington D.C. to Kris and Jim Jackson, who were Quakers originally from the Midwest. Jackson and his family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico when he was three years old. Jackson came from a family of wrestlers (his father, brother, and uncle were all champions in the sport). Jackson grew up in a rough neighborhood, and began learning martial arts to defend himself. As a result, he was suspended from school for instigating fights on more than one occasion. In 1992, after graduating from Rio Grande High School, Jackson founded his own martial art, Gaidojutsu, which combines rudimentary techniques from catch wrestling and kickboxing with basic BJJ and judo locks. His school officially turned into an MMA school in 2000. In 2007, Jackson teamed up with striking coach Mike Winkeljohn, which was a seminal moment for Jackson's academy; since then, the gym has been known as Jackson Wink MMA Academy (JW MMA Academy),Wright, Rick (August 3, 2014) MMA: Coaching team has it all covered, Albuquerque Journal Retrieved October 15, 2014 representing the partnership between Jackson and Winkeljohn.

The correct name for the cartridge, as listed by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI), is 270 WSM, without a decimal point.Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute It is a member of the Winchester Short Magnum family of cartridges. Overview .270 WSM left, .270 Win on the right When it was introduced, the 300 WSM sported a new case that showed a lot of promise for uses in other calibers. In 2002 Winchester introduced new cartridges in its Winchester Short Magnum family, including the 7 mm WSM and 270 WSM. This new .270 cartridge was the third commercial .270 ever produced, and the first one in 60 years. The 270 WSM is an improvement over the older 270 Winchester providing higher velocity with bullets of the same weight, and thus a flatter trajectory and more energy. Velocities tend to be about faster, in a cartridge that is shorter and can therefore be used in a shorter action resulting in a more compact rifle if desired. Performance The 270 WSM is the only cartridge of the WSM family that produces notable ballistic gains over other existing cartridges. The .300 WSM closely mimics the long-popular .300 Winchester Magnum, while the 7mm WSM matches performance of the 7mm Remington Magnum in similar barrel lengths. The .325 WSM is in a league of its own in North America as the 8 mm caliber has not become commonplace.http://www.chuckhawks.com/short_magnums.htm The 270 WSM comes quite close in performance to that of the legendary .270 Weatherby Magnum.

Beginning in 1940, he served as director of Memorial Hospital for Cancer Research in New York, from 1945 was the first director of Sloan-Kettering Institute, and the first director of the combined Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center. For his contributions to cancer research, Rhoads was featured on the cover of the June 27, 1949 issue of Time magazine under the title \\"Cancer Fighter\\".\\"Medicine: Frontal Attack\\", Time. 27 June 1949, accessed 21 October 2013 During his early years with the Rockefeller Institute in the 1930s, Rhoads specialized in anemia and leukemia, working for six months in Puerto Rico in 1932 as part of the Rockefeller Foundation International Health Board contingent. During World War II, he worked for the United States Army helping to develop chemical weapons and set up research centers. Research on mustard gas led to developments for its use in chemotherapy at Sloan Kettering. In early 1932, a letter Rhoads had written in November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and makes claims (which he referred to later as jokes) he had intentionally injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, which led to a scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests.The Rhoads Not Given: The Tainting of the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award. Rosenthal, Eric T. Oncology Times. 10 September 2003. Volume 25. Issue 17. pp. 19-20. Retrieved 8 January 2013. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten. In 2002, the controversy was revived. Alerted to the incident, American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which had established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award in 1979, commissioned a new investigation.Rosenthal, Eric T. \\"The Rhoads Not Given: The Tainting of the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award\\", Oncology Times, 10 September 2003. Volume 25. Issue 17. pp. 19-20. Retrieved 17 December 2012. It was led by Jay Katz, emeritus professor at Yale Law School and a specialist in medical ethics. He concluded there was no evidence of unethical human experimentation, but the letter was so offensive that the prize should be renamed. AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his racism. Early life and education Rhoads was born June 20, 1898, in Springfield, Massachusetts, as the son of an ophthalmologist, Dr. George H. Rhoads, and his wife.Stephen Hunter & John Bainbridge; American Gunfight: The Plot to Kill Harry Truman, pp. 194-195; Simon & Schuster pub., 2005; He received his early education in Springfield, later attending Bowdoin College in Maine, where he graduated in 1920. He entered Harvard Medical School, where he became class president, and in 1924, he received his M.D., cum laude. Rhoads became an intern at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, and contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. During his treatment and recovery, he developed a lifelong interest in disease research. Early career After recovering from TB, Rhoads published a paper on the tuberculin reaction with Fred W. Stewart, who became his longtime colleague. Rhoads taught as a pathologist at Harvard and conducted research on disease processes. In 1929 Rhoads joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, now Rockefeller University, where he worked for Simon Flexner. He was also staff pathologist at Rockefeller Hospital. His early research interests included hematology and poliomyelitis. He worked at Rockefeller until 1939.THE EFFECT OF CATAPHORESIS ON POLIOMYELITIS VIRUS, P. K. Olitsky, C. P. Rhoads, and P. H. Long, September 1, 1929 // JEM vol. 50 no. 3 273-277 The Rockefeller University Press Puerto Rico While working for the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by hematologist William B. Castle to join his Rockefeller Anemia Commission, to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This was part of the Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division.\\"William B. Castle\\", National Academy of Sciences, Biographical Memoirs Castle's research interest was pernicious iron deficiency anemia, specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm, which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical sprue. An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans.Norman Maldonado. \\"The Changing Clinical Picture of Tropical Sprue\\" (Revista de Hematologia) , Hematolog√≠a 2010;11(2): 95-98 April ‚Äî June 2010. Retrieved 17 December 2012. The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics. Rhoads was to assist Castle, and they established a base in San Juan at the Presbyterian Hospital. Rhoads corresponded often with Simon Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute in New York regarding his research and career interests. In Puerto Rico, the Rockefeller group had more than 200 patients; historian and ethicist Susan E. Lederer notes that, while referred to as patients, they were primarily clinical subjects whose conditions were studied to advance medical research. Because of the effects of anemia and the suspicion that tropical sprue was related to diet, Rhoads experimentally controlled patients' diets. Lederer notes that in letters from this time, Rhoads referred to his patients as \\"experimental 'animals'.\\" He wrote: \\"If they don‚Äôt develop something they certainly have the constitutions of oxen.\\" Rhoads sought to experimentally induce the conditions he was studying in his patients rather than simply treat them. If they did develop tropical sprue, he could treat it with liver extract. Castle wanted to perform a similar study in Cidra, in conjunction with the School of Tropical Medicine, which was doing related research, but this was not approved. Rhoads also collected polio serum samples for his boss Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute, for which he was assisted by contacts at the university. Scandal On 10 November 1931, Rhoads was at a party at a Puerto Rican co-worker's house in Cidra. After having some drinks, he left, and found that his car had been vandalized and several items stolen. He went to his office, where he wrote and signed a letter addressed to \\"Ferdie\\" (Fred W. Stewart, a colleague from Boston, by then working at the Memorial Hospital for Cancer Research in New York).Susan E. Lederer, \\"Porto Ricochet\\": Joking about Germs, Cancer, and Race Extermination in the 1930s\\", American Literary History, Volume 14, Number 4, Winter 2002, pp. 720‚Äì746 He wrote the following: His unmailed letter was found by one of his staff and circulated among workers at the Anemia Commission. When Rhoads learned of this, he quickly made a public apology at a meeting of all staff and doctors. A while later, he was dismayed to hear that the letter was going to be discussed at a meeting of the Puerto Rico Medical Association. With relations having deteriorated locally, he returned to New York in December 1931. Publicity and investigations Pedro Albizu Campos At the end of December, Rhoads' former lab technician Luis Baldoni resigned; he later testified that he feared for his safety. In January 1932 he gave the Rhoads letter to Pedro Albizu Campos, president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Albizu Campos sought publicity about the incident, sending copies of the letter to the League of Nations, the Pan American Union, the American Civil Liberties Union, newspapers, embassies, and the Vatican. In addition to distributing the letter to the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office. A photograph of the Rhoads' letter was published on January 27, 1932 in La Democracia, the Unionist newspaper of Antonio Rafael Barcel√≥, with a translation in Spanish of the entire letter. It did not support Albizu Campos' theory of a US conspiracy against Puerto Rico. On February 13, El Mundo published the entire letter, in both Spanish and English.Truman R. Clark. 1975. Puerto Rico and the United States, 1917-1933, University of Pittsburgh Press, pp. 151-154 The Rhoads' letter created one of the first crises for James R. Beverley, newly appointed as the acting Governor of Puerto Rico. He said the letter was a \\"confession of murder\\" and \\"a libel against the people of Puerto Rico\\", and ordered an investigation, one of his first acts. Beverley said of Rhoads that \\"he was just a damned fool, ... a good doctor, but not very strong mentally on anything else.\\" Rhoads, already back in New York, released an official response to the media and the governor. He insisted that he was joking in his letter, which was intended to be confidential, calling it a \\"fantastic and playful composition written entirely for my own diversion and intended as a parody on supposed attitudes of some American minds in Porto Rico,\\" explaining that nothing \\"was ever intended to mean other than the opposite of what was stated.\\" Rhoads offered to return to clear things up, but never did. The governor's inquiry concluded that Rhoads did not commit the acts included in his letter, nor any other crimes. Rhoads and his work were investigated by the Puerto Rican Attorney General Ramon Quinones, with review of medical aspects by Dr. P. Morales Otero, representative of the Puerto Rico Medical Association, and Dr. E. Garrido Morales, representing the Commissioner of Health. Sworn testimony was taken from several of Rhoads' patients as well as his colleagues, including Castle, William Galbreath, and George C. Payne. They reviewed the case files for the 257 patients treated by Rhoads and the Rockefeller Commission, including the 13 patients who died during this period. They found no evidence of the crimes described in Rhoads' unmailed letter. The Attorney General and medical community joined in absolving Rhoads of the Nationalist charges that he was part of a U.S. plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. Rhoads was subject to separate investigations ordered by the acting American governor of Puerto Rico, Beverley, and the Rockefeller Institute, and \\"neither...was able to uncover any evidence that Dr. Rhoads had exterminated any Puerto Ricans.\\" Confirmed in Lederer's 21st century account, \\"records at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where Rhoads had performed his research, revealed no patients in the young pathologist's care had died under suspicious circumstances.\\" Additionally, the investigators were \\"unable to confirm Rhoads's other claim (omitted in Time 's account) that he had 'transplanted cancer into several patients.'\\"Susan E. Lederer. \\" 'Porto Ricochet': Joking about Germs, Cancer, and Race Extermination in the 1930s,\\" American Literary History. Volume 14. Number 4. Winter 2002. p. 720. During the investigations, Ivy Lee, who handled public relations for the Rockefeller family, and a team at the Institute began a campaign to defend Rhoads' reputation. He was seen as a promising researcher. The Rockefeller Foundation also wanted to protect its working relationship with medical organizations in Puerto Rico and avoid problems with critics of human experimentation in the U.S. During the early 1930s, there was a revival of the anti-vivisectionist movement in the U.S., which also was concerned about the use of vulnerable populations as human subjects of experimentation: children (especially orphans), prisoners, and soldiers. As Lederer observed, \\"some members of the medical community...monitored the popular and medical press.\\"Susan E. Lederer, Subjected to Science: Human Experimentation in America Before the Second World War, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997 paperback, pp. 103-104, 109 Francis Peyton Rous of the Rockefeller Institute was editor of the Journal of Experimental Medicine through the 1930s and 1940s. Although it accepted few articles on clinical research, he was careful about their wording in an effort to avoid criticism by the anti-vivisectionists.Lederer (1997), Subjected to Science, p.109 Lee was given access to pre-published versions of the articles on the controversy by both The New York Times and Time. He persuaded Time to eliminate the words \\"and transplanting cancer into several more,\\" from its published version of the letter. Also, based on the positive testimony of some patients, The New York Times headlined its article as \\"Patients Say Rhoads Saved Their Lives\\" and reported on this aspect as well.\\"Patients Say Rhoads Saved Their Lives.\\" New York Times 2 Feb. 1932:19. Rhoads had returned to New York before the scandal broke in Puerto Rico. After the Attorney General's report\\"DR. RHOADS CLEARED OF PORTO RICO PLOT\\", New York Times, 15 February 1932 and that of the Rockefeller Institute in 1932, the controversy quickly faded in the United States. Reaction to the Rhoads scandal and controversy was mixed in the United States, in part due to the Rockefeller campaign. Starr says (in his 2003 article on the scandal) that Rhoads' colleagues did not believe the researcher's attempt to cast his letter as a \\"fantastic and playful composition...intended as a parody.\\" Some were worried about Rhoads' mental health at the time. A superior dismissed the incident as a case of local ingratitude. Time magazine headlined the incident as \\"Porto Ricochet\\"; Starr suggests they meant that Rhoads's humanitarian work in Puerto Rico had come back to bite him. In Puerto Rico, Albizu Campos used the Rhoads scandal as part of his anti-colonial campaign, attracting followers to the Nationalist Party. In 1950, longtime Puerto Rican pro-independence activists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola tried to assassinate President Truman to bring their cause to the world stage. When later interviewed, Collazo said that as a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the Nationalist movement. Hematology Following his study in Puerto Rico, in 1933 Rhoads was chosen to lead a special service at the Rockefeller Institute in clinical hematology, to study diseases of the blood-forming organs. He built on his research on anemia and tropical sprue.George Washington Corner, A History of the Rockefeller Institute, 1901-1953, Rockefeller Institute Press, 1965, p. 271 In 1934 Rhoads and another researcher published results of the success in using liver extract therapy to treat tropical sprue (and relieve anemia). Their work was recognized as contributing benefit in treatment of the disease by others in the field. Memorial Hospital and World War II In 1940, Rhoads was selected as director of Memorial Hospital, which was devoted to cancer care and research, and had recently moved into a new building. Rhoads was selected for his interest in clinical investigation in addition to laboratory research, as the hospital did research as well as treatment. He succeeded James Ewing, a noted oncologist. Ewing had written about cancer transplantation in 1931, a subject which Rhoads had referred to in his scandalous letter written in November of that year. In 1941 Rhoads was studying the use of radiation to treat leukemia.\\"Postirradiation Changes in the Levels of Organic Phosphorus in the Blood of Patients with Leukemia\\", Cancer Research During World War II, Rhoads was commissioned as a colonel and assigned as chief of medicine in the Chemical Weapons Division of the U.S. Army. He established the U.S. Army chemical weapons laboratories in Utah, Maryland, and Panama. With his enthusiastic participation, secret experiments including race-based tests involving African Americans, Japanese Americans, and Puerto Ricans were performed on more than 60,000 U.S. soldiers. Many were left suffering from debilitating, lifelong aftereffects. For this work, he won the Legion of Merit for \\"combating poison gas and other advances in chemical warfare\\" in 1945. Due to his casualty studies on mustard gas from an accident during the war in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis for the development of the field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.Goozner, Merrill. 2004. The $800 Million Pill: The Truth Behind the Cost of New Drugs. p.172 Post- war In 1945 Sloan-Kettering Institute was founded as a cancer research center, in the hopes that an industrial approach to research would yield a cure. It opened in 1948. While still director of Memorial, from 1945 until 1953 Rhoads also served as the first director of the Sloan-Kettering Institute.\\"Cornelius P. Rhoads\\", ECommons, Cornell University Library He was \\"praised by Memorial for his 'essential role in the evolution of the hospital into a modern medical center.'\\" As director of Sloan-Kettering, he had oversight as well over research related to Department of Defense radiation experiments through 1954. For instance, that year, a Sloan-Kettering team began a multi-year study of \\"Post-Irradiation Syndrome in Humans.\\"Appendix 1: Contract DA-49-007, in \\"Report on Search for Records of Human Radiation Experiments\\", US Department of Defense, p. 125 In 1953, Rhoads stepped back slightly, becoming scientific director of the newly merged Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center. He also continued as the scientific director of Sloan-Kettering operations.\\"SERVICE FOR DR. RHOADS; Memorial for Sloan- Kettering Director Here Tomorrow\\", The New York Times He also was an adviser to the United States Atomic Energy Commission regarding nuclear medicine. Some AEC funding supported Sloan-Kettering research into the use of iodine to transport radiation to cancer tumors.\\"New Hope is Held Out for Cancer Cure\\", Daytona Beach Morning Journal, 16 June 1948, Retrieved 17 December 2012 Rhoads continued to serve as scientific director of the Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center until his death. He died of a coronary occlusion on August 13, 1959, in Stonington, Connecticut. In 1979, on the 20th anniversary of his death, the American Association for Cancer Research established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Prize in his honor, as an annual award to a promising young researcher. Honors *Legion of Merit in 1945 for Rhoads' work for the US Army during WWII. *Trustee of the Charles Kettering Foundation. *Awarded three honorary doctorates, two for science and one for law. *Posthumously awarded the Katherine Berkin Judd Award for outstanding contributions to oncology research. *The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award posthumously in his honor in 1979.(In 2002, it renamed the award due to Rhoads' racism expressed in his 1932 letter.) Revival of controversy In 1982, Puerto Rican social scientist and writer Pedro Aponte-V√°zquez discovered new information at various archives which raised questions about the investigations conducted on Rhoads and Rockefeller Project. Most prominent among his findings was a 1932 letter written by Governor Beverly to the associate director of the Rockefeller Foundation, stating that Rhoads had written a second letter \\"even worse than the first\\" and which, according to Beverley, the [Puerto Rican] government had suppressed and destroyed. In 1932 the Puerto Rican Attorney General, aided by top-ranking Puerto Rican doctors, had investigated all of the work of Rhoads and the Rockefeller Project, including 13 deaths that occurred among nearly 300 patients treated. They found no evidence of wrongdoing or crimes. In addition, Rhoads' superior at the Rockefeller Project had conducted a close investigation of the 13 patients who died under Rhoads' tenure, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. But in 1982 Aponte-V√°zquez urged the Puerto Rico Department of Justice to reopen the case. It refused as Rhoads had been dead for so long. In 2002, Edwin Vazquez, a biology professor at the University of Puerto Rico, came across Rhoads' 1932 letter and contacted the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) about it. Given the letter's offensive nature, he demanded that Rhoads' name be removed from the AACR award. Others also contacted the AACR, including Puerto Rico's Secretary of State Ferdinand Mercado. Revival of the issue generated a fresh wave of publicity. The AACR, which said it had not known of the 1932 controversy, commissioned an investigation led by Jay Katz, a bioethicist from Yale University. Katz said although \\"there was no evidence of Dr. Rhoads' killing patients or transplanting cancer cells, the letter itself was reprehensible enough to remove his name from the award.\\" The AACR agreed with his conclusion. Eric Rosenthal of Oncology Times in 2003 characterized the case as the AACR having to \\"deal with the embarrassment of having history catch up to modern-day sensibilities.\\" He wrote, > The complicated legacy of Cornelius \\"Dusty\\" Rhoads, who died in 1959, should > not cause society to promote nor deny his existence but should provide a > perspective that neither condones what he wrote or thought‚Äîor the > whitewashing of the incident by institutions and media of the 1930s‚Äîbut that > does give him due appropriate credit for his accomplishments as well as > acknowledgement of his faults and sins.\\" In 2003 the AACR renamed the award, stripping the honor from Rhoads posthumously. The AACR indicated that the new name would be retroactive and past awardees would receive updated plaques.\\"Cancer Body to Probe Claims that Scientist Killed Subjects\\", IPS News Representation in other media * Aponte-V√°zquez self-published a book in 2005 entitled The Unsolved Case of Dr. Cornelius P. Rhoads: An Indictment; he writes on this topic via his blog and personal website. * During the 1980s, the Puerto Rican political satire comedy group, Los Rayos Gamma, performed parodies of Rhoads with Jacobo Morales portraying a Cornelio Rodas as an insane, Frankenstein-like scientist bent on the elimination of Puerto Ricans.Collado-Schwartz, √Ångel, editor; \\"El humor como expresi√≥n cultural\\", La Voz del Centro II, Fundaci√≥n La Voz del Centro, 2006 * Roberto Bus√≥-Garc√≠a wrote and directed the dramatic film, The Condemned (2013), which he said was loosely based on the Rhoads' controversy in Puerto Rico.Manohla Dargis, \\"Disgraced Life Conjures Mysterious Forces\\", New York Times, February 2013, accessed 21 October 2013 References Further reading *Susan E.

His relatively long reign was dominated by conflict with the Sarbadars and the Jalayirids, and ended only upon the arrival of Timur into eastern Persia. Rise to Power Amir Vali was the son of Shaykh 'Ali Hindu, who had been a supporter of the Ilkhanid claimant Togha Tem√ºr and had served as his governor in Astarabad. In 1353 Togha Tem√ºr was murdered by the Sarbadars, who annexed Astarabad. Vali avoided the slaughter of Togha Tem√ºr's adherents and sought refuge with the neighboring Jauni Kurban tribe. The Sarbadar state soon descended into civil war, and Amir Vali decided to take advantage of the situation. He moved to Mazandaran, which he used as a staging point to launch raids into the region of Astarabad. The city at that time was ill-equipped to handle such attacks, as many of the Sarbadar forces haddeparted to partake in the civil war. In order to recruit supporters, he claimed to be acting in the name of Togha Tem√ºr's son Luqman. By the time Luqman had arrived on the scene, however, Vali had apparently decided to rule in his own name, told Luqman to depart, and sent into exile his relatives and supporters. Furthermore, he declared for the Shi'a in order to gain the support of the Shi'as of Mazandaran against the then-Sunni Sarbadars.Smith, pp. 85-86 s After overwhelming a Sarbadar garrison near Astarabad, Amir Vali successfully fought three armies sent to subdue him, including one led by the Sarbadar leader Hasan Damghani himself. In 1356, after the defeat of the first army sent against him, he conquered Astarabad itself. He then expanded, taking Bistam and Damghan from the Sarbadars in around 1360. Loss and Recovery of Astarabad Eventually the Sarbadars, who since 1361 were under the leadership of 'Ali Mu'ayyad, were able to mount a serious counteroffensive, and Amir Vali was forced out of his territories, including Astarabad, in c. 1366. This defeat proved to be only a temporary one for Vali. Soon after losing Astarabad, he established a new power base by seizing Semnan from the Sarbadars. He then attempted to regain Astarabad, but failed. The next few years after that he went on the offensive against the Jalayirids to the west, campaigning in the region of Rey. The Jalayirid Shaikh Uvais stopped him, but was unable to follow up on his victory. Uvais tried to convince 'Ali Mu'ayyad to attack Vali, but the Sarbadar considered him to be a useful buffer against the Jalayirids and refused to move against him. During this time he temporarily switched his allegiance back to the Sunni, although this apparently didn't give him the boost in support he expected, since he reverted to the Shi'a after a few years.Smith, p. 86 A prolonged war between the Sarbadars and the Kartids of Herat allowed Amir Vali to expand his territories at the Sarbadars' expense. By 1374 at the latest he had retaken Astarabad, and sometime between 1374 and 1376 he invaded Khurasan and besieged Sabzavar, the Sarbadar capital. In 1376 or 1377 'Ali Mu'ayyad himself was overthrown by several radical dervishes who had enlisted Kartid support; he fled to Vali, who saw this as a useful opportunity to expand his influence in Khurasan. Vali laid siege to Sabzavar and took it in around 1380 and restored 'Ali Mu'ayyad in the capital. Conflict with Timur In 1381 Amir Vali had his first encounter with the Amir Timur, who sacked Esfarayen when Vali refused to pay homage to him. Vali then proceeded to besiege Sabzavar again, after a falling out between him and 'Ali Mu'ayyad, and enlisted the support of the Jauni Kurban. 'Ali Mu'ayyad, who had already become Timur's vassal, appealed to him for aid, and Timur relieved the city in the winter 1382. He then proceeded to invade Gurgan, forcing Vali to sue for peace. In the following year (1383), Timur sent an army against Vali, then proceeded to invade his territories himself. Vali attempted to stop Timur but in the end he failed and fled to the Jalayirids in 1384, following which Timur occupied Astarabad. He then gave the city to Luqman, whose name Vali had supposedly been acting in almost three decades ago, when he was first establishing himself in the region. After his loss of power, Amir Vali spent some time in the service of the Jalayirids. He participated in defending Tabriz during the siege of Tokhtamysh, khan of the Golden Horde. After the city was sacked he travelled to Mazandaran, where he attempted to stage a rebellion against Timur in 1386. The rebellion failed and Vali was killed, bringing an end to his long career.

It was known as in Japan. It is one of the early Sega sports games where a celebrity athlete's name was added to the title when it was localized from Japan (the other two games being Tommy Lasorda Baseball and Pat Riley Basketball).Sega Genesis Sports Game Advertisement from 1989 - Fors Yard Although Arnold Palmer is shown on the box cover and at the title screen, the game makes no reference to him during the actual golf game play. Gameplay Players must be aware of the wind conditions in addition to the amount of strength that they apply to their golf clubs while swinging. The game features two game play modes: tournament and practice. Tournament mode consists of 12 rounds, each with 18 holes of golf. There are three different golf courses, one each in the United States, Japan, and Great Britain (although the background and the scenery does not vary). As the player progresses in the tournament mode, their skill level is increased allowing them to hit the ball farther with greater control. They can also upgrade their golf clubs from the initial black carbon club set, to glass fiber and ceramic clubs. This also increases the distance the player is able to hit the ball. Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf has no save feature, but instead provides a password after each round of the tournament that allows the player to pick up where they left off. In practice mode, one or two players can play a complete 18 rounds of golf on one of the three courses. Each player can set their skill level and use any of the three golf club sets available in the game. Before each turn, the player's caddy will give advice based on its skill level. At first, the caddy can only give the distance from the ball's current position to the tee. As the game progresses, more skilled caddies can give distances to various landmarks and information about how the ball is lying. The player then selects which club to use during the shot. After this, the player can adjust their golfer's stance in order to shank the ball in one particular direction based on the direction of the wind (all golfers in the game are right-handed). To control the swing, the player uses a power gauge to select the strength and height of the shot. When the player first presses the shot button, a marker starts to upwards to the top of the gauge. If the player hits the shot button again before it reaches the top (this controls how hard the shot will be), the marker will then move back down towards the starting position. The player then must hit the button a third time inside of a green area on the power gauge (this controls how high the shot will go in the air). If the player fails to hit the shot button a third time, the sequence will start over from the beginning. When the ball reaches the putting green, a close-up of the screen will appear. The game will first show the distance from the ball to the tee, and then show a simple diagram of the lie on the green. The player will then be able to select how hard to hit the ball and in what direction. Connections to Sega franchises Pressing the start button allows the player to change the music and also whether he hears a cheer from the gallery or not upon completing a hole. Opa-Opa, the player-character from the Fantasy Zone series, is the cursor in the pause menu. Also, a trick allows the player to play a secret Fantasy Zone level by hitting the ball 100 times on the first hole of any course without holing out, then entering up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, and A on the game over screen. The special level freezes after a certain number of enemies are killed. However, it is impossible to return to the golf game without resetting the system. In addition, Alex Kidd makes appearances in the Tournament Mode after nine holes have been played in each round (called \\"Coffee Breaks\\").

Over the 110-year history the business has made boots for a wide range of people, industries and uses.

Sales were initially slow, but increased due to the First World War. A bigger and larger factory was needed so the first of three stages of factory was built. The depression years were hard years and getting orders proved difficult. During the Second World War Rossi Boots was a major supplier to the military making hundreds of thousands of boots which saw service in various theatres including New Guinea. The war years saw the number of employees peak at around five hundred. In the years after the war, materials were scarce and it was then when the company introduced the concept of using old car tyres as a soling for boots. Gradually since then the methods of manufacturing footwear have changed as petroleum based products such as glues, rubbers and plastics have replaced the traditional ones of leather, nails and threads. More modern machinery has been introduced than can directly mould soles to the bottom of boots and can easily pull leather over a last. At the end of 1987 the company moved from Unley to Hilton. The move allowed production to be carried out in a more modern, fit-for-purpose factory. Since then the company has continued to change; introducing computer controlled machines for cutting, sewing and attaching soles. These changes occurred whilst many of Rossi's competitors moved offshore. Whilst the introduction of these machines reduced the number of local staff, it has enabled Rossi Boots to continue to manufacture in Australia. In March 2019 Rossi Boots relocated the factory, warehouse and headquarters from Hilton to Kilburn, South Australia. This move to a new, expansive location allows Rossi Boots to continue to manufacture boots in South Australia and continue to house all operations under one roof.

A graduate of the Sorbonne and √âcole centrale de Lille, he worked at EDF and he became known for his studies on waking dreams. Desoille was born in Besan√ßon into a family of military officers and began a scientific education in engineering that he would never complete after being mobilized in World War I. After his 1923 meeting with Colonel Eug√®ne Caslant, who introduced him to an experimental mental imaging technique, he developed his method of the \\"directed waking dream\\" (r√™ve eveill√© dirig√©, or RED), explicating it in seven books. RED protocol Lying on his back, the subject puts himself into a state of relaxation and closes his eyes in order to create an imaginary scenario in which he is the principal (or sole) hero. Placing himself behind the subject, the therapist sometimes intervenes to specify part of imaginary space or a possible bifurcation of the scenario. In another phase of the therapeutic work, the subject writes a written report which will be used in a face-to-face session in order to explore the meaning of the scenario. For children, the protocol is modified: with his eyes open, the child sits at a table and draws a comic strip of the scenario he imagines. Influences and legacy At the theoretical level, Desoille was influenced by first by Sigmund Freud, then by Carl Gustav Jung and finally, following his membership of the French Communist Party, he constrained himself to a Pavlovian theorization. Desoille's first writings in the 1930s built on the work of Freud, Pierre Janet, and Roland Dalbiez. He studied the relationship between symbolism, invention, and memory in his early works, underscoring the applicability of the directed waking dream method in exploring sublimation. In the 1940s, Desoille referenced Jung's collective unconscious and presented his own conception of the mind based on Freud's three instances. The transference identified by Freud, Desoille believed, could be expressed and resolved in the directed waking dream. Finally in the 1950s and 1960s, concomitant to his political affiliations, Desoille held to a Pavlovian conception of neurosis, based on reflexes, in what was termed a \\"rational psychotherapy\\". Those reflexes that are poorly adapted could be dissolved through the directed waking dream method, according to Desoille, and, starting in the imagination, new dynamic stereotypes could be formed. Desoille died at age 76 in Paris. Desoille's pupils now define themselves as \\"analysts\\" and interpret their practice along Freudian, Freudo-Lacanian, or Jungian lines. Authors that cite Desoille's work include Charles Baudouin, Gaston Bachelard, Juliette Favez- Boutonier, Fran√ßoise Dolto, Daniel Lagache and Roberto Assagioli; parallels have also been drawn between Desoille's work and that of Milton H. Erickson and neuro-linguistic programming. Desoille's work was used in the development of guided imagery techniques used in psychosynthesis.

The 36th F√ºsilier Regiment was formerly part of the 8th Infantry Division. The 48th Infantry Regiment came from the 5th Infantry Division. The 32nd Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in the Thuringian states, primarily the Reuss principalities. The 36th F√ºsiliers was a \\"Magdeburg\\" regiment, raised in the Prussian Province of Saxony. The 48th Infantry was a Brandenburg regiment. The 48th Infantry was replaced by the 66th Infantry, another Magdeburg regiment, making the division primarily Prussian Saxon and Thuringian in character. Cavalry support came in the form of cuirassiers from the Rhineland. The artillery and combat engineer units were newly formed. Combat chronicle The 113th Infantry Division fought on the Western Front in World War I, entering the line between the Meuse and Moselle in April 1915. In 1915, it saw action in the Second Battle of Champagne. In 1916, the division fought in the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme. After a period in the trenchlines in the Wo√´vre region and in Upper Alsace, the division fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also known as the Third Battle of Champagne. It then went into the line on the Chemin des Dames and north of the Ailette River, where it remained until preparing for the 1918 German Spring Offensive. It fought in the First Battle of the Somme (1918) and the Second Battle of the Marne, and later faced various Allied offensives collectively known as the Hundred Days Offensive.

She kept her maiden name throughout her life and later took to shortening her signature to \\"Flanders Dunbar\\"\\" (Hart, (1996), p.50. ‚Äî is an important early figure in U.S. psychosomatic medicine and psychobiology, as well as being an important advocate of physicians and clergy co-operating in their efforts to care for the sick. She viewed the patient as a combination of the psych and some, body and soul. Both needed to be treated in order to treat a patient efficiently. Dunbar received degrees in mathematics, psychology, theology, philosophy, and medicine. Dunbar founded the American Psychosomatic Society in 1942 and was the first editor of its journal. In addition to running several other committees committed to treating the whole patient, Dunbar wrote and distributed information for public health, involving child development and advocating for mental health care after World War II. Life Helen Flanders Dunbar, the eldest child of a well-to-do family, born in Chicago, Illinois on May 14, 1902. Her father, Francis William Dunbar (1868-1939), was an electrical engineer, mathematician, and patent attorney. Her mother, Edith Vaughn Flanders (1871-1963), was a professional genealogist and translator. Her brother, Francis, was born in 1906. As a child she suffered from malnutrition; and despite Dunbar's later misleading claims that she had suffered poliomyelitis, and a childhood pediatrician's diagnosis of a muscular form of rickets (\\"rachitic pseudo-paralysis\\"). Due to her illness, Dunbar was described as an intense and nervous child. It is possible that the suffered a form of melancholia at age 15. At age twelve, Dunbar and her family moved to Manchester, Vermont as a result of her father's involvement in a serious patient litigation. Dunbar was strongly influenced by her mother, her grandmother and her aunt. Her mother was the head of household and an ardent feminist. Dunbar's grandmother, Sarah Ide Flanders, was a widow of an Episcopal priest. Her aunt, Ellen Ide Flanders, once expressed interest in becoming a medical missionary. Many of her characteristics; shrewd, manipulative, stubborn, and domineering, were later also used to describe Helen. Dunbar was also influenced by her father. She was very introverted and highly gifted, mirroring her father's shy and semi-reclusive nature. Dunbar was a lifelong Episcopalian with high church inclinations even though she was largely non-practicing in her later years. A diminutive adult ‚Äî she was 4'11\\" (150 cm) ‚Äî she always wore platform shoes. While at Yale, her classmates dubbed her with the nickname \\"Pocket Minerva\\", due to her small stature and large accomplishments. She married her first husband, Theodor Peter Wolfensberger (1902-1954), in 1932 ‚Äî he was eventually known in the U.S. as Theodore P. Wolfe ‚Äî and they were divorced in 1939. (Wolfe arranged for the immigration of Austrian psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich in 1939, and was the translator of most of Reich's books and articles.) She married her second husband, economist and editor of The New Republic, George Henry Soule Jr. (1887-1970), in 1940. A daughter, Marcia was born in 1942. Education Dunbar was taught by private tutors and at private schools. Her education began at Laboratory School in Chicago. She graduated from Bryn Mawr with a B.A. (dual major in mathematics and psychology) in 1923.Hart, (1996), p.49. She received a Med. Sci D degree from Columbia University in 1935. Dunbar focused on medieval literature and Dante, which impacted her medical practice and therapeutic approaches. While at Columbia University, Dunbar was simultaneously enrolled at Union Theological Seminary. In 1927, Dunbar graduated from Union Theological Seminary, with a degree in theology, and completed her first year at Yale University's Medical School. At Columbia University, Dunbar was an acknowledged intellectual leader of her class. At Columbia University, she was instrumental in the beginning of consultation- liaison psychiatry. While at Union Theological Seminary, Dunbar was awarded the Travelling Fellowship for the outstanding student and used this opportunity to travel to Europe in 1929 and visit with both Helene Deutsch and Felix Deutsch in Vienna, and with Carl Jung at the Burgh√∂lzli, the psychiatric clinic of Zurich University. She also trained with Anton Boisen (1876-1965), a co-founder of the Clinical Pastoral Education Movement, at the Worcester State Hospital in the summer of 1925. In pursuit of more knowledge in relation to the psychic aspects of healing and disease, she visited Lourdes and a number of other healing shrines in Germany and Austria. While there, Dunbar observed that of the patients vising the shrine, those overcome by hysterical excitement as well as those waiting for a cure were not the ones to leave feeling well. The most successful were those who came with \\"deep confidence and quiet\\" to go about their day, helping themselves and others. Career and scholarship While at Union Theological Seminary, she met Anton Boisen, who introduced her to a training program at Worcester. Dunbar worked in the department of social work studying symbols and symbolism in schizophrenia. Her friendship with Boisen lead to her helping him through his second psychiatric hospitalization and to her instrumental support in his interests in the formal structuring of the movement into the Council for Clinical Training. Dunbar had a fundamental role in the stages of the clinical pastoral education movement that brought seminarians and clergy into hospitals and clinics for pastoral care and counseling training, but was not actively involved much after the late 1930s. She believed in the importance of clinical training for clergy and the role of symbols in understanding illness. She was the first medical director (1930-1942) of the Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students in New York City. She was also the director of the Joint Committee on Religion and Medicine of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America and the New York Academy of Medicine from 1931 to 1936. She was an instructor at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute from 1941 to 1949. She founded the American Psychosomatic Society in 1942 and was the first editor of its journal Psychosomatic Medicine. She also had an interest in public health. Dunbar wrote books on childhood development to help parents. She also wrote of her extensive and evangelical efforts to spread the word about the virtues and values of mental health care following the conclusion of World War II. Dunbar's life and contributions have been studied and documented by multiple scholars, most notably Robert C. Powell, whose dissertation, \\"Healing and Wholeness: Helen Flanders Dunbar (1902-1959) and an Extra-Medical Origin of the American Psychosomatic Movement, 1906-1936,\\" is the most comprehensive manuscript on her work. As a result of the extensive scholarship that Dunbar has received, both the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education and the College for Pastoral Supervision and Psychotherapy give out annual \\"Helen Flanders Dunbar (1902-1959) Award for Significant Contributions to the Field of Clinical Pastoral Training\\" in her honor. Powell described Dunbar as a \\"practical theoretician\\" and a \\"woman with a mission\\". Research and influences Dunbar believed that the psyche and soma, body and soul, were intimately connected and the physician must attend to both if the patient is to be fully healed. She saw the patient in their world first and only then integrated this understanding with symptoms resulting in a diagnosis of disease. She drew upon the foundational work of John Dewey and William James, who saw the patients as human beings who were dynamically involved in an environment that formed and transformed them. She was the first to attempt to do research into the efficacy of pastoral care on the healing process. The results, however, were inconclusive. She was unable to put her substantial learning together in service of the rapidly expanding dialogue between religion and psychiatry. Dunbar's studies at Columbia University of Dante lead to an \\"insight symbol\\", which like symbols in medieval and renaissance literature, in psychosomatic medicine and psychiatry gather, shed light on, or refer to a multiplicity of meanings, events, and conditions. For Dunbar, symbols called attention to the whole that is always greater than the sum of its parts. Dunbar also attempted to extend the use of psychoanalysis into the somatic realm. She suggested a physical mechanism for the psyche that was taken from the first two laws of thermodynamics, which she called \\"emotional thermodynamics\\". The first law stated psychological energy seeks an outlet through physical symptoms due to its inability to be expressed mentally. The second law states that permanent faults in personality can lead to dissipation of energy and eventually somatic dysfunction. Dunbar viewed the mind as a tangible entity seeking its own equilibrium, by means of energy flowing from an invisible mind to a tangible body. However, Dunbar's research showed a correlational rather than causational relationship between mental and physical phenomena. One of Dunbar's case studies was of a man named James Roe, who had impressions of God that contributed to an emotional breakdown. When James was seven, he was a very well behaved young boy. However, his mother suffered financial misfortunes that led to him abandoning his plan for future education. His pastor mentioned the discipline of the Cross and caused James to identify with Christ, the mocked one. James continued to lose one job after another, causing him to face God and memories of his father with a sense of failure. His pastor continued to talk to him about Christ. Once admitted to a mental hospital, he told the superintendent that he was Christ. Dunbar used this case to document the damaging effect of an overarching portrayal of God as the suffering God. She challenged teachers of religion to use dynamic symbolism, which provides multiple symbols that can prevent an overbearing focus on one of them. Another one of Dunbar's studies involved a study of pregnancy to support her theory of connection between mind and body. It was based on two patients. One of the women had one miscarriage and two stillbirths and the other had a stillborn before delivering a healthy baby girl. Dunbar was convinced that a Freudian analysis of a pregnant patient's dreams could prevent miscarriage and stillbirth. The health of the child was also at risk for \\"severe emotional strain during pregnancy\\". Dunbar believed that psychiatry and medicine could work together to isolate pathogenic factors in disease and be able to prevent them. She and her colleagues sketched out a \\"cardiac type of personality\\", a relentlessly driven ambitious male that resembled a \\"Type A\\" personality.

Later life and death Towards the end of her life, Dunbar suffered from a self-destructive nature and alcoholism. These attitudes caused her to be removed from her position on the American Psychosomatic Society. She alienated leaders of the Council for Clinical Training for Theological Students. She also lost her position as its medical director after she demanded adherence to her own version of psychoanalytic orthodoxy. A former secretary who was a close friend and a former patient committed suicide. In 1954, she was in a serious automobile accident and was involved in costly ligation with a former patient. On August 21, 1959, Dunbar was found floating face down in her swimming pool. Initial speculations mentioned suicide. However, the coroner recorded a death by drowning. The drowning was most likely caused by a heart attack. Notes References * Anon, \\"Dr. Dunbar Found Dead in Her Pool\\", The New York Times, (23 August 1959), p. 95, col.D. * Div, M.

They are no longer available for a reading today in terms of traditional publication, although the advent of the Internet has allowed for peer-to-peer file sharing. Premise Purported to be translations of English-language books by prisoners in concentration camps, these books were highly pornographic accounts of imprisonment, generally of Allied soldiers, sexual brutalization by female SS guards (or in some cases by Imperial Japanese women), and the prisoners' eventual revenge, which usually consisted of the rape and murder of their tormentors. The books, with titles like I Was Colonel Schultz's Private Bitch, were especially popular among adolescent boys, often the children of concentration camp survivors. History The books emerged from the culture of silence that surrounded the Holocaust, especially in Israel, until the Eichmann trial. Many young people lived in the shadow of these events, but could find no answers to their inevitable questions, whether from their parents or their teachers. For most of adolescents, the only answers they could find were in the book House of Dolls (1955) a novella by K. Tzetnik, a then-anonymous survivor of Auschwitz who wrote about women prisoners forced into prostitution by the Nazi guards. Although published as fiction, the book has been considered a partially truthful account based upon the experiences of the author's sister.Mikics, David; (August, 2012). \\"Holocaust Pulp Fiction\\". Tablet Magazine. http://tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/97160/ka-tzetnik It affected young Israelis as they went through puberty: questions of identity and their parents' violent past melted into their emerging sexual identity. This became more prevalent during the highly publicized Eichmann trial, when these same young people were exposed to detailed descriptions of the concentration and death camps for the very first time. K. Tzetnik himself was one of the witnesses who provided graphic testimony during the trial. Exploiting these trends, a group of Israeli publishers began to publish dime novel-format memoirs, describing abuse, particularly sexual abuse, in the concentration camps. Sold in magazine kiosks, the novels, ostensibly first- person memoirs, became best-sellers. According to filmmaker Ari Libsker, \\"the Holocaust pictures that I saw, as one who grew up here, were of naked women.\\" They disappeared almost as quickly as they appeared. Within two years of the appearance of the first publication, the publishers were accused by an Israeli court of distributing pornography and the books were discontinued. Although still available underground, certain titles earned the ire of the establishment, and efforts were made to find and destroy them. The advent of the Internet has allowed for peer-to-peer file sharing and thus made censorship attempts far harder. In 2003, the genre re-entered public debate in Israel with the research of popular culture analyst Eli Eshed. As a result of that research, Israeli filmmaker Ari Libsker featured the books in a documentary film, which was titled Stalags.cinephil.co.il See also * Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS * Nazi exploitation * Stalags (film) References External links  Village Voice Category:Israeli literature Category:Israeli pornography Category:Holocaust literature Category:Pulp fiction ","title":"Stalag fiction"},{"id":"13136650","text":"TREK73 is a computer game based on the original Star Trek television series. It was created in 1973 by William K. Char, Perry Lee, and Dan Gee for the Hewlett-Packard 2000 minicomputer in HP Time-Shared BASIC. The game was played via teletype. Alt URL. Trek73 is so big that it needs the CHAIN feature of HP2000 BASIC. Unlike many other Trek-themed games of the era, Trek73 is not derived from the well known Star Trek by Mike Mayfield. Trek73 simulates multi-ship starship combat in a smaller play area and does not include the more strategic elements of the original, like starbases and the galactic map layout. Like most BASIC programs from the 1970s, there are dozens of minor variations on the original. Dave Korns adapted the code to support smart terminals, using the cursor control characters on the Hazeltine 2000 to produce an in-place updating display. In the mid-1980s, Dave Pare and Chris Williams translated the original BASIC version into C and Jeff Okamoto, Peter Yee, and others corrected and enhanced the source code. These versions are widely available for Unix-like and DOS operating systems.  Gameplay  The game simulates battles between spaceships of the Star Trek franchise. Through text commands, a player may order the ship to perform certain tasks in battle against an opposing vessel. History In January 1973, William K. Char began programming a space battle game in BASIC on a time-shared Hewlett-Packard 2000C system at Wilson High School in San Francisco. The first version of what was then called $SPACE was introduced in May 1973. In June 1973, Char, Perry, Lee, and Gee started programming TREK73; it was completed October 8, 1973. Roderick Perkins adapted TREK73 for the DECISION computer at the Lawrence Hall of Science in 1974. The game was played by Homebrew Computer Club member Steve Dompier, who purchased a Teletype machine for his home so that he could play the game for hours without interruption. Other versions Dave Pare and Chris Williams at the University of California, Berkeley independently translated TREK73 into the C programming language in 1984. In April 1985, Jeff Okamoto and Peter Yee combined the Pare and Williams versions into one. The command set was expanded to 31. This version had enhancements based on the boardgame Star Fleet Battles. The player was also capable of designing his own ship. David Soussan then ported the Okamoto/Yee version to MS-DOS, having played it in high school. (download at the bottom of the page) While at the University of Iowa, Tom Nelson and Mike Higgins played and made modifications to TREK73 on one of the University HP2000 system. In 1984 they created Begin, A Tactical Starship Simulation for MS-DOS. Begin was not a port of TREK73. It was written in C and was very much inspired by TREK73. In 1993 Higgins released Begin 2, a VGA version for MS-DOS, and in 2009 Nelson released Begin 3 for Windows. In 1985 while at the University of Michigan, Howard Chu wrote a version of TREK73 in Turbo Pascal for MS-DOS. This may have been the first version to use a screen-oriented interface and function-key command input. A version of TREK73 was included on Disk 10 of Fred Fish's Fish Disks for Amiga computers. Around 1990, Chu wrote a version in C/curses for the Amiga. Unlike his Turbo Pascal version, this game is fully implemented. It uses the numeric keys instead of function keys.

The Campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (CUNPA) is a global network of more than 300 non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and 1,500 current and former parliamentarians from around 150 countries devoted to establishing a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly. Campaign objectives CUNPA-supported symbol of a UNPA, reflecting parliamentary benches and recalling the Flag of the United Nations The Campaign's objectives: *To make the UNPA proposal visible in political debates and the media *To facilitate the creation of national and local networks of individuals, non-governmental organizations and parliamentarians advocating a UNPA in their sphere of influence *To establish a global multi-stakeholder coalition which unites parliamentary and civil society efforts for a U.N. Parliamentary Assembly *To facilitate contacts and debates with potentially like-minded parliaments and governments Profile Steering committee The Campaign's Secretariat is led by Democracy Without Borders. The work of the Campaign is guided by an informal Steering Committee, which helps to define the Campaign's goals, policies and strategies. The Steering Committee consists of the NGOs Democracy Without Borders, Society for Threatened Peoples International, World Federalist Movement-IGP, Democracia Global, and The Workable World Trust. Regional and national networks The Campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has built coalitions and established national and regional networks all over the world as for example in Israel, Germany, Argentina, Sweden, Canada and Spain, among others. Multiple Global Weeks of Action for a World Parliament have also been held, with supporting activities taking place across the world. History The policy of the Campaign is based on the \\"Appeal for the Establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations\\" which was presented at launch events in over ten countries during April and May 2007. 552 persons were initial signatories to the petition, among them parliamentarians and individuals such as Nobel Prize laureates, Right Livelihood Award laureates, civil society leaders, three former prime ministers, several former foreign ministers and Boutros Boutros-Ghali (former UN Secretary General). At a meeting in November 2007 the Campaign reiterated its policy as formulated in the appeal. Although the CUNPA's early literature seemed to emphasize indirect election of the UNPA as a necessary first step, in November 2007, the organization noted that some countries could choose direct election of delegates in the first stage of the body's existence.http://www.unpacampaign.org/documents/en/POLICY1107.pdf Similarly, early CUNPA statements stressed the UNPA's oversight role over the UN and its bodies, but the November 2007 statement clarified that the UNPA could also have a role overseeing the Bretton Woods institutions. In a statement on the financial crisis issued in April 2008 this position was confirmed and outlined in more detail. In 2016 the Campaign received strong support from the Pan- African Parliament, and in 2017 the Campaign's chairman, Andreas Bummel, was invited to give a statement to the Parliament. As of 2018, the campaign claimed the support of 1535 former and current members of parliament around the world, as well as the support of some other academic and public figures. Support has also come from some national political parties, inter-governmental organisations, governmental bodies, and non-governmental organisations. The Campaign has also been discussed in motions at the German, Icelandic, Canadian, Mercosur and European parliaments, among others. Support for the Campaign has been diverse in nature, coming from both ends of the political spectrum.

The city was also divided into two sides, although this was probably not a distinct administrative unit as were the ends. The Sofia Side was named after the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (Sviataya Sofia in Russian) and consisted of the Nerev, Zagorodskii and Liudin Ends. The Trade or Market Side of the city consisted of the Slavno and Plotnitksii Ends. It is believed that the decisions of the all-city veche had to be ratified by the veches of each end, though it is not certain. It is also thought that each end governed one of the Fifths, the five organized territories into which the Novgorodian Land had been divided, although this too is unclear from the sources.

Dee was the only major character in the show to be conceived without an actor in mind. Although she was originally written to be a female voice of reason, Dee's character quickly became an equal participant in The Gang's illicit and morally questionable activities once Olson was cast.  Character biography Sweet Dee is Dennis Reynolds' twin sister and is the main bartender at their bar, Paddy's Pub. Dee was unpopular in high school due to her severe scoliosis, for which she wore a corrective back brace that earned her the nickname \\"The Aluminum Monster\\". Additionally, she is often ridiculed for her resemblance to a bird by the rest of The Gang, especially Dennis and Mac. She claims to be liberal, compassionate and smart; in reality, however, she is selfish, greedy, and prejudiced. Dee battles The Gang's view that \\"females are inferior\\" and feels that she must prove that she's as capable as her male friends. In \\"The Gang Gets Invincible\\", Dee poses as male alter ego \\"Cole\\" to try out for the Philadelphia Eagles with Mac and Dennis; she does a superb job and impresses the Eagles coaches until she stuns everyone by revealing she's a woman right before her punting tryout, after which she kicks the ball and severely injures her foot. Her father Frank is the only one who considers Dee a true member of The Gang. Whenever there is a decision or a vote among members of The Gang, the three other guys habitually exclude her. In the 6th episode of the 3rd season (\\"The Gang Solves the North Korea Situation\\") it is revealed that Dee's breath \\"smells like vomit\\" despite maintaining a hygienic outward appearance. Though Dee was originally intended to be a sensible and compassionate counterpoint to the other characters, she has shown herself to be just as morally corrupt as the rest of the gang. She consistently uses others for her own ends, including: feigning affection for Matthew \\"Rickety Cricket\\" Mara for financial gain only to reject him when he leaves the priesthood for her; blackmailing the Waitress to come out with her for drinks despite the fact the woman is a recovering alcoholic; and pushing a reluctant young girl into performing with her in a beauty pageant. Dee is usually ignored or ridiculed whenever she presents an idea to The Gang; however, if someone repeats her exact suggestion, it is immediately accepted. In her will, Dee's mother tells her that she has been a disappointment and a mistake. consequently, she has considerable animosity towards her mother, and many of her actions are designed to \\"shove it in her face\\". In \\"Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare\\", she and Dennis temporarily develop an addiction to crack cocaine, which is brought up a few times in later episodes. In \\"Dennis and Dee's Mom Is Dead\\", her cruel mother Barbara dies in a botched neck lift and leaves her and Frank, Barbara's ex husband, nothing to inherit. In an attempt to inherit Barbara's money, which was given to Dee's biological father Bruce Mathis, Dee and Frank stage a fake wedding. The scheme backfires however. A recurring joke on the show is Dee having her car destroyed or stolen. In season 4, Mac and Charlie steal and crash her blue Dodge Neon to fake their deaths (\\"Mac and Charlie Die\\"). In season 5, her next car, a red Ford Aspire, is stolen the same day she bought it by a hitchhiker the gang picked up on their way to the Grand Canyon (\\"The Gang Hits The Road\\"). After Dee becomes his mistress in \\"Dennis Gets Divorced\\", Bill Ponderosa gives her a brand new black BMW 3 Series. Soon after, however, another of Bill's mistresses arrives to reclaim the car as Bill had originally given it to her. In \\"The Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre\\", Charlie and Mac steal Dee's purple Chrysler PT Cruiser and crash it into a pole, totaling it, claiming \\"zombies must have stolen [it].\\" However, the same PT Cruiser shows up again in the next episode, \\"Charlie and Dee Find Love,\\" with Charlie complaining, \\"I can't believe you just bought another ridiculous ugly car\\" just before another car crashes into it. Pregnancy In one of the show's most well-known story arcs, Dee gets pregnant, but does not reveal the identity of the father. The father is eventually revealed to be a transgender woman named Carmen who once dated Mac. Dee carries Carmen's child as a surrogate, having been impregnated through Carmen's sperm and an egg from a donor. She gives birth to a girl in the episode \\"Dee Gives Birth\\". The episode was dedicated to Axel Lee McElhenney (Kaitlin Olson's and Rob McElhenney's real-life son).  Career  After flunking out of the University of Pennsylvania, where she had intended to major in psychology, Dee decided to become an actress. However, she has put little effort into realizing her ambition and has never had any significant acting work; as a result, The Gang frequently says that she has no talent for anything. Dee's aspirations to be an actress inspire her to create several characters, all of which are based on ethnic stereotypes. Many of these are seen in the episode \\"America's Next Top Paddy's Billboard Model Contest\\", in which she attempts to be discovered by talent agencies by posting videos of her acting on YouTube. However, her presence in the videos is overshadowed by Charlie's performances as Green Man. Although Dee shows no on-camera stage fright, she consistently faces severe glossophobia when performing in front of an audience. When she performs a stand-up comedy routine at a local comedy club, she repeatedly gags and dry-heaves on stage due to her anxiety. Her only legitimate acting job was a small part in an adult film seen in the episode \\"Dee Makes a Smut Film\\".  Relationships  Since high school and through the entire series, Dee has had a long list of failed relationships and one-night stands that includes: a high-school boy who uses her for alcohol and to make his girlfriend jealous; a thief who robs the bar; a middle-aged toothless Korean busboy; a sweet, but simple-minded Iraq War veteran named Ben, who ultimately finds her to be \\"a mean person\\"; Lil Kev, a rapper who The Gang originally thought was mentally retarded, only to find out he wasn't; and Bill Ponderosa, a man whom she had a crush on back in high school only to find out he was an overweight loser and married. Like the other members of The Gang, Dee drinks heavily, often hoping to calm herself when meeting an attractive man. Relative to the rest of The Gang, Dee seems to drink more and be drunk more often. She harbors a phobia of the elderly. Despite her many insecurities, Dee is aggressively outspoken and is prone to violence when angered. At one point, she assaults a bum she finds masturbating in the alley behind Paddy's. Charlie and Dee accidentally use steroids in \\"Hundred Dollar Baby\\", which greatly increases their anger. In \\"The Gang Solves the North Korea Situation\\", she is, along with Frank and Mac, on an American Idol-like panel where she portrays a drunken spoof of Paula Abdul, slurring her words and judging hopefuls in a talent contest. She drinks heavily from a cup full of \\"Rum and Coke\\" and uses the event as an excuse to criticize and demean the contestants.

Navis showed signs of creativity from a young age. Before discovering his talents as a writer, he was an accomplished flautist and violist. He was also a skilled painter. After graduating from the Indonesisch Nederlandsche School (INS) ‚Äì a Dutch-language teachers' school in Kayu Tanam in 1945, he began work as head of production at a Japanese-owned porcelain factory.Eneste, Pamusuk (Ed) (2001) Sastra Indonesia. Jakarta. Kompas. His skill as a writer led to his appointment on the Central Sumatra Cultural Committee from 1953 to 1955, and his good English-language skills meant he was often asked to assist foreign scholars studying Minangkabau culture. Navis rose to prominence with the story Surau Kami in 1955, which was voted one of the three best stories of the year by the literary magazine, Kisah. The story was considered very brave in criticizing the pious who neglect the poor. His collection of short stories was released under the same title in 1956 and has been translated into English, German and Japanese. Navis taught many other writers while producing his own short stories, novels, poetry, children's stories, radio plays and essays on cultural and social problems. He wrote 22 books, plus five anthologies with other poets, and eight anthologies abroad. He also composed 106 papers for academic publishers and activities at home and abroad. They were later collected in the book A Walk Along the Way. Between 1971 and 1982 Navis served as a member of his home province's house of representatives.

Navis made writing a habit in his life, a practice he advocated to others. \\"Writing is a tool,\\" he told Kompas in 1997. The most important thing for a man of letters, he says, is his work is durable or not? One of his most famous short novels \\"Robohnya Surau Kami\\" detailed stories about cultural bankruptcy in Minangkabau. Navis famously spoke out about the ‚Äúcorruptors‚Äù ruining Indonesia. He was also concerned about the quality of national education, especially what he saw as the failure to read and write with open minds. Navis died after a long illness. He was survived by one wife, Aksari Yasin, whom he married in 1957, and seven children: Early Akbari, Lusi Bebasari, Dedi Andika, Lenggogini, Gemala Ranti, Rinto Amanda, and Rika Anggraini, and 13 grandchildren.

The school mascot is the Green Wave, which represents the waves of corn in the fields surrounding the community of Mattoon. History On September 20, 2017 at 11:33 am, a 14-year-old male student opened fire in the school cafeteria and was quickly subdued by Angela McQueen, a math and physical education teacher. One student was struck in the chest and was driven to a nearby hospital suffering non-life-threatening wounds. The shooter was taken into custody without further incident and was charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and sent to juvenile hall.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-mattoon-high-school- shooting-sentence-20181011-story.html Academics In the 2017‚Äì18 school year, Mattoon had an enrollment of 1,013, with 88.3% of that population being white. Hispanics makeup 4.3% of the student population, surpassing the percentage of blacks, who makeup 3.6% of the student body.

As late as October 2003, there were only 3,432 Hong Kong residents working in Shanghai, according to Shanghai municipal government statistics; however, by December of the following year, that number roughly doubled to 6,680. Employment 60.2% work in the general services sector, 13.9% in manufacturing, 5% in real estate, 5.1% in finance and insurance, and 12.3% in other industries. Most work in managerial positions; they were either hired in Hong Kong and sent to Shanghai afterwards by Hong Kong or foreign firms, or established their own companies in Shanghai. However, the growth in their population is limited by competition from increasingly well-educated local employees, who demand much lower salaries. With the rise in value of the renminbi, an increasing number of Hong Kong residents working in Shanghai who had previously been paid in foreign currencies such as United States dollars have begun to prefer receiving their salary in local currency instead. To control capital inflow, Hong Kong residents living in Shanghai, in common with residents from Macau and Taiwan, are limited to purchasing one house or apartment per Home Return Permit-holder (the so-called \\"one permit, one house\\" scheme), but the Shanghai municipal government suggested it may relax this restriction to three houses or apartments per permit-holder.

Ram√≥n Arnaud Vignon Captain Ram√≥n Arnaud Vignon (1877‚Äì1915) was an officer in the Mexican Army and the last Mexican governor of Clipperton Island.  Early years and military enlistment Ram√≥n Arnaud was born in Orizaba, Veracruz, in 1879, to √Ångel Arnaud and Carlota Vignon, Mexicans of French origin who had settled in Veracruz in the aftermath of the 1862‚Äì1867 French Intervention. He completed his primary education in Orizaba and, influenced by a friend of his, the son of General Bernardo Reyes, decided to enlist in the Army. He was unable to secure entry to the Military Academy in Mexico City but, assisted by the influence of General Reyes, enrolled as a sergeant in the 7th Cavalry Regiment. Shortly after enlisting, however, he deserted; he was promptly tracked down, arrested, sent to the military prison in Tlatelolco for 5¬Ω months, and demoted to a private in the 23rd Infantry Battalion. In the space of three years, however, he had regained his earlier rank after fighting against Maya insurgents in the Caste War of Yucat√°n. Shortly after that, he was posted to Japan in the company of Col. Abelardo √Åvalos.  Governor of Clipperton  Upon his return from the East Asia, the government of President Porfirio D√≠az placed him in charge of the military garrison on Clipperton Island, an atoll in the Pacific subject to a sovereignty dispute between Mexico and France. At first he was reluctant, believing that this amounted to an exile from Mexico, but Col. √Åvalos convinced him by telling him that President D√≠az had personally chosen him to protect Mexico's interests in the international conflict with France, and that the fact that he spoke English, French, and Spanish would assist him in protecting Mexico's sovereignty over the territory. He consequently accepted and arrived on Clipperton as governor in 1906. By 1914, the situation on the island had turned difficult. With the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution and the overthrow of Victoriano Huerta, the Mexican supply ship that sailed between Clipperton and Acapulco had stopped coming. An American ship arrived, bringing provisions and rescuing a German, Gustav Schultz (the representative of the company which mined guano on Clipperton Island), who had lost his mind. The Americans also impressed upon Arnaud the seriousness of the problems which confronted Mexico (including the American occupation of Veracruz) and informed him of the outbreak of the First World War, advising him to abandon the island. Nevertheless, the captain and the rest of the soldiers decided to remain, staying faithful to their duty even though their homeland had forgotten them.  Final days  In 1915, an outbreak of scurvy claimed many of the colonists' lives and in 1915, by now desperate and at the head of a colony that had no food, Arnaud set sail with three soldiers in a canoe in pursuit of a passing ship they had spied. They were unable to reach the ship, however, and the canoe sank while returning, drowning all four of its occupants.  References  *Restrepo, Laura. La Isla de la Pasi√≥n.

They rose to their highest prominence as the dukes of Devonshire and Newcastle. Leading branches have held high offices in English then British politics, especially since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the participation of William Cavendish, then-earl of Devonshire, in the Invitation to William, though the family appears to date to the Norman Conquest of England, with Cavendish being used (in one form or another) as a surname since the beginning of the 13th century. As a place-name, it is first recorded in 1086.  Early history  As a place-name, it is first recorded as in 1086 in the Domesday Book, and appears to have a meaning of 'Cafna's Pasture', from personal byname (from 'bold, daring'), and 'enclosed pasture'. By 1201, it was in use as the surname (borne by one Simon de Cavendis in the Suffolk Records of Pleas before the King (specifically King John), recurring in 1242 as , and again in 1302 as . Additional related information is found on pp. 165, 187, 341. Various (sometimes disputed) early records of Anglo-Norman nobility suggest that the family was founded by a Robert Gernon or Guernon of Montfiquet, granted lands and titles in this area (among many others) for his service during the Conquest, and that the family is closely related to those that later used the surnames Gernon and de Montfichet. The Norman People and Their Existing Descendants (1875) summarizes the history (and the dispute) thus: The de Montfichet line of Essex, Middlesex, and London appears to have become extinct in 1258 with the death without heirs of Magna Carta witness Richard de Montfichet, though the name survived in place names. Gernon survives as a surname in England, Ireland, and abroad (sometimes spelled Garnon or Garnons); it dates in England with the Gernon spelling to at least Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester (1099‚Äì1153), a descendant of Robert de Guernon, the baron from Mountfiquet who as a companions-at-arms of William the Conqueror received more than 50 manor houses, baronies, and other domains in England, including apparently Cavendish. As a noble family, they were landed in Essex, Suffolk, and Derby. survives as a French surname, including with noble connections to at least the 19th century in the same Calvados region of Normandy, especially Ranville, Ouistreham (), and the eponymous Fauguernon. It is claimed ultimately to be derived from , the French name of the Viking who effectively became the first Duke of Normandy; if true, this would make the overall family one of the oldest Norman lineages.The seniority of this family is attested in the various researches on the French nobility made in 1463‚Äì1465 by Monfaut, in 1599 by Roissy, and in 1666 by Chamillard. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes was employed as a tutor by the Cavendish family and educated various members of the family.  From the Glorious Revolution onward  After missing nation-leading and internationally definitive largesse and empire- building in Charles II's five-peer acronym of the Cabal ministry, William Cavendish, Earl of Devonshire, was the first of the name to rise to duke, at age 27. He co-wrote the 1688 Invitation to William to exclude Catholics from the monarchy, which set in motion the Glorious Revolution in that year (and which also ultimately had the result of shifting more power to Parliament). The Invitation's authors were later known as \\"the Immortal Seven\\". This pre- dated the Spencer-Churchills' centrality under campaigns (most of all the Battle of Culloden) against the Catholic pretenders to the throne. High appointments were often won by senior title holders and some juniors among the Cavendishes, from 1688 until about 1887, and marked the family's ascendancy, along with the Marquesses of Salisbury and the Earls of Derby. The notable lines descend from Sir John of Cavendish in the county of Suffolk (c. 1346‚Äì1381). Other peerages included the Dukedom of Newcastle; Barony of Waterpark (County Cork, Ireland); the Barony of Chesham (in Buckinghamshire); and through a daughter marrying into the Bentinck family (leading to combined surnames), the Dukedom of Portland (a title which ceased in 1990, and most of the wealth of which is in the Howard de Walden Estate, which has kept minor, overarching interests in and reviews changes across most of central Marylebone, London). Concessions to populists of post-imperial meritocracy movements shifted power to industrialism and to the House of Commons. The 1911, 1958, 1963, and 1999 transformations of the House of Lords permanently ended key influence by Cavendish and many other British noble families. Under primogeniture, the senior branches of these families still dominate in inter- family (relative) wealth and titles. The head of the modern family is Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire, whose Georgian mansion, Chatsworth House, in the Peak District attracts many visitors with its gardens, iconic high-jet fountain, Capability Brown grounds, and fine-art collection. Among its past urban assets with lasting influence, this branch of the family had a large house in London, on which many grand apartments and houses now stand, including Devonshire Square.

Infanterie-Division (Chronik 1915/1918) It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of regular infantry divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 229th Infantry Brigade staff was formerly the staff of the 82nd Infantry Brigade of the 39th Infantry Division, which came to the new division along with the 171st Infantry Regiment. The 40th Reserve Infantry Regiment was formerly part of the 28th Reserve Division. The 136th Infantry Regiment came from the 30th Infantry Division. The 40th Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in the Grand Duchy of Baden. The 136th Infantry and the 171st Infantry were Alsace-Lorraine regiments, but mainly drew from the Rhineland. Cavalry support came in the form of Baden dragoons. The artillery and combat engineer units were newly formed. Combat chronicle The 115th Infantry Division initially fought on the Western Front in World War I, entering the line in the Artois in April 1915, fighting in the Second Battle of Artois, and then moving to the Aisne region. On July 30, the division left the line and was transported to the Eastern Front, arriving in August and entering the line in the siege of Kovno. It participated in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive and was in the line until November 1916, when it went to the Romanian Front. It fought on the Romanian front into late 1917, and then remained in Romania for several months after the armistice on that front. In April 1918, the division was transported back to the Western Front. After a period in reserve and on the Belgian/Dutch border, it entered combat in June 1916 in the Champagne region. It remained in the Champagne, Verdun and Wo√´vre regions and then fought against the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 606-608.

It was built in 1930 in an Art Deco style, a twin to the Paramount Theater in Peekskill, across the Hudson River. Paramount-Publix Corporation (now Paramount Pictures), the builder and original owner, opened the building on June 12 of that year with a celebration that included a parade at noon, a musical performance by the Paramount Symphony Orchestra, and the first movie, The Big Pond, starring Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert at 6 p.m. It was preceded by a newsreel, a short film about Middletown and its citizens, and a welcome film starring Buddy Rogers. Paramount-Publix had to sell the theater after the U.S. Supreme Court's 1948 United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. decision, which required the movie studios to divest themselves of their theater chains. ABC, a successor corporation, owned the Paramount until 1973 when it sold it to Hallmark Releasing. After several other owners, it closed five years later. In 1979, the city took title when back taxes went unpaid. Two years later, the Arts Council of Orange County bought it and renovated it into a performing arts center. An apron was added to the stage, and a pavilion on the back of the building provided dressing room space. It was reopened in 1985. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The theatre hosts a variety acts and events, as well as art exhibits, lectures, civic fundraisers, dance recitals, business receptions, school theatre series, performing arts summer camp and some film features. The New York Theater Organ Society installed the Wurlitzer organ from the Clairidge Theater in Montclair, New Jersey.

Later life  After marrying Alice Page Schaff in 1868 and moving to Massachusetts, he became Superintendent of the Berkshire Glass Works for 11 years. Another 26 years was spent as a public service with the State Gas and Electric Light Commission of Massachusetts. Schaff embarked on a writing career late in life, publishing his first book in 1905.

It was released in France, Sweden, and on television in the United States as The Tender. It was released straight-to- video in 1994 under its proper title to coincide with Travolta's bigger name release, Pulp Fiction. According to the opening credits, the movie is based on a true story. The film was shot predominantly in Chicago with some pickups and reshoots in Los Angeles. Travolta plays Bobby Allen, a down-on-his-luck single father and recovering alcoholic whose wife died of a drug overdose. With no job and no money, his former brother-in-law Cissy gets him a job as a money courier while Bobby's 10-year-old daughter finds a wounded fighting dog. She takes care of the dog over her father's objections, until Bobby is betrayed by Cissy, who blames him for his sister's death. Desperate, Bobby steals Cissy's money and flees with the girl to California, leaving the dog behind. The dog follows them across the country to be reunited with the girl, while Cissy pursues Bobby to retrieve his money and to take the girl. Plot Partygoers gather at a mansion. A man named Bobby also enters the party. A man tries to make him leave, but Bobby claims to have an appointment with Cissy. When Cissy shows up, Bobby says he has a business opportunity for him, a dry cleaning store. Bobby notices a station wagon entering the garage. In the garage, the man in the station wagon opens the back to reveal a Doberman Pinscher, muzzled, in a small metal cage. Back at the party, Bobby snacks until Cissy comes to visit. Bobby tries again to get him to consider the business, but Cissy only asks if he is drinking, which Bobby denies. Cissy leads him downstairs where the other party goers are gathering. A white pit bull is on one side being held by a man, while the Doberman's cage is on the other. Cissy begins the dogfight and the dogs clash. The Doberman is seriously wounded during the fight and is, later that night, thrown into the river by his owner. The next morning, Baby takes money from an envelope hidden in the headboard of a bed, and buys a cigarette lighter, which she has giftwrapped. Back at the house she decorates a misshapen cake with M&M;'s. Bobby discovers the missing money, and yells at her for stealing the money. They arrive home to find Cissy and some of his goons waiting in their apartment. Bobby complains about Cissy breaking in, but Cissy says he got a key from his sister. Cissy tells him to come by and he might have something for him. Baby finds the Doberman, shivering and whimpering in pain. She cares for him as best she can, and he follows her home, and from there into a subway station, where he is captured by animal control employees. Baby finds where the dog was taken. Baby distracts the worker by dropping some money, and quietly lifts the latch on the kennel, then leaves. That night, the dog escapes the pound and finds his way back to Baby. In the morning, Bobby recognizes it as the fighting dog he saw at Cissy's and demands she gets rid it. He goes to Cissy, where he is offered a job doing pickups with car included. Bobby accepts. Cissy seems to blame Bobby for his sister's death. Baby returns the dog to where she found it, but it gets back to the apartment before she does. Bobby goes out to do his pick ups. At Cissy's place, Cissy complains that Bobby has been on time all day and even refused a drink. Cissy thinks Baby is too much for Bobby to raise and sends two of his goons to go pick up Bobby. Bobby asks what's going on and they pretend to check the receipts. They take him out to a remote bridge area, accuse him of being short, and drag him out of the car where the proceed to beat him. Bobby manages to fight them off. Bobby gets to a phone and calls Baby. He tells her they are taking a trip and to pack a bag very quickly, then meet him at the steps of the park. She comes, with the dog. Bobby hustles her into the car with the bag, but refuses to allow her to bring the dog. She refuses to come, and he relents but abandons the dog in a junkyard. At a truck stop, Bobby explains that they are going to Los Angeles and lies and says that Cissy loaned it to him for the trip. As they leave, the girl drops her glove in the parking lot. Back in Chicago, Cissy and his men are tearing up Bobby's apartment where they find a letter from Bobby's brother. Late that night, the dog arrives at the truck stop and finds the girl's glove. While filling up the gas tank, Bobby asks if he should call George. The girl says he should. While he makes the call, the girl goes to the side of the gas station and leaves a sock on the road. On the phone, Bobby tells George he'll be in L.A. that he'll be there in the morning and gets an invitation to come over. Bobby sees Baby putting the sock on the road and tries to take it back. Bobby helps her by putting rocks on it to keep the wind from blowing it. As they head back to the car, Bobby mentions that L.A. has good schools. The dog continues to follow. Bobby and Baby arrive at George's house where they are greeted warmly. Bobby tells him that he plans to live there and get a job. The dog stops in the barn of a small ranch, where the owner and its dog find him. The man notices the dog's nails are worn down almost to his paws, so he treats them while his dog warms up the Doberman. The next morning, the dog sets off again, arriving in Los Angeles the next morning. George tells Bobby he has a contractor friend who might have a job for Bobby. Bobby and George end up in another argument which ends when George leave Bobby on the side of a freeway. When he gets back to the house, Bobby barks at the girl to get her things because they are leaving. They drive to a motel, but someone steals their car, along with the money. As George and his family eat dinner, Cissy's two goons show up asking where Bobby is. George tells him he doesn't know where Bobby is, so Cissy leaves his number and tells him to call if Bobby contacts him. Cissy tells him they just want the money and reminds him that they know where George lives. The girl suggests going back to George, but Bobby refuses. Bobby tells her he's going to take her to George's and leave her there while he gets himself together. He calls George, and apologizes about the fight, confused about why George is so mad. After George explains, Bobby hangs up to realize the girl has left. He searches for her, even calling George again. The dog arrives at the same bridge the girl stood on a few nights ago, and picks up her scent. He follows it through the city, but finds a crying, drunken Bobby instead. The dog leads him to the girl back at the bridge where she ecstatically greets the dog. Bobby, still crying, hugs her and apologizes. They go back to George's where the brothers hug. While the girl plays outside, Bobby explains everything to George. Cissy's goons beat Bobby up badly. Cissy offers Baby anything she wants if she goes back to Chicago. She goes over to Bobby in answer. As Cissy goes to leave the room, Cissy is confronted by the dog. Cissy doesn't believe it's the same dog that lost the fight, but when the girl says the dog followed them from Chicago, he decides that he wants the dog to fight again. Cissy tells Bobby it's his chance to get out of the situation in one piece. Baby treats Bobby's wounds while the dog looks on. While Bobby sleeps, Cissy is on the phone ordering a dog to fight the Doberman. Back at the bridge, Baby is crying over the Doberman, where Bobby finds her. She tells him she's worried and that she loves him. Bobby tells her he has a plan and reminds her of what she used to do when she was little and he and Brenda were fighting. The next day they take the dog to the location for the fight. Bobby leaves Baby outside and tells her he loves her, and tells her to remember \\"when the bell rings.\\" The Doberman is pitted against a huge mastiff-looking dog. When the bell rings, the girl runs in crying Bobby's name. The crowd's cheers die down and she begs Bobby to make them stop hurting her dog. They stop the fight and break up the dog, and the Doberman runs over to the girl. As the crowd quietly stares at Cissy, Bobby walks across the ring and knocks Cissy into the ring, where the Doberman attacks him. It rips his coat and pants before getting hold of Cissy's neck. Bobby stands over Cissy and tells him \\"it's over.\\" When Cissy agrees, the dog lets go. Bobby and Baby leave with the dog as Cissy's goons help him up.

At that point, it was released straight to VHS format. It was released on DVD in 2002. Reception Despite the star appeal of Travolta, actor Michael Douglas being an executive producer, and having a soundtrack from Randy Edelman, Eyes of an Angel seemed to gain little attention upon its release. Robert Harmon was, however, nominated for a Critics Award for the film at the 1991 Deauville Film Festival in France (under its original name of The Tender).

The Scott Glacier is one of a series of major glaciers flowing across the Transantarctic Mountains, with the Amundsen Glacier to the west and the Leverett and Reedy glaciers to the east. Geography The Scott Glacier originates on the Antarctic Plateau in the vicinity of D'Angelo Bluff and Mount Howe, and descends between the Nilsen Plateau and the mountains of the Watson Escarpment to enter Ross Ice Shelf just west of the Tapley Mountains. The Tapley Mountains, Watson Escarpment, Mount Blackburn, and the La Gorce Mountains bound the Scott Glacier on its eastern margin, while the Karo Hills, Hays Mountains, Faulkner Escarpment, and Rawson Mountains define the western edge of the Scott's drainage. History Scott Glacier was discovered in December 1929 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Laurence Gould. The Scott Glacier was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US- ACAN) after early Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott, who never saw the Scott Glacier but rather ascended the Beardmore Glacier to the west en route to the South Pole in 1911‚Äì12. It was first ski traversed in January 1990 by Martyn Williams (Canada, the leader and guide) and Jerry Corr (USA) traveling from the South Pole to the Ross Ice Shelf and then by Mike McDowell (Australia) in 1992, on a ski traverse from the South Pole to the coast. Thus Williams and Corr were the first people to traverse Antarctica under human power as described in the book The Snotsicle Traverse by Jerry Corr.

Wu was the first medical student of Chinese descent to study at the University of Cambridge.Wu Lien-Teh, 2014. Plague Fighter: The Autobiography of a Modern Chinese Physician. Penang: Areca Books. He was also the first Malayan nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, in 1935.  Life and education  Wu was born in Penang, one of the three towns of the Straits Settlements (the others being Malacca and Singapore). The Straits Settlements formed part of the colonies of the United Kingdom. His father was a new immigrant from Taishan, China, and he worked as a goldsmith. His mother's family also originated from China: she was a Hakka second-generation resident of Malaya. Wu had four brothers and six sisters. His early education was at the Penang Free School. Wu was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1896, after winning the Queen's Scholarship. He had a successful career at university, winning virtually all the available prizes and scholarships. His undergraduate clinical years were spent at St Mary's Hospital, London and he then continued his studies at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (under Sir Ronald Ross), the Pasteur Institute, Halle University, and the Selangor Institute. Wu returned to the Straits Settlement in 1903. Some time after that, he married Ruth Shu-chiung Huang, whose sister was married to Lim Boon Keng, a physician who promoted social and educational reforms in Singapore. The sisters were daughters of Wong Nai Siong, a Chinese revolutionary leader and educator who had moved to the area from 1901 to 1906. Wu and his family moved to China in 1907 (see below for more details). During his time in China, Wu's wife and two of their three sons died. During the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, in November 1931, Wu was detained and interrogated by the Japanese authorities under suspicion of being a Chinese spy. In 1937, during the Japanese occupation of much of China and the retreat of the Nationalists, Wu was forced to flee, returning to the Settlements to live in Ipoh. His home and collection of ancient Chinese medical books was burnt. In 1943 Wu was captured by Malayan left-wing resistance fighters and held for ransom. Then he nearly was prosecuted by the Japanese for supporting the resistance movement by paying the ransom, but was protected by having treated a Japanese officer. Sometime after moving to Ipoh, Wu remarried and had four more children. One of Wu's daughters, Yu-lin Wu, also became a physician.  Career  In September 1903 Wu joined the Institute for Medical Research in Kuala Lumpur as the first research student. However, there was no specialist post for him because, at that time, a two-tier medical system in the British colonies provided that only British nationals could hold the highest positions of fully qualified medical officers or specialists. Wu spent his early medical career researching beri-beri and roundworms (Ascarididae) before entering private practice toward the end of 1904 in Chulia Street, Penang.  Opium  Wu was a vocal commentator on the social issues of the time. In the early 1900s, he became friends with Lim Boon Keng and Song Ong Siang, a lawyer who was active in developing Singapore civil society. He joined them in editing The Straits Chinese Magazine. With his friends, Wu founded the Anti-Opium Association in Penang. He organised a nationwide anti- opium conference in the spring of 1906 that was attended by approximately 3000 people.Cooray, Francis; Nasution Khoo Salma. Redoutable Reformer: The Life and Times of Cheah Cheang Lim. Areca Books, 2015. This attracted the attention of the powerful forces involved in the lucrative trade of opium and, in 1907, this led to a search and subsequent discovery of one ounce of tincture of opium in Wu's dispensary, for which he was convicted and fined. Wu began work for the Chinese government in 1907 and became vice director of the Army Medical College, based in Tianjin, in 1908.  Pneumonic plague  In the winter of 1910, Wu was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate an unknown disease that killed 99.9% of its victims. This was the beginning of the large pneumonic plague pandemic of Manchuria and Mongolia, which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. Wu was able to conduct a postmortem (usually not accepted in China at the time) on a Japanese woman who had died of the plague. Having ascertained via the autopsy that the plague was spreading by air, Wu developed surgical masks he had seen in use in the West into more substantial masks with layers of gauze and cotton to filter the air. G√©rald Mesny, a prominent French doctor who had come to replace Wu refused to wear a mask and died days later of the plague. The mask was widely produced, with Wu overseeing the production and distribution of 60,000 masks in a later pandemic, and it featured in many press images. It is believed that the N95 mask is the descendant of Wu's design. Wu initiated a quarantine, arranged for buildings to be disinfected, and the old plague hospital to be burned down and replaced. The measure that Wu is best remembered for was in asking for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims. It was impossible to bury the dead because the ground was frozen, and the bodies could only be disposed of by soaking them in paraffin and burning them on pyres. Cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic; days after cremations began, plague began to decline and within months it had been eradicated. Wu chaired the International Plague Conference in Mukden (Shenyang) in April 1911, a historic event attended by scientists from the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, Russia, Mexico, and China. The conference took place over three weeks and featured demonstrations and experiments. Wu later presented a plague research paper at the International Congress of Medicine, London in August 1911 which was published in The Lancet in the same month. At the plague conference, epidemiologists Danylo Zabolotny and Anna Tchourilina announced that they had traced the initial cause of the outbreak to Tarbagan marmot hunters who had contracted the disease from the animals. A tarabagan became the conference mascot. However, Wu raised the question of why traditional marmot hunters had not experienced deadly epidemics before. He later published a work arguing that the traditional Mongol and Buryat hunters had established practices that kept their communities safe and he blamed more recent Shandong immigrants to the area for using hunting methods that captured more sick animals and increased risk of exposure.  Later career  In 1912, Wu became the first director of the Manchurian Plague Service. He was a founder member and first president of the Chinese Medical Association (1916‚Äì1920).Courtney, Chris (2018), \\"The Nature of Disaster in China: The 1931 Central China Flood\\", Cambridge University Press [] Wu led the efforts to combat the 1920-21 cholera pandemic in the north-east of China. In 1929, he was appointed a trustee of the 'Nanyang Club' in Penang by Cheah Cheang Lim, along with Wu Lai Hsi, Robert Lim Kho Seng, and Lim Chong Eang. The 'Nanyang Club', an old house in Peiping, China, provided convenient accommodation to overseas Chinese friends. In the 1930s he became the first director of the National Quarantine Service. Around 1939. Wu moved back to Malaya and continued to work as a general practitioner in Ipoh. Wu collected donations to start the Perak Library (now the Tun Razak Library) in Ipoh, a free-lending public library, and donated to Shanghai City Library and the University of Hong Kong. Wu was a mandarin of the second rank and sat on advisory committees for the League of Nations. He was given awards by the Czar of Russia and the President of France, and was awarded honourary degrees by Johns Hopkins University, Peking University, the University of Hong Kong, and the University of Tokyo.  Death and commemoration  Wu practised medicine until his death at the age of 80. He had bought a new house in Penang for his retirement and had just completed his 667-page autobiography, Plague Fighter, the Autobiography of a Modern Chinese Physician. On 21 January 1960, he died of a stroke while in his home in Penang. A road named after Wu can be found in Ipoh Garden South, a middle- class residential area in Ipoh. In Penang, a private road named Taman Wu Lien Teh is located near the Penang Free School. In that school, his alma mater, a house has been named after him. There is a Dr. Wu Lien-teh Society, Penang. The Wu Lien-teh Collection, which comprises 20,000 books, was given by Wu to the Nanyang University, which later became part of the National University of Singapore. The Art Museum of the University of Malaya has a collection of Wu's paintings. In 1995, Wu's daughter, Dr. Yu-lin Wu, published a book about her father, Memories of Dr. Wu Lien-teh, Plague Fighter. In 2015, the Wu Lien-Teh Institute opened at Harbin Medical University. In 2019, The Lancet launched an annual Wakley-Wu Lien Teh Prize in honour of Wu and the publication's founding editor, Thomas Wakley. Dr. Wu Lien-teh is regarded as the first person to modernise China's medical services and medical education. In Harbin Medical University, bronze statues of him commemorate his contributions to public health, preventive medicine, and medical education. During the Coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019, several scholars argued that Wu's work had contemporary relevance to the field of epidemiology. In May 2020, Dr Yvonne Hohttps://www.DrYvonneHo.com/ organised the Inaugural Meeting of the Medical and Scientific Descendants of Dr Wu Lien-Teh via video-conferencing, after having identified 17 known descendants living in 11 different cities, 4 different continents separated by time-zones of up to 17 hours, and with an age range of 62 years. They were all native English speakers with different accents. No-one had previously met everyone else of this group prior to this date.https://www.DrWuLienTeh.com In July 2020, a joint article by some of these medical and scientific descendants was published for the first time, to remember and honour Dr Wu's lifetime work in Public Health. In August 2020, a second joint article to honour Dr Wu was published by a second group of his medical and scientific descendants. In September 2020, a third joint article was published in the Chinese language.  References   Further reading  * Wu Lien-Teh, 1959. Plague Fighter: The Autobiography of a Modern Chinese Physician.

He owned and managed the Algonquin Hotel during the heyday of the Algonquin Round Table and wrote a number of books about his experiences with the hotel and the Round Tablers. Case worked at the Algonquin from the time it opened in 1902. It was Case who came up with the hotel's name. The original owner had wanted to call it \\"The Puritan.\\" In 1907 Case took over the lease and became manager, eventually buying the hotel in 1927 for $1,000,000. He remained owner and manager of the Algonquin until his death in 1946. Personal life Born in Buffalo, New York, on November 7, 1872, Frank Case worked as an usher at a vaudeville theater as a teen. In 1896, he started his hotel career as a night clerk at the Genesee Hotel in Buffalo. In a live appearance on the Royal Gelatine Hour radio show on June 17, 1937, Case told Rudy Valee that he learned his hotelier skills at the Genesee Hotel. There, he had to stay up all night by roaming the hotel on roller skates. Later, he managed Taylor's Hotel in Jersey City, New Jersey for three years. In 1902, at age 31, he was hired by Albert Foster to work at the new hotel at 59 W. 44th Street in Manhattan. Although Foster owned the hotel, Case embraced it as his own. He persuaded his boss to change the name of the hotel, from the \\"Puritan\\" to the \\"Algonquin.\\" Twenty-five years later, he bought the business. In June 1916, Mr. Case married Mrs Bertha Louise Grahling, n√©e Walden. His best man was Douglas Fairbanks Sr, a lifelong friend. Bertha was a charming, gracious, outstanding hostess, who fully participated in hotel operations. The Algonquin became a hub for both theater people and journalists, whose offices were nearby. In 1918, Vanity Fair magazine was four doors down. VF writers Robert E. Sherwood, Robert Benchley, and Dorothy Parker began lunching at the Algonquin. When the press reported that theater critic, Alexander Woollcott, was roasted at the Algonquin, customers increased. Mr. Case had a passion for the Arts, and encouraged, cultivated, and catered to the growing literary and artistic celebrities. Those attending these luncheons included Heywood Broun, Harold Ross, Edna Ferber, George S. Kaufman, Harpo Marx, and Franklin P. Adams (F.P.A.) among many others. Mr. Case moved this lively group to a round table in the center of the Rose room. Thus, began the Algonquin Round Table. He served them free hors d'oeuvres, provided a room for poker games, and space for journalists to hammer out stories. In 1925, Round tabler Harold Ross founded the New Yorker magazine. Case began the tradition of giving each hotel guest a free copy of The New Yorker. Frank Case died June 7, 1946 in Manhattan, New York and is buried in New York City's Woodlawn Cemetery. Case was married twice. His first wife, Caroline Eckert Case, died in 1908 giving birth to the couple's second child, a boy named Carroll.

Her sisterships were , , and . Sachsen was built in the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin. She was laid down in April 1875, launched on 21 July 1877, and commissioned on 21 October 1878. The ship was armed with a main battery of six guns in individual open mounts. Sachsen was built when the German navy was primarily concerned with coastal defense against either French or Russian fleets. The ship participated in routine fleet maneuvers for the duration of her active career. On her last such fleet exercise, in 1901, she accidentally rammed and sank the aviso . The following year, Sachsen was placed in reserve, and in 1911, she was used as a target hulk for the fleet. The ship was eventually broken up for scrap in 1919, following the German defeat in World War I.  Design  Illustration of Sachsen The Sachsen class was the first group of capital ships built under the tenure of General Albrecht von Stosch, the first Chief of the Imperial Admiralty. Stosch favored a coastal defense strategy for the German fleet, and the Sachsens were intended to operate from fortified ports, from which they could sortie to attack blockading fleets. They proved to be controversial in service, as critics pointed out their poor seakeeping, tendency to roll in heavy seas, and low speed compared to earlier armored frigates. The ship was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. Sachsen was powered by two 3-cylinder single-expansion steam engines, which were supplied with steam by eight coal- fired D√ºrr boilers. The ship's top speed was , at . Her standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men, though while serving as a squadron flagship this was augmented by another 7 officers and 34 men. She was armed with a main battery of six guns, two of which were single-mounted in an open barbette forward of the conning tower and the remaining four mounted amidships, also on single mounts in an open barbette. As built, the ship was also equipped with six L/24 guns and eight Hotchkiss revolver cannons for defense against torpedo boats. Sachsen's armor was made of wrought iron, and was concentrated in an armored citadel amidships. The armor ranged from on the armored citadel, and between on the deck. The barbette armor was 254 mm of wrought iron backed by 250 mm of teak.  Service history  Sachsen was ordered by the Imperial Navy under the contract name \\"B,\\" which denoted that the vessel was a new addition to the fleet. She was built at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin; her keel was laid down in 1875 under yard number 74. The ship was launched on 21 July 1877, and was commissioned into the German fleet on 20 October 1878. She was the first large, armored warship built for the German navy that relied entirely on engines for propulsion. After her commissioning, Sachsen joined the German fleet, which was tasked primarily with coastal defense against France and Russia, who were presumed to be the most likely enemies in a continental war. In the early 1880s, heightened tensions with Russia prompted the naval command developed more offensively- minded contingencies. These formed the basis for the annual summer fleet maneuvers, in which Sachsen took part. In 1887, she was present for the ceremonies marking the beginning of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, which was to link the Kiel with the North Sea. Kapit√§n zur See Otto von Diederichs took command of the ship in 1889. Sachsen took part in a goodwill visit to Portsmouth to take part in the Cowes Regatta. Following the trip to England, Sachsen and the rest of the fleet conducted the annual summer exercises. At 15:45 on 27 February 1890, Sachsen ran aground outside Kiel in foggy weather. The grounding dented the bottom of the hull and tore it open. However, on 2 March, the ship was able to get underway at high tide. Repairs lasted for two weeks. In 1891, the German navy stopped the practice of deactivating the fleet in the winter months and instead kept the front-line units on permanent active duty. The fleet was also reorganized, to form two four-ship divisions. Sachsen and her sisters were assigned to I Division, under the command of Admiral Hans von Koester. Annual fleet training cruises were conducted in April. The summer fleet maneuvers, which occurred during mid-August to mid-September, up through 1894 were always centered on defensive actions in the North and Baltic seas. left Starting in 1896, Sachsen was dry- docked at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization. The ship's entire propulsion system, including screws, boilers, and engines were replaced with new equipment. The single-expansion engines were replaced with compound engines that offered higher performance. Wood construction was replaced with steel and the vessel was lightened by . The four funnels were trunked into a single stack and a new conning tower was built, protected by nickel-steel. The secondary battery was also improved: the 8.7 cm guns were replaced with 8.8 cm SK L/30 quick-firing guns and the eight 3.7 cm machine guns were replaced with four newer models. On 1 May 1897, the ship was re- commissioned for trials, during which the ship reached . On 4 September 1901, Sachsen collided with the aviso while on extensive training maneuvers with the rest of the fleet. Wacht was sunk, but the crew was safely evacuated and neither ship suffered casualties. During the maneuvers, Wacht attempted to pass between Sachsen and her sistership W√ºrttemberg. However, Wachts helmsman misjudged the distance and passed too closely in front of Sachsen. Sachsen immediately attempted to reverse course to avoid ramming the cruiser, but the ships collided. Sachsens ram bow tore a large hole in Wacht, which began to slowly sink. The battleship attempted to tow Wacht to shallow water, but several of Wachts internal bulkheads collapsed under the strain and the ship quickly sank. In 1902, Sachsen was withdrawn from active service and placed in the reserve fleet. The ship remained as a reserve vessel until 19 February 1910, when she was stricken from the navy list. The following year, Sachsen was used as a target hulk off the coast of Schwansen for the fleet. Following the German defeat in World War I in 1918, the vessel was sold to Hattinger Co., which broke the ship up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven in 1919.

It was built by iX.co and Virtual Eye, a division of Animation Research Ltd (ARL), in accordance with the PGA TOUR Digital Product Team. TOURCast lets viewers follow players‚Äô progress around a golf course, by exploring the graphically traced results of each shot by leveraging ShotLink data. ShotLink, the PGA Tour's data gathering information system is used to provide the necessary real-time information to TOURCast. However, TOURCast takes shot trails a step further by depicting the course through interactive 3D renderings produced via overlaying high-resolution imagery captured by low flying aircraft on to computer-aided design (CAD) wireframes. Before a golfer hits a shot, viewers can see his career history on the hole he‚Äôs playing, his up-to-the-minute strokes-gained data for the tournament and the season, his position on the leader board, how tough the hole is playing on the day, yardages to the pin, front and back of the green, and manipulate the view angles to capture the views from wherever the players may be standing. Once the shot is hit, fans will have significantly more data than previously at their disposal. Swing speed, ball speed, spin rate, apex height, and more will be provided by Trackman's radar technology. This data is also used to provide the true ‚Äúball- in-motion‚Äù flight path of every tee shot. If a player hits a rope hook or a stinger, you‚Äôll see just how much the ball moved from right to left or how low the apex was. TOURCast also provides the ability to replay the video for every shot captured on camera. The camera feeds are passed through an AI-driven video highlight cutting and posting program, facilitated by WSC sports, which will result in every shot captured by a PGA TOUR camera being immediately posted to TourCast. If a player is in a featured group, that means virtually every one of his shots will be viewable through TOURCast in near real-time.

It suggests that the signer was born to wealth and privilege but disgraced himself and so has enlisted as a common soldier (perhaps at the lowest rank, as a private or corporal) serving far from the society that now scorns him. Compare to remittance man, often the black sheep of a \\"good\\" family, paid a regular allowance to stay abroad, far from home, where he cannot embarrass the family. The term also describes those soldiers who signed on specifically as 'gentleman volunteers' in the British Army to serve as private soldiers with the understanding being that they would be given a commission (without purchase) at a later date. The men trained and fought as private soldiers but \\"messed\\" (dined and perhaps socialized) with the officers and were thus afforded a social standing of somewhere in between the two. Kipling's poem The term appears in several of Rudyard Kipling's stories and as the title of a poem he wrote which appeared in Barrack-Room Ballads, and Other Verses, first series, published in 1892. T. S. Eliot included it in his 1941 collection A Choice of Kipling's Verse. In Kipling's poem \\"Gentlemen- Rankers\\", the speaker \\"sings\\":  Commentary on the poem  \\"machinely crammed\\" may indicate the use of a Latin 'crammer' and the general method of learning by rote; a somewhat 'mechanical' process. The Empress is Queen Victoria, specifically in her role as Empress of India. Ready tin means easy access to money. Branded with the blasted worsted spur refers to the emblem of a spur, embroidered with worsted wool, that was sewn onto the uniforms of highly skilled riding masters of the British Army. And the Curse of Reuben holds us, this refers to the Biblical story of Reuben, who, for sexual misconduct, was told by his dying father, \\"Reuben, thou art my first-born .... Unstable as water, thou shall never excel....\\" (Genesis 49:3-4).  Adaptations of and references to the poem  Kipling's poem, in translation, was set to music by Edvard Grieg in 1900 (EG 156, Gentlemen-Menige.) However, after he had completed it, he received a copy of the English original and was so dismayed by the omission of important passages that he did not publish it; it was published posthumously in 1991. Based on a recent recording by Monica Groop, it sounds as though the \\"Baa! Baa! Baa!\\" choruses were omitted. The poem was set to music and sung at Harvard and Yale Universities in the early 1900s. It became associated with one collegiate a cappella group in particular, The Whiffenpoofs of Yale. Their historian states that the song was known \\"as far back as 1902\\" and was popular by 1907‚Äì1909. The words were famously adapted by Meade Minnigerode and George Pomeroy to become \\"The Whiffenpoof Song\\". In turn, it has been covered by many singers, including Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. James Jones's award-winning 1951 bestseller From Here to Eternity, about American soldiers in Hawaii on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II, takes its title from Kipling's poem. In Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers (1959), the poem is sung at marching cadence by Mobile Infantry officer cadets. Billy Bragg borrows part of this poem in his song \\"Island Of No Return\\" on his 1984 album Brewing Up with Billy Bragg: \\"Me and the corporal out on the spree, Damned from here to Eternity\\". Peter Bellamy recorded it in 1990 for his privately issued cassette Soldiers Three. This recording was also included in 2012 on the CD reissue of Peter Bellamy Sings the Barrack-Room Ballads of Rudyard Kipling.https://mainlynorfolk.info/peter.bellamy/songs/gentlemenrankers.html The song is spoken of in The Road to Kalamata, a memoir by soldier of fortune Mike Hoare, who led several mercenary companies during the bush wars in the Katanga and former Belgian Congo during the 1960s. Eliza Carthy recorded the poem in full on her 2019 album ‚ÄúRestitute‚Äù.

He was appointed third in command after John Garang and Kerubino Kuanyin Bol. While he worked as a commander of the SPLA he lived in Itang, a small Ethiopian town in the Gambela Region. In September 1992 he defected from the SPLA to join another faction under Riek Machar, but he rejoined the SPLA before he was assassinated on 13 January 1996, possibly by Machar's forces.  Early life  Bany was a Nuer from Ayot. He was also related to the Dinka. (The Dinka claim that he is an ethnic Dinka from Duk Padiet.) He spoke Nuer, Arabic, Amharic, and some English. Army life When war broke out in a southern town of Bor, Bany served as a major in the Sudanese army in Ayot. He served as a commander in Sudan for a long time before he started a rebellion in 1983. Bany and Kerubino Kwanyin Bol were founding members of SPLA, before John Garang joined them. Bany was appointed the 3rd high-ranking Commander after Bol. Commander Salva Kiir was the 4th. Bany was also the Chief of Staff, a position later occupied by Commander Paul Malong Awan.  SPLA dissent  In August 1991 there was a split between the SPLM/A-Torit faction, and SPLA- Nasir, led by Lam Akol Ajawin. SPLA-Nasir accused Garang of ruling by force, in a \\"dictatorial reign of terror\\"; but ethnic rivalry seemed to have a part, with the Nasir faction mainly composed of Nuer, and Garang's supporters mainly Dinka people. Months of fighting between the two factions left thousands dead in early 1992. The SPLA-Nasir also raised the idea of an independent south (whereas Garang wanted unity). On 10 May 1992 Bany was met by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairman under Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida in Abuja, to discuss the need for unifying the two delegations. An agreement was signed the following day, known as the Abuja II Peace agreement. Defection from SPLA On 14 September 1992, Bany, who was at the time Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the SPLA and Deputy Chairman of the SPLM, announced his defection from the SPLA. It is alleged that he was offered money by Khartoum (seat of the Sudanese government) to do so. Bany left the SPLA headquarter in Pageri, escaped Garang-held territory and formed another faction, Forces of Unity (?). The following day, Commander Salva Kiir Mayardit was promoted from Chief of Staff to Bany's old positions of Deputy Commander- in-Chief and Deputy Chairman. Bany's forces were defeated in October 1993 and he withdrew to Lafon, where he joined forces with Riek Machar and Lam Akol (who had attempted a coup in August 1991 and brought about an ethnic civil war within the SPLA in the Nasir region, with heavy civilian casualties). Fighting went on in the Lafon area between the SPLA and Machar and Bany's group. Children were recruited to the ranks of the various factions, and a group of Nuer boys were lured from their families by the promise of education only to end up in a camp run by Bany in Magire in Eastern Equatoria state. Fighting continued throughout 1993 and 1994. SPLA-United A third faction, known as the Kerubino group, was formed in February 1993, after Bol and several others had escaped from a Garang prison. On 5 April 1993, at a press conference in Nairobi, the three rebel factions announced a coalition, to be called \\"Sudanese People's Liberation Army-United\\", known as SPLA-United, which included a number of former Garang officials and other southerners. In early 1994, under both domestic and international pressure owing to heavy casualties exacerbated by famine, SPLA-United agreed to a cease-fire in which Garang agreed to self-determination for the south, an idea which had gained popularity. However, there was rivalry between SPLA-United's Machar and Garang in their respective leadership roles. In April 1994, a conference was called (the first since 1983) of about 500 delegates, in order to support and consolidate Garang's leadership, against SPLA-United. In July 1994, Bany was third in command of SPLA-United after Riek Machar and Bol. Back to SPLA In early 1995, Machar (of the Nasir faction) split to form the SSIM, Southern Sudan Independence Movement, formally launched on 11-12 March 1995. Bany was expelled from SPLA-United for his alleged collaboration with Khartoum (government of Sudan), at which he supported a pro-Garang stance within the SSIM ‚Äì but later both groups changed to support unity anyway. Machar led an anti-SPLA faction, while Bany led a pro-SPLA faction within the SSIM. On 31 March 1995, a group of junior officers talked Bany into rejoining the SPLA, and contact was made with Garang and Kiir. On 27 April 1995 \\"The Lafon Declaration\\" was made confirming Bany's return to the SPLA/M. A few weeks later, Bany apologised for his actions and expressed gratitude that Commander Salva Kiir had given up his position as the Deputy to allow Bany to resume his duties in this position. He went on to fight vigorously for the SPLA/M. An article in the University of Pennsylvania's Africa Center journal Sudan Update reported in May 1995 that Bany, who was sacked earlier that year by SSIM/A leader Machar, \\"was sent out from the government garrison at Magiri with ten armoured vehicles to rescue the captured convoy, but instead joined forces with the rebels\\", in March 1995. He and Bol, who had also been dismissed, were reinstated in their posts. It referred to \\"personal animosities\\" among leaders, and failure to control inter-tribal feuding, which had damaged the rebel forces' effectiveness. Bol, Bany and Arok Thon Arok had at various times cooperated with government forces, which led to accusations of treachery. In April 1996, SSIM and SPLA-United signed an agreement with the Sudanese government which endorsed the current boundaries of the country, i.e., no independent south. Death According to The National Courier, Bany was killed by Machar's forces on 13 of January 1996 at Gul. Family and legacy Bany is survived by a number of widows and children (most of whom live in the United States of America). One of his widows, Abuoch, was a main speaker during Martyr's Day celebrations in Juba in 2012, in the presence of Salva Kiir. Salva Kiir married one of Bany's daughters, Aluel William Nyuon Bany, in a traditional wedding around 2004. This later caused public strife between her and Kiir's eldest daughter, Christina Adut Nardes. One of his daughters is Nyadol Nyuon, prominent lawyer and human rights advocate in Melbourne, Australia. One of his daughters, Nyagoa Nyuon, returned to South Sudan after spending about 10 years in the US. In 2013, she co-founded The William Nyuon Bany Foundation, which supports programs fostering children's education and focuses on \\"improving the health and livelihoods of the communities and building the leadership capacity youth for a prosperous country\\". One of his sons is called Mabok William Nyuon. A conference hall in the South Sudan State House was named after Bany.

It is a more aggressive, but still treatable, form of leukemia.  B-cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia  Specifically, B-PLL is a prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) that affects prolymphocytes ‚Äì immature forms of B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes ‚Äì in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. It is an aggressive cancer that presents poor response to treatment. Mature lymphocytes are infection-fighting immune system cells. B-lymphocytes have two responsibilities: # Production of antibodies ‚Äì In response to antigens, B-lymphocytes produce and release antibodies specific to foreign substances in order to aid in their identification and elimination phagocytes # Generation of memory cells ‚Äì Interactions between antibodies and antigens allow B-lymphocytes to establish cellular memories, otherwise known as immunities that allow the body to respond more rapidly and efficiently to previously encountered species  Classification  It is categorized as a lymphoproliferative disorder due to the excessive production of lymphocytes, in B-PLL there is excess production of B-prolymphocytes by the bone marrow. These immature lymphocytes are not normally found in the blood; part of their maturation process is being programmed to produce antibodies against foreign material prior to their departure from the bone marrow. In B-PLL, malignant B-prolymphocytes disrupt the adaptive capabilities of the immune system due to the lack of mature B-lymphocytes. It has been suggested that some cases may represent a variant of mantle cell lymphoma.  Epidemiology  B-PLL represents less than 1% of all leukemia cases worldwide, mainly affecting the elderly population with a mean age of presentation between 65-70 years. Most cases have shown slight male predominance, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6 to 1, and the vast majority of patients being Caucasians.  Signs and Clinical Features  This type of leukemia is characterized by: * More than 55% of circulating cells in peripheral blood (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets collectively) are prolymphocytes. Generally, prolymphocyte proportion exceeds 90% * Minimal or absence of lymphadenopathy ‚Äì abnormalities in size, number or consistency of lymph nodes * Splenomegaly - Abnormal enlargement of the spleen * High white blood cell count * B-symptoms ‚Äì Fever, night sweats and/or weight loss Similar to other leukemias, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is often asymptomatic. The most common signs and symptoms are the result of the inability of the bone marrow to produce normal levels of blood cells: * Anaemia ‚Äì due to lack of red blood cells * More frequent, severe and prolonged infections ‚Äì due to lack of normal white blood cells * Bleeding and bruising ‚Äì due to lack of platelets  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of B-PLL is difficult due to its considerable overlap with other mature B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. It requires integration of morphology with diagnostic tests including immunophenotyping and chromosome analysis (cytogenetics).  Morphology  The malignant B cells are larger than average. In order to diagnose a patient with B-PLL, b-prolymphocyte composition of a patient's blood cells must exceed 55%. High white blood cell counts ‚Äì greater than 100 x 109/L ‚Äì are also indicative of B-PLL. B-prolymphocytes are characterized by: * Large size ‚Äì approximately twice the size of a normal small lymphocyte * Round or oval-shaped nuclei * Single prominent nucleolus * Moderately condensed nuclear chromatin * High nuclear- cytoplasmic ratio ‚Äì indicates more abundant cytoplasm  Immunophenotype  This technique is used to study proteins expressed in cells using immunologic markers. In B-PLL patients there is strong expression of surface immunoglobulin ‚Äì a membrane-bound form of an antibody, b-lymphocyte surface antigens CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a and FMC7, and weak expression of CD5 and CD23. Due to the similarities among lymphoproliferative disorders, it is often difficult to diagnose patients. Immunophenotyping helps distinguish B-PLL from similar diseases, one of its key identifiers is the absence in expression of the surface antigens CD10, CD11c, CD25, CD103 and cyclin D1 ‚Äì an important regulator of cell-cycle progression. A case has been described as CD20+, CD22+, and CD5-. It can also be CD5+. Another case was described as CD45+, CD19+, CD20+, CD5+, HLA-DR+, CD10-, CD23+/-, CD38+ and FMC7-.  Cytogenetics  B-PLL is rare, consequently few genetic studies have focused on this disease. As a result, the associated genetic lesions underlying B-PLL are largely unknown.  Chromosomal Mutations  The most commonly reported abnormalities have occurred at chromosome 14, specifically in a region of the chromosome called band q23 (14q23). Translocations to this location lead to overexpression of the cyclin D1 gene which has been linked to both the development and progression of a number of cancers. Other chromosomal abnormalities have been reported on 6q21, 11q23, 12p12, 13q14 and 17p. It can involve deletions from chromosome 11 and chromosome 13.  TP53 Gene  Among the documented studies, mutations to the TP53 gene have occurred in 75% of all cases of B-PLL. This is the highest incidence among all sub-types of B-cell malignancies. Mutations to this gene have also been documented in other hematologic malignancies. TP53 is an important transcriptional activator of genes involved in the regulation of the G1 checkpoint of the cell cycle as well as certain genes responsible for programmed-cell death (apoptosis). It is believed that mutations to TP53 are responsible for the frequent therapy resistance and aggressive course of this disease.  c-MYC Gene  In a small number of B-PLL cases, abnormalities in the c-MYC gene have been observed. It is considered a global amplifier and influences nearly all aspects of cellular activity. Among the number of genes it regulates, most are involved in cell growth, cell cycle progression, protein biosynthesis and apoptosis. Amplification of c-MYC has been reported in B-PLL patients and while the consequences are unclear, it is generally associated with poor clinical outcome.  Biopsy  After physicians have identified an abnormality in the composition of the peripheral blood, biopsies (tissue samples) from a patient's bone marrow and/or spleen are often recommended for confirmation. A bone marrow biopsy involves the removal of a small amount of tissue that is further analyzed for abnormalities, for B-PLL pathologists look for prolymphocytic infiltration where the hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow are replaced with prolymphocytes due to excess production. In 50% of reported cases, it was common for patients to be both anemic (lack healthy red blood cells in blood) and thrombocytopenic (deficiency of platelets in blood).  Treatment  The rarity of B-PLL paired with its considerably fast progression compared to other leukemias has resulted in difficult production of effective treatments. This disease is currently incurable, treatments and therapy are guided to reduce prolymphocyte abundance in the blood and production by the bone marrow, treating symptoms and controlling progression.  Watchful Waiting  Some patients do not require immediate treatment after diagnosis; these patients include those that do not show overt symptoms or whose cancer has not been observed to be progressing. Regular check-ups with physicians are required to actively monitor the patient's condition; once there is evidence of disease progression or patient distress from symptoms, treatment will be implemented.  Chemotherapy  B-PLL has a very aggressive clinical course and refractoriness to chemotherapy; it is believed this resistance is the result of mutations to the TP53 gene. Its resistant nature has led to the use of combinations of chemotherapy drugs. Drug regimens recommended and employed by physicians are unique to each patient and are based on previous chemotherapy experience along with potential side effects. In addition to the utilization of combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs, it is most often paired with immunotherapy treatments.  Targeted Therapy   Monoclonal Antibodies  A type of targeted therapy that recognizes specific proteins in leukemia cells preventing collateral damage to normal, healthy cells. The following are compounds currently showing promising results in clinical trials and studies: * Rituximab is a widely used monoclonal antibody in treating B-cell malignancies, it is directed against the surface protein CD20. Case studies have documented successful treatment of B-PLL solely with rituximab; additional studies have reported positive activity when rituximab is paired with the chemotherapeutic drugs fludarabine or bendamustine together with the anthracyclines mitoxantrone or epirubicin * Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody that targets the CD52 antigen which is highly expressed in malignant B-lymphocytes. In vitro tests have demonstrated that it induces cell death. Furthermore, it is most active in the blood, bone marrow and spleen, all of which are main sites involved with B-PLL and thus could serve as a potential agent in treating this disease with more research  Splenectomy or Radiation Therapy to Spleen  Patients with splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), unfit for systemic treatment or refractive to chemotherapy may have their spleens removed via splenectomy or undergo splenic irradiation in order to relieve pain, control their symptoms, and allow removal of a major proliferative focus and tumour bulk in this disease. Splenic irradiation has been used in the treatment.  Stem Cell Transplantation  A stem cell transplant is a procedure that uses highly specialized cells called hematopoietic stem cells to replace bone marrow that contains the leukemia. This procedure should be considered in younger patients that have responded well to initial treatments because the progression and spread of this disease is inevitable. However, stem cell transplantation is a high-risk procedure, with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, it is often not a feasible option due to the presence of other systemic diseases/conditions.  Prognosis  Despite advancements in treatments and deeper understanding of pathogenesis, the prognosis for B-PLL patients is poor , with early relapse and median survival time between 3‚Äì5 years.

The restaurant served everyone from United States presidents to the homeless. It closed its doors on December 1, 2001, due to rent increases combined with a sudden drop in local tourism that year based on fear of terrorism. Location At its height, the restaurant had become a chain with eight locations, but for its last decade the restaurant's only location was at 1990 K Street N.W., with its entrance on 20th Street N.W. Often, charter buses would be outside, picking up or letting off groups of high school students from around the country. History The first location opened in 1928 by Evan A. Sholl. Sholl was an entrepreneur from rural Pennsylvania whose businesses included farms, a dairy, an ice cream factory, and real estate. Opening his chain of cafeterias helped the growing numbers of government workers in the late 1920s and 1930s who were short on time and lunch options. George and Van Fleishell were the last owners and managers of Sholl's. George Fleishell was Evan Sholl's nephew through Evan's wife Gertrude and grew up working for Sholl's as a child. Returning from his service in World War II, George worked for Sholl's until the day it closed. At its height, Sholl's served 10 people a minute, 2 million a year. At one point there were 8 locations in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. The final location at 1990 K Street NW closed its doors on December 1, 2001. Racial integration From at least the 1940s and throughout the period of the fight for racial integration, Sholl's took a stand against racial segregation and served African Americans. Sholl's employees included immigrants from Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia. One cook was Marina Naranjo. Sholl extended family members also worked there. Religion At Sholl's, any member of the clergy, regardless of his or her religion, was served a free meal. Featured at every table were prayer cards that suggested grace‚Äî Catholic, Jewish, or Protestant‚Äîbefore meals. Charity work Sholl's took part in programs to feed the homeless. Michael Kirwin, a D.C. advocate for the homeless, wrote in The Washington Post of the generosity of Sholl's management. Years before, Kirwin had given $5,000 to feed homeless patrons. \\"Somehow that $5,000 check never seemed to run out,\\" Kirwan recalled. \\"The stories I've heard from people on the streets, their quiet moments of dignity, respect, warmth and a full and nourishing meal at the hands of this wonderful cafeteria could fill a book of essays.\\" External links * \\"A Fight For Honesty, Purity, and Veal,\\" Ben A.

He spent the majority of his career in Albania where he notably had a successful spell with Elbasani and Tirana and was once dubbed as the best left-back in the Albanian Superliga. Career Early career Abraham started his playing career in Nigeria Division 1 with Ambassadors of Christ as a teenager. He then moved to Albania in 2004 in search of European football. Abraham had three unsuccessful trials at Besa Kavaje, Teuta Durr√´s and Elbasani, which then forced him to move to Gramozi Ersek√´. After playing well for KS Gramozi Erseke the young Nigerian transferred to Apolonia Fier who were playing in Albanian First Division at the time.  Albanian Superliga  Following a very successful first year in Albanian and European football, Abraham made his move to the Albanian Superliga. His first team in Albania's premiere division was KF Elbasani, he joined them in the summer of 2005. During his first season in the Superliga he was part of a very successful KF Elbasani side that won the league. Abraham was part of the best defence in Albania in that season conceding only 22 goals all season.KF Tirana 2005‚Äì2006 Stats He was also part of the Dinamo Tirana team that won the 2007‚Äì08 Albanian Superliga. KF Tirana signed the Nigerian defender in the summer transfer window of 2008 for a fee believed to be in the region of around $160,000. He has also set a new record in Albania, having won 4 Albanian Superliga titles, the most ever for a foreign player in Albanian football.  AC Milan friendly  Abraham played a big role in KF Tirana's 2‚Äì1 victory over Italian giants, AC Milan in the first ever Ta√ßi Oil Cup organised by Albanian oil baron Rezart Ta√ßi. He had a very impressive game at left back, especially going forward. However, despite having a great game he lost the ball just before the end of the game which then lead to Ronaldinho's late goal. > \\"I felt bad that they were able to score through my mistake. All the same, > it was good that we beat Milan, although it was only a friendly match. The > bigger joy for me was that I eventually exchanged jerseys with Clarence > Seedorf and I was able to get a DVD copy of the match \\" Iraklis Thessaloniki In July 2010 Abraham signed for Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. in the Greek Super League. Vardar Skopje In June 2012, Abraham signed a one-and-a-half contract with Vardar in the Macedonian First Football League. He played with the team in their away match against BATE Borisov in the 2012‚Äì13 UEFA Champions League qualifiers however, he was released before the start of domestic season in Macedonia, and, with the transfer window still open, Abraham ended up returning to Albania where he joined Besa Kavaj√´. Adriatiku Mamurrasi Following Kastrioti Kruj√´'s relegation from the Albanian Superliga, Alechenwu left the club in search of a new team, and he ended up joining Adriatiku Mamurrasi in the Albanian First Division who had serious ambitions regarding achieving promotion to the top flight for the first time in its history. La√ßi In August 2016, Abraham returned to top flight and signed a one-year contract with La√ßi. Personal life Abraham has an Albanian passport and can speak Albanian language fluently.

'Impermeable' is essential here to distinguish nanotube membrane with traditional, well known porous membranes. Fluids and gas molecules may pass through the membrane en masse but only through the nanotubes. For instance, water molecules form ordered hydrogen bonds that act like chains as they pass through the CNTs. This results in an almost frictionless or atomically smooth interface between the nanotubes and water which relate to a ‚Äúslip length‚Äù of the hydrophobic interface. Properties like the slip length that describe the non-continuum behavior of the water within the pore walls are disregarded in simple hydrodynamic systems and absent from the Hagen‚ÄìPoiseuille equation. Molecular dynamic simulations better characterize the flow of water molecules through the carbon nanotubes with a varied form of the Hagen‚ÄìPoiseuille equation that takes into account slip length. Transport of polystyrene particles (60 and 100 nm diameter) through single-tube membranes (150 nm) was reported in 2000. Soon after, ensemble membranes consisting of multi-walled and double-walled carbon nanotubes were fabricated and studied. It was shown that water can pass through the graphitic nanotube cores of the membrane at up to five magnitudes greater than classical fluid dynamics would predict, via the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, both for multiwall tubes (inner diameter 7 nm) and double-wall tubes (inner diameter <2 nm). In experiments by Holt et al., pure water (~1.0020 cP viscosity) was transported through three samples of double-walled carbon nanotubes in a silicon nitride matrix with varying membrane fluxes and thicknesses. These membranes were found to have enhanced flow that was more than three orders of magnitude faster than the expected for no-slip hydrodynamic flow as calculated by the Hagen‚ÄìPoiseuille equation. These results for nanotubes with the 1‚Äì2 nm diameter pores corresponded to about 10‚Äì40 water molecules per nm2 per nanosecond. In a similar experiment by Mainak Majumder et al., nanotubes of about 7 nm in diameter in solid polystyrene were tested for their fluid velocities. These results similarly showed that the nanotubes have long slip-planes and flow rates were found to be four to five orders of magnitude faster than conventional fluid flow predictions. It was further demonstrated that the flow of water through carbon nanotube membranes (without filler matrix, thus flow on the outside surface of CNTs) can be controlled through the application of electric current. Among many potential uses that nanotube membranes might one day be employed is the desalination of water. Mitra et al. (8-14) pioneered a novel architecture in producing CNT based membrane. This method creates a superior membrane by immobilizing carbon nanotubes in the pores and on the membrane surface. In their work, the CNTs are immobilized into polymeric or ceramic membranes leading to the development of unique membrane structure referred to as the carbon nanotube immobilized membrane (CNIM). This was achieved by immobilizing CNT from a dispersed form. Such membranes are robust, thermally stable, and possess high selectivity. The goal here is to immobilize CNTs such that their surfaces are free to interact directly with the solute. The membrane produced by this method has shown dramatic enhancements in flux and selectivity in various applications, such as sea water desalination (8,9), membrane extraction (10), water purification by the removal of volatile organics from water (11) and for micro scale membrane extraction for the analysis of water pollutants (12-14). In 2016, large format commercial scale CNT membranes were introduced for the first time. Initially these membranes were produced in a flat sheet format similar to those previously made in research laboratories, although at a much larger scale. In 2017, the company announced the development of a hollow fiber membrane CNT membrane, with nanotubes oriented radially perpendicular to the membrane's surface, something that had never been achieved before . In all cases, the CNTs serve as unique pores that enhance mass transport across the membrane, selecting based on size or chemical affinity. For example, in the case of desalination the CNTs enhance the transport for water while blocking or reducing the transmission of salts, based on the size of hydrated salt ions. In the case of the removal of organics such as in water purification, pervaporation and extraction, CNT membranes preferentially permeate the organics, allowing for separations that had previously only been possible using methods like distillation. One example of organic / water separations is the separation of ethanol from water, an application in which CNT membranes show nearly ideal selectivity for the transport of ethanol .  Nanopore measurement in track etched membrane  Since the discovery of track-etched technology in the late 1960s, filter membranes with needed diameter have found potential use in various fields including food safety, environmental pollution, biology, medicine, fuel cell, and chemistry. These track-etched membranes are typically made in polymer membrane through track-etching procedure, during which the polymer membrane is first irradiated by heavy ion beam to form tracks and then cylindrical pores or asymmetric pores are created along the track after wet etching. As important as fabrication of the filter membranes is the characterization and measurement of the pores in the membrane. Until now, a few of methods have been developed, which can be classified into the following categories according to the physical mechanisms they exploited: Imaging methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM),transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM); fluid transports such as bubble point and gas transport; fluid adsorptions such as nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BEH), mercury porosimetry, liquid‚Äìvapor equilibrium (BJH), gas‚Äìliquid equilibrium (permoporometry) and liquid‚Äìsolid equilibrium (thermoporometry); electronic conductance; ultrasonic spectroscopy;19 Molecular Transport. More recently, the use of light transmission technique as a method for nanopore size measurement has been proposed.

The reason for his resignation was the issue of change of Estonian constitution proposed to the parliament by President Toomas Hendrik Ilves.On-line intervjuu: k√ºsimustele vastas Leo Kunnas. Postimees, 17.10.2007 http://sport.postimees.ee/071007/esileht/siseuudised/287116.php After his resignation, he has defended the following views in numerous articles: * Changing the Estonian Constitution would be a serious mistake. Abolishing the President's role as Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces and giving the role to the Minister of Defense is dangerous. This change would not serve the civilian control over the Estonian Defence Forces, but would give the MOD officials unlimited power over the Estonian Defence Forces and would politicize the officers' and NCO corps. * Estonia should be ready to defend herself with a well-trained reserve-based army inside the NATO framework. The weak point of Estonian NATO membership is the lack of any military plans to defend the Baltics, which means that albeit help will eventually come (he is not arguing over Article 5), Estonia would be occupied without credible self- defence. He is referring to the 2003 RAND research, The Baltic States and NATO Membership.https://www.senate.gov/~foreign/testimony/2003/LarrabeeTestimony030403.pdf * Russia is the most serious geopolitical factor for Estonian security which will not be forgotten in defence planning. He argues that Estonia should plan for the worst-case scenario, and this is the reason for the rise in the Estonian reserve component up to 40,000 reservists (the wartime operational structure is currently at around 16,000). * The Estonian MOD has done nothing to develop the credible self-defence capability and is focusing only on international missions. The reaction from the Estonian society and government circles is dualistic in nature. On the one hand, Lt. Gen (Ret.) Johannes Kert thinks that Leo Kunnas is one of the very few people in Estonia who has analytical and very clear vision of the Estonian defence issues. Estonian MOD officials (and especially ex-minister of defence J√ºrgen Ligi) are strongly against Kunnas' views.Kaitseministeerium Education Leo Kunnas has studied history, philosophy and politics in the following universities: * 1989-1991 - Estonian Humanitarian Institute * 1991 - University of Helsinki Military education: * 1992-1994 Finnish National Defence Academy - 1.Estonian Officer Course * 2001-2002 Finnish National Defence Academy - Senior Staff Officer Course * 2005 US National Defence University (Norfolk, Virginia) Military career Estonian Army * 1992 Ensign * 1994 Second Lieutenant * 1995 First Lieutenant * 1997 Captain * 1999 Major * 2003 Lieutenant Colonel Belletristic Activity Novels * 1990 - \\"Kustumatu valguse maailm\\" ( The World of the Eternal Light) * 2001 - \\"S√µdurjumala teener\\" (Servant of the Soldier God) * 2008 - \\"Gort Ashryn\\" I osa \\"Enne viimast s√µda\\" (Before the last war) * 2009 - \\"Gort Ashryn\\" II osa \\"S√µda\\" (War) * 2010 - \\"Gort Ashryn\\" III osa \\"Rahu\\" (Peace) Documentary Stories * 2006 - \\"Viiv pikas s√µjas\\" (A Moment in the Long War - some parts are available on-line http://www.diplomaatia.ee/?archive_mode=article&articleid;=145)) Articles an Interviews in Estonian newspapers * \\"P√µhiseaduslik korratus ilma kaitsev√§e juhatajata\\" (The Constitutional Disorder without the Commander of Estonian Defence Forces)- Postimees 03.10.2007 Postimees: Leo Kunnas: p√µhiseaduslik korratus ilma kaitsev√§e juhatajata * \\"NATO n√µrgeneb - mida teha?\\" (NATO is weakening - what to should be done?) - Eesti P√§evaleht 28.11.07 * \\"Eesti 2007: Pyrrhose v√µit\\" (Estonia 2007: Phyrros Victory) - Eesti P√§evaleht 31.12.07 * \\"L√µiv √µhukesele riigile\\" (The idea of \\"thin\\" state) - Eesti P√§evaleht 29.01.08 * \\"35 viga iseseisva kaitsev√µime √ºlesehitamisel\\" (35 Mistakes of building up the Estonian Military Capabilities) - Eesti Ekspress 07.02.2008 * \\"Eesti: raua ja verega s√ºndinud riik\\" (Estonia: State that has born from Iron and Blood) - Eesti P√§evaleht 21.02.08 * \\"L√§ti saatuslik valik\\" (The Fatal Choice of Latvia) - \\"Eesti P√§evaleht\\" 06.03.2008 LEO KUNNAS: L√§ti saatuslik valik - Eesti P√§evaleht Online * \\"Eesti kui A-grupi potensiaalne konfliktikolle\\" (Estonia as the A-Group conflict centre) - \\"Eesti P√§evaleht\\" 08.04.2008. * \\"Riigikaitse juriidiline r√§gastik\\" (Juridical Maze of Estonian Defence) - \\"Eesti P√§evaleht\\" 20.04.2008. * \\"M√º√ºt rahuaja kaitsev√§est\\" (Myth of the peace-time army) - \\"Eesti P√§evaleht\\" 22.04.2008. * \\"Kaitsekulutuste suurendamine: mille arvelt?\\" (How to raise defence expenditures? ) - \\"Eesti P√§evaleht\\" 28.07.2008. * \\"Leo Kunnas: eestlased peavad oma riiki ise kaitsma.\\" (Estonians shall defend their country oneselves ) - \\"Postimees\\" 14.08.2008.LEO KUNNAS: Eestlased peavad oma riiki ise kaitsma.\\" \\" - Postimees Online Interesting facts At the age of 16, Leo Kunnas was sentenced to Soviet prison for attempted border crossing and possession of firearms.

In 2002, he founded Chhandam Nritya Bharati in India. There were ten branches of Chhandam worldwide. Until his death in 2015, Das taught dance as a way of life, a path for attaining self-knowledge and as a service to society. Das performed in India, North America and Europe. He was known for his virtuosic footwork, rhythmic adeptness, compelling storytelling,Ullrich, Alan. 2008. ‚ÄúPure Citresh‚Äù. as well as his innovation of ‚ÄúKathak Yoga‚Äù.Kathak Yoga in California‚Äù in the Telegraph, Sunday 23 March 2008, http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080323/jsp/calcutta/story_9024016.jsp Early life and background Chitresh Das was born in Calcutta, West Bengal to Nrityacharya Prohlad Das and Smt. Nilima Das. His parents founded ‚ÄúNritya Bharati,‚Äù one of India‚Äôs first institutions for dance that housed teachers of several classical and folk styles. Prohlad Das, a dance scholar and choreographer, used traditional dance forms to express modern issues in his revolutionary work ‚ÄúAbhyudaya‚Äù (meaning ‚Äúawakening‚Äù) staged before Indian Independence in 1947.Morelli, Sarah. 2007. PhD Dissertation. ‚ÄúFrom Calcutta to California‚Äù: Negotiations of Movement and Meaning in Kathak Dance. Harvard University: Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp34. Das frequently cited his mother, Nilima Das, stating, ‚Äúmother is the first guru‚Äù. Growing up in his parents' dance school in Calcutta, Nritya Bharati, Pandit Das was surrounded by literary artists, poets, dancers, and gurus. He recalled iconic dancers such as Rukmini Devi Arundale, Uday Shankar, Balasaraswati and the legendary Shambhu Maharaj coming to visit his home. Das began his study of Kathak at age nine under Kathak guru, Pandit Ram Narayan Misra, a disciple of Shambhu and Acchchan Maharaj. Das was schooled in both major Kathak traditions, embodying each in his artistry: the graceful and sensual elements of the Lucknow school combined with the dynamic and powerful rhythms and movements of the Jaipur School. Das was a child prodigy who attained national fame, performing at age 11 with the legendary tabla maestro Samta Prasadji and in a special concert for Indian dance icon Uday Shankar. Das graduated from Rabindra Bharati University in Calcutta and earned his M.A. in dance from Prayag Sangit Samiti in Allahabad. Teaching career Chitresh Das came to the United States in 1970 on a Whitney Fellowship to teach Kathak at the University of Maryland. In 1971, Pandit Das was invited by Ustad Ali Akbar Khan to the San Francisco Bay Area to teach Kathak and establish a dance program at the Ali Akbar College of Music (AACM) in San Rafael, California.Morelli, Sarah. 2007, pp8. By 1979, he left the AACM faculty to form his own dance school called Chhandam; his \\"Chitresh Das Dance Company\\" (CDDC) was incorporated in 1980. In 1988, Das formed the first university accredited Kathak course in the US at San Francisco State University; several current dancers of CDDC began studying with Das in the SFSU program. Das was also a guest faculty member at Stanford University. His own school of Chhandam has continued to grow with branches in San Francisco, Fremont/Union City, Berkeley, Mountain View, San Jose, Sacramento, and Los Angeles. His disciples, Joanna De Souza and Gretchen Hayden went on to establish branches of Chhandam in Toronto (1990) and Boston (1992), respectively. Chhandam had 550 students enrolled at branches across North America in 2010.Keleher, Maureen. 2010. \\"The Journey of Kathak\\". In Dance Studio Life, pp82. Through the years Das would return annually for several months to India to teach and perform. In 2002, Pandit Das reopened his parents' school of Chhandam Nritya Bharati in Calcutta, India. In 2010, Seema Mehta, one of his disciples and Das founded the second branch of his school in India, Chhandam Nritya Bharati, in Mumbai. While in India, Pandit Das continued his work with the New Light Foundation, teaching Kathak dance to the children of sex workers of the Kalighat red light district in Calcutta as a part of a program to help them break free of the cycle of exploitation. Mehta would get an award from the President of India for similar work in 2019. As he was trained by his Guru, Pandit Ram Narayan Misra, Das trained his own students, both in the US and India, within the guru-shisya parampara (the tradition of master and disciple). A Guru is ‚Äúone who removes the darkness‚Äù through direct knowledge and training.Guru Das was said to have remained committed to preserving the traditional one-to-one transmission of knowledge between guru and shisya in today's society; he trained many disciples who have gone on to become solo artists in their own right.Dalidowicz, Monica. 2010. Becoming a Kathaka: Chitresh Das and the New Generation of Kathak dancers. Performing career Chitresh Das performed in America, India and Europe as a solo artist and in collaborations including the Chitresh Das Dance Company. Select performances within India included the Surya festival (1982); Pandit Ravi Shankar's Rimpa Festival in Benares (1983), representing his home state of West Bengal in tours throughout India (1998, 1999), Dover Lane Conference, Kolkata (1979, 1982, 1984, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2003); National Kathak Festival in New Delhi (2003), Fort William, Kolkata (2005) where he performed before 4,000 Indian soldiers, UMAQ Festival, New Delhi (2004, 2006, 2007), US Consulate 50th Anniversary in Mumbai (2008), Karamatullah Khan Festival in Kolkata (2008), Mumbai Festival (2008), 50th Anniversary Festival and IIT Kharagpur, India (2009). In the early 1970s, Das began performing in the United States. In 1984 Das was selected to perform in the Olympic Arts Festival during the Los Angeles Olympic Games. Other select American performances include the Lincoln Center (1988), International Kathak festival in Chicago (2004), American Dance Festival (2004, 2006), and the American Folk festival (2008). In the San Francisco Bay Area, Chitresh Das and his Dance Company have been a mainstay of the local dance season and his company's home season has included such masterpieces as \\"Gold Rush\\" (1990), \\"Sadhana\\" (1991), \\"East as Center\\" (2003), and his most recent award-winning collaboration with tap dancer, Jason Samuels Smith, \\"IJS: India Jazz Suites‚Äù (2005 to present).

Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco inaugurated the festival by proclaiming 28 Sep \\"Kathak Day\\".Proclamation from Mayor Newsom. Das had performed throughout Europe, including Bonn and Aachen International Dance Festivals (1983), Logan Hall in London (1984), and Nijmegen and Arnhem, Holland (1984). In the late eighties, he also performed throughout in Germany, Poland, and Hungary with Tanzprojekt. On screen Chitresh Das and Jason Samuels Smith perform India Jazz Suites in 2009. In 2004, Pandit Das was featured on a national PBS program, and in a BBC series \\"Eighty Treasures Around the World\\"; the program featured Pandit Das performing in a historic court in Calcutta.See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhlPYhww7Bc He was also featured in the PBS series ‚ÄúIndians in America‚Äù. In January 2005 and 2006, Pandit Das‚Äô solo performances were featured on national Indian television. In 2007, he was featured on PBS station KQED‚Äôs performing arts profile show Spark.See http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=16485 Das‚Äôs collaboration with Jason Samuel Smiths is the subject of a documentary, ‚ÄòUpaj,‚Äô nationally broadcast on PBS in 2011. Das also appeared on the popular Indian talk show ‚ÄúOye! Its Friday‚Äù show filmed in Mumbai in 2009. Style and contributions ‚ÄúFreedom comes through refined discipline with responsibility.‚Äù In the early years, Das was known for his distinctively athletic style: fast and powerful emphasising footwork and swift turns.Morelli, Sarah. 2007 (see also Chakravorty 1999 PhD Dissertation. Choreographing Modernity: Kathak Dance, Public Culture and Women‚Äôs Identity in India. Temple University) Das taught in this rigorous style with focus on tayari (readiness of technique, speed, and stamina) and laykari (virtuosity of Indian classical rhythmic system), but equally emphasises khubsurti (beauty) and nazakat (delicacy and refinement). Dancers must become adept at abhinaya (expression) and learn to masterfully portray the concept of 'Ardhanariswara' (the embodiment of the masculine and feminine) in their dance. Das‚Äôs teaching and performance also emphasise Upaj, or improvisation. Whilst Das has choreographed many group pieces, he and his students continue to present traditional full-length Kathak solos, requiring the dancer to improvise on stage with live musicians for up to two hours.Swapan, Ashfaque. 2008. ‚ÄúKathak Maestro Chitresh Das Mezmerizes Audience‚Äù. Indiawest Archives, 15 October 2008. [see also Narang, Shalini, ‚ÄúImprovisation Hallmark of Kathak‚Äôs Solo‚Äù, Indiawest, 7 December 2009, http://www.indiawest.com/readmore.aspx?id=1648&Sid;=8Improvisation] One of Das's most important contributions to his school and to the larger field of Kathak is his development of \\"Kathak yoga\\". Kathak yoga involves the practice of simultaneously dancing, singing, and often, playing an instrument. In Kathak yoga, the dancer recites a chosen taal (rhythmic cycle), sings the melody and the theka (language of the drum) of the taal, while practising precise complicated footwork.Also see Howard, Rachel. 2006. https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/arts/dance/24howa.html?scp=1&sq;=kathak+yoga&st;=nyt Kathak yoga is based on the fundamental yogic concept of integrating the mind, soul and body and was the subject of a doctoral dissertation at Harvard University by Dr. Sarah Morelli. Das himself has demonstrated Kathak yoga by dancing, singing, and playing tabla simultaneously. His company also exhibits the practice of Kathak yoga by adding the playing of instruments to their dance.See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNOLB5AJS6Y The dancers simultaneously perform three contrasting concepts ‚Äì complex rhythmic compositions with the feet and body, continuous singing of the rhythmic cycle, and playing an instrument (harmonium or manjira). Selected awards In 1987, and then again in 2003, Das was awarded the Isadora Duncan Dancer of the Year Award. In 2004 Pandit Das received the inaugural lifetime achievement award from the San Francisco Ethnic Dance Festival. In 2005, he was named a ‚ÄúDance Icon of the West‚Äù by the San Francisco Performing Arts Library and Museum. In 2006 Pandit Das received the Goldie Lifetime Achievement Award from the San Francisco Bay Guardian. In 2007, Das received an award from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, a national arts institution inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in India in 1938, for outstanding contribution in the field of Kathak dance!!! In 2009, Pandit Das was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed on a traditional artist by the US Government. Das received the award, signed by President Obama, at a ceremony at the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill. Many of Das's productions also received numerous awards, including Isadora Duncan Awards for his productions 'East of Center' (2003), India Jazz Suites (2005) as well as a special award for presenting the largest Indian classical dance festival outside of India, Kathak at the Crossroads (2006). Pandit Das also received numerous grants including from the Olympic Arts Festival, National Endowment for the Arts, National Dance Project, California Arts Council, Rockefeller Foundation, Irvine Fellowships in Dance, among others. Serving society through the arts Das began working with the New Light Foundation, a Kolkata-based NGO that works to free the children of red- light district workers from the cycle of prostitution and abuse through support services, education and care, in 2003. Das and the teachers of Nritya Bharati taught the children of the New Light Foundation Kathak dance as a means for cultural and self-awareness and empowerment. The New Light group was invited by the German Ministry of Culture and International Cooperation to be a part of Kinder Kulture Karavane; in 2008, the New Light children travelled to Germany for a 6-week performing tour. Das also worked with the Calcutta Blind Opera (or Shyambazar Blind Opera), teaching Kathak to visually challenged performers through emphasis on its rhythmic and musical components. Das's teachings emphasized the concepts of ‚Äòtyaag aur seva‚Äô (sacrifice and selfless service). Das encouraged the students of Chhandam to adopt his values of selflessness and sacrifice. He argued that these values must manifest both within the context of their study of Kathak and also permeate in other aspects of their lives by giving back to their communities and the society by and large. Personal life Das married his first wife, Julia Maxwell, in 1971 and they divorced in 1987. He married his second wife, Celine Schein, in 1999, and they were married until his death. Das and Celine had two children, Shivaranjani, born August 15, 2011, and Saadhvi, born July 4, 2013.

The division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of regular infantry divisions that were being triangularized. The division's 233rd Infantry Brigade staff had been the staff of the 23rd Reserve Infantry Brigade of the 12th Reserve Division, which came to the new division along with the 22nd Reserve Infantry Regiment. The 11th Reserve Infantry Regiment had been part of the 11th Reserve Division. The 157th Infantry Regiment came from the 12th Infantry Division. The division was recruited in Silesia.

It then fought in the Second Battle of Artois and the Autumn Battle by La Bass√©e and Arras, which included the Battle of Loos. It remained in the trenches in Flanders and the Artois until February 1916, and then was in the line on the Yser until July. It then fought in the Battle of the Somme. In August 1916, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front, arriving in Carpathia later in the month. It faced the Russians in Carpathia until late 1917, when it went into combat against the Romanians. In October 1917, the division was transferred to Italy, and went into the line on the Isonzo Front. It fought in the Battle of Caporetto and the follow-on offensive to the Piave River. The division remained in Italy until March 1918, when it returned to the Western Front. It fought in the Battle of the Lys, also known at the Fourth Battle of Ypres. It remained in the line, and fought against several Allied offensives, including the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. It was facing the Allies between the Meuse and Beaumont when the Armistice came into effect. Allied intelligence rated the division as second class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914‚Äì1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 609-611.

Her first novel sold 250,000 copies; and she had total sales of 2 million books in her lifetime, second only to Harriet Beecher Stowe. Portraying domestic life in small-town and rural settings, she examined gender relationships, as well as those of class and race. She also dealt with slavery and the American Civil War with a strong sense of moral justice. Since the late 20th century, she has received fresh recognition and reappraisal, although her popular work was excluded from most 19th-century literary histories. Early life and education Mary Jane Hawes was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts in 1825, the fifth of Fanny (Olds) and Preston Hawes' nine children. The household was economically modest, but the parents encouraged intellectual endeavor. She may also have been influenced by her uncle, Rev. Joel Hawes (1789-1867), for many years minister at the First Congregational Church in Hartford, Connecticut, and known for his published sermons and other writings. Preston Hawes died when Mary Jane was 12 and she started teaching school at 13. Interested in writing from an early age, she published her first story at 15. Marriage and family On August 9, 1849 Hawes married Daniel Holmes, a graduate of Yale College from New York City. They moved for a time to Versailles, Kentucky in the Bluegrass Region, where they both taught for a few years. These were formative years, as Holmes used the small-town, rural setting and people she knew as inspiration for her first novel and others set in the antebellum South. In 1852 the Holmes family returned to New York and settled in Brockport, a short distance west of Rochester, where Daniel read law and was ultimately admitted to the bar. He went into practice and also served in local politics. They had no children. Holmes' supportive marriage was one she used as a model for several portrayed in her novels. Career Holmes used her experiences in Kentucky for the material of several novels. In 1854 at the age of 29, she published her first novel, Tempest and Sunshine. Its central girl characters, Julia and Fanny, were reportedly modeled on the local family of John Singleton and his daughters Bettie and Susan.Ermina Jett Darnell, Forks of Elkhorn Church: With Genealogies of Early Members (on-line), Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., 1946, p. 229 The portrayal of girls with contrasting characters was resolved with a sense of moral justice, as they both traveled personal journeys of growth. While sales of the novel were slow at first, they steadily continued, and ultimately totaled about 250,000 copies. Reprinted in 1886, this novel was her most popular.Earl Yarington, \\"Mary Jane Holmes\\", Legacy: A Journal of American Women Writers, Vol. 25, No. 1, 2008, p. 146, accessed 14 Aug 2010 She was first published by Appleton, and later for 20 years by G.W. Carleton, which was succeeded by G.W. Dillingham, all of New York City. As The Nation noted in its obituary at her death: > It is an eternal paradox of our world of letters that the books which enjoy > the largest sale are barely recognized as existing by the guardians of > literary tradition. Mrs. Mary Jane Holmes, who died Sunday at Brockport, > N.Y., wrote thirty-nine novels with aggregate sales, it is said, of more > than two million copies, and yet she had not even a paragraph devoted to her > life and works in the histories of American Literature. (\\"The Week\\") The theme of most of her novels was domestic life, reflecting society in the antebellum years, as well as during and after the American Civil War. Her books were very popular and she was published by major firms in New York. Her sales were second nationally only to those of Harriet Beecher Stowe; in total Holmes sold more than two million books. As the literary scholar Judith Fetterley notes: > [T]the literature of mid-nineteenth century women is essentially about > women. Thus the first truth the women have to tell is that not all Americans > are male and the assumption that an American text must be a man's story told > by men is partisan to say the least. Were this truth to be told, of course, > it would require a redefinition of what constitutes an American theme; it > would require the possibility that a story by a woman about women could be > an American text...at issue equally is the matter of perspective. For a > man's story told by a man is not necessarily the same as a man's story told > by a woman.Judith Fetterley, Provisions: A Reader from 19th-Century American > Women, Indianapolis, IN: Indiana University Press, 1985, p. 23, accessed 17 > Aug 2010 Critics of the time and early 20th century classified Holmes' and other women authors' work as \\"sentimental\\" and downplayed it because of appeal to the common reader. Recent critics have appreciated how Holmes grappled seriously with issues of gender, race and class, as well as slavery and the Civil War. She created attractive characters who also had flaws, with whom readers could identify. The scholar Earl Yarington notes that her heroines \\"go out, often on their own accord, into an uncertain world and make new lives for themselves.\\" This experience provides the heroine \\"with an education so she can learn how to thrive and improve not only her own conditions, but also the conditions of others.\\" Her work appealed to many readers at a time of rapidly expanding literacy among women. While Holmes traveled extensively to Europe and Asia, trips from which she collected art, she continued to write and publish about one book annually. She wrote a total of 39 novels, plus numerous short stories and novellas. Many were first serialized in the New York Weekly \\"storypaper\\". The popularity of her novel Marian Grey (1863) reportedly led to a jump in the paper's circulation by 50,000, and it reached 100,000 by 1865.Felicia L. Carr, \\"Mary J. Holmes\\", American Women's Dime Novels Project: Dime Novels for Women, 1870-1920, George Mason University, accessed 14 Aug 2010 Holmes was active in the Episcopal Church and its charitable activities. She started local activities to share her collection from her travels and education with young women. Holmes died in 1907, at the age of 82, in Brockport. Her obituary was published a few days later in the Nation,\\"Mary J. Holmes\\", \\"The Week,\\" Nation', 10 Oct 1907, p. 316 reflecting her stature. Long excluded from literary histories of the nineteenth century written by men, the author was reappraised by scholars in the late 20th and early 21st century, who recognized her achievements and the value of her work.

Her sister ships were , , and . W√ºrttemberg was built in the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin from 1876 to 1881. The ship was commissioned into the Imperial Navy in August 1881. She was armed with a main battery of six guns in two open barbettes. After her commissioning, W√ºrttemberg served with the fleet on numerous training exercises and cruises. She participated in several cruises escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on state visits to Great Britain and to various cities in the Baltic Sea in the late 1880s and early 1890s. During 1898‚Äì1899, the ship was modernized at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel; she served for another seven years with the fleet before being withdrawn from active service in 1906. She was subsequently used in a variety of secondary roles, until she was sold in 1920 and broken up for scrap.  Design  Illustration of the Sachsen-class ships The Sachsen class was the first group of capital ships built under the tenure of General Albrecht von Stosch, the first Chief of the Imperial Admiralty. Stosch favored a coastal defense strategy for the German fleet, and the Sachsens were intended to operate from fortified ports, from which they could sortie to attack blockading fleets. They proved to be controversial in service, as critics pointed out their poor seakeeping, tendency to roll in heavy seas, and low speed compared to earlier armored frigates. The ship was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward.

Her standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men, though while serving as a squadron flagship this was augmented by another 7 officers and 34 men. She was armed with a main battery of six guns, two of which were single-mounted in an open barbette forward of the conning tower and the remaining four mounted amidships, also on single mounts in an open barbette. As built, the ship was also equipped with six L/24 guns and eight Hotchkiss revolver cannons for defense against torpedo boats. W√ºrttembergs armor was made of wrought iron, and was concentrated in an armored citadel amidships. The armor ranged from on the armored citadel, and between on the deck. The barbette armor was 254 mm of wrought iron backed by 250 mm of teak.  Service history  SMS W√ºrttemberg in 1899, after reconstruction W√ºrttemberg was ordered by the Imperial Navy under the contract name \\"D,\\" which denoted that the vessel was a new addition to the fleet. She was built at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin; her keel was laid down in 1876 under yard number 78. The ship was launched on 9 November 1878 and was commissioned into the German fleet on 9 May 1881. Along with her three sisters, W√ºrttemberg was the first large, armored warship built for the German navy that relied entirely on engines for propulsion. After her commissioning, W√ºrttemberg was placed in reserve. She was not activated for service with the fleet until 1884; this in part had to do with the poor performance of her sister in the fleet maneuvers of 1880. Among the problems associated with the Sachsen-class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability. Nevertheless, W√ºrttemberg and her three sisters served as I Division in the 1884 fleet maneuvers, under the command of Rear Admiral Alexander von Monts. The ship was again placed in reserve in 1885, but returned to fleet service in 1886 alongside Sachsen, , and the new ironclad . During the annual fleet maneuvers, W√ºrttembergs engines proved troublesome. Following the 1886 maneuvers, W√ºrttemberg and her three sisters were removed from active duty to serve as the Baltic reserve division. In June 1887, Germany dedicated the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal; W√ºrttemberg was among the ships present during the celebrations. The ship returned to active service with the fleet in 1890 when she joined I Division during the annual maneuvers. W√ºrttemberg was commanded by Captain Alfred von Tirpitz during the exercises. The eight ships of I and II Divisions simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel, which was defended by torpedo boat flotillas. W√ºrttemberg was in reserve during the 1891 maneuvers, but returned to I Division in 1892, 1893, and 1894. By the winter of 1894‚Äì1895, the last of the four s had been commissioned; these ships were assigned to I Division, which displaced W√ºrttemberg and her three sisters to II Division. The eight ships conducted training cruises over the winter and spring before conducting the annual autumn fleet exercises. The German fleet at anchor in 1896; the four s are at right On 21 June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal was opened for traffic, eight years after work had begun. W√ºrttemberg and her three sisters, along with dozens of other warships, attended the ceremonies. The major naval powers sent fleets to join the fleet review. The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high- seas battle between I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers with the rest of the fleet in the Baltic. W√ºrttemberg again served during the 1896 and 1897 maneuvers, though Sachsen was her only sister to join the exercises. Baden and Bayern were out of service for extensive modernization. After the conclusion of the 1897 maneuvers, W√ºrttemberg was taken into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for reconstruction. The ship's old wrought iron and teak armor was replaced with new Krupp nickel- steel armor. The four funnels were trunked into a single large funnel and new engines were also installed, which increased the ship's speed to . The ship's 8.7 cm guns were replaced with quick-firing SK L/30 guns and four autocannons. Work was completed in 1898. W√ºrttemberg remained with the fleet until 1906; her replacement in the fleet organization plan, the new dreadnought battleship , was ordered that year. W√ºrttemberg was then used as a torpedo training and test ship until February 1919, when she was reduced to an escort for F-type minesweepers. The ship was stricken from the naval register on 20 October 1920 and sold to Hattinger Co. W√ºrttemberg was ultimately broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven.

He went on to gain fame as \\"the father of German naval artillery.\\" Bayerns three sisters and the new ironclad comprised the training squadron for 1886. In 1887, she was present for the ceremonies marking the beginning of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, which was to link the Kiel with the North Sea.

Three separate simulations were conducted, which included French blockades of the German North Sea coast and a Russian attack on Kiel. Vice Admiral Wilhelm Schr√∂der commanded the fleet maneuvers of 1893, which simulated a protracted campaign against a superior French fleet. Bayern and her three sisters served as the Russian Baltic Fleet during the 1894 maneuvers. The four Sachsen-class ships were transferred to II Division before the winter cruise of 1894‚Äì1895, following the completion of the four s.

As suggested by its name, the Japanese whiting was first recorded from Japan in 1843, but has subsequently been found to extend to Korea, China and Taiwan. The species inhabits a variety of shallow water habitats where it preys on a variety of crustaceans as well as polychaetes, bivalves and small fish. They spawn between June and October, and are taken in large quantities during this period by fishermen. Being one of the most abundant species of fish around Japan, they make up a large percentage of the commercial catch. Taxonomy and naming The Japanese whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt-whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidea. The species was first recognized and scientifically described by Temminck and Schlegel in 1843 based on a holotype taken somewhere along the Japanese coast. The species has often been mistaken for Sillago sihama, and erroneously been published under this name by a number of authors, the first being Steindachner and D√∂derlein in 1885. Studies into various aspects of the Japanese whiting's biology have also been incorrectly named as studies on S. sihama. The binomial and common name of the species refers to the country where the species was first described from; Japan, although its range has subsequently found to be much wider than just Japan. The species is locally known as Shiro-gisu in Japan and Chin-Sa-Suo in China. Description As with most of the genus Sillago, the Japanese whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the two rows of cheek scales and head. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 21 to 23 soft rays posterior. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 22 to 24 soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 70 to 73 lateral line scales and a total of 35 vertebrae. The species has a known maximum length of over 30 cm (11.8 in) . Like all species of sillaginid, the swim bladder is the most dependable diagnostic feature. Japanese whiting have a swim bladder characterised by a single, long posterior extension which tapers to a slender point. The anterior end of the organ has three long median projections, with the central extension the longest. The colour of the fish is a greenish grey above with the dorsal region of the head darker and whitish on the underside of the fish. The anterior and posterior dorsal fins are hyaline, with the first few membranes of the spinous dorsal fin dusted in tiny brown spots. The anal, ventral and pectoral fins are also hyaline, with the pectoral having a greenish upper margin and base. The caudal fin is whitish with dark margins. Distribution and habitat Japanese whiting taken from Tokyo Bay The Japanese whiting ranges from Japan where it was first described, west toward Korea, China and Taiwan, possibly extending as far south as the Philippines. The species is not only the most common sillaginid of Japan, but is one of the most common coastal species of any family, often making up a significant proportion of shallow water samples. S. japonica occurs in a variety of habitats, with shallow sandy flats in bays, surf zones of beaches, protected eelgrass seabeds and occasionally estuaries used by the species. They are a shallow water species, operating in depths between 0 and 30 m (98 ft). Juveniles tend to use eelgrass beds as a nursery area, gaining both food and protection from these habitats while adults move to more exposed areas. Biology Like other sillaginids, the Japanese whiting is benthic in nature, inhabiting the bottom layer of water in a marine system. This is due to the benthic nature of their prey during the daytime, which inhabit these layers of weaker water flow preferentially due to their body shape. Japanese whiting are a schooling species like most other sillaginids, and similarly are able to burrow into the sand to escape predators or forage for prey. Diet Studies of Japanese whiting occupying surf zones show that there is a distinct shift in diet as fish mature, with the change occurring at a length of around 20 mm. Young fish tended to consume a higher proportion of calanoid copepods, with small amounts of mysids also taken. Older fish take substantially more mysids, with few copepods or polychaetes taken. Other studies have found amphipods, bivalves, caridean shrimps, crabs and small fish also contribute to the diets of S. japonica in some areas, helping to reduce interspecific competition locally. In most all diet surveys, there is a shift in diet as size increases, probably to avoid intraspecific competition. Seasonal changes associated with prey abundance are also observed. Reproduction Japanese whiting produce between 13,600 and 68,900 egg in a spawning period, which occurs between June and October. The larval development has been extensively described by Oozeki et al., who described ten stages in the morphological and histological development of the species. Juveniles inhabit protected areas such as shallow bays and seagrass beds. The species becomes sexually mature by 2 years for both sexes, living to at least 4 years of age and reaching more than 30 cm in length. Relationship to humans Being one of the most common inshore species in Japan, it has become one of the most important commercial species in the country, greatly esteemed for its delicate flavour. Recreational fishermen in Japan also take the species often, especially in summer, with the species relatively easy to access from land based fishing areas. Many studies have been carried out on the breeding of the species in captivity, which has led to the development of an aquaculture market for Japanese whiting. In other countries where other sillaginids are more prevalent, Japanese whiting are caught as a byproduct of smaller inshore fisheries, usually alongside other species of Sillago.

It is built by Khrunichev, and launched from sites 81 and 200 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Commercial launches are marketed by International Launch Services (ILS), and generally use Site 200/39. The first Proton-M launch occurred on 7 April 2001. Proton flew its most recent mission on 30 July 2020, delivering Ekspress-80 and Ekspress-103 to geostationary orbit.http://russianspaceweb.com/eutelsat5wb-mev1.html As of August 2020, a number of Roscosmos and other Russian government missions remain on Proton launch manifest.  Vehicle description  The Proton-M launch vehicle consists of three stages; all of them powered by liquid rocket engines using the hypergolic propellant combination of dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer, and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine for fuel. The first stage is unique in that it consists of a central cylindrical oxidizer tank with the same diameter as the other two stages with six fuel tanks attached to its circumference, each carrying an engine. The engines in this stage can swivel tangentially up to 7.0¬∞ from the neutral position, providing full thrust vector control. The rationale for this design is logistics: the diameter of the oxidizer tanks and the two following stages is the maximum that can be delivered by railroad to Baikonur. However, within Baikonur the fully assembled stack is transported again by rail, as it has enough clearance. The second stage uses a conventional cylindrical design. It is powered by three RD-0210 engines and one RD-0211 engine. The RD-0211 is a modified version of the RD-0210 used to pressurize the propellant tanks. The second stage is joined to the first stage through a net instead of a closed inter-stage, to allow the exhaust to escape because the second stage begins firing seconds before separation. Thrust vector control is provided by engine gimballing. The third stage is also of a conventional cylindrical design. It contains the avionics system that controls the first two stages. It uses one RD-0213 which is a fixed (non-gimballed) version of the RD-0210, and one RD-0214 which is a four nozzle vernier engine used for thrust vector control. The nozzles of the RD-0214 can turn up to 45.0¬∞; they are placed around (with some separation), and moderately above the nozzle of the RD-0213. The Proton-M features modifications to the lower stages to reduce structural mass, increase thrust, and utilise more propellant (less of it remains unused in the tanks). A closed-loop guidance system is used on the first stage, which allows more complete consumption of propellant. This increases the rocket's performance slightly compared to previous variants, and reduces the amount of toxic chemicals remaining in the stage when it impacts downrange. It can place up to into low Earth orbit. With an upper stage, it can place a 3000 kg payload into geostationary orbit (GEO), or a 5500 kg payload into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). Efforts were also made to reduce dependency on foreign component suppliers.  Upper stage  Most Proton-M launches have used a Briz-M upper stage to propel the spacecraft into a higher orbit. Launches have also been made with Blok-DM upper stages: six launches were made with the Blok DM-02 upper stage carrying GLONASS spacecraft, while two further GLONASS launches have used the Blok DM-03. The DM-03 will be used for a total of five launches; a further GLONASS launch is planned along with two launches of Ekspress satellites. As of 2013, no Proton-M launches have been made without an upper stage. However, this configuration is manifested to launch the Nauka (ISS module) and European Robotic Arm (ERA) of the International Space Station, currently scheduled to be launched together in July 2021.  Payload fairing  Commercial launches conducted by ILS use two kinds of fairings: *PLF-BR-13305 short faring. *PLF- BR-15255 long faring. Both fairings have a diameter of 4.35 metre.  Proton-M Enhanced (M+)  On 7 July 2007, International Launch Services launched the first Proton-M Enhanced rocket (also called M+), which carried the DirecTV-10 satellite into orbit. This was the 326th launch of a Proton, the 16th Proton-M/Briz-M launch, and the 41st Proton launch to be conducted by ILS. It features more efficient first stage engines, updated avionics, lighter fuel tanks and more powerful vernier engines on the Briz-M upper stage, and mass reduction throughout the rocket, including thinner fuel tank walls on the first stage, and use of composite materials on all other stages. The second launch of this variant occurred on 18 August 2008, and was used to place Inmarsat 4 F3 into orbit. The baseline Proton-M was retired in November 2007, in favour of the Enhanced variant. Frank McKenna, CEO of ILS, has indicated that in 2010 the Phase III Proton design would become the standard ILS configuration, with the ability to lift 6150 kg to GTO. On 19 October 2011, ViaSat-1 weighing 6740 kg was lifted into GTO by the Proton-M/Briz-M Phase III.  Light and Medium variants  Proton Light and Proton Medium were two proposed variants with a lower payload capacity at a reduced price. Originally proposed end of 2016, Proton Light was cancelled in 2017 and Proton Medium was put on \\"indefinite hold\\" in 2018. The variants were designed to reduce the cost for launching medium and small commercial communications satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). The variants were planned with a 2 + 1 stage architecture based on 3 stage Proton/Briz M, but dispensing with the 2nd stage and featuring minor lengthening of the other two stages. The Proton Light 1st stage was planned with 4 main engines and external tanks to the 6 used by Proton Medium and Proton-M. The cost was expected to be competitive with Ariane and SpaceX. The planned maiden flights were 2018 for Proton Medium and 2019 for Proton Light. They were expected to use Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/24 and would have required a new transporter-erector system and other ground infrastructure changes. The full-sized Proton-M can currently lift 6300 kg into a standard Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO); Proton Medium was planned to lift 5000 kg into a similar GTO while Proton Light was rated for 3600 kg. The 3000-5000 kg payload range includes all-electric and hybrid satellites that use ion thrusters to slowly make their way into geostationary orbit (GEO).  Launch profile  In a typical mission, a Proton-M is accompanied by a Briz-M upper stage. The Proton-M launches the orbital unit (that is: the payload, the payload adapter and the Briz-M) into a slightly suborbital trajectory. The first and second stages and the payload fairing crash into designated crash sites; the third stage crashes into the ocean. After the third stage separates, the orbital unit coasts for a brief period, then Briz-M performs its first firing to achieve orbital injection into a parking orbit with 51.5¬∞ inclination, at 170 km to 230 km altitude (the Mission Planner's Guide also mentions 64.8¬∞ and 72.6¬∞ as standard inclinations for the parking orbit). Subsequently, the Briz-M performs orbital maneuvers to place the payload into either its final orbit or a transfer orbit. If a transfer orbit is used the final maneuver(s) are performed by the payload on its own propulsion system.  Reliability  , 111 Proton-M launches had occurred, of which 11 failed or partially failed, yielding a success rate of . Four of these failures were the results of problems with the Proton-M itself, six were caused by the Briz-M upper stage malfunctioning and leaving cargo in a useless orbit (albeit on two instances the satellites were able to maneuver to correct orbit under their own propulsion), and one was the result of a Blok DM-03 upper stage being incorrectly fueled, leaving the Proton too heavy to achieve orbit.  Notable launch failures  In September 2007, a Proton-M/Briz-M rocket carrying Japan's JCSAT-11 communications satellite failed to achieve orbit, and fell in the Ulytau District of Kazakhstan. An investigation determined that first and second stages of the rocket had failed to separate, due to a damaged pyrotechnic cable. On 5 December 2010, the upper stage and payloads failed to reach orbital velocity due to overloading of the upper stage with 1500 kg of liquid oxygen, resulting in the loss of three GLONASS satellites it was carrying. In July 2013, a Proton-M/DM-03 carrying three GLONASS satellites failed shortly after liftoff. The booster began pitching left and right along the vertical axis within a few seconds of launch. Attempts by the onboard guidance computer to correct the flight trajectory failed and ended up putting it into an unrecoverable pitchover. The upper stages and payload were stripped off 24 seconds after launch due to the forces experienced followed by the first stage breaking apart and erupting in flames. Impact with the ground occurred 30 seconds after liftoff. The preliminary report of the investigation into the July 2013 failure indicated that three of the first stage angular velocity sensors, responsible for yaw control, were installed in an incorrect orientation. As the error affected the redundant sensors as well as the primary ones, the rocket was left with no yaw control, which resulted in the failure. Telemetry data also indicated that a pad umbilical had detached prematurely, suggesting that the Proton may have launched several tenths of a second early, before the engines reached full thrust. In May 2014, another Proton-M launch ended in failure, resulting in the loss of an Ekspress telecommunications satellite. Unlike the 2013 crash, this occurred more than nine minutes into the flight when one of the third stage verniers shut off, causing loss of attitude control. An automatic shutdown and destruct command was issued and the remains of the upper stages and payload impacted in northern China. An investigation committee concluded that the failure was most likely due to one of the turbopumps breaking off its mount, rupturing a propellant line and causing the vernier to lose thrust. In May 2015, a Proton-M with a Mexican telecommunications satellite, MexSat-1, was lost due to problems with the third stage. Russian sources indicated that the problems had been the same as with the 2014 failure. An investigation determined that the third stage vernier engine RD-0214 failed due to excessive vibration loads, which had been caused by an increasing imbalance of the rotor in the turbopump and concluded it was the same cause of a prior accident in 1988. In a June 2016 launch, one of the four second stage engines shut down prematurely. The Briz-M was able to make up for the resulting stage under- performance and deliver the Intelsat 31 satellite to the intended orbit. Pending an investigation, the rocket was grounded for the rest of 2016 and first half of 2017: Proton-M at that time planned to return to the launch pad around June 2017 to deliver the EchoStar-21 satellite to orbit. On 28 January 2017, the Russian government announced, as a result of the investigation into the failure of Progress MS-04, the recall of all Proton-M 2nd and 3rd stage engines produced by the Voronezh Mechanical Plant, including the disassembly of three completed Proton rockets and a three and a half month suspension of flights. The investigation found that cheaper alternatives, unable to resist high temperatures, had been used in place of engine parts containing valuable minerals, and that production and certification documentation had been falsified. Proton returned to flight 8 June 2017, a full year after the previous flight on 6 June 2016.  Upper stage malfunctions  Among the various Proton-M failures, some have been caused by the upper stages used to allow the rocket to deliver payloads to higher orbit, notably the failures in May 2014 and May 2015. At least five earlier launches also succumbed to problems with the Briz-M upper stage; Arabsat-4A in February 2006, AMC-14 in March 2008, Ekspress AM4 in August 2011, Telkom-3 and Ekspress MD2 in August 2012 and Yamal-402 in December 2012. All of the payloads were unusable except for Yamal-402, which was able to correct its orbit at the expense of several years' operational life, and AMC-14 which was sold to the US Government after SES determined that it couldn't complete its original mission.  Effect on government and industry  As a result of the July 2013, Proton-M launch failure, a major reorganization of the Russian space industry was undertaken. The United Rocket and Space Corporation was formed as a joint-stock corporation by the government in August 2013 to consolidate the Russian space sector. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said \\"the failure-prone space sector is so troubled that it needs state supervision to overcome its problems\\". Three days following the failure, the Russian government had announced that \\"extremely harsh measures\\" would be taken \\"and spell the end of the [Russian] space industry as we know it\\".  Environmental impact  Critics claim that Proton rocket fuel (unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH)) and debris created by Russia's space programme is poisoning areas of Russia and Kazakhstan. Residents claim that acid rain falls after some launches. Anatoly Kuzin, deputy director of the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center, has however denied these claims, saying: \\"We did special research into the issue. The level of acidity in the atmosphere is not affected by the rocket launches [and] there is no data to prove any link between the illnesses, in Altai town and the influence of rocket fuel components or space activity of any kind\\".

Apache was delivered to the U.S. Navy in 1981. She is operated by Military Sealift Command and crewed by 18 civil service mariners (CIVMARS). She is designed to provide the Navy with towing service, and when augmented by Navy divers, assist in the recovery of downed aircraft and ships. There are quarters on board for up to 22 additional personnel. Background Fleet ocean tugs are used to tow ships, barges, and targets for gunnery exercises. They are also used as platforms for salvage and diving work, as participants in naval exercises, to conduct search and rescue missions, to aid in the cleanup of oil spills and ocean accidents, and to provide fire fighting assistance. Features Apache is equipped with a 10-ton-capacity crane and a bollard pull of at least 87 tons. A deck grid is fitted aft which contains bolt receptacles spaced apart. This allows for the bolting down of a wide variety of portable equipment. The large rear deck is also painted for helicopter operations to allow for vertical replenishment at sea. There are two GPH diesel off-ship fire pumps supplying three fire monitors with up to 2,200 gallons of foam per minute. A deep module can be embarked to support naval salvage teams. Propulsion Apache towing the decommissioned destroyer ex- on the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., on 18 November 1983. Barry was arriving to take up duty as a museum ship at the Washington Navy Yard.Apache has twin GM EMD 20-645F7B diesel engines providing a total of 7,200 shaft horsepower capable of hauling large tows at speeds up to and exceeding , and light boat at . The shafts are connected to controllable pitch propellers (CPP). The engines can be operated from one of three stations on the bridge, at the engine operating station, and from an aft control station looking astern. Usually controlled from the bridge by deck officers, they allow control of the engines' RPMs and propeller pitch independently. Together with twin rudders and a bow thruster, the ship is highly maneuverable at slow speeds with extremely quick engine response. Towing equipment The vessel can employ one of two winches for towing operations. The main towing winch for large, long distance tows is a single drum, closed-loop SMATCO electro-hydraulic drive winch, with a mechanically, pneumatically, or hydraulically actuated band brake and an air-actuated dog brake which are capable of holding 500,000 lbf of tension. The winch has of 2¬º inch IWRC 6√ó37 wire rope with a poured end fitting and a breaking strain of 424,000 lbf (1.89 MN). The cable weighs approximately 8.5 lb per foot (12.6 kg/m), making the weight of the wire approximately 21,500 lb (10.75 short tons) excluding the weight of any chain bridle used on the vessel being towed. The second winch is a traction machine capable of handling up to synthetic hawsers used for smaller, shorter distance tows. The traction machine is capable of line pulls of up to . The stern employs a tow-pin box capable of capturing either the wire or synthetic towing lines, as well as Norman pins at the quarters. Service history Apache began service with the Military Sealift Command in 1981 in the Atlantic. Among her early assignments was a mission in September 1982 towing the battleship USS Iowa (BB-61) from the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Westwego, Louisiana, where Iowa began modernization work preparatory to her return to active service. Apache towed the decommissioned destroyer USS Barry (DD-933) on the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., on 18 November 1983. On 31 October 2015 Apache searched and located the missing cargo ship SS El Faro, which was lost with all hands during Hurricane Joaquin, on 1 October 2015, east of the Bahamas. Apache used the CURV 21, a deep ocean remotely operated vehicle to survey and confirm the identity of the wreckage. The initial search was conducted over 3 days using a pinger locator, attempting to listen for the ping from the El Faro's black box recorder. This was unsuccessful, so the Apache switched equipment to use a side scanning sonar, which located the wreck in 15,000 feet of water. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/searchers- locate-wreckage-believed-to-be-el-faro-cargo-ship/ar- BBmFLCj?li=AAa0dzB&ocid;=U142DHP The Federal Mariner, January-March 2016 (page 3) References   External links  *NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive USNS Apache (T-ATF-172) *Military Sealift Command Ship Inventory: USNS Apache (T-ATF-172) *U.S. Navy Fact File: Fleet Ocean Tugs ‚Äì T-ATF Category:Tugs of the United States Navy Category:Cold War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ships built by Marinette Marine Category:1981 ships ","title":"USNS Apache (T-ATF-172)"},{"id":"13138092","text":"Dr. Barry S.

Mortimer became President of the Society of Artists in 1774, five years before his death at age 39. Biography Mortimer was born on 17 September 1740 at Eastbourne. His father, Thomas Mortimer, was a customs officer, a dealer in flour and owner of several mills. By 1757, while he was still young, Mortimer was studying in London at the Duke of Richmond's Academy. During this time he became a friend of Joseph Wright, a fellow student at the Academy - a friendship which would endure throughout Mortimer's life. Mortimer is also known to have had some professional relationship with the artist Samuel Ireland, who was involved with etching his work.Samuel Ireland at ilab.org accessed 7 September 2007 At the St Martin's Lane Academy his fellow students included Thomas Jones and William Pars. Mortimer also studied under Cipriani, Robert Edge Pine, and Sir Joshua Reynolds. In 1759, Mortimer won a first prize for a study after Michelangelo's Bacchus and a second prize for a life drawing. He began to exhibit his works on a regular basis in the early 1760s, becoming an active member of the Society of Artists, which awarded him prizes for paintings of subjects from British history in 1763 and 1764. The second of these prizes was for a picture entitled St Paul Preaching to the Ancient Druids in Britain (now in the Guildhall in High Wycombe). He became president of the society in 1774. Saint Paul Preaching to the Britons, drawing, (between 1775 and 1778) Mortimer painted the figures for several paintings by Thomas Jones, working on the Welsh artist's A Land Storm, with the Story of Dido and Aeneas (1769), The Death of Orpheus (c.1770) and a pair of paintings based on Milton's Allegro and Penseroso, commissioned by Benjamin Bates (1774). In the 1770s Mortimer was associated with more masculine, and criminal, presentation of the male form after a period of more effete images. His painting Sir Arthegal, the Knight of Justice, with Talus, the Iron Man is used as an example of this style. He was inspired by both the work and the legend of the life of the seventeenth-century Neapolitan painter, Salvator Rosa, who it was claimed, had been brought up by bandits. Mortimer first exhibited a painting of a bandit subject in 1772, and later made an etching after Rosa'a self- portrait. From 1770 to 1773 he was engaged in the decoration of the saloon at Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, where he was assisted by Thomas Jones, Francis Wheatley, James Durno, and Burnaby Mayor In 1775 he married Jane Hurrel, which affected his artistic productivity. Owing to his membership of the Society of Artists, Mortimer did not exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1778, when he showed five works, including Sir Arthegel and three scenes with Italian bandits. On 2 November of the same year he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy. He died of undocumented causes on 4 February 1779.  Notes  I Mortimer was sometimes accused of being a \\"copier\\" of others. Horace Walpole, the politician and writer, claimed that Mortimer was nothing more than an \\"imitator\\" of Salvator Rosa in his war scene paintings.  Sources  ;Attribution Further reading * J.

Born in Scotland in the Dumfries and Galloway region, a region which produced many of the leaders of Jardine, Matheson including its founder, he was educated at Eton where he excelled in Classics and sports then later at Trinity College in Cambridge. While at Cambridge in 1942, his studies were interrupted by his service with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, serving in Europe, later on his regiment was transferred to the Middle East, in Egypt then in Palestine. Attaining the rank of Captain and awarded the Military Cross for gallantry in action, he returned to Cambridge in 1947 to continue his studies in Classics. In 1949, Herries joined Jardine, Matheson & Co. as a junior accountant and was immediately asked to report to Hong Kong in the Far East. Before moving, he had married Elizabeth Smith and transferred to Hong Kong with her. In just a short time as junior accountant, he was promoted to general manager. A brilliant manager, Herries moved up the corporate ladder fast and in less than ten years reached the rank of associate director. In 1959, he became Director overseeing a large division within the group. In 1962, he became the Deputy Managing Director reporting to then Chairman and Managing Director Hugh Barton. Upon Barton's retirement in June 1963, Herries became Chairman and Managing Director of Jardines, acquiring the title of 'Tai-pan'. As 'Tai-pan' of Jardines, he oversaw the group's rapid rise to become an international conglomerate. Herries did much in transforming Jardines from an old-fashioned trading company into a modern enterprise run by a modern team of managers. He is best remembered for confidently steering the group during the tumultuous 1966-67 revolution that convulsed Hong Kong and was prodded by the Chinese Communist Government. For his actions, he was awarded a Knighthood in 1968. Herries retired from Jardines in 1970. He had an outstanding business reputation in Hong Kong and the Far East from his years of successfully managing a large diversified conglomerate and an even outstanding public service. He was an active member of the non-executive Legislative Council of Hong Kong and a member of several trade groups, universities and associations. After a brief association with Jardines after his retirement, he joined The Royal Bank of Scotland as Vice-Chairman in 1974, Deputy Chairman in 1975 and Chairman in 1976 and retired in 1992. He was also a director of the London Tin Corporation, Scottish Widows Fund & Life Assurance Society; Lloyds & Scottish; and Scottish Mortgage & Trust plc. Herries received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1984 Sir Michael Herries was known to be a brilliant manager and demanded nothing but the best from his staff. He was widely regarded as one of the most modest and likeable of men. He and his wife, Elizabeth had two sons and a daughter. Sir Michael died on 6 May 1995.

First took piano lessons at age 7, then guitar at age 10. Then had musical training at Eric Guilder guitar school in London with teacher Ivor Mairants. His professional career ran over 40 years until he retired following a car crash in 2004. During the 1960s he played in a number of bands which left few traces in the history of popular music. The notable exception occurred when he joined briefly John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Dean's guitar is heard on Mayall's first album and single. Leaving Mayall, he went to work with his former band the Nu Notes. In 1971, he played with a band called Spike Island and recorded an album with them, a mixture of folk, country and world music. Later, as a member of various other bands like The Bluejays, P. P. Arnold's backing band and The Bad Boys, he recorded on some hits, but gradually turned to more anonymous work as a session musician playing for TV shows, backing stars and other lucrative jobs, such as cruises on the QE2 as guitarist with The Joe Loss Orchestra. In 1978, Dean became the first western musician allowed to play on electric guitar in China. From 1992 he held teaching posts at various British schools. After a serious illness, Dean died in 2008.

Formins (formin homology proteins) are a group of proteins that are involved in the polymerization of actin and associate with the fast-growing end (barbed end) of actin filaments. Most formins are Rho-GTPase effector proteins. Formins regulate the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton and are involved in various cellular functions such as cell polarity, cytokinesis, cell migration and SRF transcriptional activity. Formins are multidomain proteins that interact with diverse signalling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins, although some formins have been assigned functions within the nucleus.  Diversity  Formins have been found in all eukaryotes studied. In humans, 15 different formin proteins are present that have been classified in 7 subgroups. By contrast, yeasts contain only 2-3 formins.  Structure and interactions  Formins are characterized by the presence of three formin homology (FH) domains (FH1, FH2 and FH3), although members of the formin family do not necessarily contain all three domains. In addition, other domains are usually present, such as PDZ, DAD, WH2, or FHA domains. The proline-rich FH1 domain mediates interactions with a variety of proteins, including the actin-binding protein profilin, SH3 (Src homology 3) domain proteins, and WW domain proteins. The actin nucleation- promoting activity of S. cerevisiae formins has been localized to the FH2 domain. The FH2 domain is required for the self-association of formin proteins through the ability of FH2 domains to directly bind each other, and may also act to inhibit actin polymerization. The FH3 domain is less well conserved and is required for directing formins to the correct intracellular location, such the mitotic spindle, or the projection tip during conjugation. In addition, some formins can contain a GTPase-binding domain (GBD) required for binding to Rho small GTPases, and a C-terminal conserved Dia-autoregulatory domain (DAD). The GBD is a bifunctional autoinhibitory domain that interacts with and is regulated by activated Rho family members. Mammalian Drf3 contains a CRIB-like motif within its GBD for binding to Cdc42, which is required for Cdc42 to activate and guide Drf3 towards the cell cortex where it remodels the actin skeleton. The DAD binds the N-terminal GBD; this link is broken when GTP-bound Rho binds to the GBD and activates the protein. The addition of the DAD to mammalian cells induces actin filament formation, stabilizes microtubules, and activates SRF mediated transcription. Another commonly found domain is an armadillo repeat region (ARR) located in the FH3 domain. The FH2 domain, has been shown by X-ray crystallography to have an elongated, crescent shape containing three helical subdomains. Formins also directly bind to microtubules via their FH2 domain. This interaction is important in promoting the capture and stabilization of a subset of microtubules oriented towards the leading edge of migrating cells. Formins also promote the capture of microtubules by the kinetochore during mitosis and for aligning microtubules along actin filaments.

He was a favourite of King Henry I and is most famous for having founded the Priory of the Hospital of St Bartholomew in 1123. Many of the details of Rahere's life have become confused, having been variously described as a cleric, a courtier, a minstrel and a jester, but undoubtedly Rahere existed and did many of the things in the legends about him. He may at different times in his life have been all of these. Rahere is listed as a canon of St Paul's Cathedral in a document of 1115. On a pilgrimage to Rome, he fell ill and had a reputed vision of St Bartholomew, who directed him to establish a religious hospital. Upon his return to England, he followed this calling and founded a priory at Smithfield in London, being installed as its prior, a position he held until his death. An ornate tomb in his memory can be found inside the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great. He is the subject of Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"Rahere\\", collected in Debits and Credits, as well as being a major figure in Kipling's story \\"The Tree of Justice\\", featuring in Rewards and Fairies. He is also a significant character in Rosemary Sutcliff's historical novel for children, The Witch's Brat (1970). It seems likely that Sutcliff was first introduced to Rahere by reading Kipling's Rewards and Fairies as a child and later chose him as a character for one of her own books: Kipling's works are a significant and openly acknowledged inspiration for Sutcliff.

The series is most notable for being television's first filmed series (although not the first filmed series broadcast),The NBC anthology series Your Show Time became American television's first filmed dramatic series to be broadcast, in January 1949. Stanley Rubin, \\"A (Very) Personal History of the First Sponsored Film Series on National Television\\", E-Media Studies, vol. 1, issue 1 (2008). paving the way for later filmed TV series such as I Love Lucy four years later. After running in syndication earlier that year as Public Prosecutor, the program aired on DuMont from 6 September 1951 to 27 September 1951. Retitled Crawford Mystery Theatre, after sponsor Crawford Clothes, the series was padded out to thirty minutes with the addition of a panel show segment. Before the guilty party was revealed, three studio panelists would attempt to guess his or her identity. This version of the show was hosted by Warren Hull. After the network cancellation, the program continued to air locally on DuMont's flagship station, WABD in New York City. The final program aired on February 28, 1952.McNeil, Alex. Total Television.

This image warping avoids any restrictions when displaying it together with video from multiple radar sources or with other geographical data including scanned maps and satellite images which may be provided in a particular projection. There are many areas where geo warping has unique benefits: * Single radar video signal displayed together with maps of different geographical projections. E.g. **Mercator **UTM **stereographic * Multiple radar video signals displayed simultaneously: ** Having the computing power to do so on one computer. ** Adapting the projection of all radar signals allowing the geographically correct display and accurate superimposition of those videos. * Slant range correction: a modern 3D radar system can measure the height of a target and hence it is possible to correct the radar video by the real corrected range of the target. Slant Range Correction also allows to compensate the radar tower height e.g. for maritime surveillance radars.  Introduction  Radar video presents the echoes of electromagnetic waves a radar system has emitted and received as reflections afterwards. These echoes are typically presented on a computer screen with a color-coding scheme depicting the reflection strength. Two problems have to be solved during such a visualization process. The first problem arises from the fact that typically the radar antenna turns around its position and measures the reflection echo distances from its position in one direction. This effectively means that the radar video data are present in polar coordinates. In older systems the polar oriented picture has been displayed in so called plan position indicators (PPI). The PPI-scope uses a radial sweep pivoting about the center of the presentation. This results in a map-like picture of the area covered by the radar beam. A long-persistence screen is used so that the display remains visible until the sweep passes again. Bearing to the target is indicated by the target's angular position in relation to an imaginary line extending vertically from the sweep origin to the top of the scope. The top of the scope is either true north (when the indicator is operated in the true bearing mode) or ship's heading (when the indicator is operated in the relative bearing mode). This is a typical plan position indicator (PPI) For visualization on a modern computer screen the polar coordinates have to be converted into Cartesian coordinates. This process called radar scan conversion is presented with more detail in the next section. The second problem to solve arises from the fact that a radar system is placed in the real world and measures real world echo positions. These echoes have to be displayed together with other real world data like object positions, vector maps and satellite images in a consistent way. All this information refers to the curved earth surface but is displayed on a flat computer display. Building a link from real world earth positions to display pixels is commonly called geographical referencing or in short geo- referencing. Part of the geo-referencing process is to map the 3D earth surface onto a 2D display. This process of a geographical projection can be performed in many ways, but different data sources have their own ‚Äònatural‚Äô projection. E.g. Cartesian radar video data from a radar source on the earth surface are geo-referenced by a so-called radar projection. When using this radar projection the Cartesian radar video pixels can directly displayed on a computer screen (only being linearly transformed according to the current position on the screen and e.g. the current zoom level). A problem now arises if e.g. also a satellite map shall be shown together with the radar video data. The ‚Äònatural‚Äô geographical projection of a satellite image would be a satellite projection which depends on the satellite orbit, position and further parameters. Now either the satellite image has to be reprojected to a radar projection or the radar video has to use the satellite projection. This geographical re-projection is also called geographical warping or Geo Warping where each image pixel has to be transformed from one projection into another. This article describes in further detail the Geo Warping of radar video images in real time. It will also show that radar video Geo Warping is done most efficiently when it is integrated with the radar scan conversion process.  Radar-scan conversion  This section describes the principles of the radar- scan conversion (RSC) process. The radar-scan conversion process in general as it is done by the OpenGL RSC The radar supplies its measured data in polar coordinates (œÅ,Œ∏) directly from the rotating antenna. œÅ defines the target/echo distance and Œ∏ the target angle in polar world coordinates. These data are measured, digitized and stored in a polar coordinate polar store or polar pixmap. The main RSC task is to convert these data to Cartesian (x, y) display coordinates, creating the necessary display pixels. The RSC process is influenced by the current zoom, shift and rotation settings defining which part of the 'world' shall be visible in the display image. As detailed later the RSC process also takes the currently used geographical projection into account when the radar video images are Geo Warped. The OpenGL RSC is implemented using a reverse scan conversion approach which calculates for every image pixel the most appropriate radar amplitude value in the polar store. This approach generates an optimal image without any artifacts known from forward spoke fill algorithms. By applying bi-linear filtering between adjacent pixels in the polar store during the conversion process the OpenGL RSC finally achieves a very high visual quality radar display image for every zoom level, creating smooth images of the radar echoes.  Radar projection  This section illustrates how radar video data are geo referenced and displayed on a computer screen. This figure shows the principles of a radar measurement This figure shows an example radar projection with the center of projection (COP) at latitude 50.0¬∞ and longitude 0.0¬∞ which is also the radar position. The radar sensor is positioned on the earth surface with a height h above the ground. It measures the direct distance d to the target (and not e.g. the distance the target is away from the radar if one would move on the earth surface). This distance is then used in the display plane after adjustment to the current display zoom level by the radar scan converter (RSC). Now it has to be clarified how the radar video data is geo referenced. This basically means, that if we want to display a geographical real world object (like e.g. a light house) which is at the same real world position as the radar target, that it also shall appear at the same position in the display plane. This is realized by calculating the distance from the radar sensor to the respective real world object and use that distance in the display plane. The position of the real world object is typically given in geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude and height above the earth surface). In other words, using a radar projection with geographical data is done by simulating a radar measurement process with the real world objects and use the resulting range and azimuth in the display plane. The second picture to the right shows an example radar projection with the center of projection (COP) at latitude 50.0¬∞ and longitude 0.0¬∞ which is also the radar position. The dashed lines are the equal-latitude and equal-longitude lines on top of the background map. The solid lines show equal-range and equal-azimuth with the respect to the radar position. It is a feature of the radar projection that equal-range lines are circles and equal-azimuth lines are straight lines. This is necessary to display radar video consistently with other map data when using a radar projection where the projection center has to be the radar position.  Geo Warping process Geo Warping Radar to CIB Projection. This section explains the actual geo warping or re-projection process when applied to radar video in real time. Assume we want to display radar video on top of a satellite image. As an example we use the CIB projection which is used to display satellite data in CIB (Controlled Image Base) format. The Figure Geo Warping Radar to CIB Projection shows dashed the maximal range circle for a range of 111 km or 60 miles using the radar projection. Such a range is typical for long range coastal surveillance radars. As stated in the last section this is a perfect circle also on the computer screen. The solid line ellipse shows the same range circle for the CIB projection. Typically the errors occurring without Geo Warping are smallest near the radar position if at least the projection center (COP) coincides with the radar position, as realized in our example. Otherwise the error distribution depends both on the used projection and also on the projection parameters. Thus, in our case the errors are most significant near the maximum radar range. The CIB projection error corrected in east-west direction at half the radar range is 2.6 km and is 5.3 km at the full radar range of 111 km. An error of 5.3 km is quite significant compared to a typical radial radar measurement resolution of 15 m. Coordinate re- projection The Figure Coordinate re-projection explains how the radar coordinates have to be transformed to match the CIB projection coordinates. The radar world coordinates correspond to the Cartesian version of the data measured by the radar sensor. Using an inverse radar projection these coordinates are converted into geographic coordinates which represent the radar data posi-tions on the earth surface. These coordinates are then finally projected by the CIB (or any other) projection for displaying on the computer screen. A problem which arises is that geo warping all measured radar video pixels is far too computing resource consuming as to be performed in real time. A possible solution is to use lookup tables for all points on the screen, but the lookup table re-computation after e.g. a display zoom operation still causes a noticeable delay for radar video visualization. Geo warping grid The Figure Geo warping grid depicts the solution to the problem. The circular radar coverage area is divided into a circular grid. Only the corner points of the grid are geo warped which drastically reduces the computation time. Coordinates within a grid tile are computed by a weighted bilinear interpolation of the grid corner points. As geographical projections are typically non-linear functions this introduces a certain error for the radar video display position. Keeping this error sufficiently below the radar measurement resolution makes sure that this is no restriction for the radar video display quality. The grid tile size has to be computed once for a radar position and a given projection. Thus, the grid is typically computed once for a static radar and only more often for moving radars such as on ships. The OpenGL radar-scan converter does its scan conversion computations on the graphics processing unit to achieve high performance and visual quality. The bi-linear coordinate interpolation mentioned above is done in dedicated hardware on the GPU and therefore causes no overhead for the scan converter.  Example  This example demonstrates how geo warping helps to consistently display multiple radar videos. Example of a radar target shown with and without the effects of geo warping. This figure shows the visual effects on the right side without geo warping that targets seen by two radars cannot be correctly displayed and it is unclear where the target is actually positioned. The red and yellow target echoes are seen be radars which are about 50 km away. The radars are also about 50 km away from each other. The semi- transparent pink color depicts the track history. In this scenario even a radar projection is used but of course the radar projection center (COP) can be only at the position of one of the radars. Even larger inconsistencies can arise if a projection different from a radar projection is used. The geo warped view on the left side shows the consistently displayed radar echoes where both radar echoes are exactly at the real target's position.

Chinese marks are also copied, so that to scratch an article is sometimes the only means of proving it to be of Persian manufacture, for the Chinese glaze, hard as iron, will take no mark.\\" Of the Chinese Li family in Quanzhou, Li Nu, the son of Li Lu, visited Hormuz in Persia in 1376, converted to Islam, married a Persian or an Arab woman, and brought her back to Quanzhou. Li Nu was the ancestor of the Ming Dynasty reformer Li Chih. In 1756, the Dutch reported that 80 Chinese families lived in Kharg Island, where they worked as farmers. The numbers of expatriates from the People's Republic of China began to increase noticeably between 2002 and 2005. Business and employment Most modern Chinese expatriates work on construction or other engineering projects; a few run import/export companies or other small businesses. Large-scale investment projects are also becoming more common; businessmen from Zhejiang began building Iran's first Chinese trade complex in 2006. The 330,000 square-metre site in the south of the country, located five kilometres from Khorramshahr and twenty kilometres from the Iraqi border, is expected to contain 1,500 businesses and cost RMB600 million to complete. Cultural integration One People's Daily reporter described Chinese people in Iran often have trouble adapting to local life. They live in a separate sphere from Iranians. Most cannot speak much Persian. Because the number of Chinese in the country is so small, Chinese people are typically taken to be Koreans or Japanese people instead, unlike in other countries where the opposite mistake is more common. Chinese cuisine is largely unavailable. Aside from Chinese people married to Iranians, international students are the group of Chinese in Iran best integrated into mainstream society, in terms of lifestyle and language. Their total number is estimated at roughly 100; unlike other Chinese residents, most live outside of Tehran, because the number of scholarships offered by universities in the capital has been decreasing. There is a small Chinatown in Iran built on a Chinese theme, known as Mahale Chiniha.

Early life  Laurens Reael was the son of Laurens Jacobsz Reael, a merchant in Amsterdam named after the sign or gable stone of his house/shop In den gouden Reael (\\"In the Golden Real\\") and an amateur poet known for writing Geuzenliederen (songs of the geuzen). The Amsterdam neighborhood Gouden Reael is named after Laurens Reael's birth house, via a later (1648) warehouse of the Reael family on the Zandhoek that turned into a popular inn. Laurens Jr. had academic talents, excelling in math and languages. He studied law in Leiden, where he lived in the house of Jacobus Arminius who had married his older sister Lijsbet Reael in 1590. Laurens received his doctorate in 1608.  East Indies  In May 1611, he left as commandeur of four ships for the East Indies. He quickly worked his way up to become the third Governor-General in 1616, where he was stationed at the VOC headquarters, at that time on Ternate in the Moluccas. That year he could personally welcome both Joris van Spilbergen (30 March) and Schouten & Le Maire (12 September) upon their respective arrivals at Ternate from the Dutch Republic via the Strait of Magellan and Cape Horn. He was unaware that the VOC had ordered Schouten & Le Maire's ships to be confiscated for alleged infringement of its monopoly of trade to the Spice Islands. Already after a year, on 31 October 1617, Reael resigned following a dispute with the VOC's leadership (the Lords XVII) on the treatment of both the English competitors in the Moluccas and of the native people. The jurist Reael would only take action against the English if international law would allow that and had protested repeatedly against the incursions against the natives. He, like the local admiral Steven van der Haghen, was of the opinion that the VOC's goals should be achieved solely via commercial and diplomatic routes. In his official report to the Staten Generaal and the VOC's Lords XVII upon his return to the Dutch Republic, he made these points again very clear. It would take however until 21 March 1619, when the decidedly less pacifistic Jan Pieterszoon Coen would replace him as Governor-General, before which time Reael had fought the Spanish in 1617 in the Bay of Manila, the English at Bantam and in the Mollucas, and the Mataram Sultanate at Japara on Java. Later life in the Dutch Republic Reael left the East Indies in January 1620 for Holland where for several years he focused on poetry, partially because his sympathies for the remonstrants (Arminius had been his brother in law after all) prevented him from holding public office. He acquainted, among others, the poets Pieter Cornelisz Hooft and Joost van den Vondel and became part of the Muiderkring. In 1623 Vondel dedicated his poem Lof der Zeevaart (Ode to Seafaring) to him. After the death of Maurice of Nassau, Reael's standings were restored, and on 9 June 1625 he became a member of the Amsterdam Chamber of the VOC, which he would remain until the end of his life. From 1625 to 1627, he served as vice admiral of Holland and West- Friesland with the Amsterdam Admiralty, and he commanded a fleet of ships fighting the Spanish at the Barbary Coast alongside the English (the \\"second expedition to Spain\\" from 12 November 1626 to 10 July 1627). In 1626 he represented the Dutch Republic at the crowning of Charles I of England, who knighted him at the occasion. After 18 August 1627, he served as acting lieutenant admiral of Holland and West-Friesland, after the death of Lieutenant-Admiral Willem van Nassau. At the end of 1627, he was sent as a diplomat to Denmark, which at that time was at war with Ferdinand II of Austria. On his way back early in 1628, he suffered a shipwreck of the coast of Jutland, where Austrian imperial troops happened to be camped. These captured him and sent him to Vienna, where he would remain imprisoned until February 1629. On his return he was not reinstated in his naval functions. In the summer of that year he married, and in 1630 he became councillor and in 1632 alderman (schepen) of the city of Amsterdam. In 1637, he was considered for the function of Fleet Admiral of the confederate Dutch fleet to replace the incompetent Philips van Dorp, but in October, after losing his two young sons earlier in the year, he died of bubonic plague in Amsterdam. He was buried in Amsterdam in the Westerkerk.

The form genus was put forwards by Dianne Edwards, and is diagnosed by inwards-pointing flanges and randomly oriented pseudo-cellular units. Projections on the outer surface are always present, and sometimes also appear on the inner surface; however, the surface of the cuticle itself is always smooth. The holes in the cuticle are often covered by round flaps, loosely attached along a side. Where Nematothallus was sometimes used to relate only to tube-like structures, Cosmochlaina was used in reference to the cuticle fragments. Material discovered later revealed its internal anatomy, which comprises a lichen-like mat of 'hyphae'. It has been suggested that the pores of Cosmochlaina represent broken-off rhizoids, on the basis that rotting and acid treatment of extant liverworts produces a similar perforated texture. However, the status of this form genus in any one kingdom is not secure; members could, for example, represent arthropod cuticle. Alternatively, different species may in fact represent different parts of the same organism. Based on the more recent material, a lichen affinity seems most plausible.

Weinbaum, about an experimental medical treatment gone awry. It was first published in the November 1935 issue of Astounding magazine under the pen name \\"John Jessel\\". It was collected in various editions of A Martian Odyssey, as well as the 1979 The Best Of Stanley G. Weinbaum.ISFDB entry The story was dramatized on the radio program Escape March 26, 1949 and later that year on the television program Studio One episode called \\"Kyra Zelas\\" (the name of the title character) aired on September 12, 1949. It was dramatized on June 20, 1952 on the television show Tales of Tomorrow under the title \\"The Miraculous Serum\\" (Season 1, Episode 38), and again on December 3, 1955 on the television show Science Fiction Theatre under the title \\"Beyond Return\\", starring Zachary Scott and Joan Vohs, with the story credited to John Jessel. A film version was released in 1957 as She Devil, starring Mari Blanchard, Jack Kelly, and Albert Dekker. In the 1971 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, the story tied for 16th in the Pre-1940 Short Fiction classification. Plot summary Dr. Daniel Scott approaches his colleague, Dr. Herman Bach of Grand Mercy Hospital, looking for a human test subject. Scott claims that recovering from a disease or injury is merely a matter of adaptation. He has derived a serum from fruit flies, the most adaptable creatures he could find. Bach is skeptical, but has a patient only hours from death due to tuberculosis (at the time an incurable disease). With nothing to lose, a drab, plain woman named Kyra Zelas agrees to the treatment. The results are beyond Scott's wildest dreams. Within a week, Zelas is well and is discharged from the hospital. Shortly afterwards, she murders an old man in a park for his money. She is quickly arrested and brought to trial. A witness describes the killer as a skinny brunette, but the Kyra Zelas on trial possesses a stunning figure and pure white hair, and the case is dismissed. Scott and Bach attend the trial; Bach notices that when sunlight strikes her hair, it turns blonde immediately. The two doctors reach the conclusion that Zelas has become adaptive to an extreme degree. This hypothesis is confirmed when she accepts an offer of shelter from Dr. Bach, allowing the two men to make observations. During her stay, Zelas confesses her crime to Scott. She also tells him that she thinks she wants him. At that moment, her already-great beauty intensifies; Scott realizes that she is adapting once again, to make him love her, but even knowing this, he falls under her spell. From experiments on guinea pigs, the doctors find that the adaptive ability is connected to hypertrophy of the pineal gland, but when they try to put Zelas to sleep with gas in order to operate on her, she is unaffected - she quickly develops an immunity. After stealing a car and killing a child in a hit-and-run accident, Zelas leaves to acquire power to protect herself. When next the doctors hear of her, they find that she has become engaged to a rising politician, the Secretary of the Treasury. As time passes, she is more and more in the news, hinting that her influence is growing. One day, she returns for an overnight visit to try once more to woo Scott, but fails. Scott and Bach realize that they will have only one chance to stop her grandiose schemes, but how? Then Scott finds her weakness: no organism can adapt to its own waste products. They pump carbon dioxide gas into her room to knock her out as she sleeps. Even so, she almost escapes. The doctors are able to operate on her pineal gland. Afterwards, she reverts to her former appearance, with just a hint left of the magnificent beauty she once possessed, but to Dr. Scott's eyes, she has not changed in the least.

It was first issued in 1968 on Bluebell Records and is De Andr√©'s last studio release on Bluebell. Of the songs contained in the album, only four were previously unreleased; the other ones are re-recordings of tracks originally issued on 45-rpm records during De Andr√©'s early stint with the Karim label. Track listing The songs *\\"La canzone di Marinella\\" became De Andr√©'s first hit as soon as Mina made a re-recording of it, after De Andr√©'s original (as featured here) had made no impact on the charts. Its lyrics, in a very sweetened, sugar-coated style, tell the story (mentioned as true in the opening line) of the rape and murder of a young girl; the lyrics, as De Andr√© revealed in a 1991 Rai 1 interview with Vincenzo Mollica, are based on the actual murder of a 16-year-old girl during the early 1960s in Genoa, identified by the local papers as a prostitute; her killer, who was never apprehended, dumped her corpse in the Tanaro river.  Alternate explicit lyrics to \\"La canzone di Marinella\\"  The fifth verse of \\"Marinella\\", as De Andr√© originally wrote it, was notably more explicit in its depiction of the actual rape act: \\"It started with a caress and a little kiss / then he moved straight onto a blowjob; / and under the threat of a straight razor / you were forced to spit and swallow.\\" However, by the time he went into the studio to record the song, De Andr√© was well aware of how strict Italian censorship was in seizing upon even the tiniest hints of explicitness (having previously experienced censorship on his earlier song \\"Carlo Martello\\") and decided not to record the explicit verse at all; he rewrote it as \\"There were kisses and there were smiles / then it was only cornflowers, / which, as your eyes were looking at the stars, / saw your skin shivering to the wind and the kisses,\\" which made a better fit to the overall \\"sweet\\" mood of the lyrics. However, De Andr√© did include the alternate verse in his earliest live performances, starting from his very first concert residency in 1975 at the famous \\"Bussola\\" nightclub in Viareggio. It can be heard in a March 15, 1975 recording of his, as featured in the 2012 release La Bussola e Storia di un impiegato: il concerto 1975-'76; on the same recording, the live audience can be heard reacting enthusiastically to the lyrical change, as they did not expect the song (which was already popular by then) to have any \\"alternate\\" lyrics at all.La Bussola e Storia di un impiegato CD release, Disc 1, track 17. On the other hand, a critic for Corriere della Sera, reviewing the opening night, unceremoniously referred to the performance as a \\"porn version of Marinella\\".Photo book included with Fabrizio De Andr√©: I concerti box set, page 8. During the 1975 residency, De Andr√© performed the song in a very similar arrangement to the studio version; after Franco Mussida from PFM reworked the song into a melancholic ballad for the band's historical 1979 concert tour with De Andr√©, the singer dropped the explicit verse and went back to its \\"radio-friendly\\" equivalent. *\\"La ballata dell'eroe\\" [\\"The hero's ballad\\"] is a sad lament about the futility of war, describing a soldier who, moved by his ardent desire for military glory, acts on his own beyond the received orders and gets killed as a result. De Andr√©, with his usual sarcastic irony, notes that \\"all that's left of him is a medal in his memory.\\" The song, originally recorded in 1961 as the B-side of what De Andr√© saw as his first \\"proper\\" 7-inch release on Karim (the A-side being \\"La ballata del Mich√®\\", below), was also recorded by Luigi Tenco in 1962. * \\"Il gorilla\\" [\\"The gorilla\\"] is a translated version of Georges Brassens' song \\"Le Gorille\\". It is about a gorilla which, after escaping from his cage, loses his virginity after deciding to rape a judge instead of an old woman. The story is ultimately used to convey a message against death penalty. * \\"S'i' fosse foco\\" [\\"If I were fire\\"] is based on the LXXXVI satirical sonnet of the Rime (Rhymes), written by Italian medieval poet Cecco Angiolieri. In his poem, Cecco jocularly describes the huge devastation he would cause to the world and its inhabitants if he were fire, wind, water, God, the Pope or an emperor, as well as the death of both his parents, which he also would cause if he were Death (or Life - in which case, he would stay away from his parents). The ambiguously dark mood of the poem is, however, offset by its final three lines, where Cecco shoots his ultimate jest: \\"If I were Cecco like I am and was / I'd take for myself all the youngest and fairest women; / the lame and ugly ones - I'd leave them to others.\\" The poem is set by De Andr√© to a joyous mazurka tune. * \\"Amore che vieni, amore che vai\\" [\\"You, love, who comes and who goes\\"] ia a melodic and regretful song focusing on a recurring theme of De Andr√©'s, the mutability of love. The singer argues that no matter how strong is a love affair, or how passionately love may be expressed by a person, everything is bound to change, or even to disappear, within a short time - such as a month or a year. * \\"La guerra di Piero\\" [\\"Piero's war\\"] is another of De Andr√©'s best-known songs, one of the few he included in almost every live show of his - from the very first ones in 1975 to the very last one in 1998. Set on a strongly marked rhythm of a military march, but at a very slow, almost funereal pace, \\"La guerra di Piero\\", like \\"La ballata dell'eroe\\", is a strong condemnation of war and a statement of the absolute uselessness of all war efforts. In the lyrics, Piero (vaguely modeled on the very young US soldiers in the Vietnam war, but, as De Andr√© clarified later, not intended to be a specific soldier in any specific war) is marching through a field when he sees an enemy - a man who \\"was in an identical mood to [him], but his suit was of another colour\\". As Piero nervously hesitates on where and how to shoot the man, he is killed himself and dies in the field, described as a cornfield. * \\"Il testamento\\" [\\"The Will\\"], not to be confused with the later song \\"Il testamento di Tito\\", is a bitterly ironical song about a man drafting his last will and testament, but being sure, at the same time, that everyone he names will be disappointed. What the man \\"bequeaths\\" is, in fact, either trivial things or abstract ones - indeed, the \\"will\\" is just an excuse for the man to scorn and insult all of the people who, in turn, have scorned him in his lifetime. He concludes by stating that \\"when you die, you always die alone.\\" Here, for the first time in his career, De Andr√© uses a bright tarantella arrangement, with an acoustic guitar and an accordion, which he would use again in several later occasions. * \\"Nell'acqua della chiara fontana\\" [\\"In the water of a clear spring\\"] is a translated version of Georges Brassens's song \\"Dans l'eau de la claire fontaine\\". It is another song that uses the medieval troubador song template seen in \\"Carlo Martello\\"; its inclusion on the album, together with \\"S'i' fosse foco\\" and \\"Il re fa rullare i tamburi\\" (below), contributed to the recurring presentation of De Andr√© as a medieval revivalist, in the Italian press of the era. * \\"La ballata del Mich√®\\" [\\"Mickey's ballad\\"] is a waltz about a murderer who, sentenced to 20 years in jail, gives himself his own death penalty by committing suicide. De Andr√© delivers the lyrics in his usual neutral, almost-resigned tone, which by then was becoming a trademark of his. The song was inspired by an actual news event, and includes a number of elements common to De Andr√© songs: a tolerance, understanding and respect of the common man and his circumstances, along with a critique of both the law and the church for certain of their hard-line and merciless principles.Commentary by Dennis Criteser, on his blog Fabrizio De Andr√© in English, containing his English translations of De Andr√©'s entire recorded output. * \\"Il re fa rullare i tamburi\\" [\\"The king has his drums rolling\\"] is a translated version of a French traditional song from the 14th century, \\"Le roi a fait battre tambour\\", which had been recorded in its native language by Yves Montand in 1959. *\\"Il pescatore\\" [\\"The Fisherman\\"], released as a standalone single in 1970, was included as a bonus track in all re-releases of Volume 3, starting from the first.

The game also spawned a sequel, Tribal Trouble 2 in 2011, however it doesn't seem to have got further than Beta testing. Open Source Release In September 2014 the game's source code was released to the public on GitHub and is now open source under the GPLv2. Development continues in a community fork.tribaltrouble by team- penguin on github.com Gameplay Tribal Trouble buildings and units *Peons Although tiny of stature, the peons are the only real workforce of your tribe. With their patented Multi Tool they can cut down trees, mine rocks, construct, repair and demolish buildings, slaughter innocent-looking tropical chickens and produce a variety of weapons. In lack of a real armed force, peons can also attack enemy warriors, but don't expect them to survive that unless the enemy is greatly outnumbered. *Warriors Where the peons do all the hard work, the warriors get all the fun of hacking down the enemies and wrecking their buildings. Warriors generally come in three flavors: The basic rock warrior with his inferior stone weapon, the iron warrior with his sharp-edged iron weapon and finally the mighty chicken warrior who, despite what his name might imply, is the toughest of them all because of his tropical-chicken-enhanced weapon. *Chieftains Only the most maniacal individuals of a tribe can be turned into chieftains, the game's true weapons of mass destruction. Using his mighty lur, the Viking chieftain can stun enemies with his lack of musical abilities, or simply create a shockwave that will leave neither units or buildings standing. His nemesis, the native chieftain, excels in his deadly cooking skills. From his bubbling cauldron, he can cook up poisonous fumes that will kill off most lifeforms equipped with a nose, or summon forth angry clouds that strike down enemy units and buildings with lightning. *Quarters The quarters are where you create new units. Every now and then a new peon will turn up, and the more peons you have stuffed in the quarters, the faster new ones will appear. Exactly how a population consisting of males only manage to procreate is something we would rather not discuss here. *Armories These buildings serve as resource storage, weapons workshop and training barracks for your tribesmen. From here, resource harvesting operations are managed, peons are put to work in the smithy and new warriors are trained with the produced weapons. *Watchtowers Towers are great for defending your buildings and hard working peons. A few towers with warriors in them can stop an army of even slightly determined attackers. *Trees, rocks and iron ore These are the naturally occurring resources from which your tribesmen construct their buildings and weapons. If the amount of a resource goes below a certain level, more will automatically spawn. That's simply nature's way of encouraging the tribes to keep producing weapons and fighting wars. *Tropical chickens The tropical chicken (Turpiculus Exoticus Pullus) can be found in small groups scattered around on the islands, where they spend most of their time clucking and running around in circles to demonstrate their (apparent lack of) intelligence. What's more important, it has been discovered that their beaks have magical powers that can give throwing weapons the ability to bounce off the victim and hit other hostile targets. The origin of the tropical chicken has not yet been established, although native legends suggest that they \\"just fell down from the trees\\" one particularly windy day.

History KHXM was originally KLNI in the 1980s before becoming KIPO/KIFO, a news/talk radio outlet operated by Hawaii Public Radio from 1990 to 2002, when it went off the air and was sold to a Utah-based company. In 2005, the broadcast license was sold to another Utah-based broadcaster who, after closing the sale in 2006, had planned to bring a Spanish language format to Honolulu, but changed his mind and opted to go with a Sports radio format. By then KUPA, it returned to the air on August 31, 2007, with programming from Fox Sports Radio with plans to include local content. On November 1, 2007, KUPA went off the air when it lost its transmitter site, with a brief return to maintain the license in November 2008 from a temporary site.

This type of competition is unusual, especially in a market with no major professional sport teams, in part due to geographical and financial reasons. A Chinese- language format was observed to be in operation in mid-January 2016.

Currently owned by PT MNC Sky Vision Tbk, itself a subsidiary of Media Nusantara Citra, MNC Vision is the oldest subscription-based television service in Indonesia. Its slogan is Pay TV Keluarga Indonesia (Pay TV for Indonesian Families). History MNC Vision began operations in January 1994 as Indovision. Indovision started its service with five-channel C-Band Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) analog service. Using Palapa C-2 satellite for its transponder and broadcasting system, the C-Band DBS service features programming from international suppliers, such as HBO Asia, Star TV, Discovery, as well as local programming. Following in 1997, IndoStar-1 which also known as Cakrawarta-1 was launched as the world's first commercial communications satellite to use S-band frequencies for broadcast (pioneered by van der Heyden), which provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80 cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. This satellite uses S-Band frequency, which are less vulnerable to atmospheric interference than C-Band frequency, and are well suited to the tropical climate such as Indonesia. Cakrawarta-1 is managed and operated by PT Media Citra Indostar (MCI), a subsidiary of PT Indosat Tbk which was established on 22 July 1991. By the end of 1997, the company anticipated terminating its analog service and encouraged its subscribers to switch to its digital DBS service. In 2008, a slimmed-down suite of channels was marketed separately by Indovision as Top TV. It was discontinued at the end of 2017 in the rebranding to MNC Vision. In May 2009, Indovision launched a satellite named Indostar-2/Cakrawarta-2/ProtoSar-2. It was later renamed to SES-7 in May 2010. Currently, MNC Vision has 5 channels in high-definition, including HBO HD, Fox Movies Premium HD, National Geographic Channel HD, Disney XD HD, & Fox Sports 3 HD.

The art form has served multiple purposes since its inception in the second century BCE, including the duplication of religious texts and as a form of basic communication.  History  Early calligraphy (2nd century BCE-6th century CE) Beginning in the 2nd century AD, Indic language was transferred using birch bark as a writing surface. Locally, the birch bark was called Bhojpatra in India - patra meaning leaf/bark/sheet in Sanskrit. Palm leaves were used as a substitute to paper, even after paper was available for Indic manuscripts. The leaves were commonly used because they were a good surface for pen writing, which created the delicate and decorative handwriting that is known as calligraphy today. Both sides of these leaves were used and they were stacked on top of each other. People then created holes on the leaves and held them together by string, thus creating the early Indian manuscripts, common in Southeast Asia at the time. Middle Ages (6th century-16th century) Indian calligraphy took off starting around 500 AD when Indian traders, colonists, military adventurers, Buddhist monks and missionaries brought the Indic script to Central Asia from South East Asia. Different concepts and ideas were being created throughout the late 400s to late 1400s, in a 1000-year span. The Gilgit scripts are the earliest notable form of calligraphy in India that date back to the 5th and 6th centuries. The earliest painted covers of manuscripts were created between the 7th and 9th centuries, and the earliest illustrated manuscript in South Asia was not formed until around the 10th century.Inscriptions in the Kufic style of calligraphy form regular bands throughout the Qutb Minar, Delhi, built 1192 CE The languages of South East Asia were influenced by Indic language and culture. The languages that were created came in the form of the basic internal structure, the arrangement and construction of syllabic units, manner of representation of characters, and the direction of writing (left to right). Before this left to right reading, the technique of Pothi was utilized, which is the format of a book that is written vertically. This was useful for the illustrations made in these early manuscripts. Persian influence in Indian calligraphy gave rise to a unique and influential blend in Indian calligraphy, although a number of different calligraphic traditions existed in India already, and Indic scripts were fundamentally different from scripts used in Arabic and Persian traditions. The notable achievements of the Mughals included some of their fine manuscripts, which were usually autobiographies and chronicles of the noble class. They were initially written in flowing Persian script, which was one of the main forms of communication during this time, and which showed a multi-directionality and mutuality of influence on Indic calligraphers. From the 16th century onwards Sikhism played a key role in the history of Indian calligraphy. Sikhs have traditionally handwritten their holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, and furnished it with illumination. Sikh calligrapher Pratap Singh Giani (1855‚Äì1920) is known for one of the first definitive translations of Sikh scriptures into English.Ashoka's 6th pillar edict.  Modern Period (16th century-today)  There was a bigger goal to this style of language than just to communicate with one another. There was no one true form of communication before this was created, and calligraphy helped to guide community members to connect in more than one aspect of life, that was not just language. A rich heritage of calligraphy was embraced as this was a time before printing technology was accessible to Indian counties. This brought people closer together as they began to communicate in the same ways. While it may be used as an art form today, it was essential for communication before the 16th century. A Calligraphic design in 150x150px  Features of Indian calligraphy  Religious texts are the most frequent vehicle for calligraphy in India. Monastic Buddhist communities had members trained in calligraphy and shared responsibility for duplicating sacred scriptures. Jaina traders incorporated illustrated manuscripts celebrating Jaina saints. These manuscripts were produced using inexpensive material, like palm leave and birch, with fine calligraphy.

Life His father, L√∂w Schomberg, was a physician in Meyer's birthplace and Meyer (probably L√∂w's eldest son) followed his father's trade, studying classics, then (like his brothers, Salomon, Hertz, and Gerson) medicine, at the University of Giessen. Completing his MD degree in 1710, Meyer had practises in Schweinsberg, Blankenstein, and then Metz, but then moved to London and settled there in 1721. His first employment in London was a salary of ¬£30 a year from the wardens of the Great Synagogue to look after the poor. The Royal College of Physicians admitted him as a licentiate on 19 March 1722 (giving his word and his bond, he was allowed to put off paying the ¬£20 fee for that honour), on 12 January 1726 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and finally in 1730 he was admitted to the freemasons' lodge of the Premier Grand Lodge of England at the Swan and Rummer, Finch Lane (serving as its grand steward in 1734). By 1740 his professional income was said to be 4000 guineas a year, having established a successful practice (Sir William Browne attributed this to his offers of friendship and hospitality to young surgeons). He was, however, greatly envious of his contemporary, Jacob de Castro Sarmento, making a failed attempt to sabotage Sarmento's election to the Royal Society in 1729 by blackening his name, and in 1738 publicly denounced Sarmento's prescription of an opiate to Benjamin Mendes da Costa, one of Schomberg's former patients, in Janneway's Coffee House. Sarmento complained of the latter event to the censors of the Royal College of Physicians, but their fine of ¬£4 against Schomberg for breaching their moral statutes only led Meyer embarking on a feud against the College via his son Isaac. Becoming alienated from London's Jewish community in general and Sarmento and his allies in particular (explained in Schomberg's unpublished 1746 essay, Emunat omen, or ‚ÄòA physician's faith‚Äô, written in classical Hebrew, and involving his conversion to deism), he also got increasingly entangled in one expensive lawsuit after another. He also rejected the Jewish community by ‚Äì after 1742 ‚Äì encouraging his sons to become Anglican Christians if that would aid them in the liberal professions for which he had had them educated. On his death, Meyer was buried in Hackney churchyard. Family Schomberg had at least seven sons and one daughter: *Isaac, physician, with Alexander left all but 3s. of their father's estate in his will *Ralph or Raphael, Isaac's twin, physician and public notary, left 1s. in his father's will *Joel, physician, practising in Metz and Thann. *Moses (1720‚Äì1779), public notary *Solomon (1724‚Äì1774), public notary, left 1s. in his father's will *Rebecca (1719‚Äì1742), died young. *Alexander (1720‚Äì1804), Royal Navy captain, with Isaac left all but 3s. of their father's estate in his will *Henry Schomberg, purchased an army commission, reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel, left 1s. in his father's will References *M.

It usually grows at high altitudes, typically among rocks on mountainsides. Its foliage and wood are highly flammable while its natural habitat is prone to fire. To compensate, the species will coppice from its roots after being burnt down. Description A small Widdringtonia nodiflora specimen in cultivation as an ornamental. Cape Town. It is an evergreen multistemmed shrub or small to rarely medium-sized tree growing to 5‚Äì7 m (rarely to 25 m) tall. The leaves are scale-like, 1.5‚Äì2 mm long and 1-1.5 mm broad on small shoots, up to 10 mm long on strong-growing shoots, and arranged in opposite decussate pairs. The cones are globose, 1‚Äì2 cm long, with four scales. Each tree produces both male and female cones. It is unique in the genus in its ability to coppice, readily re-sprouting from burnt or cut stumps; this enables it to survive wildfires, and is considered a major factor in allowing its abundance relative to the other species in the genus. Its wood is highly flammable - another adaptation for its fire-prone environment. seed cones in clusters around a branch. Distribution It occurs naturally from Table Mountain in the south, to southern Malawi, southern Mozambique, eastern Zimbabwe and throughout eastern and southern South Africa. It is the only widespread species in its genus, and the only one not threatened or endangered. It is closely related to the endangered cypress (\\"Cedar\\") of the Cedarberg mountains. As its name suggests, the Mountain Cypress is usually found at high altitudes on mountainsides, growing among rocks, and in gullies, typically in mountain fynbos and grassland. They normally occur in small groups, like the little forest of them on the mountain above Kirstenbosch. Farjon, A. (2005). Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

Like many others, both before and since, Napoleon found that the ability to confer titles was also a useful tool of patronage which cost the state little treasure. In all, about 2,200 titles were created by Napoleon: * Princes and Dukes: **Princes of the Imperial family ***The Imperial Prince (Napoleon's son, Napoleon II) ***Princes of France (8 close family members) ** sovereign princes (3) ** duchies grand fiefs (20) ** victory princes (4) ** victory dukedoms (10) ** other dukedoms (3) * Counts (251) * Barons (1,516) * Knights (385) Napoleon also established a new knightly order in 1802, the L√©gion d'honneur, which is still in existence today. The Grand Dignitaries of the French Empire ranked, regardless of noble title, immediately behind the Princes of France. Creation Ennoblement started in 1804 with the creation of princely titles for members of Napoleon's family, the House of Bonaparte. Other titles followed: in 1806, ducal titles were created and, in 1808, those of count, baron and knight. Napoleon founded the concept of \\"nobility of Empire\\" by an imperial decree on 1 March 1808. The purpose of this creation was to amalgamate the old nobility and the revolutionary middle-class in one peerage system. This step, which aimed at the introduction of a stable elite, was fully in line with the creation of the Legion of Honour and of life senatorial peerages. A council of the seals and the titles was also created and charged with establishing armorial bearings, and had a monopoly of this new nobility. These creations are to be distinguished from an order such as the Order of the Bath. These titles of nobility did not have any true privileges, with two exceptions: * the right to have armorial bearings; * the lands granted with the title were held in a majorat, transmitted jointly with the title. Hierarchy In Napoleon's nobility, there existed a strict and precise hierarchy of the titles, which granted office to some according to their membership of the imperial family, their rank in the army, or their administrative career in the civil or clerical administrations: * Prince: for members of the imperial family, certain principal leaders of the Empire (Talleyrand was a prince of B√©n√©vent) and some marshals of the Empire * Duke: for the principal dignitaries and marshals of the Empire * Count: for the ministers, senators, archbishops, councilors of State, the president of the corps legislative, some of the generals * Baron: chairmen of the Court of Auditors, bishops, mayors of 37 good cities, bankers, some of the generals * Knight: other functions One could receive a title without exercising one of its enumerated functions. The title of marquis was not used during the First French Empire, and it therefore became very fashionable after the Bourbon Restoration, since it was not perceived to be tainted by the Napoleonic creations. This nobility is essentially a \\"nobility of service\\", to a large extent made up of soldiers (67.9%), some civil servants (22%) and some collaborating members of the Ancien R√©gime. Napoleon's nobility was not abolished after the Bourbon Restoration, but it largely disappeared gradually for natural reasons, due in part to the great number of soldiers who had been promoted and subsequently died during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1975, there were 239 remaining families belonging to the First Empire's nobility. Of those, perhaps about 135 were titled. Only one princely title (Essling, since Sievers is no longer used and Pontecorvo is merged with Prince Murat) and seven ducal titles remain today. Heraldry Joseph Fouch√© (1759-1820) as a Count. The quarter azure in chief dexter charged with a lion's head indicates his positions as a count and a minister Along with a new system of titles of nobility, the First French Empire also introduced a new system of heraldry. Napoleonic heraldry was based on traditional heraldry but was characterised by a stronger sense of hierarchy. It employed a rigid system of additional marks in the shield to indicate official functions and positions. Another notable difference from traditional heraldry was the toques, which replaced coronets. The toques were surmounted by ostrich feathers: dukes had 7, counts had 5, barons had 3, and knights had 1. The number of lambrequins was also regulated: 3, 2, 1 and none respectively. As many grantees were self-made men, and the arms often alluded to their life or specific actions, many new or unusual charges were also introduced. The most characteristic mark of Napoleonic heraldry was the additional marks in the shield to indicate official functions and positions. These came in the form of quarters in various colours, and would be differenced further by marks of the specific rank or function. In this system, the arms of knights had an ordinary gules, charged with the emblem of the Legion of Honour; Barons a quarter gules in chief sinister, charged with marks of the specific rank or function; counts a quarter azure in chief dexter, charged with marks of the specific rank or function; and dukes had a chief gules sem√© of stars argent. The said 'marks of the specific rank or function' as used by Barons and Counts depended on the rank or function held by the individual. Military barons and counts had a sword on their quarter, members of the Conseil d'Etat had a chequy, ministers had a lion's head, prefects had a wall beneath an oak branch, mayors had a wall, landowners had a wheat stalk, judges had a balance, members of Academies had a palm, etc. A decree of 3 March 1810 states: \\"The name, arms and livery shall pass from the father to all sons\\" although the distinctive marks of title could only pass to the son who inherited it. This provision applied only to the bearers of Napoleonic titles. The Napoleonic system of heraldry did not outlast the First French Empire. The Second French Empire (1852‚Äì1870) made no effort to revive it, although the official arms of France were again those of Napoleon I.Fran√ßois R. Velde. Napoleonic Heraldry Titles Princes There were three types of princely titles: * the princes imp√©riaux or imperial princes (members of the imperial family): ** the prince imp√©rial or Crown Prince, Napoleon II (Napoleon's son) ** the princes fran√ßais or French princes: ***Joseph Bonaparte (from 1804), Napoleon's brother, hereditary in the male and female grandchildren line ***Louis Bonaparte (from 1804), Napoleon's brother ***Joachim Murat (from 1804), Napoleon's brother-in-law ***Eug√®ne de Beauharnais (from 1805), Napoleon's adopted son ***√âlisa Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister ***J√©r√¥me Bonaparte (from 1806), Napoleon's younger brother ***St√©phanie de Beauharnais (from 1806), Napoleon's adopted daughter, cousin of his wife ***Joseph Fesch (from 1807), Napoleon's uncle ***Lucien Bonaparte (from 1815), Napoleon's brother * the princes souverains or sovereign princes (who had received a vassal principality of the Empire):Fran√ßois R.

Velde. Napoleonic Titles and Heraldry: Victory Titles **Marshal Davout, Prince d'Eckm√ºhl, 1809 (extinct 1853); also duc d'Auerstaedt (see below) **Marshal Berthier, Prince de Wagram, 1809 (extinct 1918), for the battle of Wagram (see above); also a sovereign title of Prince de Neuch√¢tel; also duc de Valengin (which was not a victory title). **Marshal Mass√©na, Prince d'Essling, 1810; also duc de Rivoli **Marshal Ney, Prince de la Moskowa, 1813 (extinct 1969); also duc d'Elchingen. \\"Bataille de la Moskowa\\" is the French name for the Battle of Borodino. Dukes There were three types of ducal titles: * the duch√©s grands-fiefs or dukes of large fiefs outside the territory of the First French Empire (but with no rights of sovereignty): **General Arrighi de Casanova, Duc de Padoue, 1808 (extinct 1888) **Marshal Bessi√®res, Duc d'Istrie, 1809 (extinct 1856) **Jean-Jacques-R√©gis de Cambac√©r√®s, Duc de Parme, 1808 (extinct 1824) **General Caulaincourt, Duc de Vicenze, 1808 (extinct 1896) **General Clarke, Duc de Feltre, 1809, also Comte d'Hunebourg **General Duroc, Duc de Frioul, 1808 (extinct 1829) **Joseph Fouch√©, Duc d'Otrante, 1808 (extant) **Martin-Michel-Charles Gaudin, Duc de Ga√´te, 1809 (extinct 1841) **Charles-Fran√ßois Lebrun, Duc de Plaisance, 1808 (extinct 1927) **Marshal MacDonald, Duc de Tarente, 1809 (extinct 1912) **Hugues- Bernard Maret, Duc de Bassano, 1809 (extinct 1906) **Marshal Moncey, Duc de Conegliano, 1808 (extinct 1842) **Marshal Mortier, Duc de Tr√©vise, 1808 (extinct 1912) **Jean-Baptiste Nomp√®re de Champagny, Duc de Cadore, (extinct 1893) **Marshal Oudinot, Duc de Reggio, 1810 (extinct 1956) **Claude Ambroise R√©gnier, Duc de Massa, 1809 **General Savary, Duc de Rovigo (extinct 1872) **Marshal Soult, Duc de Dalmatie, 1808 (extinct 1857) **Marshal Victor, Duc de Belluno, 1808 (extinct 1853) * the titres de victoires or victory titles, comparable to the princely titles of the same category: **Marshal Lefebvre, Duc de Dantzig, 28 May 1807 (extinct 1820); Dantzig was then still a city republic, which became part of Prussia after Napoleon's defeat, and is now Gda≈Ñsk in Poland **Marshal Ney, Duc d'Elchingen, 1808 (extinct 1969); also Prince de la Moskowa **General Junot, Duc d'Abrant√®s, 1808 (extinct 1859, but extended in female line in 1869; extinct again 1982) **Marshal Davout, Duc d'Auerstaedt, 1808 (extinct 1853, extended to collaterals); also Prince d'Eckm√ºhl **Marshal Augereau, Duc de Castiglione, 1808 (extinct 1816) **Marshal Lannes, Duc de Montebello, 1808 **Marshal Marmont, Duc de Raguse, 1808 (extinct 1852); present-day Dubrovnik, on the Croatian coast, was conquered as part of Napoleon's own Italian kingdom, soon part of France's imperial enclave the Illyrian province **Marshal Mass√©na, Duc de Rivoli, 1808; also Prince d'Essling **Marshal Kellermann, Duc de Valmy, 1808 (extinct 1868) **Marshal Suchet, Duc d'Albufera, 1813 **General Girard, Duc de Ligny, 1815, not recognized by the Bourbon Restoration * the ordinary titles, which went before the name: **Empress Jos√©phine, Duchesse de Navarre, 1810, ducal title inherited by her grandsons (extinct 1852) **Emmerich Joseph de Dalberg, Duc de Dalberg, 1810 (extinct 1833) **Denis Decr√®s, Duc Decr√©s, 1813 (extinct 1820) For a ducal title to be hereditary, it was necessary for the holder to have at least a 200,000 francs annual income and that the land which generated the income be held in a majorat for the inheritor of the dukedom. These titles were allotted only to Marshals of the Empire and to certain ministers.  Counts  The ordinary title of count (comte) always went in front of the name. It was subject to the same rules as the title of duke but with an income threshold of only 30,000 francs. Senators, Ministers, and Archbishops were all counts. From 1808 until 1814, 388 titles were created. Barons The title of baron was comparable with that of count, except that the income threshold fell to 15,000 francs. The mayors of the large cities and the bishops were all barons. Between 1808 and 1814, 1,090 titles of baron were created. Today, the title of baron of the First French Empire is still claimed by families including d'Allemagne, Ameil, d'Andlau, d'Astorg, Auvray, Caffarelli, Christophe, Daru, Dein, Dubois, Ebl√©, Evain, Fabvier, de Croy, Fain, G√©loes, Gourgaud, Guerrier de Dumast, Hamelin, Hottinguer, Laffitte, Lefebvre, Lepic, M√©quet, Mallet, Marbot family, Martin de Lagarde, Massias, N√©rin, Nicolas, Parmentier, Petiet, Pinoteau, Portalis, Rey, Rippert, Roederer, de Saint- Didier, de Saint-Geni√®s, de Saizieu, Salmon, de Saluce, Seill√®re, Strolz, Testot-Ferry, Thiry, de Villeneuve, Werlein. Knights The title of knight (chevalier) also went in front of the name. There was an obligation to have an income of at least 3,000 francs, and a majorat on the land generating the income was not obligatory. All the knights of the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur received the title of chevalier d'Empire (\\"knight of the Empire\\"), but there had to be three generations of successive knights for the title to become hereditary. Between 1808 and 1814, 1,600 titles of knight were created.

He later served as United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Rwanda (1994‚Äì1996), and wrote the book Shallow Graves of Rwanda on his experiences on what Rwanda went through. Since August 1999, he has intermittently served as the chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board, and also served as the president of Asian Cricket Council in 2016. Early life and background Nawabzada Shaharyar Muhammed Khan was born in the Qasr-e-Sultani Palace (now Saifia College), in the Bhopal State (honoured with 19-gun salute until 1947) in British India. He is the only son and male heir of both Nawab Muhammad Sarwar Ali Khan, the ruler of former princely state of Kurwai and princess Begum Abida Sultan (Suraya Jah, and Nawab Gauhar-i-Taj), herself the Crown Princess and the eldest daughter of last ruling Nawab of Bhopal, Haji-Hafiz Sir Muhammad Nawab Hamidullah Khan, who reigned state of Bhopal after a prolonged era of Begums regime (the queens), and his wife Begum Maimoona Sultan. Khan is descended from the royal family of former princely state of Bhopal where his ancestors had emigrated to during first quarter of the eighteenth century from Afghanistan. His mother was to succeed the titles and privileges associated with the ruling house of Bhopal, but she emigrated to the newly formed Pakistan after the partition of India, therefore her aunt, Sajida Sultan, was succeeded by her father and was recognized by the government of India as Begum of Bhopal in 1961. The Begum of Bhopal, Sultan Jahan, was his grandmother, and her mother and predecessor, Shah Jahan Begum, was his great-grandmother. The cricketer and the 8th Nawab of Pataudi, Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi, is his uncle by marriage (Sajida's husband). Khan is the first cousin of the cricketer and the 9th Nawab of Pataudi, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, and the titular Begum of Bhopal, Saleha Sultan. The actors Saif Ali Khan and Soha Ali Khan, and the cricketer Saad Bin Jung are his nephews and niece. Khan studied at the following institutes: *Daly College, Indore *Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College, Dehradun *University of Cambridge *The Fletcher School‚ÄìTufts University Career, retirement and literary work Khan (right) with David Miliband at LUMS in 2014 He worked for a year with Burmah Shell Oil, and in 1957, joined the Pakistani foreign service. In 1960, he was posted as a Third Secretary in the Pakistani High Commission in London, and was promoted to Second Secretary in the Tunis embassy from 1962 to 1966. In 1976, Shahryar Khan became Pakistan's ambassador to Jordan (1976‚Äì1982) and the United Kingdom (1987‚Äì1990) He also stayed as Pakistan Ambassador to France (1999‚Äì2001) and Chairman, Committee on Foreign Service Reforms, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1997‚Äì1999).\\"The prospects for Pakistan and its neighbourhood\\" The Ditchley Foundation, 5‚Äì7 October 2007 Khan is currently teaching Pakistan's Foreign Relations at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) as part of the Social Sciences faculty. He teaches a course titled \\"Pakistan's Foreign Relations\\" in Fall semester and a senior level course titled \\"Critical Issues in Pakistan's Foreign Relations\\" in Spring semester. At LUMS, he is also the patron of the LUMS Model UN Society (LUMUN). On 1 July 1994, he was appointed United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's Special Representative to Rwanda, succeeding Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh. As U.N. Special Representative, he represented the United Nations during the genocide and subsequent refugee crisis.\\"Massacres, 'mindless violence and carnage' rage in Rwanda\\", UN Chronicle, September 1994 He also remained the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board from 10 December 2003 till he resigned on 7 October 2006. On 16 August 2014 he was again appointed as the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. In 2005 he was made an honorary fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.Corpus Christi College honorary fellows In his retirement, Shaharyar Khan has written a number of books. The Begums of Bhopal is a history of the princely state of Bhopal. The Shallow Graves of Rwanda is an eye-witness account of his two-year stay in a country ravaged by what some might call genocide. Cricket ‚Äì a Bridge of Peace, about India-Pakistan relations, is his third book. His most personal book has been the biography of his mother Princess Abida Sultaan ‚Äì Memoirs of a Rebel Princess, which has been translated into Urdu. In 2013 with his son Ali Khan he wrote Cricket Cauldron: The Turbulent Politics of Sport in Pakistan. He has also co-authored a book titled as \\"Shadows across the playing field; 60 years of India-Pakistan cricket\\" with renowned Indian writer and politician Shashi Tharoor. Chairman Pakistan Cricket Board He has been appointed chairman after he was elected unanimously by the board of governors of Pakistan Cricket Board in the light of new constitution of the PCB 2014 which was approved by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Khan previously served as the PCB chief in 2003, taking over with the board in turmoil. His tenure is remembered more for Pakistan's 2006 forfeit of the Oval test after being penalised for ball tampering. He was once again appointed the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board on 18 August 2014. He served as one of the founders of the Pakistan Super League.As of May 2016, he is still the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. In March 2016, Pakistan was eliminated from the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing 3 matches against India, New Zealand and Australia and only winning against Bangladesh. This caused great controversy over whose 'fault' it was. Khan was amongst those blamed and there were talks about him retiring from PCB after this. However, he later spoke out and said he would not resign. He also said it would be better to bring in a foreign coach, implying that Waqar Younis' coaching contract, which ends in June 2016, will not be renewed. Furthermore, Khan did not release any statements on who he thought was responsible for the loss, but Instead, he said before the match that he will not change Afridi's position because he has been 'serving Pakistan for the last 20 years'. Khan added that changes will happen after the tournament but also noted that the poor performance was from the whole team, except certain individuals. Personal life Khan met Minoo Khan, a student at the Queen's College in London in 1957, and married her in 1958 in Karachi. The couple have three sons and a daughter together. One of his sons, Ali Khan, is married to Mariam Zaman, the daughter of his sister, Kaiser Zaman. See also *Foreign relations of Pakistan  References  External links *Profile of Author Shaharyar M.

The novel focuses on one of the central themes in Madsen's writing - the nature of time. Like most of Madsen's novels it hasn't been published in English. This novel is a typical example of the third phase in Madsen's writing that's like most of his later works is set in the town of Aarhus and has several characters that also appear in his other books (Johanna, Sverre). It also has another typical feature of Madsen's books - a complicated timeline of the novel having chapters describing overlapping periods of time. Plot summary Johanna who is a lector at a Danish university gets involved by her colleague professor Jeyde in a time travel experiment. Jeyde has discovered that he can put the time 23 days back. The background to the invention is that Jeyde perceives the time as split up into small sets, among which time stands calm.Analysis of the third phase of Svend Aage Madsen's works Jeyde compares his theory with films, where every second 24 still pictures are shown. If you happen to cut the time \\"tape\\" the world gets rewound to the previous secure point (which would be 23 days before the moment of the cut). The problem that Jeyde has encountered is that after the time cut neither he nor anybody else can notice that there was a cut because everything that happened between the safe point and the cut is erased from their memories as it never had happened (and theoretically it hasn't happened indeed). He can't even be sure about any event whether it's the first time it's happening or not. To be able to understand the possibilities of his invention better, Jeyde sends Johanna to a psychiatrist who \\"opens up her mind\\" so after a time cut she'd be able to remember the destroyed time. When Johanna gets tired of being repeatedly sent by Jeyde back in time (since Jeyde sends back the entire Universe and not just Johanna he doesn't need Johanna's participation or agreement to send her back) she manages to lock Jeyde up in a psychiatric hospital and wants to leave time travelling behind her, but then she suddenly realises how much freedom it can give her.Plot summary at scifisiden.dk (in Danish) This way Johanna gets the unique chance to outplay different variations of her relationship with Sverre, one of her students, as she can always correct a mistake that she has made. Another bonus she gets is in no need to spend time tidying up at home because she can always come back to a time when everything was still clean. However she quickly discovers that too much knowledge about upcoming events tends to make things more complicated. Her relationship with Sverre cannot recommence from where they left off and she has trouble remembering which events are real and which are fictional in any given situation. Finally she decides that the only solution to let time flow normally is for her to first kill Jeyde and then herself.

He was always referred to by his initials as J.J. Carrick. Carrick served as mayor of Port Arthur in 1908. He represented Port Arthur in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1908 to 1911 and Thunder Bay and Rainy River in the House of Commons of Canada from 1911 to 1917 as a Conservative member. He stepped aside in 1917 for his erstwhile prot√©g√© Donald McDonald Hogarth, but when the Port Arthur Liberal Association refused to accept Hogarth as the Unionist Party candidate, he gave way to Conservative Francis Henry Keefer who won the seat in the 1917 Canadian federal election for the Unionists. He was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, the son of John A. Carrick, and was educated at the University of Toronto. In 1899, he married Mary Jane Day. Carrick came to Port Arthur in 1903 attracted by a real estate boom in anticipation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway locating at the Lakehead. He subsequently acquired and marketed a large number of subdivisions on the fringes of the Port Arthur town plot, the most successful of which was Mariday Park, named after his wife. He launched the Port Arthur Daily News in 1906 to promote his political career and real estate business. He was president of the Great West Coal Company. He secured the rank of honorary lieutenant-colonel from the Canadian Minister of Militia, Sam Hughes during World War I and served as liaison officer to Canadian HQ staff. Carrick relocated to Toronto after the First World War to run a brokerage business. He attempted to regain political office in Port Arthur, but was unsuccessful at the federal elections of October 1925 running as an Independent Conservative and again in 1930 running as a Mackenzie King Liberal. His son Donald Carrick also served in the House of Commons. The community of Carrick, Manitoba was named after him.Place Names of Manitoba, P Ham (1980) His name is also associated with a subdivision in Thunder Bay and has a street named after him there in the Intercity area.

Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East. Centered on the Tigris‚ÄìEuphrates river system in Upper Mesopotamia, the Assyrian people came to rule powerful empires at several times. Making up a substantial part of the \\"cradle of civilization\\", which included Sumer, the Akkadian Empire, and Babylonia, Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements at its peak. At its peak, the Assyrian empire ruled over what the ancient Mesopotamian religion referred to as the \\"four corners of the world\\": as far north as the Caucasus Mountains within the lands of what is today called Armenia and Azerbaijan, as far east as the Zagros Mountains within the territory of present-day Iran, as far south as the Arabian Desert of today's Saudi Arabia, as far west as the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, and even further to the west in Egypt and eastern Libya. ¬ß716. Assyria is named for its original capital, the ancient city of Assur, which dates to c. 2600 BC, originally one of a number of Akkadian city states in Mesopotamia. Assyria was also sometimes known as Subartu and Azuhinum prior to the rise of the city-state of Assur, and during the Sasanian Empire as As≈çristƒÅn.

Royal worshiper before a god on a throne; human-headed bulls below,ca. 1820‚Äì1730 B.C. Old Syrian In the Old Assyrian Empire, Assyria established colonies in Anatolia and the Levant and, under king Ilu-shuma, it asserted itself over southern Mesopotamia (what was later to become Babylonia). The first written inscriptions by urbanized Assyrian kings appear c. 2450 BC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city-states and small Semitic-speaking kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of A≈°≈°ur was traditionally ascribed to king Ushpia who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of Ishbi-Erra of Isin and Naplanum of Larsa. He was reputedly succeeded by kings named Apiashal, Sulili, Kikkia and Akiya (died c. 2026 BC), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in A≈°≈°ur. Between c. 2500 BC and c. 2400 BC, Assyrian kings were pastoral leaders. The main rivals, neighbors or trading partners to early Assyrian kings between c. 2200 BC and c. 2000 BC would have been the Hattians and Hurrians to the north in Anatolia, the Gutian people, Lullubi and Turukkaeans to the east in the Zagros Mountains of the northwest Iranian Plateau, Elam to the southeast in what is now south central Iran, the Amorites to the west in what is today Syria, and their fellow Sumero-Akkadian city- states of southern Mesopotamia such as Isin, Kish, Ur, Eshnunna and Larsa.Georges Roux (1964), Ancient Iraq Around 2400 BC, the Assyrians became subject to Sargon of Akkad, who united all the Sumero-Akkadian-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the Akkadian Empire, which lasted from c. 2334 BC to c. 2154 BC.Georges Roux (1964), Ancient Iraq, pp. 161‚Äì191. At that time, the Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) population.Woods C. 2006 \\"Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian\\". In S. L. Sanders (ed) Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture: 91‚Äì120 Chicago Assyria became a regionally powerful nation in the Old Assyrian Empire from c. 2100 BC to c. 1800 BC. The Amorites had overrun the kingdoms of southern Mesopotamia and the Levant between c. 2100 BC and c. 1900 BC, but had hitherto been successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings during this period. However, Erishum II (c. 1818 BC ‚Äì c. 1809 BC) was to be the last king of the dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, founded c. 2025 BC. In c. 1808 BC he was deposed and the throne of Assyria was usurped by Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1809 BC ‚Äì 1776 BC) in the expansion of Amorite tribes from the Khabur River delta in the north eastern Levant. About 1800 BC, Assyria came into conflict with the newly created city state of Babylon, which eventually eclipsed the far older Sumero- Akkadian states and cities in the south; such as Ur, Isin, Larsa, Kish, Nippur, Eridu, Lagash, Umma, Uruk, Akshak and Adab, incorporating them into a greater Babylonia. Assyria remained untroubled by the emergence of the Hittites and Mitanni, both to the north of Assyria, and by the Kassites who had seized Babylon from its Amorite founders. After securing its borders on all sides, Assyria entered into a quiet and peaceful period in its history which lasted for two and a half centuries. The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in c. 1600 BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic Mitannian- Hurrian domination in c. 1500 BC. The Indo-European-speaking Mitanni are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a language isolate, i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European. Origin of name Map showing the approximate location of the geographical region or heartland referred to as \\"Assyria\\" in what is today referred to as the Middle East. \\"Assyria\\" is named after its first capital city, Assur. The city Assur is itself named after its patron deity, Ashur. Assyria was also sometimes known as \\"Azuhinum\\", prior to the rise of the city-state of Assur, after which it was referred to as \\"A≈°≈°≈´rƒÅyu\\".\\" ‚ÄúAssyria‚Äù can also refer to the geographic region of the Assyrian homeland, roughly equivalent to the territory of the Old Assyrian Empire, and still the homeland of the indigenous Christian Assyrians. Scholars suggest that Subartu may have been an early name for Assyria proper along the Tigris river and further upriver into Upper Mesopotamia, although there are various other theories placing it sometimes a little further out to the north, west, and/or east within the Tigris‚ÄìEuphrates river system. Settlements  Capital cities Assur Layout of Assur throughout the centuries. Assur was the capital city of Assyria c. 2025 BC ‚Äì c. 1754 BC and c. 1681 BC ‚Äì c. 1379 BC. The oldest remains of the city were discovered in the foundations of the Ishtar temple, as well as at the Old Palace. In around 2025 BC, Puzur- Ashur I founded a new dynasty, and his successors such as Ilu-shuma, Erishum I and Sargon I left inscriptions regarding the building of temples to the gods Ashur, Adad and Ishtar in the city. Assur developed rapidly into a center for trade, and trade routes led from the city to Anatolia, where merchants from Assur established trading colonies. These Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor were called karu, and traded mostly with tin and wool. In the city of Assur, the first great temples to the city god Ashur and the weather god Adad were erected. Assur was the capital of the empire of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1754 BC ‚Äì c. 1721 BC). He expanded the city's power and influence beyond the Tigris River valley, creating what some regard as the first Assyrian Empire. In this period, the Great Royal Palace was built, and the temple of Ashur was expanded and enlarged with a ziggurat. This empire came to end when Hammurabi, the Amorite king of Babylon incorporated the city into his short lived empire following the death of Ishme-Dagan I c. 1681 BC, and the next three Assyrian kings were regarded as vassals. A king named Adasi drove the Babylonians and Amorites from Assur and Assyria as a whole c. 1720 BC, however little is known of his successors. Renewed building activity is known a few centuries later, during the reign of a king Puzur-Ashur III, when the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defenses. Temples to the moon god Sin and the sun god Shamash were erected c. 1490 BC. The city was then subjugated by the king of Mitanni, Shaushtatar c. 1450 BC, who removed the gold and silver doors of the temple to his capital, Washukanni, as plunder. Ashur-uballit I overthrew the Mitanni c. 1365 BC, and the Assyrians benefited from this development by taking control of the eastern portion of Mitanni territory, and later also annexing Hittite, Babylonian, Amorite and Hurrian territories. Shubat-Enlil Cylinder seal, ca. 1820‚Äì1730 B.C. Old Syrian Shubat-Enlil was the capital city of Assyria c. 1754 BC ‚Äì c. 1681 BC. Shubat-Enlil was known as Shekhna c. 2000 BC. The conquest of the region by Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1754 BC ‚Äì c. 1721 BC of Assyria revived the abandoned site of Shekhna. He renamed it from Shekhna to Shubat-Enlil, meaning, \\"the residence of the god Enlil\\" in the Akkadian language.Harvey Weiss, Tell Leilan and Shubat Enlil, Mari, Annales de Recherches Interdisciplinaires, vol. 4, pp. 269-92, 1985 In the city a royal palace was built and a temple acropolis to which a straight paved street led from the city gate. There was also a planned residential area and the entire city was enclosed by a wall. The Babylonians were defeated and driven out of Assyria by the Assyrian king Adasi, however Shubat-Enlil was never reoccupied and the Assyrian capital city was transferred to its traditional home in Assur. Among many important discoveries at ≈†ubat-Enlil is an archive of 1,100 cuneiform clay tablets maintained by the rulers of the city. These tablets date to c. 1700 BC and record the dealings with other Mesopotamian states and how the city administration worked.Jesper Eidem, with a contribution by Lauren Ristvet and Harvey Weiss: The Royal Archives from Tell Leilan. Old Babylonian Letters and Treaties from the Lower Town Palace East (PIHANS 117). The Netherlands Institute for the Near East, Leiden, 2011. ≈†ubat-Enlil was abandoned c. 1681 BC. Other cities Nineveh Nineveh was an ancient Assyrian city of Upper Mesopotamia. The historic Nineveh is mentioned during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1754 BC ‚Äì c. 1721 BC) as a centre of worship for the god Ishtar, whose cult was responsible for the city's early importance. The goddess' statue was sent to the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III (c. 1386 BC ‚Äì c. 1349 BC), by orders of the king of the Mitanni. The Assyrian city of Nin√¢ became one of Mitanni's vassals for half a century until c. 1378 BC. Karum Map showing central Anatolia during the kƒÅrum-period. Assyrian merchants had established the karum (Akkadian: kƒÅrum \\"quay, port, commercial district\\", plural kƒÅr≈´, from Sumerian kar \\"fortification (of a harbor), break-water\\") small colonial settlements next to Anatolian cities which paid taxes to the rulers of the cities c. 1960 BC. Among them were: Kanesh, Ankuwa, and ·∏™attu≈°a. There were also smaller trade stations which were called mabart≈´. The number of kar≈´ and mabart≈´ was probably around twenty. Early references to kar≈´ come from the Ebla tablets; in particular, a vizier known as Ebrium concluded the earliest treaty fully known to archaeology, known variously as the, \\"Treaty between Ebla and Assur\\", or the \\"Treaty with Abarsal\\". Currency had not yet been invented, so Assyrian merchants used gold for wholesale trade and silver for retail trade during this time. Gold was considered eight times more valuable than silver. But there was one more metal, amutum, which was even more valuable than gold. Amutum is thought to be the newly discovered iron and was forty times more valuable than silver. The most important Anatolian export was copper, and the Assyrian merchants sold tin and clothing to Anatolia. Karum Kanesh View from lower town to the actual tell. Assyrian merchants established a karum which was called, ‚ÄúKarum Kanesh‚Äù, meaning \\"merchant-colony city of Kanesh\\" in the Assyrian language c. 1974 BC ‚Äì c. 1836 BC. The karum was set aside by local officials for the early Assyrian merchants to use without paying taxes, as long as the goods remained inside the karum. Kanesh appears to have served as \\"the administrative and distribution centre of the entire Assyrian colony network in Anatolia.\\" This important karum was inhabited by soldiers and merchants from Assyria for hundreds of years, who traded local tin and wool for luxury items, foodstuffs and spices, and, woven fabrics from the Assyrian homeland and from Elam. Craftsmen in Kanesh specialized in earthen drinking vessels, in the shapes of animals, that were often used for religious rituals. Kanesh was destroyed by fire c. 1836 BC, which some attribute to the conquest of the city of Assur by the kings of Eshnunna; but Bryce blames it on the raid of Uhna. The inhabitants left most of their possessions behind, which were later to be found by modern archaeologists. The findings have included numerous baked-clay tablets, some of which were enclosed in clay envelopes stamped with cylinder seals. The documents record common activities such as trade between the Assyrian colony and the city state of Assur and between Assyrian merchants and local people. The trade was run by families rather than by the state. The K√ºltepe texts are the oldest documents from Anatolia. Although they are written in Old Assyrian, the Hittite loanwords and names in these texts constitute the oldest record of any language of the Indo-European language family. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use of both cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence. To date, over 20,000 cuneiform tablets have been recovered from the site.E. Bilgic and S Bayram, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri II, Turk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi, 1995, K. R. Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, The destruction of Kane≈° caused by the fire was so total that no wood survived for dendrochronological studies. Kanesh is the result of several superimposed stratigraphic periods. New buildings were constructed on top of the remains of the earlier periods; thus, there is a deep stratigraphy from prehistoric times to the early Hittite period. Kane≈° was rebuilt over the ruins of the old and again became a prosperous trade center c. 1798 BC ‚Äì c. 1740 BC. This trade was under the control of Ishme-Dagan (c. 1721 BC ‚Äì c. 1681 BC), who was put in control of Assur when his father, Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1754 BC ‚Äì c. 1721 BC), conquered Ekallatum and Assur. Kanesh was again destroyed by fire which some attribute Kanesh's second burning to the fall of Assur, to other nearby kings, and eventually to Hammurabi of Babylon (c. 1696 BC ‚Äì c. 1654 BC.) Ankuwa Ankuwa was an ancient Hattian and Hittite settlement in central Anatolia. Along with Hattusa and Katapa, Ankuwa was one of the capital cities from which the Hittite kings reigned. Traveling from Hattusa, the royal entourage would arrive at Imralla on the first night, Hobigassa on the second, and Ankuwa on the third. Ankuwa has been linked to present-day Ankara for etymological reasons, but Hittite sources have been discovered to place the settlement along the southern bend of the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak River. Ali≈üar H√ºy√ºk, which has also been suggested as a location, is an archeological site near the present-day village of Ali≈üar. Ali≈üar H√ºy√ºk was occupied from the Copper Age (c. 5000 BC ‚Äî c. 3300 BC) then well into the Bronze Age (c. 3300 BC ‚Äì c. 1200 BC.) A number of Hittite-era cuneiform tablets written in the Old Assyrian cuneiform script of the Cappadocia-type have been found here. Mention in those tablets of ‚ÄúAnkuwa‚Äù has caused speculation that the archaeological site is the Ankuwa mentioned in other Hittite texts. About twelve kilometers northwest of Ali≈üar H√ºy√ºk is another important archaeological site named √áadƒ±r H√∂y√ºk. Excavators of √áadƒ±r H√∂y√ºk have identified this site tentatively with the Hittite city of Zippalanda.Site History √áadƒ±r H√∂y√ºk Archaeological Project - www.cadirhoyuk.com Evidence of the first known settlement at √áadƒ±r H√∂y√ºk has been radio-carbon dated to the Copper Age (c. 5000 BC ‚Äì c. 3300 BC); nevertheless the occupation may well be even earlier than that, and go back to the New Stone Age (c. 5500 BC.) √áadƒ±r H√∂y√ºk appears to have flourished during both the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2100 BC ‚Äì c. 1550 BC) and Late Bronze Age (c. 1550 BC ‚Äì c. 1200 BC.) The site was excavated from 1927 to 1932 by a team from the Oriental Institute of Chicago; excavation resumed in 1992, led by Ronald Gorny as part of the Ali≈üar Regional Project, though most of the work has been at nearby √áadƒ±r H√∂y√ºk. Hattusa Hattusa was the capital city of the Hittite Empire in the late Bronze Age. Its ruins lie near Boƒüazkale, within the great loop of the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak River. At its peak, the city covered 1.8 km¬≤ and comprised an inner and outer portion, both surrounded by a massive and still visible course of walls erected during the reign of Suppiluliuma I. The inner city covered an area of some 0.8 km¬≤ and was occupied by a citadel with large administrative buildings and temples. The landscape surrounding the city included rich agricultural fields and hill lands for pasture and for woods. Smaller woods are still found outside the city, but in ancient times, they were far more widespread. This meant the inhabitants had an excellent supply of timber when building their houses and other structures. The fields provided the people with a subsistence crop of wheat, barley and lentils. Flax was also harvested, but their primary source for clothing was wool. They also hunted deer in the forest, but this was probably a luxury reserved for the nobility. Domestic animals provided meat. The earliest traces of settlement on the site are from c. 6000 BC. Before 2000 BC, a settlement of the apparently indigenous Hatti people was established on sites that had been occupied even earlier and referred to the site as Hattush. Merchants from Assur in Assyria established a trading post here, setting up in their own separate quarter of the city c. 1900 BC ‚Äì c. 1700 BC. The center of their trade network was located in Karum Kanesh. Business dealings required record-keeping: the trade network from Assur introduced writing to Hattusa, in the form of cuneiform. A carbonized layer apparent in excavations attests to the burning and ruin of the city of Hattusa c. 1700 BC. The responsible party appears to have been king Anitta from Kussara, who took credit for the act and erected an inscribed curse for good measure: Only a generation later, a Hittite-speaking king had chosen the site as his residence and capital. The Hittite language had been gaining speakers at the Hattic language's expense for some time. The Hattic Hattus now became the Hittite Hattusa, and the king took the name of Hattusili I, the \\"one from Hattusa.\\" Modern estimates put the population of the city between forty-thousand and fifty-thousand at the peak; in the early period, the inner city housed a third of that number. The dwelling houses that were built with timber and mud bricks have vanished from the site, leaving only the stone- built walls of temples and palaces. Excavations suggest that Hattusa was gradually abandoned over a period of several decades as the Hittite empire disintegrated. One of the most important discoveries at the site has been the cuneiform royal archives of clay tablets, consisting of official correspondence and contracts, as well as legal codes, procedures for cult ceremony, oracular prophecies and literature of the ancient near east. Although the thirty-thousand or so clay tablets recovered from ·∏™attu≈°a form the main corpus of Hittite literature, archives have since appeared at other centres in Anatolia, such as Tabigga and Sapinuwa. Government Around 2400 BC, Assyrian kings were pastoral leaders and like many nations in Mesopotamian history, Assyria was to a great extent, an oligarchy rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with Assur and the polity had three main centres of power‚Äîan assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an eponym. The ≈°arrum The ruler was not to be referred to with the usual Akkadian term for \\"king\\" (sharrum); that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity: Ashur. The i≈°≈°i‚Äôak A≈°≈°ur The ruler was designated as \\"the steward of Ashur\\" (i≈°≈°i‚Äôak a≈°≈°ur) where the term for ‚Äústeward‚Äù is borrowing from Sumerian ens√≠. Ens√≠ is a Sumerian language title designating the ruler or prince of a city-state. The i≈°≈°i‚Äôak A≈°≈°ur presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. Puzur-Ashur I's successors bore the title i≈°≈°i‚Äôak A≈°≈°ur, vice regent of the city's patron deity Ashur, as well as ensi. The institution of the eponym and the formula i≈°≈°iak A≈°≈°ur lingered as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy. The limmu The limmu was annually elected by lot. Although picked by lot, there was most likely a limited group, such as the men of the most prominent families or perhaps members of the city assembly. The Assyrians used the name of the limmu for that year to designate the year on official documents. The limmu was responsible for the economic administration of the city which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. At the beginning of the reign of an Assyrian king, the limmu, an appointed royal official, would preside over the New Year festival at the capital city. Eponym dating system The eponym dating system was a calendar system for Assyria, for a period of over one thousand years. Every year was associated with the name, an eponym, of the limmu, the individual holding office. The dating system is thought to have originated in the ancient city of Assur, and remained the official dating system in Assyria until the end of the Neo- Assyrian Empire in 605 BC. The names of the limmu who became eponyms were chosen by lot, until c. 1000 BC it became a fixed rotation of officers headed by the king who constituted the limmu. The earliest known attestations of a year eponyms are at Karum Kanesh, and became used in other Assyrian colonies in Anatolia. Its spread was due to Shamshi-Adad I's unification of Upper Mesopotamia (c. 1754 BC ‚Äî c. 1721 BC.) Culture Language A very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerian people and the Akkadian Empire, which included widespread bilingualism c. 2400 BC. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian c. 2400 BC as a sprachbund. The Akkadian language gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia between c. 2400 BC and c. 2000 BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language. In ancient times, Assyrians spoke a dialect of the Akkadian language, an eastern branch of the Semitic languages. The first inscriptions, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period.Georges Roux (1964), Ancient Iraq, p. 188 Writing Cuneiform script or is one of the earliest systems of writingEgyptian hieroglyphs also have a claim, and it is unsettled which system began first. See Visible Language. Inventions of Writing in the Ancient Middle East and Beyond, Oriental Institute Museum Publications, 32, Chicago: University of Chicago, p. 13, distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus. Emerging in Sumer c. 3500 BC, cuneiform writing began as a system of pictograms. Around 3000 BC, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller. The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite languages. The cuneiform script underwent considerable changes over a period of more than two millennia. The image below shows the development of the sign SAG \\"head\\" (Borger nr. 184, U+12295 ).

Such a large find indicates that the city had an extensive commercial quarter, where foreign Assyrian merchants lived and operated. Sent from Itur-ili in Assyria to Ennam-Ashur in Karum Kanesh, this letter concerns the important trade in precious metals. Itur-ili, the senior partner, offers wise words of advice to Ennam-Ashur: \\"This is important; no dishonest man must cheat you! So do not succumb to drink!\\" c. 1850 BC - c. 1700 BC (Old Assyrian) The first documents unequivocally written in Sumerian date to c. 3000 BC at Jemdet Nasr. Originally, pictographs were either drawn on clay tablets in vertical columns with a sharpened reed stylus or incised in stone. This early style lacked the characteristic wedge shape of the strokes. Certain signs to indicate names of gods, countries, cities, vessels, birds, trees, etc., are known as determinatives, and were the Sumerian signs of the terms in question, added as a guide for the reader. Proper names continued to be usually written in purely \\"logographic\\" fashion. The archaic cuneiform script was adopted by the Akkadian Empire from c. 2500 BC, and by 2000 BC had evolved into Old Assyrian cuneiform, with many modifications to Sumerian orthography. The Semitic languages employed equivalents for many signs that were distorted or abbreviated to represent new values because the syllabic nature of the script as refined by the Sumerians was not intuitive to Semitic speakers. At this stage, the former pictograms were reduced to a high level of abstraction, and were composed of only five basic wedge shapes: horizontal, vertical, two diagonals and the Winkelhaken impressed vertically by the tip of the stylus. The signs exemplary of these basic wedges are * A≈† (B001, U+12038) : horizontal; * DI≈† (B748, U+12079) : vertical; * GE23, DI≈† ten√ª (B575, U+12039) : downward diagonal; * GE22 (B647, U+1203A) : upward diagonal; * U (B661, U+1230B) : the Winkelhaken. Except for the Winkelhaken which has no tail, the length of the wedges' tails could vary as required for sign composition. Signs tilted by about 45 degrees are called ten√ª in Akkadian, thus DI≈† is a vertical wedge and DI≈† ten√ª a diagonal one. If a sign is modified with additional wedges, this is called gun√ª or \\"gunification;\\" if signs are crosshatched with additional Winkelhaken, they are called ≈°e≈°ig; if signs are modified by the removal of a wedge or wedges, they are called nutillu. (); the sign () was a Sumerian compound marker, and appears frequently in ligatures enclosing other signs. is itself a ligature of , meaning \\"to pile up; grain-heap\\" (Akkadian '). \\"Typical\\" signs have usually in the range of about five to ten wedges, while complex ligatures can consist of twenty or more (although it is not always clear if a ligature should be considered a single sign or two collated but still distinct signs); the ligature KAxGUR7 consists of 31 strokes. Most later adaptations of Sumerian cuneiform preserved at least some aspects of the Sumerian script. Written Akkadian included phonetic symbols from the Sumerian syllabary, together with logograms that were read as whole words. Many signs in the script were polyvalent, having both a syllabic and logographic meaning. The complexity of the system bears a resemblance to Old Japanese, written in a Chinese-derived script, where some of these Sinograms were used as logograms, and others as phonetic characters. This \\"mixed\\" method of writing continued throughout the Old Assyrian Period, although there were periods when \\"purism\\" was in fashion and there was a more marked tendency to spell out the words laboriously, in preference to using signs with a phonetic complement. Hittite cuneiform is an adaptation of the Old Assyrian cuneiform of c. 1800 BC to the Hittite language. When the cuneiform script was adapted to writing Hittite, a layer of Akkadian logographic spellings was added to the script, thus the pronunciations of many Hittite words which were conventionally written by logograms are now unknown. The complexity of the system prompted the development of a number of simplified versions of the script. Old Persian cuneiform was written as a semi-alphabetic syllabary, using far fewer wedge strokes than Assyrian used, together with a handful of logograms for frequently occurring words like \\"god\\" and \\"king.\\" Religion The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed the ancient Mesopotamian religion, with the national god Assur having pride of place at the head of the Old Assyrian Empire. Other major gods within the pantheon of the Old Assyrian Empire were: Ishtar, Adad, Sin, Ninurta, Nergal, and Ninlil. Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by Sumero- Akkadian styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colorful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of the Akkadian language, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavor. Deities =Ashur= Ashur was the head of the Assyrian pantheon in Mesopotamian religion, worshipped mainly in Upper Mesopotamia which constituted old Assyria. Ashur was a deified form of the city of Assur, which dates from c. 2600 BC and was the capital city of the Old Assyrian Empire.Karel van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst, Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible, pp. 108‚Äì9 During the various periods of Assyrian conquest, such as the Upper Mesopotamian Empire of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1754 BC ‚Äì c. 1721 BC) Assyrian imperial propaganda proclaimed the supremacy of Ashur and declared that the conquered peoples had been abandoned by their gods. Ashur did not originally have a family, but as the cult came under the influence of Lower Mesopotamia, he came to be regarded as the Assyrian equivalent of Enlil, the chief god of Nippur, which was the most important god of Lower Mesopotamia's pantheon from c. 2990 BC until Hammurabi of Babylon (c. 1696 BC ‚Äì c. 1654 BC) founded the Paleo-Babylonian Empire, after which Marduk replaced Enlil as the chief god Lower Mesopotamia. In Upper Mesopotamia, Ashur absorbed Enlil's wife Ninlil and his sons Ninurta and Zababa‚Äîthis process began c. 1390 BC. The symbols of Ashur include: 1\\\\. A winged disc with horns, enclosing four circles revolving round a middle circle; rippling rays fall down from either side of the disc. 2\\\\. A circle or wheel, suspended from wings, and enclosing a warrior drawing his bow to discharge an arrow. 3\\\\. The same circle; the warrior's bow; however, is carried in his left hand, while the right hand is uplifted as if to bless his worshippers. An Assyrian standard, which probably represented the world column, has the disc mounted on a bull's head with horns. The upper part of the disc is occupied by a warrior, whose head, part of his bow, and the point of his arrow protrude from the circle. The rippling water rays are V-shaped, and two bulls, treading river-like rays, occupy the divisions thus formed. There are also two heads‚Äîa lion's and a man's‚Äîwith gaping mouths, which may symbolize tempests, the destroying power of the sun, or the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Jastrow regards the winged disc as \\"the purer and more genuine symbol of Ashur as a solar deity.‚Äù He calls it, ‚Äúa sun disc with protruding rays,\\" and says, \\"to this symbol the warrior with the bow and arrow was added‚Äîa despiritualization that reflects the martial spirit of the Assyrian empire.\\"Donald A. Mackenzie Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (1915), chapter 15: \\"Ashur the National God of Assyria\\" =Adad= Adad was the weather god in ancient Mesopotamian religion. In some texts Adad is sometimes son of the moon god Sin by Ningal and brother of Shamash and Ishtar. He is also occasionally son of Enlil. Adad's consort was Shala, a goddess of grain, who is also sometimes associated with the god Dagana. Adad's special animal is the bull. Adad presents two aspects in the hymns, incantations, and votive inscriptions. On the one hand he is the god who, through bringing on the rain in due season, causes the land to become fertile, and, on the other hand, the storms that he sends out bring havoc and destruction. He is pictured on monuments and cylinder seals (sometimes with a horned helmet) with the lightning and the thunderbolt (sometimes in the form of a spear), and in the hymns the sombre aspects of the god on the whole predominate. His association with the sun-god, Shamash, due to the natural combination of the two deities who alternate in the control of nature, leads to imbuing him with some of the traits belonging to a solar deity. Shamash and Adad became in combination the gods of oracles and of divination in general. History Dynasty of Puzur- Ashur I Puzur-Ashur I (c. 2025 BC) is speculated to have overthrown Kikkia and founded an Assyrian dynasty which was to survive for eight generations (or 216 years) until Erishum II was overthrown by the Amorite Shamshi-Adad I. Puzur-Ashur I's descendants left with inscriptions mentioning him regarding the building of temples to gods such as Ashur, Adad and Ishtar in Assyria. The length of Puzur-Ashur I's reign is unknown. Puzur-Ar I's clearly Assyrian name (meaning \\"servant of Ashur\\") distinguishes him from his three immediate predecessors on the Assyrian King List, who possibly bore non-Semitic names, and from the earlier, Amorite-named \\"Kings who are ancestors\\" (also translatable as \\"Kings whose fathers are known\\"), often interpreted as a list of Shamshi-Adad's ancestors. Hildegard Levy, writing in the Cambridge Ancient History, rejects this interpretation and sees Puzur-Ashur I as part of a longer dynasty started by one of his predecessors, Sulili. Inscriptions link Puzur-Ashur I to his immediate successors, who, according to the Assyrian King List, are related to the following kings down to Erishum II. Shalim-ahum (c. 2025 BC ‚Äì c. 1995 BC), son and successor of Puzur-Ashur I, is the earliest independent ruler to be attested in a contemporary inscription. Carved in curious archaic character mirror-writing in old Assyrian on an alabaster block found during the German excavations at Assur under Walter Andrae, this sole exemplar of his contemporary inscriptions records that the god Ashur ‚Äúrequested of him‚Äù the construction of a temple and that he had ‚Äúbeer vats and storage area‚Äù built in the ‚Äútemple area.‚Äù He ruled during a period when nascent Assyrian merchant companies were branching out into Anatolia to trade textiles and tin from Assur for silver. Shalim-ahum and his successors bore the title i≈°≈°i‚Äôak a≈°≈°ur, vice regent of Assur, as well as ens√≠. Ilu-shuma, inscribed DINGIR-≈°um-maKhorsabad copy of the Assyrian King List i 24, 26. (c. 1945 BC ‚Äì c. 1906 BC), son and successor of Shalim-ahum, and is known from his inscription (extant in several copies) where he claims to have \\"washed the copper\\" and \\"established liberty\\" for the Akkadians in the Sumerian city- states Ur, Nippur, and Der. This has been taken by some scholars to imply that he made military campaigns into Southern Mesopotamia to relieve his fellow Mesopotamians from Amorite and Elamite invasions. However, the historian M. Trolle Larsen has suggested that this represented an attempt to lure traders from the south of Assur with tax privileges and exemptions, to monopolize the exchange of copper from the gulf for tin from the east. The cities cited therefore are the three major caravan routes the commodities would have traveled rather than campaign routes for the king. His construction activities included building the old temple of Ishtar, a city wall, subdivision of the city into house plots and diversion of the flow of two springs to the city gates, ‚ÄúAushum‚Äù and ‚ÄúWertum‚Äù. Erishum I (inscribed me-ri-≈°u, or mAPIN-√¨≈° in later texts but always with an initial i in his own seal, inscriptions, and those of his immediate successors, ‚Äúhe has desired,‚Äù) (c. 1906 BC ‚Äì c. 1876 BC), son and successor of Ilu-shuma, vigorously expanded Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his long reign. It was during his reign that karums were established along trade routes into Anatolia in the lower city of Kanesh, Amkuwa, Hattusa, and eighteen other locations yet to be identified, some designated warbatums, satellites of and subordinate to the karums. The markets traded tin, textiles, lapis lazuli, iron, antimony, copper, bronze, wool, and grain. His numerous contemporary inscriptions commemorate his building of the temple for Assur, called ‚ÄúWild Bull,‚Äù with its courtyard. Erishum I's other civic constructions included the temples of Ishtar and that of Adad. Ikunum (c. 1876 BC ‚Äì c. 1861 BC), son and successor of Ilu-shuma, built a major temple for the god Ningal. He further strengthened the fortifications of the city of Assur and maintained Assyria's colonies in Asia Minor. The following are the sixteen annual limmu officials from the year of accession of Ikunum to his death:Cahit G√ºnbattƒ±, An Eponym List (KEL G) from K√ºltepe Altoriental. Forsch. 35 (2008) 1, 103-132. Buzi son of Adad-rabi (c. 1876), Shuli son of Shalmah (c. 1875), Iddin-Suen son of Shalmah (c. 1874), Ikunum son of Shudaya (c. 1873), Dan-Wer son of Ahu-ahi (c. 1872), Shu-Anum from Nerabtim (c. 1871), Il-massu son of Ashur-tab (c. 1870), Shu-Hubur son of Shuli (c. 1869), Idua son of Shulili (c. 1868), Laqip son of Puzur-Laba (c. 1867), Shu-Anum the hapirum (c. 1866), Uku son of Bila (c. 1865), Ashur-malik son of Panaka (c. 1864), Dan-Ashur son of Puzur-Wer (c. 1863), Shu-Kubum son of Ahu-ahi (c. 1862), Irishum son of Iddin-Ashur (c. 1861). Sargon I or ≈†arru-kƒ´n I (c. 1861 BC ‚Äì c. 1822 BC), son and successor of Ikunum, reigned as king of the Old Assyrian Empire. Sargon I might have been named after Sargon of Akkad. The name ‚ÄúSargon‚Äù means ‚Äúthe king is legitimate‚Äù in Akkadian. Sargon I is known for his work refortifying Assur. Very little is known about this king. Puzur- Ashur II (c. 1822 BC ‚Äì c. 1814 BC), son and successor of Sargon I, was king of the Old Assyrian Empire for eight years. Due to his father's long reign he came to the throne at a late age since one of his sons, named Ili-bani, was a witness in a contract (and so already a grown man) eleven years before Puzur- Ashur II became ruler. Naram-Sin or NarƒÅm‚ÄìSuen, inscribed in cuneiform on contemporary seal impressions as dna-ra-am-dEN.ZU, was the ens√≠ or waklum of A≈°≈°ur (da-≈°√πr), listed as the thirty-seventh king of Assyria on the later Assyrian King Lists, where he is inscribed mna-ram-dEN.ZU,SDAS List, IM 60484, i 34.Nassouhi List, Istanbul A. 116 (Assur 8836), i 33.Khorsabad List, IM 60017 (excavation nos.: DS 828, DS 32-54), i 34. or a fragmentary list where he appears as -d30.Assyrian Kinglist fragment VAT 9812 = KAV 14: ‚Äò3 (c. 1814 BC ‚Äì c. 1760 BC), son and successor of Puzur-Ashur II, was named for the illustrious Naram-Sin of Akkad and, like his grandfather, Sargon I, took the divine determinative in his name. He should not be confused with the Naram-Sin who ruled Eshnunna for around twelve years, the successor and son, as identified on an inscription, of the long-reigning Ebiq-Adad II. The city- state of Assur which he had inherited would have been fairly wealthy as the hub of the trading network at the height of the Old Assyrian Empire's activity and, despite the destruction of the trading post at Kanesh partway through his reign, commerce apparently continued elsewhere. The Assyrian King List records that Shamshi-Adad I, ‚Äúwent away to Babylonia in the time of NarƒÅm-S√Æn.‚Äù Shamshi-Adad I was not to return until taking Ekallatum, pausing three years and then overthrowing Erishum II (c. 1760 BC ‚Äì c. 1754 BC), son and successor of Naram-Sin.

Upper Mesopotamian Empire Map showing the approximate extent of the Upper Mesopotamian Empire at the death of Shamshi-Adad I c. 1721 BC. Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1754 BC ‚Äì c. 1721 BC), son of Ila-kabkabu, inherited the throne in Ekallatum from his father c. 1785 BC. Shamshi-Adad I was forced to flee to Babylon while Naram-Suen of Eshnunna attacked Ekallatum c. 1761 BC. Shamshi-Adad I conquered Assur, took over the long-abandoned town of Shekhna in north-eastern Syria,Leilan.yale.edu, Harvey Weiss et al., The genesis and collapse of Third Millennium north Mesopotamian Civilization, Science, vol. 291, pp. 995-1088, 1993 converted it into the capital city of his Upper Mesopotamian Empire, renamed it to Shubat-Enlil, and emerged as the first Amorite king of Assyria c. 1754 BC. Shamshi-Adad I placed his sons in key geographical locations and gave them responsibility to look over those areas. While he remained in ≈†ubat-Enlil, his eldest son, Ishme- Dagan I was put on the throne of Ekallatum. A main target for expansion was the city Mari, which controlled the caravan route between Anatolia and Mesopotamia. The king of Mari, Iakhdunlim, was assassinated by his own servants, possibly on Shamshi-Adad I's orders. Shamshi-Adad I seized the opportunity and occupied Mari c. 1741 BC. Shamshi-Adad I put his second son, Yasmah-Adad on the throne in Mari, and then returned to Shubat-Enlil. With the annexation of Mari, Shamshi-Adad was in control of a large empire,Some of the Mari letters addressed to Shamshi-Adad I by his son can be found in the Mari Letters section of controlling the whole of Upper Mesopotamia. While Ishme- Dagan I probably was a competent ruler, his brother Yasmah-Adad appears to have been a man of weak character; something the disappointed father was not above mentioning. Shamshi-Adad I clearly kept a firm control on the actions of his sons, as shown in his many letters to them. At one point he arranged a political marriage between Yasmah-Adad to Beltum, the princess of his ally in Qatna. Yasmah-Adad already had a leading wife and put Beltum in a secondary position of power. Shamshi-Adad I did not approve and forced his son to keep Beltum in the palace in a leading position. Dadusha, a king of the neighbouring state Eshnunna, made an alliance with Shamshi-Adad I in order to conquer the area between the two Zab rivers c. 1727 BC. This military campaign of joint forces was commemorated on a victory stele which states that Dadusha gives the lands to Shmshi-Adad I. Shamshi-Adad I later turned against Dadusha by attacking cities including Shaduppum and Nerebtum. After the death of Shamshi-Adad I, Eshnunna captured cities around Assur. Shamsi-Adad I's rise to glory was envied by neighbouring kings and tribes, and throughout his reign, he and his sons faced several threats to their control. Ishme-Dagan I (c. 1721 BC ‚Äì c. 1681 BC), son and successor of Shamshi-Adad I, held the capital city of his realm of influence in Ekallatum and ruled over the southeastern region of Upper Mesopotamia, including the city-state Assur. Ishme-Dagan I's main challenge was in keeping his enemies in check; to his east were the foothills of the Zagros Mountains, inhabited by warlike pastoral peoples, and to the south was the Mesopotamian kingdom of Eshnunna. Although his father counted Ishme-Dagan I as politically astute and a capable soldier, commending him as he berated Yasmah-Adad in their letters, Ishme-Dagan I was not able to hold his father's empire for long after his father died. Ishme-Dagan I eventually lost most of his domain, and was reduced to holding Assur and Ekallatum, despite waging several counter offensives to try to regain the upper Khabur area. First Dynasty of Babylon Map of the Ancient Near East showing the city-state Assur within the territory of the First Dynasty of Babylon during the reign of King Hammurabi's son and successor, Samsu-iluna (light green) c. 1654 BC. Mut-Ashkur (c. 1681 BC ‚Äì c. 1671 BC), son and successor of Ishme- Dagan I, was arranged by his father to marry the daughter of the Hurrian king Zaziya.Who's who in the ancient Near East By Gwendolyn Leick Hammurabi of Babylon (c. 1696 BC ‚Äî c. 1654 BC), after first conquering Mari, Larsa, and Eshnunna, eventually prevailed over Mut-Ashkur. With Hammurabi, the various kƒÅrum colonies in Anatolia ceased trade activity‚Äîprobably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians. The Assyrian monarchy survived; however, the three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan I (including Mut-Ashkur) were vassals and dependent on the Babylonians during the reign of Hammurabi. Rimush, inscribed mri-mu-u[≈°] on the only variant king list on which he appears,Assyrian Kinglist fragment VAT 9812 = KAV 14: 5. (c. 1671 BC ‚Äì c. 1665 BC), a successor to and probably a descendant of I≈°me-DagƒÅn I, would appear to be named for the second king of the Akkadian Empire Rimush of Akkad (c. 2214 BC ‚Äì c. 2206 BC). This perhaps reflects the extent to which Shamshi- Adad and his successors identified with the prestigious Dynasty of Akkad, although the earlier Rimush was apparently assassinated by his own courtiers, ‚Äúwith their seals‚Äù, according to a liver-omen of the monumental BƒÅr√ªtu series, a somewhat ignominious end. The events resulting in the demise of the dynasty are witnessed in only one inscription, that of Puzur-Sin, who boasted of overthrowing the son of Asinum, descendant of Shamshi-Adad I, whose name has not been preserved. This may have been Rimush, or if Asinum followed him, perhaps his grandson. The result was apparently turmoil as a rapid succession of seven usurpers took power, each reigning briefly before being overthrown. Asinum (c. 1665 BC), possibly successor or descendant to either Rimush or Mut- Ashkur, was an Amorite king driven out by the Assyrian vice-regent Puzur-Sin; not included in the standard King List; however, attested in Puzur-Sin's inscription. Asinum is believed to had been a descendant of Shamshi-Adad who had founded the brief, foreign Amorite dynasty apparently greatly resented by the locals judging by an alabaster slab inscription left by Puzur-Sin. Puzur- Sin is believed to had been an otherwise unattested Assyrian monarch. Puzur- Sin deposed Asinum to allow for the Assyrian king Ashur-dugul to seize the throne. A period of civil war followed this event which ended Babylonian and Amorite influence in Assyria c. 1665 BC. Ashur-dugul, inscribed ma≈°-≈°ur-du- gul, ‚ÄúLook to (the god) Ashur!‚Äù, (c. 1665 BC ‚Äì c. 1659 BC), apparently, ‚Äúson of a nobody‚Äù, seized the throne from the three unpopular Amorite vassals. The Assyrian King List says of Ashur-dugul that he was a ‚Äúson of a nobody, without right to the throne‚Äù meaning that he was not of royal descent and consequently unqualified to govern according to the patrilineal principle of legitimacy relied upon by later monarchs. During Ashur-dugul's reign six other kings, ‚Äúsons of nobodies also ruled at the time‚Äù. This may suggest a fragmentation in the small Assyrian kingdom, with rival claims to the throne. Ashur-dugul was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, Ashur-apla-idi. Adasi (c. 1659 BC‚Äîc. 1640 BC), ‚Äúson of a nobody‚Äù, was the last of the six kings who ruled during the reign of Ashur-dugul. He managed to quell the civil unrest and stabilize the situation in Assyria. During his reign, he completely drove the Babylonians and Amorites from the Assyrian sphere of influence. Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole to the Sealand Dynasty. The Adaside dynasty of Assyria was named after Adasi. Adaside Dynasty The short-lived Babylonian Empire quickly began to unravel upon the death of Hammurabi, and Babylonia lost control over Assyria during the reign of Hammurabi's successor Samsu-iluna (1750‚Äì1712 BC). A period of civil war ensued after Asinum (a grandson of Shamshi-Adad I and the last Amorite ruler of Assyria) was deposed in approximately 1732 BC by a powerful native Assyrian vice regent named Puzur-Sin, who regarded Asinum as both a foreigner and a former lackey of Babylon. A native king named Ashur- dugul seized the throne in 1732 BC, probably with the help of Puzur-Sin. However, he was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, Ashur-apla-idi. Internal instability ensued with four further kings (Nasir-Sin, Sin-namir, Ipqi-Ishtar and Adad-salulu) all reigning in quick succession over a period of approximately six years between 1732 and 1727 BC. Babylonia seems to have been too powerless to intervene or take advantage of this situation. Finally, a king named Adasi (1726‚Äì1701 BC) came to the fore c. 1726 BC and managed to quell the civil unrest and stabilize the situation in Assyria. Adasi completely drove the Babylonians and Amorites from the Assyrian sphere of influence during his reign, and Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole, also losing the far south of Mesopotamia (an area roughly corresponding to ancient Sumer) to the native Akkadian-speaking Sealand Dynasty, although the Amorites would retain control over a much reduced and weak Babylonia itself until 1595 BC, when they were overthrown by the Kassites, a people from the Zagros Mountains who spoke a language isolate and were neither Semites nor Indo-Europeans. Adasi was an Assyrian king, the last in a line of seven kings designated by the Assyrian King List as usurpers of the Assyrian throne, who reigned from 1718‚Äì1699 BC after the ejection of the Amorite ruled Babylonians from Assyria. He is credited in the Assyrian King List with stabilising Assyria and freeing it from civil war and Amorite influence.Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq The Adaside dynasty of Assyria was named after him. He was succeeded by Bel-bani. Adasi was succeeded by Bel-bani (1700‚Äì1691 BC) who is credited in Assyrian annals with inflicting further defeats on the Babylonians and Amorites, and further strengthening and stabilising the kingdom. Bel-bani, inscribed mdEN-ba-ni, ‚Äúthe Lord is the creator‚Äù, (c. 1640 BC ‚Äì c. 1630 BC), son and successor of Adasi,) and was the first ruler of what was later to be called the dynasty of the Adasides. His reign marks the inauguration of a new historical phase following the turmoil of the competing claims of the seven usurpers who preceded him. He was the 48th king to appear on the Assyrian King List and reigned for ten years. Libaya (c. 1630 BC ‚Äì c. 1613 BC), successor and possibly either son or brother of Bel-bani, ruled over a relatively peaceful, secure, and stable Assyria existing undisturbed by its neighbours such as the Hattians, Hittites, Hurrians, Amorites, Babylonians, Elamites, and Mitanni. He succeeded Bel-bani in the Adaside Dynasty which came to the fore after the ejection of the Babylonians and Amorites from Assyria.K. R. Veenhof (2008). Mesopotamia: The Old Assyrian Period. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. p.24. Little is currently known of many of the kings that followed such as Sharma-Adad I (c. 1613 BC ‚Äì c. 1602 BC), Iptar-Sin (c. 1602 BC ‚Äì c. 1590 BC), Bazaya (c. 1590 BC ‚Äì c. 1562 BC), Lullaya (c. 1562 BC ‚Äì c. 1556 BC), Shu-Ninua (c. 1556 BC ‚Äì c. 1542 BC), and Sharma-Adad II (c. 1542 BC ‚Äì c. 1539 BC.) Iptar-Sin, inscribed IB.TAR.S√Æn mIB.TAR-d30. (reading uncertain), (c. 1602 BC ‚Äì c. 1590 BC) may have been a brother of both his predecessors Libaya and Bel-bani and was the 51st Assyrian king according to the Assyrian King List.·∏™orsƒÅbƒÅd King List ii 18. He reigned for 12 years some time during the 17th century BC. Bazaya (c. 1590 BC ‚Äì c. 1562 BC), son of either Iptar-Sin or Belu-bani, was the fifty- second king listed on the Assyrian King List. He reigned for twenty-eight years and has left no known inscriptions. Lullaya (c. 1562 BC ‚Äì c. 1556 BC), ‚Äúson of nobody,‚Äù was the fifty-third king of Assyria to be added to the Assyrian King List. He was a \\"son of a nobody\\", i.e., unrelated to a previous monarch, and reigned 6 years, from c. 1633 BC ‚Äì c. 1627 BC, during a period when a rather diminished Assyria was overshadowed by its more powerful neighbor, the Mitanni. Reade speculates that he may be identified with the earlier king, Ashur-dugul, on the basis of their similar lengths of reign and lack of royal parentage. Shu-Ninua (c. 1556 BC ‚Äì c. 1542 BC), son of Bazaya, succeeded the presumed usurper, Lullaya. There are no contemporary inscriptions of his reign. He is recorded as having been a contemporary of Akurduana of the Second Dynasty of Babylon in the Synchronistic King List, rather than any supposed ruler from the Third Dynasty of Babylon. The Assyrian King List records that he reigned for fourteen years before being succeeded by his sons. His sons were Sharma-Adad II and Erishum III. Shamshi-Adad II (c. 1529 BC ‚Äì c. 1526 BC), son and successor of Shu-Ninua (c. 1542 BC ‚Äì c. 1529 BC), is implausibly stated by the Synchronistic King List to have had eight different contemporary Kassite rulers. Ashur-nirari I (1547‚Äì1522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded Mitanni Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom. Ishme-Dagan II (c. 1526 BC ‚Äì c. 1510 BC), son and successor of Shamshi-Adad II, was a rather obscure ruler of Assyria in the midst of a Dark Age. He is only known from the Assyrian King List. The relationship with his successor is uncertain as the copies describe Shamshi-Adad III's father as Ishme-Dagan II, the brother of Sharma-Adad II, who was in turn the son of Shu-Ninua. This Ishme-Dagan, however, has his filiation clearly given as son of Shamshi-Adad II. This led Yamada to suggest that Shamshi-Adad III's father was a different homonymous individual from a collateral line of descent from Shu-Ninua. Ashur-nirari I (c. 1510 BC ‚Äì c. 1484 BC), son and successor of Ishme-Dagan II, The Synchronistic King List gives his Babylonian contemporary as Kashtiliashu III. Evidence of his construction activities survives, with four short inscriptions commemorating work building the temple of Bel-ibrƒ´ia on bricks recovered from an old ravine, restoring the Abaru forecourt and rebuilding the Sin-Shamash temple. He ruled in a peaceful and uneventful period of Assyrian history between the overthrow of the Babylonians and Amorites by Puzur-Sin c. 1732 BC and the rise of the Mitanni in c. 1450 BC. Puzur-Ashur III (c. 1484 BC ‚Äì c. 1460 BC), son and successor of Ashur-narari I, is the first Assyrian king to appear in the synchronistic history, where he is described as a contemporary of Burnaburiash of Babylon. He undertook much rebuilding work in Assur, the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defenses. Temples to the moon god Sin (Nanna) and the sun god Shamash were erected during his reign. He signed a treaty with Burna-Buriash I the Kassite king of Babylon, defining the borders of the two nations in the late 16th century BC. He was succeeded by Enlil-nasir I (1497‚Äì1483 BC) who appears to have had a peaceful and uneventful reign, as does his successor Nur-ili (1482‚Äì1471 BC). Enlil-nasir I (c. 1484 BC ‚Äì c. 1460 BC), son and successor of Puzur-Ashur III, is mentioned in the Synchronistic King List, but the name of the Babylonian counterpart is illegible. His name is present on two clay cones from Assur. Nur-ili (c. 1460 BC ‚Äì c. 1448 BC), son and successor of Enlil- nasir I, was the king of Assyria. Ashur-shaduni (c. 1448 BC), son and successor of Nur-ili, was the ruler of Assyria for just \\"one complete month\\". There remains uncertainty concerning the dating of his accession, as the two subsequent Assyrian kings have unknown reign lengths, effectively disconnecting him and his predecessors from the firmer chronology of the later Assyrian King List. Although there are no extant contemporary inscriptions for him or his immediate predecessor or successors, his name appears on two of the Assyrian King Lists and faintly at the end of the first column of the Synchronistic King List, level with where one of the successors' to Kassite Babylonian king Kashtiliashu III might be supposed to appear. The King Lists describe his overthrow: \\"from the throne, he deposed, the throne he seized\\". Ashur-rabi I (c. 1448 BC ‚Äì c. 1430 BC), son of Enlil-nasir I, seized the throne after a coup against Assur-shadduni. Assyria remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked and its Amorite rulers deposed by the Hittite Empire, and subsequently fell to the Kassites in 1595 BC, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, Agum II, and Erishum III (1598‚Äì1586 BC) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers. Mitanni Map of the Ancient Near East showing the city- state Assur within the territory of the Mitanni at their maximum extent. The Mitanni heartland (dark purple) and the approximate maximal extension of the Mitanni dominion (light purple) c. 1430 BC. The emergence of the Mitanni c. 1500 BC eventually led to a short period of sporadic Mitanni domination c. 1450 BC. The Indo-European-language-family-speaking Mitanni are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians in eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians had spoken a language isolate, one neither of the Afroasiatic language family nor the Indo-European language family. There are dozens of Mesopotamian cuneiform texts from this period, with precise observations of solar and lunar eclipses, that have been used as \\"anchors\\" in the various attempts to define the chronology of Babylonia and Assyria between c. 2000 BC ‚Äì c. 1300 BC.) Ashur-nadin-ahhe I (c. 1430 BC ‚Äì c. 1415 BC), son and successor of Ashur-rabi I, was courted by the Egyptian Empire, which was a rival of the Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the Ancient Near East. Amenhotep II sent the Assyrian king a tribute of gold to seal an alliance against the Mitanni. It is likely that this alliance prompted Saushtatar, the ruler of the Mitanni, to invade Assyria, and sack its capital city, after which Assyria had become a vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being forced to pay tribute to Shaushtatar. After a fifteen-year-long rule, Ashur-nadin-ahhe I was overthrown by his brother Enlil-Nasir II (c. 1415 BC ‚Äì c. 1409 BC). Ashur-nirari II, inscribed ma≈°-≈°ur-ERIM.GABA (=D√Å·∏™), \\"Ashur is my help,\\" (c. 1409 BC ‚Äì c. 1402 BC), son and successor of Enlil-nasir II, ruled over Assyria in a time when it was still recovering from the sack of Assur by the Mitanni ruler Shaushtatar. According to the Khorsabad Kings List,Khorsabad Kinglist, tablet IM 60017 (excavation nos.: DS 828, DS 32-54), iii 3. Ashur- nerari II reigned for seven years, the corresponding columns on the Nassouhi Kings List and SDAS Kings List are damaged at this point. A legal textKAJ 174. from Assur is dated to the, ‚Äúeponym of Ber-nadin-ahhe, son of Ashur-nerari II, supreme judge‚Äù, and another gives the witness, ‚ÄúShamash-kidinnu, son of Ibashi-ilu, son of Ber-nadin-hhe, supreme judge‚Äù. Ashur-nerari II had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni. The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitanni influence appears to had been sporadic. They appear not to have been always willing or indeed able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs. Ashur-bel-nisheshu, inscribed mda≈°-≈°ur-EN-UN.ME≈†--≈°√∫,Nassouhi King List, Istanbul A. 116 (Assur 8836), iii 11‚Äì12.Khorsabad King List, IM 60017 (excavation nos.: DS 828, DS 32-54), iii 5‚Äì6.SDAS King List, tablet IM 60484, ii 38. and meaning ‚ÄúAshur is lord of his people,‚Äù (c. 1402 BC ‚Äì c. 1394 BC) also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Assur itself. Assyria appears to had redeveloped its former highly sophisticated financial and economic systems during his reign, and to have been independent of Mitanni influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with Karaindash, the Kassite king of Babylonia c. 1400 BC. Ashur-bel-nisheshu succeeded his father, Ashur-nerari II, to the throne. As was the practice during this period of the Assyrian monarchy, he modestly titled himself, ‚Äúvice-regent‚Äù, or i≈°≈°i'ak A≈°≈°ur, of the god Ashur. The Synchronistic ChronicleSynchronistic Chronicle (ABC 21), tablet K4401a, i 1‚Äì4. records his apparently amicable territorial treaty with Karaindash, king of Babylon, and recounts that they ‚Äútook an oath together concerning this very boundary‚Äù. His numerous clay cone inscriptions (line art for an example pictured) celebrate his re-facing of Puzur-Ashur III‚Äôs wall of the ‚ÄúNew City‚Äù district of Assur. Ashur-rim-nisheshu, inscribed mda≈°-≈°ur-√ÅG-UN.ME≈†-≈°u, meaning ‚ÄúAshur loves his people‚Äù, was ruler of Assyria, or i≈°≈°i‚Äôak A≈°≈°ur, ‚Äúvice-regent of Assur‚Äù, written in Sumerian: PA.TE.SI (=√âNSI), (c. 1394 BC ‚Äì c. 1387 BC), son and successor of Assur-bel-nisheshu II, is best known for his reconstruction of the inner city wall of Assur. All three extant Assyrian King Lists give his filiation as, ‚Äúson of Ashur-bel-nisheshu\\", the monarch who immediately preceded him, but this is contradicted by the sole extant contemporary inscription, a clay nail giving a dedicatory inscription for the reconstruction of the wall of the inner city of Assur, which gives his father as Assur-nerari II, the same as his predecessor who was presumably therefore his brother. With Ber-nadin-aye, another son of Assur-nerari who was given the title, \\"supreme judge\\", it seems he may have been the third of Assur-nerari's sons to rule. The clay nail identifies the previous restorers as Kikkia (c. 2100 BC), Ikunum (c. 1876 BC ‚Äì c. 1861 BC), Sargon I (c. 1861 BC ‚Äì c. 1822 BC), Puzur-Ashur II (c. 1822 BC ‚Äì c. 1814 BC), and Ashur-nirari I (c. 1510 BC ‚Äì c. 1484 BC.) Ashur-nadin-ahhe II, whose name is a personal Assyrian name meaning ‚ÄúAshur has given a brother‚Äù (c. 1387 BC ‚Äì c. 1378 BC), also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from the Egyptian Empire, probably in an attempt to gain Assyrian military support against the Egyptian Empire's rivals in West Asia: the Hittite Empire and the Mitanni. However, the Assyrian king appears to have been in a strong enough position to challenge neither the Mitanni nor the Hittites. Two Assyrian kings ruling between c. 1430 BC ‚Äì c. 1379 BC were called Ashur-nadin-ahhe. Hardly anything is known about these kings, but one of them is mentioned in one of the Amarna letters. In the letter from king Ashur-uballit I of Assyria to the pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire, numbered EA 16, Ashur-nadin-ahhe II is referred to as his ancestor who wrote to Egypt and received gold in return. This would imply an earlier diplomatic marriage and alliance between Assyria and Egypt during his reign. The name Ashur-nadin-ahhe II mentioned in EA 16 has been contested as a faulty writing of Ashur-nadin-apli, another Assyrian king. He was succeeded by his brother, Eriba-Adad I, the first king of the Middle Assyrian Empire.

An ethnic Hungarian, member of the Communist Party since 1974, he became a supporter of Milo≈°eviƒá in the late 1980s. As long-time director of Federal Customs Bureau of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Kertes provided logistic and financial support for various undercover government operations. During the 2000s, after the 5 October, Kertes was sentenced, tried or acted as a witness in several trials. Biography Kertes was born in Baƒçka Palanka to father Mihalj, a tailor and mother Olga, a housewife. He completed the primary and middle school, as well as the Higher School of Management (major of social work) in his hometown. He started working as a clerk for social work in municipal administration, became a member of League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1974, and his local career progressed to the level of secretary of municipal committee of the Communist League, in 1986. During the party's transformation into the Socialist Party of Serbia, Kertes became a supporter of Milo≈°eviƒá's policy. Rise Kertes became a prominent figure when, during the anti-bureaucratic revolution in support of Milo≈°eviƒá's politics, he initiated the protests in Baƒçka Palanka and led the protesters to Novi Sad, the capital of SAP Vojvodina. The event, known as the \\"Yogurt revolution\\", led to resign of the provincial leadership and installation of loyals to Milo≈°eviƒá. His statement \\"How can you Serbs be afraid of Serbia when I, a Hungarian, am not afraid of Serbia?\\", made him particularly famous. Due to that role, he progressed to Serbian presidency membership, and was in 1990 elected to the Assembly of Serbia as an MP for the Grocka‚ÄîBelgrade suburb, considered controversial as he had not lived there. In 1991, he shortly withdrew from the public eye and, under the auspice of the State Security, in the eve of the War in Croatia he travelled across Serb- populated areas in Croatia and Herzegovina, distributing weapons to local Serbs. In July 1991, he made another historic statement in Nik≈°iƒá: \\"Here we will build a great Serbian state, with the border on the left shore of Neretva and Dubrovnik as the capital\\" Subsequently, he was installed as head of State security department of the Federal Ministry of Interior, and (almost secretly) as assistant to Federal Minister of Interior Petar Graƒçanin (1992‚Äì93). Prime Minister Milan Paniƒá sacked him after an incident at the London Conference, when it was discovered that he induced Vladislav Jovanoviƒá to carry a secret listening device, and that he was listening on the other end. He was linked with formation of Serbian paramilitary units in Croatia (especially in eastern Slavonia) and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 and 1993. Kertes's reached the ultimate and the most lucrative peak of the career when he was appointed the head of Yugoslav Customs Office in 1993, the post that he will hold up to 2000. That position allowed him to impose whatever tax was necessary on the goods, and the customs duties functioned as a state budget in shadow. They were a financial source for a vast range of operations, from funding the paramilitary units in wars of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, across money laundering in foreign off-shore banks, to natural filling of private pockets of people close to Milo≈°eviƒá. He had Milo≈°eviƒá's trust throughout his tenure. Corruption, nepotism, smuggling and money extortion took over in the service. UN sanctions meant that the entire lucrative turnover of goods, especially such as tobacco and oil, had to be effectively smuggled, the privilege that was given only to the selected ones. Milo≈°eviƒá's son Marko had an effective monopoly of dealing Phillip Morris cigarettes in FR Yugoslavia. From his position, Kertes distributed an enormous number of gifts, chiefly vehicles and luxury goods, and the benefitors ranged from underdeveloped villages, through various state and local officials, to various special police, military and paramilitary units. During the reign, he was a man of unlimited power in his hometown Baƒçka Palanka. Apart from his (self-confessed) love to fish using the net and dynamite, he is also remembered for driving an armored limousine to his mother's house through the town. He had the power to sack whoever he did not like, and provided benefits to loyals. The town provided around 800 customs officials out of 2300 the country's total during his mandate. Fall After the overthrow on Milo≈°eviƒá on 5 October 2000, activists of Democratic Opposition of Serbia broke in the customs headquarters, finding Kertes and associates shredding the documentation. Other items found in the suite included US$ 1.3 million in various currencies, 18 pound of drugs, about 50 pieces of weapons, and 10 bulletproof luxury cars. After the brief detention, Kertes was permitted to leave the office, but subsequently faced various charges. After two retrials, in February 2007, Kertes was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for providing the truck to executioners of opposition politicians, in the 1999 Ibarska magistrala assassination. In September 2007, he faced trial for abuse of office and embezzlement. Among other issues, the prosecution charged the group, consisting of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, Jovan Zebiƒá and Nikola ≈†ainoviƒá for transferring 120 million German marks to Cyprus banks, where the trace is lost. Only Kertes faces trial, as Milo≈°eviƒá and Zebiƒá died, and ≈†ainoviƒá is currently standing a trial in International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. In November 2012, the Appellate Court reached the final verdict of six years and six months in prison to Kertes for illegal transfer of money to Cyprus and embezzlement of state budget for 1.5 million dinars. The sentence was joined with the previous one of 1.5 years for his participation in the Ibarska magistrala assassination. He was absolved of charges of \\"joint criminal venture\\" with Milo≈°eviƒá, Zebiƒá and ≈†ainoviƒá. However, in March 2013, the Supreme Court of Cassation reversed the verdict and ordered a reconsideration by the Appelate Court. In August 2014, he was released of all charges for embezzlement due to absolute obsolescence. Kertes also faces several trials for tobacco smuggling during 1990s and \\"abuse of official role\\" in relation with it. In December 2015, Appelate Court reached the final verdict of 2.5 years in prison in one such case. Personal life Kertes is ethnic Hungarian of Vojvodina. He is married to Mira, and has two daughters, Sanja and Dragana.

She was the last Cunard Line vessel built specifically for transatlantic crossings. The ship was later heavily rebuilt as a cruise ship, and sailed under the names SS Fairwind, SS Sitmar Fairwind, SS Dawn Princess and SS Albatros before being scrapped in 2004. She was renamed SS Genoa for her last voyage. Concept and construction Fairwind and Fairsea laid up at Southampton in August 1969 In addition to the more prestigious Transatlantic service from Southampton to New York, Cunard Line also operated other services, including one from Liverpool to Montreal, Canada. On the Canadian run their main competitors were Canadian Pacific Steamships. In order to strengthen their position on this service, Cunard decided to order a series of four identical liners in 1951. The new ships reflected the economics and travel patterns of the post-war world‚Äîthey were not built exclusively as passenger liners, but also included cargo-carrying facilities. Their passenger accommodation were divided into just two classes, first and tourist, with the tourist class occupying the majority of the ship. The outer dimensions of the ships were defined by the Saint Lawrence Seaway, as they had to be able to navigate from the Atlantic Ocean up to Montreal. The construction of the new ships, eventually referred to as the Saxonia class after the first ship, was awarded to the John Brown & Company shipyard at Clydebank in Glasgow, Scotland. The first ship, was delivered in 1954, with following in 1955, in 1956, and finally Sylvania in 1957. As was the tradition for Cunard Line vessels, all ships were named after Latin names of provinces of the Roman and Holy Roman Empires. Sylvania was rebuilt once during her service with Cunard Line, in 1965 when she was rebuilt into a more cruise-friendly configuration by the addition of en suite facilities to many of her cabins. In 1970‚Äì1971 the ship ‚Äì by now named Fairwind ‚Äì received a more extensive rebuilding for cruise service at Arsenale Triestino San Marco, Trieste, Italy, with her superstructure and funnel radically rebuilt and interiors re-styled to fit the tastes of the North American cruise passengers. Design Exterior design The Saxonia-class ships were built to a classic ocean liner appearance, with a black hull, long bow, slightly rounded terraced forward superstructure and a tiered aft superstructure. However, they lacked the traditional outward projecting promenade deck and had an unusual funnel with a rounded top. Due to their cargo-carrying capabilities, there were four large cranes on both the bow and aft deck. At some point of her career, Sylvanias hull was re-painted white. During the 1970‚Äì71 refit the ship's external appearance was radically altered, with the forward superstructure rebuilt to a sleek, streamlined form, the funnel rebuilt to a more modern, slightly conical form with a smoke deflector fin on top, and the cargo cranes eliminated. In keeping with the then-current Sitmar Line livery, Fairwind had a buff funnel with a large V (for Vlasov) painted on it. In addition to the funnel, the topmost decks of her superstructure and her radar mast were painted buff. In 1988 Sitmar Fairwind received the new Sitmar livery with an entirely white superstructure, a dark blue funnel with Sitmar's new Swan logo, and three wave-like ribands painted on her hull. Alongside she was the only ship to receive the short-lived new Sitmar livery. After moved to Princess Cruises and renamed Dawn Princess, the ship received the all-white Princess livery, with only the top of her funnel painted dark blue, and Princess' wave logo attached to the funnel. In Phoenix Reisen service her funnel was painted turquoise with a black top, with Phoenix's seagull-and-sun logo attached. Additionally a turquoise decorative stripe was painted on her hull. Interior design Sylvania, like her sisters, was originally built with a general arrangement of three cargo holds located both aft and forward of the superstructure, the passenger spaces located between them, with tourist class dominating the passenger spaces. Despite the dominance of the tourist class, her interiors were built to the elegant standards maintained by Cunard on their previous ships. Notable public spaces included a cinema with a balcony and even a soda fountain. The ship was also built with full air-conditioning. The public spaces were also altered radically in the 1970‚Äì71 refit, with three swimming pools added to the rear decks, and the accommodations brought up to the high standards expected by the North American cruise passengers. After the refit her facilities included a theatre, five lounges and three restaurants. Service history 1957‚Äì1968: Sylvania Sylvania started on her maiden voyage from Greenock to Montreal on 5 June 1957. On 26 June 1957 she joined her sisters on their northern hemisphere summer service from Liverpool to Montreal via Greenock and Qu√©bec. By the time she entered service the growth of passenger numbers in transatlantic liner service had ceased, while the number of passengers transported by the jet airplane was growing. In 1958 the Saxonia made one crossing from Liverpool to New York via Cobh and Halifax. In April 1961 she was moved permanently to the Liverpool‚ÄîNew York service, replacing . At some point during her career with Cunard, Sylvania also served on the Rotterdam‚ÄîSouthampton‚ÄîLe Havre‚ÄîQu√©bec‚ÄîMontreal -route and winter crossings between Liverpool and Halifax via Greenock. When the North Atlantic passenger operation became unprofitable in the early sixties, Sylvania was used on more and more cruises. In early 1965 she received a refit to make her accommodations more cruise-friendly (though this was not as extensive as the refits given to her sisters Saxonia and Ivernia). In November 1966 her transatlantic service was altered back to the Liverpool‚ÄîMontreal route. In June 1967, she was on a regular run from Montreal to Southampton via Le Havre when she ran aground on a sand bank between Lac St. Pierre and Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec. After nearly 24 hours trying to shift her with ocean-going tugboats, Cunard offered the 400 or so passengers the option of flying to the UK or continuing their voyage on the CP liner Empress of England, which had sailed from Montreal at noon the following day. Those passengers who opted to take Empress of England were transferred late in the afternoon on the deck of a ferry from Trois-Rivi√®res, arriving aboard Empress of England via the utility entrance for the kitchen.Philip Brown a passenger Between 24 February 1967 and 10 May 1967, Sylvania carried British Hovercraft Corporation's SRN-6 type hovercraft 024 on board during her cruises on the Mediterranean from Gibraltar. The hovercraft was used to run trips from the ship to various ports along the cruises. The experiment proved unsuccessful and was not repeated. Due to heavy losses Cunard withdrew Sylvania and her sister ship Carinthia from service in December 1967. They were subsequently laid up in Southampton and put up for sale. 1968‚Äì1988: Fairwind On 2 February 1968 Sylvania and Carinthia were sold to the Italy-based Sitmar Line. The sisters were re- registered to Liberia and renamed Fairwind and Fairland, respectively, with the intention of converting them into immigrant liners for the service from Europe to Australia and New Zealand. Sitmar had held the immigrant service contract by the Australian government from 1955, but the Australian government was asking for new tenders for the period of 1970 onwards, and Sitmar needed new ships to use for the service. However, despite the purchase of Fairwind and Fairland, Sitmar lost the contract to Chandris Lines, and as a result Fairwind and Fairland were laid up at Southampton. Having failed to keep the immigrant subsidiaries, Sitmar decided to convert their recently acquired ships for cruise service instead. Fairwind received a year-long refit between January 1970 and January 1971, after which she joined her sister (completed some two months earlier and renamed Fairsea) on the North American cruise market, on which she proved highly popular. During the northern hemisphere winter season the Fairwind made cruises to South America from Fort Lauderdale, while during the summer season she sailed from San Francisco on cruises to Canada and Alaska. In the late 1980s Sitmar decided to change their brand identity with a new external livery and new naming policy. Following an impact with a sandbar during an Amazon cruise in 1988, the Fairwind sailed through the Panama Canal en route to Los Angeles. After disembarking the passengers the ship headed for San Francisco where it received repairs to its propeller and a facelift. Fairwind became the first ship to be re-painted and -named, becoming the blue-funnelled Sitmar Fairwind in 1988. Her career as Sitmar Fairwind proved short, as already on 1 September 1988 Sitmar Cruises was sold to P&O; Group, who decided to close down the Sitmar brand in North America. Just eight days after the acquisition of Sitmar by P&O;, Sitmar Fairwind was renamed Dawn Princess and transferred to the fleet of Princess Cruises. 1988‚Äì1993: Dawn Princess As Dawn Princess the ship continued cruises mainly aimed at the North American market. At the time Princess Cruises were investing heavily on new tonnage, and the popular Dawn Princess was sold in early 1993 to V-Ships, a subsidiary of Vlasov Group, who had been the owners of Sitmar. 1993‚Äì2004: Albatros SS Albatros leaving Amsterdam, 2003 Dawn Princess was renamed Albatros after the sale to V-Ships and she was chartered to Phoenix Reisen, a German travel/cruise company, initially for five years from 27 March 1993 onwards. On 18 August 1993 Albatros set on her first cruise for Phoenix Reisen from Germany to North Cape, Norway. On 22 May 1995 Albatros suffered an engine room fire while on a cruise on the Red Sea. Her passengers were evacuated in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After passengers were evacuated, the ship sailed to Livorno, Italy for provisional repairs. She received full repairs at Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven in June, returning to service on 30 June 1995. On 16 May 1997 Albatros, carrying 800 people, hit Bartholomew's Ledge, St Mary's Sound, Isles of Scilly. The ship returned to St Mary's Road to anchor, escorted by the pilot boat and St Mary's Lifeboat. After two days, the 504 German passengers were taken from the listing ship, returning home on land. Bartholomew's Ledge had torn a gash in the hull of the liner, which was manoeuvring out of the archipelago at . On 26 June 1997 Albatros arrived at A & P Shipyard, Southampton, for repairs and returned to service in July of the same year. In November 2003 Albatros suffered severe machinery problems, hence Phoenix Reisen decided to terminate her charter contract, while V-Ships concluded that the price of repairing the 46-year-old ship would be too high. As a result, she was sold to the scrapyard at Alang, India in December 2003. The ship was renamed Genoa, and on 1 January 2004 she arrived at Alang, where she was beached and subsequently broken up. As a replacement vessel, was quickly chartered in January 2004, and given the name .

Prison Six was eventually founded as a result of the extreme overcapacity. Ever since, Prison Four has been gradually undergoing major changes. The prison was the first to experiment with new ideas in the prison sector, like the operation of security cameras in key locations, as well as the rehabilitation program abbreviated to Gahelet (lit. factors for returning to proper service) in 2000. In 2006, a load of expensive items belonging to prisoners deposited in the prison's safe, were stolen, and in January 2008, the first prisoner in the history of the jail died, although the exact circumstances of his death are not clear. Both events are causing the high command of the Military Police Corps to rethink their approach to the prison system, and install new safeguards. Syrian prisoner escape After the Six-Day War, high-quality Arab prisoners of war were kept in regular Israeli military prisons, including Prison Four. They were given excellent living conditions, including television, dangerous objects and trips to the outside, in order to ensure that the Israeli POWs held in Egypt and Syria would get similar treatment. On April 16, 1972, three Syrian prisoners were found missing in a morning roll call, and were later confirmed to be escapees. After the initial investigation, the commander of the Manpower Directorate, Aluf Shlomo Lahat, ordered a revocation of all special privileges to POWs held in Prison Four. The deputy Chief Military Police Officer, Colonel Meir Rosenfeld, was responsible for the task, and as a first step informed a cell of Egyptians that their television sets would be revoked. The Egyptians asked for two hours to formulate a means to have all the prisoners give up their TVs, meanwhile planning a riot. They began fortifying their cells and damaging the weak ceiling. After this became clear to the jailors, an intervention team was formed, although Col. Rosenfeld did not wish to have a violent clash which would endanger either Egyptian or Israeli lives. Rosenfeld personally climbed the roof of the cellblock and fired a bursts around him to scare the Egyptians. One bullet ricocheted and wounded an Egyptian prisoner. The others promptly surrendered, and the injured prisoner died from his wounds. While the Chief of Staff David Elazar, who arrived at the scene, praised Rosenfeld for his actions, an investigating committee found that he used his weapon illegally. As a result, Megiddo Prison was founded in 1974 to hold certain prisoners of war, as well as problematic Israeli military prisoners. Structure Prison Four's full structure chart At the head of Prison Four stands a lieutenant-colonel, with a major as vice-commander. There are six companies in Prison Four and several other assisting sub-units: *Absorption Company - accepts new prisoners and sometimes temporarily holds them before they can be transferred to a permanent company. Formerly this company was located outside the prison and had accommodations for prisoners, but this was changed following the mass deposit robbery of 2006. Headed by a lieutenant. *Company Alef (◊ê) - for prisoners serving sentences of 28 days or less, or those who have less than 28 days till their release. This is an open company, i.e. prisoners sleep in an open (but guarded) area, and not in jail cells. Headed by a captain and can contain up to 120 prisoners. *Company Bet (◊ë) - for long-time convicts, usually with sentences above 100 days. Company Bet is known for its harsh living conditions. *Company Gimel *Company Dalet *Company 400 - formerly a separate prison, company 400 is the women's company, and contains all female prisoners. Company Gimel Company Gimel (◊í) is a closed company for detainees awaiting trial, new prisoners, and some serving medium sentences. It consists of four regular platoons and a fifth absorption platoon, where new prisoners are accepted and sorted. Gimel is the largest company, containing up to 180 prisoners, and its commander is a major instead of a captain. Company Gimel contains the isolation/solitary confinement wing ( agaf habodedim), which has 21 cells and 2 full solitary ( tzinok) cells. The regular cells are for separation of prisoners and prevention of harm only - i.e., prisoners are put there if they pose an obvious danger to their surroundings, or are involved in feuds with other prisoners. This is not officially a punishment. A guard from Company Alef is placed inside each cell to guard the dangerous prisoner and prevent suicides, etc. Full solitary (tzinok) cells are used to punish prisoners and any lieutenant or higher in the prison may sentence any prisoner to 24 hours there (up to 1 week for higher-ranking officers). Company Dalet Company Dalet (◊ì) is an open company and the least strict of any of the other companies. While technically intended for reservists, there are two other classes of soldiers who may serve their sentences there. Soldiers aged 22 and above may request placement in Company Dalet, as may soldiers serving in the Nahal Haredi, a battalion made up of Haredi soldiers. The reason for the latter group of soldiers is that women do not serve as jail instructors in Company Dalet, thereby minimizing the Haredi soldiers' exposure to women. Soldiers in Company Dalet have a lot of free time during the day, and have access to television and a DVD player (in Prison Six this includes satellite TV as well). Apart from the much lighter overall atmosphere, another difference between Dalet and the other companies is that they eat with a full set of silverware. This, in contrast to the other companies' soldiers who only receive spoons at meals. In 2007, because of the shortage of space for prisoners in both prisons, Company Dalet also began accepting regular prisoners with short sentences and good records. However, Dalet's status is still of a small company, and its commander is a lieutenant instead of a captain. Assisting units *Prisoner management unit - headed by a captain, it serves as the adjutant unit for prisoners only. *Adjutant unit - headed by a lieutenant, it serves as the adjutant unit for regular soldiers serving in Prison Four. *Operations sector - headed by a lieutenant. *Operations room *Mental health sector - provides psychological help for prisoners. Headed by a major. *Gahelet sector - a sector introduced in 2000, which helps prisoners resume normal service. This sector is operated mostly by female soldiers who pick the soldiers they want to help, instead of the soldier asking for help as with other sectors. Headed by a major. *Intelligence sector - responsible for collecting intelligence about possible rebellions, etc. Headed by a first sergeant (called an intelligence officer).

The period runs from about 500 CE to 1500 CE, though there may be regional differences and debates. The era was globally characterized by the expansion of civilizations geographically and development of networks of trade between civilizations.The Post‚ÄêClassical Era by Joel Hermansen In Asia, the spread of Islam created a new empire and Islamic Golden Age with trade among the Asian, African and European continents, and advances in science in the medieval Islamic world. East Asia experienced the full establishment of power of Imperial China, which established several prosperous dynasties influencing Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. Religions such as Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism spread in the region. Gunpowder was developed in China during the post- classical era. The Mongol Empire connected Europe and Asia, creating safe trade and stability between the two regions. In total the population of the world doubled in the time period from approximately 210 million in 500 CE to 461 million in 1500 CE. Population generally grew steadily throughout the period but endured some incidental declines in events including the Plague of Justinian, The Mongol Invasions, Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent, and the Black Death.Haub (1995): \\"The average annual rate of growth was actually lower from 1 A.D. to 1650 than the rate suggested above for the 8000 B.C. to 1 A.D. period. One reason for this abnormally slow growth was the Black Plague. This dreaded scourge was not limited to 14th century Europe. The epidemic may have begun about 542 A.D. in Western Asia, spreading from there. It is believed that half the Byzantine Empire was destroyed in the 6th century, a total of 100 million deaths.\\" Historiography Terminology and periodization Leonardo Bruni, Renaissance historian who helped develop the concept of \\"Middle Ages\\" ‚ÄòPost-classical history‚Äô is a periodization used by historians employing a ‚Äòworld history‚Äô approach to history, specifically the school developed during the late 20th and the early 21st centuries. Outside of world history, the term is also sometimes used to avoid erroneous pre- conceptions around the terms ‚ÄòMiddle Ages‚Äô, ‚ÄòMedieval Ages‚Äô and the ‚ÄòDark Ages‚Äô (see Medievalism), though the application of the term ‚Äòpost-classical‚Äô on a global scale is also problematic, and may likewise be Eurocentric.Catherine Holmes and Naomi Standen, ‚ÄòIntroduction: Towards a Global Middle Ages‚Äô, Past & Present, 238 (November 2018), 1-44 (p. 16). The post-classical period corresponds roughly to the period from 500 CE to 1450 CE. Beginning and ending dates might vary depending on the region, with the period beginning at the end of the previous classical period: Han China (ending in 220 CE), the Western Roman Empire (in 476 CE), the Gupta Empire (in 543 CE), and the Sasanian Empire (in 651 CE). The post-classical period is one of the five or six major periods world historians use: # early civilization, # classical societies, # post-classical # early modern, # long nineteenth century, and # contemporary or modern era. (Sometimes the nineteenth century and modern are combined.) Although post-classical is synonymous with the Middle Ages of Western Europe, the term post-classical is not necessarily a member of the traditional tripartite periodisation of Western European history into ‚Äòclassical‚Äô, ‚Äòmiddle‚Äô and ‚Äòmodern‚Äô. Approaches The historical field of world history, which looks at common themes occurring across multiple cultures and regions, has enjoyed extensive development since the 1980s. However, World History research has tended to focus on early modern globalization (beginning around 1500) and subsequent developments, and views post-classical history as mainly pertaining to Afro-Eurasia. Historians recognize the difficulties of creating a periodization and identifying common themes that include not only this region but also, for example, the Americas, since they had little contact with Afro-Eurasia before the Columbian Exchange. Thus recent research has emphasised that ‚Äòa global history of the period between 500 and 1500 is still wanting‚Äô and that ‚Äòhistorians have only just begun to embark on a global history of the Middle Ages‚Äô.Michael Borgolte, ‚ÄòA Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World‚Äô, in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 70-84. For many regions of the world, there are well established histories. Although Medieval Studies in Europe tended in the nineteenth century to focus on creating histories for individual nation-states, much twentieth-century research focused, successfully, on creating an integrated history of medieval Europe.Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, ‚ÄòSome Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages‚Äô, in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 1-13.Patrick Geary, ‚ÄòEuropean Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?‚Äô, in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 57-69.Jinty Nelson, ‚ÄòWhy Reinventing Medieval History is a Good Idea‚Äô, in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 17-36.Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 70-84. The Islamic World likewise has a rich regional historiography, ranging from the fourteenth-century Ibn Khaldun to the twentieth-century Marshall Hodgson and beyond.Adam J. Silverstein, Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 94-107. Correspondingly, research into the network of commercial hubs which enabled goods and ideas to move between China in the East and the Atlantic islands in the West‚Äîwhich can be called the early history of globalization‚Äîis fairly advanced; one key historian in this field is Janet Abu-Lughod.Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 70-84 [81-83]. Understanding of communication within Sub- Saharan Africa or the Americas is, by contrast, far more limited.Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 70-84 [80-81]. Recent history-writing, therefore, has begun to explore how it might be possible meaningfully to write history that spans the Old World, where human activities were fairly interconnected, and establishes its relationship with other worlds, such as the Americas and Oceania. In the assessment of James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham, > Global history may be boundless, but global historians are not.

A number of commentators have pointed to the history of the earth's climate as a useful approach to World History in the Middle Ages, noting that certain climate events had effects on all human populations.William S. Atwell, 'Volcanism and Short-Term Climatic Change in East Asian and World History, c. 1200-1699', Journal of World History, 12.1 (Spring 2001), 29-98.Richard W.

S. Campbell, The Great Transition: Climate, Disease and Society in the Late- Medieval World (Cambridge, 2016).  Main trends  The Post-classical era saw several common developments or themes. There was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas; the rise and/or spread of the three major world, or missionary, religions; and a period of rapidly expanding trade and trade networks.  Growth of civilization  Nazca Lines produced by Nazca culture, a South America Andean civilization that thrived from the 1st to the 8th century First was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas across Asia, Africa, Europe, Mesoamerica, and western South America. However, as noted by world historian Peter N. Stearns, there were no common global political trends during the post-classical period, rather it was a period of loosely organized states and other developments, but no common political patterns emerged. In Asia, China continued its historic dynastic cycle and became more complex, improving its bureaucracy. The creation of the Islamic Empires established a new power in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. Africa created the Songhai and Mali kingdoms in the West. The fall of Roman civilization not only left a power vacuum for the Mediterranean and Europe, but forced certain areas to build what some historians might call new civilizations entirely. An entirely different political system was applied in Western Europe (i.e. feudalism), as well as a different society (i.e. manorialism). But the once East Roman Empire, Byzantium, retained many features of old Rome, as well as Greek and Persian similarities. Kiev Rus' and subsequently Russia began development in Eastern Europe as well. In the isolated Americas, Mesoamerica saw the building of the Aztec Empire, while the Andean region of South America saw the establishment of the Wari Empire first and the Inca Empire later.  Spread of universal religions  Siege of Acre (1191; picture from 1280.) Religious wars were common in post-classical times. One of the largest was the Crusades. |200x200px Religion that envisaged the possibility that all humans could be included in a universal order had emerged already in the first millennium BC, particularly with Buddhism. In the following millennium, Buddhism was joined by two other major, universalising, missionary religions, both developing from Judaism: Christianity and Islam. By the end of the period, these three religions were between them widespread, and often politically dominant, across the Old World.Yuval Noah Harari, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, trans. by Yuval Noah Harari, John Purcell and Haim Watzman (London: Harvill Secker, 2014), , chapter 12. * Buddhism spread from India into China and flourished there briefly before using it as a hub to spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam; a similar effect occurred with Confucian revivalism in the later centuries. * Christianity had become the State church of the Roman Empire in 380, and continued spreading into northern and eastern Europe during the post-classical period at the expense of belief systems that Christians labelled pagan. An attempt was even made to incur upon the Middle East during the Crusades. The split of the Catholic Church in Western Europe and the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe encouraged religious and cultural diversity in Eurasia. * Islam began between 610 and 632, with a series of revelations to Muhammad. It helped unify the warring Bedouin clans of the Arabian peninsula and, through a rapid series of Muslim conquests, became established to the west across North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and parts of West Africa, and to the east across Persia, Central Asia, India, and Indonesia.  Trade and communication  Pakistan's Babusar Pass, part of the Silk Road Finally, communication and trade across Afro-Eurasia increased rapidly. The Silk Road continued to spread cultures and ideas through trade and throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. Trade networks were established between West Europe, Byzantium, early Russia, the Islamic Empires, and the Far Eastern civilizations. In Africa the earlier introduction of the Camel allowed for a new and eventually large trans-Saharan trade, which connected Sub- Saharan West Africa to Eurasia. The Islamic Empires adopted many Greek, Roman, and Indian advances and spread them through the Islamic sphere of influence, allowing these developments to reach Europe, North and West Africa, and Central Asia. Islamic sea trade helped connect these areas, including those in the Indian Ocean and in the Mediterranean, replacing Byzantium in the latter region. The Christian Crusades into the Middle East (as well as Muslim Spain and Sicily) brought Islamic science, technology, and goods to Western Europe. Western trade into East Asia was pioneered by Marco Polo. Importantly, China began the sinicization (or Chinese influence) of regions like Japan, Korea, and Vietnam through trade and conquest. Finally, the growth of the Mongol Empire in Central Asia established safe trade such as to allow goods, cultures, ideas, and disease to spread between Asia, Europe, and Africa. The Americas had their own trade network, however theirs was limited by the lack of draft animals and the wheel. In Oceania some of the island chains of Polynesia and Micronesia also engaged in trade with one another.  Climate  During Post-classical times, there is evidence that many regions of the world were affected similarly by global climate conditions; however, direct effects in temperature and precipitation varied by region. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, changes did not all occur at once. Generally however, studies found that temperatures were relatively warmer in the 11th century, but colder by the early 17th century. The degree of climate change which occurred in all regions across the world is uncertain, as is whether such changes were all part of a global trend. Climate trends seemed to be more recognizable in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere.Reconstructed depth of Little Ice Age varies among studies. Anomalies shown are from the 1950‚Äì80 reference period. There are shorter climate periods that could be said roughly to account for large scale climate trends in the Post-classical Period. These include the Late Antique Little Ice Age, the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. The extreme weather events of 536‚Äì537 were likely initiated by the eruption of the Lake llopango caldera in El Salvador. Sulfate emitted into the air initiated global cooling, migrations and crop failures worldwide, possibly intensifying an already cooler time period. Records show that the world's average temperature remained colder for at least a century afterwards. The Medieval Warm Period from 950 to 1250 occurred mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, causing warmer summers in many areas; the high temperatures would only be surpassed by the global warming of the 20th/21st centuries. It has been hypothesized that the warmer temperatures allowed the Norse to colonize Greenland, due to ice-free waters. Outside of Europe there is evidence of warming conditions, including higher temperatures in China and major North American droughts which adversely affected numerous cultures. After 1250, glaciers began to expand in Greenland, affecting its thermohaline circulation, and cooling the entire North Atlantic. In the 14th century, the growing season in Europe became unreliable; meanwhile in China the cultivation of oranges was driven southward by colder temperatures. Especially in Europe, the Little Ice Age had great cultural ramifications. It persisted until the Industrial Revolution, long after the Post-classical Period. Its causes are unclear: possible explanations include sunspots, orbital cycles of the Earth, volcanic activity, ocean circulation, and man-made population decline.

This was especially true in the north, the Sudan region, and the east coast. However, this conversion was not complete nor uniform among different areas, and the low-level classes hardly changed their beliefs at all. Prior to the migration and conquest of Muslims into Africa, much of the continent was dominated by diverse societies of varying sizes and complexities. These were ruled by kings or councils of elders who would control their constituents in a variety of ways. Most of these peoples practiced spiritual, animistic religions. Africa was culturally separated between Saharan Africa (which consisted of North Africa and the Sahara Desert) and Sub-Saharan Africa (everything south of the Sahara). Sub-Saharan Africa was further divided into the Sudan, which covered everything north of Central Africa, including West Africa. The area south of the Sudan was primarily occupied by the Bantu peoples who spoke the Bantu language. From 1100 onward Christian Europe and the Islamic World became dependent on Africa for gold. After 650 approximately urbanization expanded for the first time beyond the ancient kingdoms Aksum and Nubia. The precolonial African civilizations can be divided into three categories based on religion: *Christian civilizations on the Horn of Africa, *Islamic civilizations which formed in the Niger River valley in West Africa, and on the coast of East Africa, and *traditional societies which adhered to native African religions. South of the Sahara African kingdoms developed based on continental trade with one another through land based routes and generally avoided sea trade. Sub-Saharan Africa was part of two large, separate trading networks, the Trans Saharan trade which bridged commerce between West and North Africa. Due to the huge profits from trade native African Islamic empires arose, including those of Ghana, Mali and Songhay. In the 14th century, Mansa Musa king of Mali may have been the wealthiest person of his time. Within Mali, the city of Timbuktu was an international center of science and well known throughout the Islamic World, particularly from the University of Sankore. East Africa was part of the Indian Ocean trade network, which included both Arab ruled Islamic cities on the East African Coast such as Mombasa and Traditional cities such as Great Zimbabwe which exported gold, copper and ivory to markets in the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.  Europe  serfs who worked in exchange for military protection. After the Black Death of the 1340s, a labor shortage caused serfs to demand wages for their labor. Drawing from 1300|alt=|200x200px In Europe, Western civilization reconstituted after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire into the period now known as the Early Middle Ages (500‚Äì1000). The Early Middle Ages saw a continuation of trends begun in Late Antiquity: depopulation, deurbanization, and increased barbarian invasion.Gilian Clark, Late Antiquity: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford 2011), pp. 1‚Äì2. From the 7th until the 11th centuries Arabs, Magyars and Norse were all threats to the Christian Kingdoms that killed thousands of people over centuries. Raiders however, also created new trading networks. In western Europe the Frankish king Charlemagne attempted to kindle the rise of culture and science in the Carolingian Renaissance. In the year 800 Charlemagne founded the Holy Roman Empire in attempt to resurrect Classical Rome. The reign of Charlemange attempted to kindle a rise of learning and literacy in what has become known as the Carolingian Renaissance In Eastern Europe, the Eastern Roman Empire survived in what is now called the Byzantine Empire which created the Code of Justinian that inspired the legal structures of modern European states. Ruled by religious Christian Orthodox emperors the Byzantine Eastern Orthodox Church Christianized the Kieven Rus, who were the foundation of modern-day Russia and Ukraine. Byzantium flourished as the leading power and trade center in its region in the Macedonian Renaissance until it was overshadowed by Italian City States and the Islamic Ottoman Empire near the end of the Middle Ages. Bobolice Castle, in Boblice Poland. Medieval European castles were centers of feudal power. Later in the period, the creation of the feudal system allowed greater degrees of military and agricultural organization. There was sustained urbanization in northern and western Europe. Later developments were marked by manorialism and feudalism, and evolved into the prosperous High Middle Ages. After 1000 the Christian kingdoms that had emerged from Rome's collapse changed dramatically in their cultural and societal character. During the High Middle Ages (c. 1000‚Äì1300), Christian- oriented art and architecture flourished and the Crusades were mounted to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim control. The influence of the emerging nation-state was tempered by the ideal of an international Christendom and the presence of the Roman Catholic Church in all western kingdoms. The codes of chivalry and courtly love set rules for proper behavior, while the Scholastic philosophers attempted to reconcile faith and reason. The age of Feudalism would be dramatically transformed by the cataclysm of the Black Death and its aftermath. This time would be a major underlying cause for the Renaissance. By the turn of the 16th century European or Western Civilization would be engaging in the Age of Discovery. The term \\"Middle Ages\\" first appears in Latin in the 15th century and reflects the view that this period was a deviation from the path of classical learning, a path supposedly reconnected by Renaissance scholarship.Miglio \\"Curial Humanism\\" Interpretations of Renaissance Humanism p. 112  West Asia  The Arabian peninsula and the surrounding Middle East and Near East regions saw dramatic change during the Postclassical Era caused primarily by the spread of Islam and the establishment of the Arabian Empires. Derbent, Dagestan Russia. Prior to the Muslim conquest of Persia, Sassanid Persia with its Zoroastrian Religion controlled most of the Middle East. In the 5th century, the Middle East was separated by empires and their spheres of influence; the two most prominent were the Sasanian Empire of the Persians in what is now Iran and Iraq, and the Byzantine Empire in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power. Meanwhile, the nomadic Bedouin tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism. Golden Age of Islam made advances in medicine. From the University Library, Istanbul.|alt=|276x276px While the Byzantine Roman and Sassanid Persian empires were both weakened by the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, a new power in the form of Islam grew in the Middle East under Muhammad in Medina. In a series of rapid Muslim conquests, the Rashidun army, led by the Caliphs and skilled military commanders such as Khalid ibn al-Walid, swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars and completely engulfing Persia in the Muslim conquest of Persia. It would be the Arab Caliphates of the Middle Ages that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant ethnic identity that persists today. These Caliphates included the Rashidun Caliphate, Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, and later the Turkic-based Seljuq Empire. After Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an Islamic Golden Age, inspiring achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in medicine, algebra, geometry, astronomy, anatomy, and ethics that would later finds it way back to Western Europe. The dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the Seljuq Turks, migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the Hejaz. This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joint European forces mainly from England, France, and the emerging Holy Roman Empire, to enter the region. In 1099 the knights of the First Crusade captured Jerusalem and founded the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which survived until 1187, when Saladin retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the Mongol Empire, swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the Siege of Baghdad (1258) and advancing as far south as the border of Egypt in what became known as the Mongol conquests. The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, Timur, and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the Ottomans.  South Asia  Rajendra Chola. Picture by Prakash Chidambaram.|alt= There has been difficulty applying the word 'medieval' or 'post classical' to the history of South Asia. This section follows historian Stein Burton's definition that corresponds from the 8th century to the 16th century, more of less following the same time frame of the Post Classical Period and the European Middle Ages. Until the 13th century, there was no less than 20 to 40 different states on the Indian Subcontinent which hosted a variety of cultures, languages, writing systems and religions. In the beginning of the time period Buddhism was predominant throughout the area with the short lived Pala Empire on the Indo Gangetic Plain sponsoring the faith's institutions. One such institution was the Buddhist Nalanda University in modern-day Bihar, India a center of scholarship and brought a divided South Asia onto the global intellectual stage. Another accomplishment was the invention of the Chaturanga game which later was exported to Europe and became Chess. In Southern India, the Hindu Kingdom of Chola gained prominence with an overseas empire that controlled parts of modern-day Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Indonesia as oversees territories and helped spread Hinduism into the historic culture of these places.History of Asia by B.V. Rao p.211 In this time period, neighboring areas such as Afghanistan, Tibet, Southeast Asia were under South Asian influence. From 1206 onward a series of Turkic Islamic invasions based from modern day Afghanistan and Iran conquered massive portions of Northern India, founding the Delhi Sultanate which remained supreme until the 16th century. The Delhi Sultanate introduced Islam to the conquered populations for the first time. Native religions fared differently, Buddhism declined in South Asia vanishing in many areas but Hinduism survived and reinforced itself in areas conquered by Muslims. In the far South the Kingdom of Vijanyagar was not conquered by any Muslim state in the period. The turn of the 16th century would see the rise of a new Islamic Empire ‚Äì the Mughals and the establishment of European trade posts by the Portuguese.  Southeast Asia  View of leftFrom the 8th century onward Southeast Asia stood to benefit from the trade taking place between South and East Asia, numerous kingdoms arose in the region due to the flow of wealth passing through the Strait of Malacca. While Southeast Asia had numerous outside influences India was the greatest source of inspiration for the region. North Vietnam as an exception was culturally closer to China for centuries due to conquest. Since rule from the third century BC North Vietnam continued to be subjugated by Chinese states, although they continually resisted periodically. There were three periods of Chinese Domination that spanned near 1100 years. Vietnam gained long lasting independence in the 10th century when China was divided. Nonetheless, even as an independent state a sort of begrudging sinicization occurred. By the end of the Postclassical Era, Vietnam would be in control of its own Nguy·ªÖn dynasty. South Vietnam was governed by the ancient Hindu Champa Kingdom but was annexed by Vietnamese invaders in the 15th century. The spread of Hinduism, Buddhism and maritime trade between China and South Asia created the foundation for Southeast Asia's first major empires; including the Khmer Empire from Cambodia and Sri Vijaya from Indonesia. During the Khmer Empire's height in the 12th century the city of Angkor Thom was among the largest of the pre-modern world due to its water management. King Jayavarman II constructed over a hundred hospitals throughout his realm. Nearby rose the Pagan Empire in modern-day Burma, using elephants as military might. The construction of the Buddhist Shwezigon Pagoda and its tolerance for believers of older polytheistic gods helped Theravada Buddhism become supreme in the region. In Indonesia, Srivijaya from the 7th through 14th century was a Thalassocracy that focused on maritime city states and trade. Controlling the vital choke points of the Sunda and Malacca straits it became rich from trade ranging from Japan through Arabia. Gold, Ivory and Ceramics were all major commodities traveling through port cities. The Empire was also responsible for the construction of wonders such as Borobudur. During this time Indonesian sailors crossed the Indian Ocean; evidence suggests that they may have colonized Madagascar. Indian culture spread to the Philippines, likely through Indonesian trade resulting in the first documented use of writing in the archipelago and Indianized kingdoms.The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History by Richard Bulliet, Pamela Crossley, Daniel Headrick, Steven Hirsch, Lyman Johnson p.186 Over time changing economic and political conditions else where and wars weakened the traditional empires of South East Asia. While the Mongol Invasions did not directly annex Southeast Asia the war-time devastation paved way for the rise of new nations. In the 15th century the Khmer Empire was supplanted by the Thai Ayutthaya Kingdom and Sri Vijaya was overtaken by the Majapahit and later the Islamic Malacca Sultanate by 1450.  East Asia  In China public examinations gave citizens the opportunity to be employed by the Imperial Government through alt= The time frame of 500‚Äì1500 in East Asia's history and China in particular has been proposed as an accurate classification for the region's history within the context of global Post-classical history. There has been an attempt made in college courses to adapt the Post-Classical concept to Chinese terms. During this period the Eastern world empires continued to expand through trade, migration and conquests of neighboring areas. Japan and Korea went under the process of voluntary sinicization, or the impression of Chinese cultural and political ideas. Korea and Japan sinicized because their ruling class were largely impressed by China's bureaucracy. The major influences China had on these countries were the spread of Confucianism, the spread of Buddhism, and the establishment of centralized governance. In the times of the Sui, Tang and Song dynasties (581‚Äì1279), China remained the world's largest economy and most technologically advanced society.Bulliet & Crossley & Headrick & Hirsch & Johnson 2014, p. 264. Inventions such as gunpowder, woodblock printing and the magnetic compass were improved upon. China stood in contrast to other areas at the time as the imperial governments exhibited concentrated central authority instead of feudalism. China exhibited much interest in foreign affairs, during the Tang and Song dynasties. From the 7th through the 10th Tang China was focused on securing the Silk Road as the selling of its goods westwards was central to the nation's economy. For a time China, successfully secured its frontiers by integrating their nomadic neighbors such as the Gokturks into their civilization. The Tang dynasty expanded into Central Asia and received tribute from Eastern Iran. Western expansion ended with wars with the Umayyad Caliphate and the deadly An Lushan Rebellion which resulted in an deadly but uncertain death toll of millions. After the collapse of the Tang dynasty and subsequent civil wars came the second phase of Chinese interest in foreign relations. Unlike the Tang, the Song specialized in overseas trade and peacefully created a maritime network and China's population became concentrated in the south. Chinese merchant ships reached Indonesia, India and Arabia. Southeast Asia's economy flourished from trade with Song China.Askua Period|alt=|left With the country's emphasis on trade and economic growth, Song China's economy began to use machines to manufacture goods and coal as a source of energy. The advances of the Song in the 11th/12th centuries have been considered an early industrial revolution. Economic advancements came at the cost of military affairs and the Song became open to invasions from the north. China became divided as Song's northern lands were conquered by the Jurchen people. By 1200 there were five Chinese kingdoms stretching from modern day Turkestan to the Sea of Japan including the Western Liao, Western Xia, Jin, Southern Song and Dali. Because these states competed with each other they all were eventually annexed by the rising Mongol Empire before 1279. After seventy years of conquest, the Mongols proclaimed the Yuan dynasty and also annexed Korea; they failed to conquer Japan. Mongol conquerors also made China accessible to European travelers such as Marco Polo. The Mongol era was short lived due to plagues and famine. After revolution in 1368 the succeeding Ming dynasty ushered in a period of prosperity and brief foreign expeditions before isolating itself from global affairs for centuries. Korea and Japan however continued to have relations with China and with other Asian countries. In the 15th century Sejong the Great of Korea cemented his country's identity by creating the Hangul Writing system to replace use of Chinese Characters. Meanwhile, Japan fell under military rule of the Kamakura and later Ashikaga Shogunate dominated by Samauri warriors.

Originating in the steppes of Central Asia, the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Central Europe to the Sea of Japan, extending northwards into Siberia, eastwards and southwards into the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, and the Iranian plateau, and westwards as far as the Levant and Arabia. The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the Mongolia homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan, who was proclaimed ruler of all Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and then under his descendants, who sent invasions in every direction.Diamond. Guns, Germs, and Steel. p. 367.The Mongols and Russia, by George VernadskyThe Mongol World Empire, 1206‚Äì1370, by John Andrew BoyleThe History of China, by David Curtis Wright. p. 84.The Early Civilization of China, by Yong Yap Cotterell, Arthur Cotterell. p. 223.Mongols and Mamluks: The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War, 1260‚Äì1281 by Reuven Amitai-Preiss The vast transcontinental empire connected the east with the west with an enforced Pax Mongolica allowing trade, technologies, commodities, and ideologies to be disseminated and exchanged across Eurasia.Thomas T. Allsen. Culture and Conquest. p. 211. The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir √ñgedei, or one of his other sons such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi. After M√∂ngke Khan died, rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers Ariq B√∂ke and Kublai Khan, who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War, but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis. Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and √ñgedeid families. Letter from the Mongolian-Persian alt=The Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 marked the high-water point of the Mongol conquests and was the first time a Mongol advance had ever been beaten back in direct combat on the battlefield. Though the Mongols launched many more invasions into the Levant, briefly occupying it and raiding as far as Gaza after a decisive victory at the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar in 1299, they withdrew due to various geopolitical factors. By the time of Kublai's death in 1294, the Mongol Empire had fractured into four separate khanates or empires, each pursuing its own separate interests and objectives: the Golden Horde khanate in the northwest; the Chagatai Khanate in the west; the Ilkhanate in the southwest; and the Yuan dynasty based in modern-day Beijing.The Cambridge History of China: Alien Regimes and Border States. p. 413. In 1304, the three western khanates briefly accepted the nominal suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty,Jackson. Mongols and the West. p. 127.Allsen. Culture and Conquest. pp. xiii, 235. but it was later overthrown by the Han Chinese Ming dynasty in 1368. The Genghisid rulers returned to Mongolia homeland and continued rule in the Northern Yuan dynasty. All of the original Mongol Khanates collapsed by 1500, but smaller successor states remained independent until the 1700s. Descendants of Chagatai Khan created the Mughal Empire that ruled much of India in early modern times.  The Silk Road  Buddhist teacher possibly Sogdian instructs an East-Asian monk. Dated from the 9th century near Turfan, Xinxiang, China |214x214px The Silk Road was a Eurasian trade route that played a large role in global communication and interaction. It stimulated cultural exchange; encouraged the learning of new languages; resulted in the trade of many goods, such as silk, gold, and spices; and also spread religion and disease. It is even claimed by some historians ‚Äì such as Andre Gunder Frank, William Hardy McNeill, Jerry H. Bentley, and Marshall Hodgson ‚Äì that the Afro-Eurasian world was loosely united culturally, and that the Silk Road was fundamental to this unity. This major trade route began with the Han dynasty of China, connecting it to the Roman Empire and any regions in between or nearby. At this time, Central Asia exported horses, wool, and jade into China for the latter's silk; the Romans would trade for the Chinese commodity as well, offering wine in return. The Silk Road would often decline and rise again in trade from the Iron Age to the Postclassical Era. Following one such decline, it was reopened in Central Asia by Han Dynasty General Ban Chao during the 1st century. The Silk Road was also a major factor in spreading religion across Afro-Eurasia. Muslim teachings from Arabia and Persia reached East Asia. Buddhism spread from India, to China, to Central Asia. One significant development in the spread of Buddhism was the carving of the Gandhara School in the cities of ancient Taxila and the Peshwar, allegedly in the mid 1st century. The route was vulnerable to spreading plague. The Plague of Justinian originated in East Asia and had a major outbreak in Europe in 542 causing the deaths of a quarter of the Mediterranean's population. Trade between Europe, Africa and Asia along the route was at least partially responsible for spreading the plague. There is a popular theory that the Black Death was caused by the Mongol conquests. The claim is that the direct link that it opened between the East and West provided the path for rats and fleas that carried the disease. Although there is no concrete historical evidence to this theory, the plague is considered endemic on the steppe. There were vulnerabilities as well to changing political situations. The rise of Islam changed the Silk Road, because Muslim rulers generally closed the Silk Road to Christian Europe to an extent Europe would be cut off from Asia for centuries. Specifically, the political developments that affected the Silk Road included the emergence of the Turks, the political movements of the Sasanian and Byzantine empires, and the rise of the Arabs, among others. 264x264px The Silk Road flourished again in the 13th century during the reign of the Mongol Empire, which through conquest had brought stability in Central Asia comparable to the Pax Romana. It was claimed by a Muslim historian that Central Asia was peaceful and safe to transverse > \\"(Central Asia) enjoyed such a peace that a man might have journeyed from > the land of sunrise to the land of sunset with a golden platter upon his > head without suffering the least violence from anyone.\\" As such, trade and communication between Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East required little effort. Handicraft production, art, and scholarship prospered, and wealthy merchants enjoyed cosmopolitan cities. The Silk Road trade played a role in spreading the infamous Black Death. Originating in China, the bubonic plague was spread by Mongol warriors catapulting diseased corpses into enemy towns in the Crimea. The disease, spread by rats, was carried by merchant ships sailing across the Mediterranean that brought the plague back to Sicily, causing an epidemic in 1347. Nevertheless, after the 15th century, the Silk Road disappeared from regular use. This was primarily a result from the growing sea travel pioneered by Europeans, which allowed the trade of goods by sailing around the southern tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean.  Science  Westerner and Arab practicing geometry 15th century manuscript The term Post-Classical Science is often used in academic circles and in college courses to combine the study of medieval European science and medieval Islamic science due to their interactions with one another. However Science also spread from Eastern Eurasia, particularly from China was spread westward by Arabs due to both war and trade. The Islamic World also benefited from medical knowledge from South Asia.A History of Medicine: Byzantine and Islamic medicine By Plinio Prioreschi Vol. iv, p. 121, In the case of the Western World and in Islamic realms much emphasis was placed on preserving the rationalist Greek Tradition of figures such as Aristotle. In the context of science within Islam there are questions as to whether Islamic Scientists simply preserved accomplishments from Antiquity or built upon earlier Greek advances.Bertrand Russell (1945) History of Western Philosophy, book 2, part 2, chapter XAbdus Salam, H.R. Dalafi, Mohamed Hassan (1994). Renaissance of Sciences in Islamic Countries p. 162. World Scientific, . Regardless, Classical European Science was brought back to the Christian Kingdoms due to the experience of the Crusades. As a result of Persian trade in China, and the battle of the Talas River, Chinese innovations entered the Islamic intellectual world. These include advances in astronomy and in paper-making.Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1998. (p. 58) Masood 2009, pp. 132‚Äì135 Paper-making spread through the Islamic World as far west as Islamic Spain, before paper- making was acquired for Europe by the Reconquista. There is debate about transmission of gunpowder on whether the Mongols introduced Chinese gunpowder weapons to Europe or if gunpowder weapons were invented in Europe independently.  Literate culture and arts  Tale of Genji, the world's first novel. Persian Talaei-tetrachords Italy, 8th century Ut Queant Laxis Within Eurasia, there were four major civilization groups that had literate cultures and created literature and arts, including Europe, the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia. Southeast Asia could be a possible fifth category but was influenced heavily from both South and East Asia literal cultures. All four cultures in Post-Classical Times used poetry, drama and prose. Throughout the period and until the 19th century poetry was the dominant form of literary expression. In the Middle East, South Asia, Europe and China great poetic works often used figurative language. Examples include, the Sanskrit Shakuntala, the Arabic Thousand and one nights, Old English Beowulf and works by the Chinese Du Fu. In Japan, prose uniquely thrived more than in other geographic areas. The Tale of Genji is considered the world's first realistic novel written in the 9th century. Musically, most regions of the world only used melodies as opposed to harmony. Medieval Europe was the lone exception to this rule, developing harmonic music in the 14th/15th century as musical culture transitioned form sacred music (meant for the church) to secular music. South Asian and Mid-Eastern music were similar to each other for their use of microtone. East-Asian music shared some similarities with European Music for using a pentatonic scale.  The Americas  The Postclassical Era of the Americas can be considered set at a different time span from that of Afro-Eurasia. As the developments of Mesoamerican and Andean civilization differ greatly from that of the Old World, as well as the speed at which it developed, the Postclassical Era in the traditional sense does not take place until near the end of the medieval age in Afro-Eurasia. As such, for the purposes of this article, the Woodland period and Classic stage of the Americas will be discussed here, which takes place from about 400 to 1400. For the technical Postclassical stage in American development which took place on the eve of European contact, see Post-Classic stage.  North America  As a continent there was little unified trade or communication. Advances in agriculture spread northward from Mesoamerica indirectly through trade. Major cultural areas however still developed independently of each other.  Norse Contact and the Polar Regions  Authentic reconstruction of Norse site at L'Anse aux Meadows. Photo provided by Dylan Kereluk. While there was little regular contact between the Americas and the Old World the Norse Vikings explored and even colonized Greenland and Canada as early as 1000. None of these settlements survived past Medieval Times. Outside of Scandinavia knowledge of the discovery of the Americas was interpreted as a remote island or the North Pole. The Norse arriving from Greenland settled Greenland from approximately 980 to 1450. The Norse arrived in southern Greenland prior to the 13th century approach of Inuit Thule people in the area. The extent of the interaction between the Norse and Thule is unclear. Greenland was valuable to the Norse due to trade of ivory that came from the tusks of walruses. The Little Ice Age adversely affected the colonies and they vanished. Greenland would be lost to Europeans until Danish Colonization in the 18th century. The Norse also explored and colonized farther south in Newfoundland Canada at L'Anse aux Meadows referred to by the Norse as Vinland. The colony at most existed for twenty years and resulted in no known transmission of diseases or technology to the First Nations. To the Norse Vinland was known for plentiful grape vines to make superior wine. One reason for the colony's failure was constant violence with the native Beothuk tribe who the Norse referred to as Skraeling. After initial expeditions there is a possibility that the Norse continued to visit modern day Canada. Surviving records from medieval Iceland indicate some sporadic voyages to a land called Markland, possibly the coast of Labrador, Canada, as late as 1347 presumably to collect wood for deforested Greenland.  Northern Areas  133x133pxIn northern North America, many hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies thrived in the diverse region. Native American tribes varied greatly in characteristics; some, including the Mississippian culture and the Ancestral Puebloans were complex chiefdoms. Other nations which inhabited the states of the modern northern United States and Canada had less complexity and did not follow technological changes as quickly. Approximately around the year 500 during the Woodland period, Native Americans began to transition to bows and arrows from spears for hunting and warfare. Technological advancement however was uneven. During the 12th century was the widespread adoption of Corn as a staple crop in the Eastern United States. Corn would continue to be the staple crop of natives in the Eastern United States and Canada until the Colombian Exchange. 133x133px In the eastern United States, rivers were the medium of trade and communication. Cahokia located in the modern U.S State of Illinois was among the most significant within the Mississippi Culture. Focused around Monks Mound archaeology indicates the population increased exponentially after 1000 because it manufactured important tools for agriculture and cultural attractions. Around 1350 Cahokia was abandoned, environmental factors have been proposed for the city's decline. At the same time Ancestral Puebloans constructed clusters of buildings in the Chaco Canyon site located in the State of New Mexico. Individual houses may have been occupied by more than 600 residents at any one time. Chaco Canyon was the only pre-Columbian site in the United States to build paved roads. Pottery indicates a society that was becoming more complex, turkeys for the first time in the continental United States were also domesticated. Around 1150 the structures of Chaco Canyon were abandoned, likely as a result of severe drought. There were also other Pueblo complexes in the Southwestern United States. After reaching climaxes native complex societies in the United States declined and did not entirely recover before the arrival of European Explorers.  Mesoamerica  Toltec leftAt the beginning of the global Post Classic Period, the city of Teotihuacan was at its zenith, housing over 125,000 people, at 500 A.D it was the sixth largest city in the world at the time. The city's residents built the Pyramid of the Sun the third largest pyramid of the world, oriented to follow astronomical events. Suddenly in the 6th and 7th centuries, the city suddenly declined possibly as a result of severe environmental damage caused by extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536. There is evidence that large parts of the city were burned, possibly in a domestic rebellion. The city's legacy would inspire all future civilizations in the region. At the same time was Classic Age of the Mayan Civilization clustered in dozens of city states on the Yucat√°n and modern day Guatemala. The most significant of these cities were Chichen Itza which often fiercely competed with its neighbors to be the dominant economic influence in the region. The Mayans had an upper caste of priests, who were well versed in astronomy, mathematics and writing. The Mayan developed the concept of zero, and a 365-day calendar which possibly pre-dates its creation in Old-World societies. After 900, many Mayan cities suddenly declined in a period of drought.197x197px The Toltec Empire arose from the Toltec culture, and were remembered as wise and benevolent leaders. One priest-king called Ce Acatl Topiltzin advocated against human sacrifice. After his death in 947, civil wars of religious character broke out between those who supported and opposed Topiltzin's teachings. Modern historians however are skeptical of the extent of Toltec and influence and believe that much of the information known about the Toltecs was created by the later Aztecs as an inspiration myth. In the 1300s, a small band of violent, religious radicals called the Aztecs began minor raids throughout the area. Eventually they began to claim connections with the Toltec civilization, and insisted they were the rightful successors. They began to grow in numbers and conquer large areas of land. Fundamental to their conquest, was the use of political terror in the sense that the Aztec leaders and priests would command the human sacrifice of their subjugated people as means of humility and coercion. Most of the Mesoamerican region would eventually fall under the Aztec Empire. On the Yucat√°n Peninsula most of the Mayan People continued to be independent of the Aztecs but their traditional civilization declined. Aztec developments expanded cultivation, applying the use of chinampas, irrigation, and terrace agriculture; important crops included maize, sweet potatoes, and avocados. In 1430 the city of Tenochtitlan allied with other powerful Nahuatl speaking cities- Texcoco and Tlacopan to create the Aztec Empire otherwise known as Triple-Alliance. Though referred to as an empire the Aztec Empire functioned as a system of tribute collection with Tenochtitlan at its center. By the turn of the 16th century \\"flower wars\\" between the Aztecs and rival states such as Tlaxcala had continued for over fifty years.  South America  South American civilization was concentrated in the Andean region which had already hosted complex cultures since 2,500 BC. East of the Andean region, the natives were generally semi nomadic. Discoveries on the Amazon River Basin indicate the region likely had a pre-contact population of five million people and hosted complex societies. Around the continent numerous agricultural peoples from Colombia to Argentina steadily advanced from 500 AD until European contact.  Andean Region  alt= During Ancient times the Andean Region had developed civilizations independent of outside influences including that of Mesoamerica.Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), Encyclopedia of the Incas, New York: Rowand & Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite 6 or 7 pristine civilizations. Through the Post Classical era a cycle of civilizations continued until Spanish contact. Collectively Andean societies lacked currency, a written language and solid draft animals enjoyed by old world civilizations. Instead Andeans developed other methods to foster their growth, including use of the quipu system to communicate messages, lamas to carry smaller loads and an economy based on reciprocity. Societies were often based on strict social hierarchies and economic redistribution from the ruling class. In the first half of the Post Classical Period the Andean Region was dominated by two almost equally powerful states. In the North of Peru was the Wari Empire and in the South of Peru and Bolivia there was the Tiwanaku empire both of whom were inspired by the earlier Moche People. While the extent of their relationship to each other is unknown, it is believed that they were in a Cold-War with one another, competing but avoiding direct conflict to avoid mutual assured destruction. Without war there was prosperity and around the year 700 Tiwanaku city hosted a population of 1.4. million.Kolata, Alan L. Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara, Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 1996 After the 8th century both states declined due to changing environmental conditions, laying the ground work for the Incas to emerge as a distinct culture centuries later. In the 15th century the Inca Empire rose to annex all other nations in the area. Led by their, sun-god king, Sapa Inca, they slowly conquered what is now Peru, and built their society throughout the Andes cultural region. The Incas spoke the Quechua languages. The Incas used the advances created by earlier Andean societies. Incas have been known to have used abacuses to calculate mathematics. The Inca Empire is known for some of its magnificent structures, such as Machu Picchu in the Cusco region. The empire expanded quickly northwards to Ecuador, Southwards to central Chile. To the north of the Inca Empire remained the independent Tairona and Musica Confederation who practiced agriculture and gold metallurgy.  Oceania  Micronesian navigational chart, these were used by Polynesians to navigate through wind and water currents. Separate from developments in Afro-Eurasia and the Americas the region of greater Oceania continued to develop independently of the outside world. In Australia, the society of Aborigines and Melanesia changed little through the Post Classical Period since their arrival in the area from Africa around 50,000 BC. The only outside contact were encounters with fishermen of Indonesian origin. Polynesian and Micronesian Peoples are rooted from Taiwan and Southeast Asia and began their migration into the Pacific Ocean from 3000 to 1500 BC. During Post-classical Times the Micronesian and the Polynesian peoples constructed cities in some areas such as Nan Madol and Mu'a. Around 1200 AD the Tu'i Tonga Empire spread its influence far and wide throughout the South Pacific Islands, being described by academics as a maritime chiefdom which used trade networks to keep power centralized around the king's capital. Polynesians on outrigger canoes discovered and colonized some of the last uninhabited islands of earth. Hawaii, New Zealand and Easter Island were among the final places to be reached, settlers discovering pristine lands. Oral Tradition claimed that navigator Ui-te-Rangiora discovered icebergs in the Southern Ocean. In exploring and settling, Polynesian settlers did not strike at random but used their knowledge of wind and water currents to reach their destinations. Hale o Keawe, a restored Heiau in the U.S State of Hawaii, used as sacred temple and sacrificial altar. The statues represent traditional gods. Maori Waka, used for warfare and navigation in New Zealand On the settled islands some Polynesian groups became distinct from one another. A significant example being the Maori of New Zealand. Other island systems kept in contact with each other, such as Hawaii and the Society Islands. Ecologically, Polynesians had the challenge of sustaining themselves within limited environments. Some settlements caused mass extinctions of some native plant and animal species over time by hunting species such as the Moa and introducing the Polynesian Rat. Easter Island settlers engaged in complete ecological destruction of their habtiat and their population crashed afterwards possibly due to the construction of the Easter Island Statues.West, Barbara A. (2008) Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania. Infobase Publishing. p. 684. Holdaway & Jacomb (2000) Other colonizing groups adapted to accommodate to the ecology of specific islands such as the Moriori of the Chatham Islands. Europeans on their voyages visited many Pacific Islands in the 16th and 17th century, but most areas of Oceania were not colonized until after the voyages of British explorer James Cook in the 1780s. End of the period Genoese world map, 1457 it suggests the possibility of sea travel to India from Western Europe though this had not yet been done at the time. As the postclassical era drew to a close in the 15th century, many of the empires established throughout the period were in decline. The Byzantine Empire would soon be overshadowed in the Mediterranean by Italian city states such as Venice and Genoa and the Ottoman Turks. The Byzantines faced repeated attacks from eastern and western powers during the Fourth Crusade, and declined further until the loss of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The largest change came in terms of trade and technology. The global significance of the fall of the Byzantines was the disruption of overland routes between Asia and Europe. Traditional dominance of Nomadism in Eurasia declined and the Pax Mongolia which had allowed for interactions between different civilizations was no longer available. China, which had previously engaged in expansion and innovation became isolationist in the 14th century under the Ming and would remain so until the Industrial Revolution. Western Asia and South Asia were conquered by gunpowder empires which successfully utilized advances in military technology but closed the Silk Road. Classical Roman Empire to an end. |alt=|200x200px Europeans ‚Äì specifically the Kingdom of Portugal and various Italian explorers ‚Äì intended to replace land travel with sea travel. Originally European exploration merely looked for new routes to reach known destinations.DeLamar 1992 Portuguese Explorer Vasco De Gama traveled to India by sea in 1498 by circumnavigating Africa around the Cape of Good Hope. India and the coast of Africa were already known to Europeans but none had attempted a large trading mission prior to that time. Due to navigation advances Portugal would create a global colonial empire beginning with the conquest of Malacca in modern-day Malaysia from 1511. Other Explorers such as the Spanish sponsored Italian Christopher Columbus intended to engage in trade by traveling on unfamiliar routes west from Europe. The subsequent European discovery of the Americas in 1492 resulted in the Colombian exchange and the world's first pan-oceanic globalization. Spanish Explorer Ferdinand Magellan performed the first known circumnavigation of Earth in 1521. The transfer of goods and diseases across oceans was unprecedented in creating a more connected world.. From developments in navigation and trade modern history began.

Immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, the designation of Commander-in- Chief, Africa was changed to Commander-in-Chief South Atlantic, '..and the Admiral transferred his flag from Simonstown to Freetown, Sierra Leone, and assumed general naval control over British movements in the whole of the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time the South Atlantic Division of the America and West Indies Squadron, comprising the cruisers Exeter and Ajax, was transferred to the new South Atlantic Station.'The Royal New Zealand Navy, Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War, Chapter 2: Outbreak of War: Cruise of HMS Achilles, Historical Publications Branch, Wellington, 1956 (hardcopy page 29). It was sometimes referred to as the South Atlantic Station. History The South Atlantic Station existed during and after the Second World War having been redesignated from the Commander-in-Chief, Africa. Its area of responsibility covered the Atlantic Ocean south of a line drawn between the northern French West African (now Mauritanian) border and French Guiana and the Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean east of a line drawn south from the western entrance to the Magellan Strait and west of a line drawn south from the South African/ Mozambican border. The South Atlantic Station had bases at Freetown and Simonstown.

Thus Achilles arrived in the South Atlantic and joined Commodore Harwood's force, later to take part in the Battle of the River Plate against the Graf Spee. In 1955 the new Simonstown Agreement on naval cooperation between the UK and the Union of South Africa was agreed after much discussion. It was planned to include: *the combined use of Simon's Town by the Royal Navy and South African Navy in peace and in war (even if South Africa were neutral in some non-Communist war, a most remote contingency), on the understanding that the base would also be available in war to the allies of the United Kingdom; * the gradual assumption of responsibility by the South African Navy for the operation and administration of the base for combined use; * the assumption by South Africa of responsibility in war for the operational and administrative control of a local sub-area of a South Atlantic Strategic Zone; and * that a Royal Navy officer would continue as Commander-in-Chief South Atlantic in peace, with headquarters and communications at the Cape, and that his designation in war would be Commander of the South Atlantic Strategic Zone. In April 1957 the Simonstown base was handed over to the Union of South Africa in accordance with the 1955 agreement.A.

Sidur is the creator of a style named Grob-Art (Coffin-Art). He also left a book of poetry The Happiest Autumn (–°–∞–º–∞—è –°—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤–∞—è –û—Å–µ–Ω—å) and a memoir Monuments to the Current State (–ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –°–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—é). Biography Sidur was born in Yekaterinoslav (currently Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine) to a Jewish father and Russian mother. In 1942 he was drafted into the Red Army and fought in the battles of World War II near his hometown. After being wounded in the jaw by a bullet, he was discharged as a disabled veteran. Sidur abandoned his plans to study medicine and entered Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry in Moscow instead,Biography of Sidur on the Sidur.Net site where his teachers were G.I. Motovilov and S.L. Rabinovich. In 1957 he became a member of the Union of Artists of USSR. During the early period, he created realistic ceramic sculpture. There were also such works as Heads of the Blinds, Portrait of Ernst Neizvestny cut out of rock In 1950s Sidur's art deviated from the official canon, and he completely abandoned it in 1959, developing his own art language. In the 1960s he produced the sculpture series of Monuments (–ú–æ–Ω—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã), almost all of which are now indeed public monuments in the squares of Russia and the West. In that work and the related series Disabled (–ò–Ω–≤–∞–ª–∏–¥—ã), he tried to condense artistic form to a symbol, a sign, or a formula. Later he worked on his own philosophy centered around the artist, prophet of future global catastrophes. An incarnation of this idea in art became his style of Grob-Art, that Sidur saw as a new direction in art. In 1974 he worked on the book Monuments to the Current State (–ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –°–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—é) that he self-described as a myth. He also shot an underground movie based on the book. He worked on sculpture series Man and Woman, Motherhood. In the 1980s, shortly before his death, he wrote a book of poetry titled The Most Happy Autumn (–°–∞–º–∞—è –°—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤–∞—è –û—Å–µ–Ω—å). Since the 1960s Sidur's works became known in the West. Soon he became famous. In the Soviet Union his works were not exhibited from 1950 until his death, with the exception of the one-day exhibition in the House of Writers in Moscow in 1968. After Sidur's death and with the onset of perestroika, there was established Vadim Sidur's Museum (since 1995 named Moscow State Vadim Sidur's Museum) and the artistic legacy of Sidur was recognized as a national treasure.

The type genus Nematothallus, which typifies the group, was first described by Lang in 1937, who envisioned it being a thallose plant with tubular features and sporophytes, covered by a cuticle which preserved impressions of the underlying cells. He had found abundant disaggregated remains of all three features, none of which were connected to another, leaving his reconstruction of the phytodebris as parts of a single organism highly conjectural. No reproductive or vegetative structures common to the land plants are known, and certain members of the nematophyte plexus (including Nemataplexus, axial conjugations of banded and branching tubes) seem to belong to the fungi. The lack of a clear definition of the nematophytes has led to it being used as a wastebasket taxon, with all manner of tubes and cell-patterned cuticles from around the Silurian being dubbed \\"nematophytic\\" more as a statement of ignorance than as a scientifically meaningful statement. Nematophytes, including cuticle and banded tubes, have been found in coprolites that were apparently produced by millipedes.

It was the first independent action by the RAF, and remains the only campaign named after an RAF officer. Background The defence of the North-West Frontier Province was an important task for British India. In the 1920s, the British were engaged in a continuing effort to defend British Indian Army bases against raids from militant tribesmen in the province. In July 1924, the British mounted operations against several of the Mahsud tribes in southern Waziristan and by October most tribes had ceased their activities. Only the Abdur Rahman Khel tribe and three other supporting tribes continued to attack army posts. Operations Bristol F.2B Fighters, one of the types of aircraft used in the operation After the successful use of aerial bombardment in the Fifth Expedition of Somaliland campaign in 1920, the fledgling RAF was keen to further establish its military credentials. British forces had conducted operations against Mahsud tribes in Waziristan from July 1924, leaving only the Abdur Rahman Khel tribe and a few other tribes still engaged in activity by October 1924. The air officer commanding in India, Sir Edward Ellington, made the unprecedented decision to conduct air operations against the tribesmen without the support of the army. No. 2 (India) Wing, under the command of Wing Commander Richard Pink at Risalpur, was assigned to conduct the operation. Bristol F.2B Fighters of No. 5 Squadron were deployed to the operational headquarters at Tank airstrip, with de Havilland DH.9As from 27 and 60 squadrons deployed to a forward operating base at Miranshah. Operations commenced on 9 March 1925, and following an initial sortie to drop warning leaflets on the targeted areas, the RAF squadrons strafed tribal mountain strongholds in a successful attempt to crush the rebellion. Operations focused on causing disruption to day-to-day activities for the militant tribes, as well as preventing access to safe havens; sorties were flown at night as well as during the day, in order to cause further disruption. On 1 May 1925, after just over 50 days of bombing, the tribal leaders sought peace to end the bombing, bringing the short campaign to a close. Only two British lives and one aircraft were lost during the campaign; Mahsud casualties are not known. Pink's War was the first air action of the RAF carried out independent of the British Army or Royal Navy. Honours After the campaign was over, the India General Service Medal with the Waziristan 1925 bar was awarded to the 46 officers and 214 men of the Royal Air Force who took part in Pink's War. It was by far the rarest bar given with an India General Service Medal, and was only awarded after the then-Chief of the Air Staff Sir John Salmond succeeded in overturning the War Office decision not to grant a medal for the campaign. The campaign's commander, Wing Commander Pink, after whom the action became named, soon received a promotion to group captain \\"in recognition of his services in the field of Waziristan\\". For distinguished service during Pink's War, Squadron Leader Arthur John Capel was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the Distinguished Flying Cross was awarded to flight lieutenants John Baker and William Cumming, and Flying Officer Reginald Pyne, and the Distinguished Flying Medal was given to sergeant pilots George Campbell and Ralph Hawkins, Sergeant Arthur Rutherford, Corporal Reginald Robins, and Leading Aircraftman Alfred Walmsley. A further 14 men were mentioned in despatches, including flying officers Edward Dashwood and Noel Hayter-Hames, who both lost their lives in the campaign.

As well as the temple, there is also a conference centre, campground, forest huts and cabins, offices, retreat grounds, residential spiritual community of the order, Mountain Conference Center and the Abode Organic Farm. The Order grew from the work of an Indian Sufi mystic, Inayat Khan, as he was known to his followers. He was charged by his Mursheed (spiritual teacher) to make the principles of Sufism known to the West, in pursuance of which he came West on the eve of the First World War. The war found him in the Kremlin with his American wife, and where one of his daughters was born. He was known in spiritual and occult circles in the West in the 1920s, in particular in England, France and Holland. Time, and the explosion of 'new age' and eastern spirituality in the 1960s, have tended to obscure his original eminence in these esoteric circles. The Orders still exist in Suresnes, Paris and at Murad Hassil, Katwick, Netherlands. In spite of his Islamic origins very few, if any, in his successor Orders are practicing Muslims. His fundamental idea was \\"The unity of religious ideals\\", or, more mundanely, the commonality of religious and spiritual experience.

Based in Sydney, he played a major role in shaping the evolution of Australian jazz. He taught at the Jazz Studies course at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and also became Head of Jazz Studies during the late 1970s. Biography Born in Portsmouth, England in 1948, Frampton began learning piano and saxophone at an early age and by the age of 15 he had formed his own modern jazz group which played in local clubs, also performing with top English jazz musicians such as Don Rendel, Bill Le Sage and Joe Harriott. He migrated to Australia with his family in December 1966 and in the following year joined the experimental electronic music group Teletopa and also AZ Music, which performed the works of John Cage, Steve Reich and others. Frampton toured overseas with Teletopa in 1972, playing in London at the International Carnival of Experimental Sound, at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and in Munich, Manila, Tokyo, Amsterdam and Cambridge.The Biographical Directory of Australian Composers (Australian Music Centre, 1996) On returning to Australia, he formed a trio, the Jazz Co/op, along with Sydney drummer Phil Treloar and bassist Jack Thorncraft. In 1974 this trio was expanded to a quartet when joined by US saxophonist Howie Smith who was in Sydney for three years, setting up Australia‚Äôs first formal jazz course at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. The Jazz Co/op was in demand in Sydney over the following two years. It played over thirty engagements at Sydney‚Äôs major jazz club of that time, The Basement, as well as many other performances including the Musician‚Äôs Club, Sydney Town Hall, the Sydney Opera House, and the Conservatorium of Music. The band also recorded two albums for Horst Liepolt‚Äôs ‚Äú44‚Äù record label. Howie Smith returned to the USA in 1976 and the Jazz Co/op soon disbanded. Frampton continued to play jazz in Sydney in a variety of situations, both as a sideman and as leader of his own groups. He formed the quartet ‚ÄúIntersection‚Äù in the early 1980s. This group included Phil Treloar on drums, Peter Boothman or Guy Strazzullo on guitar and Lloyd Swanton or Steve Elphick on bass. Intersection performed regularly at Jenny‚Äôs Wine Bar, appeared at concerts at the Australian Museum and the Manly Jazz Festival, and undertook a Musica Viva sponsored tour of India. In 1980 he performed with the Bruce Cale Quartet with Dale Barlow (saxes) Bruce Cale (bass) and Phil Treloar (drums). Two live concerts by this group have been recorded, The Bruce Cale Quartet Live (Adelaide concert) and On Fire - The Sydney Concert. These recordings feature some of the best examples of Frampton's work as a pianist, saxophonist and composer. In the late 1980s and during the 1990s, Frampton performed to critical acclaim with Ten Part Invention (touring Russia with that band), the trio The Engine Room with John Poch√©e and Steve Elphick, and with renowned US jazz musicians such as Don Rader, Steve Lacy and Lee Konitz. His work during this period, as a pianist, saxophonist and composer, has been extensively recorded, with a number of releases available on the Tall Poppies and ABC Classics labels. In 1991 he was awarded an APRA Award for jazz composition. He was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, but nevertheless continued to perform with various ensembles, and was awarded a Doctorate of Creative Arts from Wollongong University in 1999 for his thesis exploring co-relations between his own composition and improvisation. He participated in the 1999 Wangaratta Festival of Jazz, performing a concert of his own music with Ten Part Invention. Frampton died at home in January 2000 and was survived by his daughter Emily and partner Sherylene Robinson.

Since Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, the UK's Hungarian population has grown significantly, with the Hungarian-born population rising from 13,000 in 2001 to 52,000 in 2011. This is estimated to have increased to 80,000 in 2015 (with 30,000 living in London), with Reuters reporting in 2016 that 95,000 Hungarians were working in the UK.Hungarian immigrant workers in UK won't be affected by Brexit: Hungarian PM History The first Hungarian student known by name to have matriculated at Oxford University was one Nicolaus de Ungeria, and it is likely that he spent some time in London. Scores of Hungarian students came to study at English and Scottish universities, but the first to settle in London for good was J√°nos B√°nffyhunyadi (1576‚Äì1646) in 1608. He dabbled in alchemy and became a lecturer in chemistry at Gresham College. Marrying an Englishwoman, he had a house in London, and was often visited by fellow countrymen passing through. In 1659, after a short spell in Oxford, P√°l J√°szber√©nyi settled in London, where he opened a public school for the children of noblemen. He taught them Latin, using innovative techniques. One of the most resourceful scholars who made their home in London at the time of Pepys and Wren was J√°nos Mezolaki. He was teaching Latin and philosophy, and died as a patient of Bedlam, in 1693.A study of the history of Hungarian refugee movements over the 20th century As with other displaced persons from Central Europe, many Hungarians came to Britain during and after World War II. Furthermore, up to 200,000 Hungarians left their home country after the revolution of 1956, and settled in other countries across the Western world ‚Äî especially those that formed the Western Bloc. This included refugees to the UK,\\"Hungary's 1956 brain drain\\" such as the actor Sandor El√®s. Since Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, the UK's Hungarian population has grown significantly. It was estimated that 13,159 Hungarian-born people were resident in the UK at the time of the 2001 UK Census. According to the 2011 census there were 48,308 Hungarian-born residents in England and Wales. 17,803 were in London where they made up 0.22% of the population. Just 576 were in North East England, making up 0.02% of the population there. The Hungarian- born population in England and Wales was 0.5% of the population of Hungary. By comparison the Polish-born population of 579,121 was 1.5% of the population of Poland. The Polish-born population is more spread-out around England and Wales. 55% of the Hungarian-born population were in London and South East England, compared to 41% of the Polish-born population and 30% of the total population. There were also 2,943 Hungarian-born residents in Scotland out of a total population of 5,295,403 (0.06%), and 999 Hungarian-born residents in Northern Ireland out of a total population of 1,810,863 (0.06%). This gives a 2011 census total for the whole of the United Kingdom of 52,250. The Office for National Statistics estimated that in 2015 there were 80,000 Hungarian- born people resident in the UK: 38,000 males and 42,000 females. Of these, 71,000 were estimated to be in England, 2000 in Wales, 6000 in Scotland, and 1000 in Northern Ireland. 30,000 were estimated to be living in London, with a further 8000 in South East England.

The village is centered on a church (built around year 1270) and a village pond. The village is situated between the cities Faxe and Store Heddinge. The distance to the city K√∏ge is 25 km. Smerup is parish- of-ease to the neighboring village Store Spjellerup, but is itself church city for the larger neighboring village Store Tor√∏je. 7 farms outside the village limits remain active, while the village numbers 4 shut down farms and about 30 old houses with approximately 50-100 residents of all ages. Bus connections are scarce. Nearest shopping is available in the city Karise (4 km). Spjellerup-Smerup Central School is found 2 km south of the village. From a distance you see the white church tower; the rest of the village is covered between plantations. An annual civic festival is held which is very popular. The village is a genuine Stevns-village, since it is placed on the eastern side of Stevns √Ö. Administratively though, Smerup belongs to Faxe municipality.  History  Smerup is an old village from the years 1000-1100. This is witnessed in the local archive in the year 1310, where the village is named Smith-Thorp. Originally Smerup was a farming village, and all 11 farms were copyhold farms under the manor Vemmetofte. In addition to the 11 farms in the old village and their families, there were a small number of houses inhabited by landless lodgers and workmen (blacksmith, carpenter, weaver etc.). The farming village is described in detail from around year 1700 with information about residents, land area, buildings and livestock etc. In the summer 1746, 6 farms and 2 houses were caught in a fire, but the farms were rebuilt within a few years. The oldest map of Smerup is from 1790,:File:Smerup5 Map1790.jpg whereas parish registers can be found from 1726.:File:Smerup12 Parish1726 3.jpg Moreover, census papers from 1787 have been preserved, which document a population of 126 persons in Smerup at that time.:File:Smerup10 Census1787 4.jpg As a result of the big land reforms in the late 18th century, the farms of Smerup were moved out into the open country in 1830. The ancient village community had come to an end, and the farms were placed near their respective lands. At the same time, ownership of the land was changed in a way where freehold replaced copyhold. Farms were originally named after each copyholder, but were also numbered 1-11 by the administration in Vemmetofte. After freehold was introduced, each freeholder could name his own farm. These names, including 'Tungepil', '√Öbjerg', 'Dyrlund' etc., are still used today. In the 20th century only two houses were built in Smerup and since then only 1 new house was built in 2006. All other houses are from the 18th and 19th centuries. When the co-op was shut down in 1971 the village became quieter. But in recent years a generational change has taken place which has brought young families with children to the village.

The Ealing Trailfinders first team finished as champions in National League 1 for season 2012‚Äì13 and won promotion, for the first time, to the second tier of the English rugby union leagues, the RFU Championship. After one season they finished in twelfth place and were relegated back to National League 1. The Men's Section runs four teams, competing in The Shield and the Middlesex Merit Leagues, and Middlesex Veterans League. The Academy and Youth Sections are for players aged 13 to 23 and the new Academy feeds players directly into senior rugby.

The mini and youth sections have teams in several age groups with over 750 registered players, making it the biggest club in Middlesex and one of the largest in the country. The club's junior teams are regular winners of County Festivals, and champions of the Herts and Middlesex Leagues for Youth Rugby. The club has developed a pathway for female players starting at 10 and running through to U18. Known as the Emeralds, this section has provided players to the England Elite Programme. The club has also seen players develop through the new structures to play for England and U.S. History 1869 ‚Äì 1995 The team played its first match in 1869 on Ealing Common, prior to the founding of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The early years saw regular fixtures against the likes of Wasps, London Irish, Harlequins, Richmond and Blackheath with 75% win rate for a long period. Between 1894 and 1958 the club moved location numerous times ‚Äì Hanger Lane ‚Äì West Middlesex Polo Club ‚Äì Gunnersbury Park ‚Äì Drayton Green ‚Äì Syon Lane, Horsenden Hill. Ealing Rugby Club's centenary match was played against Harlequins in 1970. In the 1970s and ‚Äô80s Ealing supplied many county level players for Middlesex. In 1987 the club finished top of London Division 1 and during the next six years was never lower than 2nd in London 1 nor higher than 10th in National 5. Ealing won the Middlesex cup three times in this period. 1995 ‚Äì present In 1996 Ealing were relegated from London 1. In response, the club formed youth and minis sections, and moved to a new ground at Trailfinders Sports Club in 1999. The Club has been awarded two RFU Presidents Awards, the first in 2007 for its work on referee development that has extended into a national programme, and the second in 2008 for coaching excellence. In 2009, the club fielded two first team players who had been developed through the Juniors. In the 2009‚Äì10, season the Club was the only team in the National Leagues to score more than 1,000 points, averaging more than 36 in each game. The club narrowly missed out on promotion to National One by losing to Barking RFC by 2 points and Rosslyn Park by 1. In 2010‚Äì11, the club started its Community Rugby programme providing coaching support and access to the game to schools and other groups throughout Ealing and West London. During this season, Ealing's winger Phil Chesters scored 70 tries which is the record for the most tries in an English Rugby season.History of the Club at official website 2007‚Äì08: National Division 3 South, 3rd place Mounts Bay 1st; Cinderford 2nd 2008‚Äì09: National Division 3 South, 3rd place London Scottish 1st; Rosslyn Park 2nd 2009‚Äì10: National League 2 South, 3rd place Barking 1st; Rosslyn Park 2ndhttp://ealingrugby.co.uk/?page_id=2652 2010‚Äì11: National League 2 South, 1st place Jersey 2nd 2011‚Äì12: National League 1, 2nd place Jersey 1st 2012‚Äì13: National League 1, 1st place Esher 2nd 2013‚Äì14: RFU Championship, 12th Midway through the season long-serving director of rugby Mike Cudmore announced that he would be stepping down at the season's end. Head coach and fly-half Ben Ward was appointed director of coaching from the start of the 2014‚Äì15 season. After fighting against relegation for the majority of the season, Ealing Trailfinders were eventually relegated on the final day of the season by one point after they lost at home to Rotherham Titans, while Jersey won away to Bedford Blues 2014‚Äì15: National League 1, 1st Ealing Trailfinders quickly established themselves in first place in National 1 and they won the title with a haul of 136 points, nine ahead of their nearest rivals Rosslyn Park. 2015-2016: RFU Championship, 11th Ealing had another tough season in life back in the Championship, however were able to beat Birmingham Moseley on the last day of the season, ensuring survival in the second division of English Rugby. 2016-2017: RFU Championship : 3rd Ealing Trailfinders announced the appointment of Alex Codling as Head Coach at Ealing, with Ben Ward being named as director of rugby. The Club also signed long time servant of London Scottish and Championship veteran Mark Bright, who became captain on a regular basis as the season progressed. Ealing's season progressed well, winning important games against strong opposition such as Cornish Pirates and Jersey reds and only losing 23-24 to eventual league winners London Irish, where Ealing were winning up until the last minute of the game. Ealing reached the Play-offs, eventually finishing 3rd, the highest league position the club had ever achieved. They faced Yorkshire Carnegie, who in the first leg beat Ealing 34-16. The 2nd leg ended 20-18 to Ealing with a standout end to end try by Luke Peters at the death. However this was not enough, as Carnegie progressed to the final (agg 52-36). 2017-2018: RFU Championship : 2nd Ealing Trailfinders started the 2017/2018 campaign after having their most successful season in the club's history. At the start of the season, Mark Bright was named Ealing's Club Captain. The Trailfinders also brought in many marquee signings, including internationals such as Andrew Durutalo, Grayson Hart, Shane O'Leary and Djustice Sears-Duru. Ealing started the season with a tight 29-28 win against Cornish Pirates. However Ealing maintained a 100% win status in the opening weeks of the season, including a 72-12 rout of London Scottish in front of Sky Sports cameras. On 1 October Ealing faced the formidable Bristol at Ashton Gate. The Trailsmen were chasing the score for most of the game thanks to early tries from Alapati Leiua and Ross McMillan, giving Bristol momentum which lasted for a large amount of the game. However Ealing fought their way back into the game thanks to a dominant Ealing pack, which allowed Alun Walker and Will Davis to score. Ealing led by one point at the 72nd minute, however a well-worked Bristol try from the halfway line and a penalty right at the death cruelly denied Ealing the win or a losing bonus point. Ealing bounced back well with an emphatic 31-8 victory against Jersey Reds and continued this impressive form, only having a small blip against Nottingham and losing by one point after conceding three tries in the early stages of the game. The Trailfinders also easily won topped their British and Irish cup pool, with impressive wins against Connacht 'A' (78-12) (71-14) and Rotherham Titans (45-10). Ealing met Bristol again in February at Vallis Way and lost controversially 27-28 in appalling conditions. Bristol were awarded a Try which (shown by the TMO) was a knock on and No.3 Sione Faletau was only given a yellow card for multiple punches to the head of an Ealing player. Although it meant that promotion hopes were dampened significantly, it meant more focus could be put on the British and Irish Cup campaign. Ealing went from strength to strength after the Bristol game, beating Jersey, Cornish Pirates (in the Quarter Final of the British and Irish Cup) and Hartpury . Most impressively, Ealing pulled off a 23-23 draw against Yorkshire Carnegie with only 19 players. At one point in the game, Ealing had 6 front rowers in the scrum and five academy players on the field. Reon Joseph, an academy player, won MOTM, with two magnificent individual tries. On 21 April Ealing faced Bedford Blues in the Semi Final of the British and Irish Cup. Another strong performance from the Trailfinders, including one of the tries of the season from Luke Carter resulted in Ealing winning 36-16 against a well-drilled Bedford team. Ealing faced Leinster 'A' in the Final on 12 May 2018. Leinster brought a strong team to Vallis Way, including Irish internationals such as Adam Byrne. A tight first few minutes saw Leinster lead 7-3 in greasy conditions. However, as the second half started, Ealing pulled away from the Irish outfit with Joe Munro scoring from a James Cordy-Redden offload. The captain Mark Bright also crashed over the line from a strongly set Ealing maul, confirming the Trailfinders cup victory. In the end Ealing came out 22-7 Victors, the last victors of the competition. Towards the end of the season Ealing announced over 25 signings, including the likes of Sam Olver, Guy Armitage, Craig Willis, Harry Sloan, Jordy Reid, and the re-signing of Andrew Durutalo (who had left earlier in the season). Ealing also released about 3/4 of their team from this season. During a Talksport Interview, Ben Ward, Director of Rugby announced that Ealing wanted promotion to the premiership due to the impending danger of ring-fencing. In order to be a premiership club, Ealing must increase the capacity of Vallis Way or ground share with a local club. Ealing 1871 Ealing Trailfinders also has an amateur team called Ealing 1871 formed in 2019. Ealing 1871 entered the English league structure for the first team during the 2019‚Äì20 season, experiencing instant success as they finished as champions of Herts/Middlesex 2 in their debut season.

He was the brother of Kentucky governor Augustus E. Willson. Personal life Byron Forceythe Willson was born April 10, 1837 in Little Genesee, Allegany County, New York. He was the eldest son of Hiram and Ann Colvin (Ennis) Willson. Though his parents addressed him as \\"Byron\\", he developed a dislike for the name, and eventually dropped it during his early manhood. In 1846, his father loaded the family and their belongings on a raft and floated down the Allegany and Ohio Rivers to Maysville, Kentucky. A year later, the family moved again, this time to Covington, Kentucky, where they lived for six years, before removing to New Albany, Indiana. This would be the last move of Hiram Willson's life. He died in 1859, and was preceded in death by his wife in 1853. Willson's father had been a Unitarian, and his mother was a Seventh Day Baptist, but Forceythe developed his own unique beliefs about spirituality. He believed that the living could communicate with the dead, and that he was a medium through which this could be accomplished. He claimed to have had a conversation with his late father some years after his death. He also maintained that he was clairvoyant, and was able to divine the contents of unopened letters, as well as some information about their authors, by placing the envelope to his forehead. In 1863, Willson married Elisabeth Conwell Smith, a poet from New Albany, Indiana. She died the following year, after the loss of their baby. Both Elisabeth, and the child are buried in Laurel, Indiana. From that time until his own death, many who were with him observed him having conversations with the spirit of his dead wife. Shortly following her death, he told a friend \\"It has left me neither afflicted nor bereaved... And strangest of yet all, the blessed Presence is at times so plain that I can scarcely believe the tender tie of her embodiment is broken.\\" Career Willson attended Antioch College in Ohio and Harvard University but was prevented from finishing a credential by the onset of tuberculosis. Instead, he became an editorial writer for the Louisville Journal (later part of the Louisville Courier-Journal.) His missives often defended the Union cause in the Civil War. He also published some of his early poetry in the Journal, including his most famous work, \\"The Old Sergeant\\", which told a real account of actual people. In 1864, Willson moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to oversee the education of his brother Augustus. On a return trip to New Albany, he was stricken with a pulmonary hemorrhage. Though he eventually recovered enough to make the return trip, he died February 2, 1867.

His sister Julia married another member, George Richmond, the father of William Blake Richmond. Tatham is most notable because after Blake's death, he looked after the poet's widow Catherine, who nominally worked as his housekeeper. After her death in 1831, he claimed that she had left him all her husband‚Äôs works. This claim brought him into conflict with another Ancient, John Linnell, who insisted that Blake's sister should have inherited them. Tatham also tried to extract paintings that Linnell himself owned, though Linnell had bought them from the artist. Shortly afterwards, Tatham joined a millenarian sect, becoming an Irvingite (follower of Edward Irving). At this time his religious dogmatism led him to destroy a significant number of Blake's works in the belief that they had been inspired by the devil. Tatham later wrote biographical literature on Blake. Tatham was both a sculptor and painter, exhibiting at the Royal Academy between 1825 and 1854. His works were characterised by their imitation of stiff early Renaissance styles, in the manner of the Ancients, though his later work became more conventional. Frederick Tatham died two days before his 73rd birthday in his home at 45 Oak Village in the Kentish Town area of Northwest London.

Kunlun Nu (, \\"The Kunlun Slave\\" or \\"The Negrito Slave\\") is a wuxia romance written by Pei Xing (Ë£¥Èìè, 825‚Äì880) during the Tang Dynasty. The hero of the tale is a Negrito slave that uses his extraordinary physical abilities to save his master's lover from the harem of a court official.

At midnight, Mo-l√™ kills the guard dogs around the compound and carries Cui on his back while easily jumping to the tops of walls and bounding from roof to roof. With the lovers reunited, Mo-l√™ leaps over ten tall walls with both of them on his back. Cui and his beloved are able to live happily together in peace because the official believes she was kidnapped by youxia and did not want to make trouble for himself by pursuing them. However, two years later, one of the official‚Äôs attendants sees the girl in the city and reports this. The official arrests Cui and, once he hears the entire story, sends men to capture the negrito slave. But Mo-l√™ escapes with his dagger (apparently his only possession) and flies over the city walls to escape apprehension. He is seen over ten years later selling medicine in the city, not having aged a single day.Liu, James J.Y. The Chinese Knight Errant. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1967 () Taoist influence Mo-l√™‚Äôs gravity defying abilities and agelessness suggests the fictional character is a practitioner of esoteric life-prolonging exercises akin to Chinese immortals. According to a tale attributed to the Taoist adept Ge Hong, some hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a naked man whose body was covered in black hair. Whenever they tried to capture him he ‚Äúleapt over gullies and valleys as if in flight, and so could not be overtaken.\\"Campany, Robert Ford.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 () After finally ambushing the man, the hunters learned it was in fact a 200 plus year old woman who had learned the arts of immortality from an old man in the forest. Still, it was popular in folktales for immortals to sell medicine in the city, just like Mo-l√™ does. The hagiography of the immortal Hu Gong (Sire Gourd) says he sold medicine in the market place during the day and slept in a magic gourd hanging in his stall at night. How the Kunlun Slave Became an Immortal The late Ming Dynasty bibliographer and playwright Mei Dingzuo (Ê¢ÖÈºéÁ•ö, 1549-1615) wrote a play entitled \\"How the Kunlun Slave Became an Immortal\\" (ÊòÜ‰ªëÂ•¥Ââë‰æ†Êàê‰ªô).

Perennis exercised an outsized influence over Commodus and was the effective ruler of the Roman Empire. In 185, Perennis was implicated in a plot to overthrow the emperor by his political rival, Marcus Aurelius Cleander, and executed on the orders of Commodus. Sources Herodian, Cassius Dio, and the Augustan History provide conflicting accounts of the rise and fall of Perennis, but all three agree on the essential points of his powerful position under Commodus and his swift execution in 185. His name also appears among the signatories on the Tabula Banasitana, dated to 177. Rise to power Perennis perhaps served as praefectus annonae during the reign of Marcus Aurelius.Franke, Thomas (Bochum), \\"Tigidius\\", Brill's New Pauly, Antiquity volumes, Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider (ed.), English Edition by: Christine F. Salazar, Classical Tradition volumes edited by: Manfred Landfester, English Edition by: Francis G. Gentry. Consulted online on 27 December 2019 The precise date of his elevation to Praetorian Prefect is uncertain. Herodian's account indicates that he did not assume the post until the accession of Commodus, but it is possible that he served as the junior partner of Publius Tarrutenius Paternus as early as 177. Paternus was alleged to have displeased Commodus by ordering the death of the emperor's lover and friend Saoterus for his questionable involvement in an assassination plot headed by Lucilla and Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus. Whatever the extent of his involvement in the removal of Paternus, Perennis thenceforth wielded enormous power as the lone prefect. Career under Commodus Herodian describes how Perennis capitalized on Commodus's distrust of the Roman Senate (following the aforementioned assassination attempt to which the Senate was linked) by destroying many powerful Senators and claiming their wealth as his own.History of the Roman Empire, Herodian, Book One, Chapter VIII So too was Perennis thought to have held ambitions of military power: soldiers were given lavish gifts in an attempt to seduce them to his cause, and his sons were appointed to commanding army roles.History of the Roman Empire, Herodian, Book One, Chapter IX The Augustan History suggests Perennis also persuaded Commodus to allow him political control, freeing the Emperor for his more hedonistic personal pursuits.Life of Commodus, Augustan History, Chapter V Downfall Herodian wrote that Perennis began to plot against Commodus. Gifts from his newly-acquired fortune were to curry favor with the army and his sons were secretly recruiting additional forces in anticipation of the coming revolt. Before they could act, however, the plot was exposed. First, during a public festival honoring Capitoline Jupiter, an unknown person took the stage before the performers and warned the emperor and the assembled crowd of Perennis' plans. He wasn't believed, and Perennis had him executed. Later, a group of soldiers came to Commodus and relayed the details of the plot, and showed him coins with Perennis' portrait that they had stolen from one of prefect's sons.History of the Roman Empire, Herodian, Book One, Chapters VIII & IXRoman History, Cassius Dio, Book Seventy Three, Chapter IX The emperor had him and his sons executed. Also instrumental in Perennis' downfall was Marcus Aurelius Cleander, who would go on to fulfill a similar role in the next period of Commodus's reign.

As of October 2016, the firm manages approximately $1 billion. Operations Knight Vinke reopened a debate about investment banking by publishing an open letter in the Financial Times calling on the Swiss bank UBS to review whether or not it should continue to own its wealth management business under the same roof as its investment bank. Signed by Eric Knight, the letter argued that the excessive risk within the UBS investment banking operations between 2007 and 2009 nearly destroyed the bank and a simplification of the group's structure would help the bank unlock its full value potential. In February 2013, Darty appointed Eric Knight to the board following a profit warning. Knight Vinke, which has a 25% stake in Darty, said it was frustrated at the pace of change, and would exercise its right to join the board with immediate effect. Knight Vinke has been an institutional investor in Eni for over 5 years and since 2009 has been calling for the state-controlled Italian oil and gas group to break itself up. It has argued that Eni's ownership of the gas pipeline operator Snam left both with the wrong capital structure; Eni was overgeared for an exploration and production company, while Snam, as a regulated utility, was undergeared. Knight Vinke played an important role in derailing a major acquisition of VNU. In late 2007, it started to challenge the strategy and governance of HSBC. In June 2009, HSBC's largest shareholder, Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), became the first major shareholder to offer public support for Eric Knight's activism, and urged HSBC to pay heed and answer questions.Top HSBC investor offers support to Knight Vinke, Reuters, 17 June 2009, (accessed 18 June 2009) History In the third quarter of 2016, Knight Vinke posted a return of 14.8% in its flagship fund when the average hedge fund returned 4.19% over the year to date. In 2016, the firm ranked 7th on Penta's Top 100 Hedge Funds.

RUNX1 is a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into mature blood cells. In addition it plays a major role in the development of the neurons that transmit pain. It belongs to the Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family of genes which are also called core binding factor-Œ± (CBFŒ±). RUNX proteins form a heterodimeric complex with CBFŒ≤ which confers increased DNA binding and stability to the complex. Chromosomal translocations involving the RUNX1 gene are associated with several types of leukemia including M2 AML. Mutations in RUNX1 are implicated in cases of breast cancer.  Gene and protein  In humans, the gene RUNX1 is 260 kilobases (kb) in length, and is located on chromosome 21 (21q22.12). The gene can be transcribed from 2 alternative promoters, promoter 1 (distal) or promoter 2 (proximal). As a result, various isoforms of RUNX1 can be synthesized, facilitated by alternative splicing. The full-length RUNX1 protein is encoded by 12 exons. Among the exons are two defined domains, namely the runt homology domain (RHD) or the runt domain (exons 2, 3 and 4), and the transactivation domain (TAD) (exon 6). These domains are necessary for RUNX1 to mediate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions respectively. The transcription of RUNX1 is regulated by 2 enhancers (regulatory element 1 and regulatory element 2), and these tissue specific enhancers enable the binding of lymphoid or erythroid regulatory proteins, therefore the gene activity of RUNX1 is highly active in the haematopoietic system. The protein RUNX1 is composed of 453 amino acids. As a transcription factor (TF), its DNA binding ability is encoded by the runt domain (residues 50 ‚Äì 177), which is homologous to the p53 family. The runt domain of RUNX1 binds to the core consensus sequence TGTGGNNN (where NNN can represent either TTT or TCA). DNA recognition is achieved by loops of the 12-stranded Œ≤-barrel and the C-terminus ‚Äútail‚Äù (residues 170 ‚Äì 177), which clamp around the sugar phosphate backbone and fits into the major and minor grooves of DNA. Specificity is achieved by making direct or water- mediated contacts with the bases. RUNX1 can bind DNA as a monomer, but its DNA binding affinity is enhanced by 10 fold if it heterodimerises with the core binding factor Œ≤ (CBFŒ≤), also via the runt domain. In fact, the RUNX family is often referred to as Œ±-subunits, together with binding of a common Œ≤-subunit CBFŒ≤, RUNX can behave as heterodimeric transcription factors collectively called the core binding factors (CBFs). The consensus binding site for CBF has been identified to be a 7 bp sequence PyGPyGGTPy. Py denotes pyrimidine which can be either cytosine or thymine.  Discovery and characterization of RUNX1  Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus discovered the transcription factor RUNX in a screen that was conducted to identify mutations that affect segment number and polarity in Drosophila. The mutation that led to presegmentation patterning defects and runted embryos was named runt. Following this discovery, the Drosophila segmentation gene runt was cloned by Gergen et al. Although the protein encoded by runt was demonstrated to exhibit nuclear translocation, it was not yet established that this protein is a transcription factor. Subsequently, in 1991, Ohki et al. cloned the human RUNX1 gene; RUNX1 was found to be rearranged in the leukemic cell DNAs from t(8;21)(q22;q22) AML patients. However, the function of human RUNX1 was not established. Soon after the discovery of the drosophila runt protein and the human RUNX1 protein, RUNX1's function was discovered. Runx1 was purified as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that regulated the disease specificity of the Moloney murine Leukemia virus. Furthermore, Ito et al. purified Runx2, the homolog of Runx1. Purified transcription factors consisted of two subunits, a DNA binding CBFŒ± chain (RUNX1 or RUNX2) and a non-DNA-binding subunit called core binding factor Œ≤ (CBFŒ≤); the binding affinity of RUNX1 and RUNX2 was significantly increased by association with CBFŒ≤.  Mouse knockout  Mice embryos with homozygous mutations on RUNX1 died at about 12.5 days. The embryos displayed lack of fetal liver hematopoiesis. Similar experiments from a different research group demonstrated that the knockout embryos die between embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5 due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system (CNS).  Participation in haematopoiesis  RUNX1 plays a crucial role in adult (definitive) haematopoiesis during embryonic development. It is expressed in all haematopoietic sites that contribute to the formation of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), including the yolk sac, allantois, placenta, para-aortic splanchnopleura (P-Sp; (the visceral mesodermal layer), aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) and the umbilical and vitelline arteries. HSPCs are generated via the hemogenic endothelium, a special subset of endothelial cells scattered within blood vessels that can differentiate into haematopoietic cells. The emergence of HSPCs is often studied in mouse and zebrafish animal models, in which HSPCs appear as ‚Äúintra-aortic‚Äù clusters that adhere to the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta. RUNX1 or CBF takes part in this process by mediating the transition of an endothelial cell to become a haematopoietic cell. There is increasing evidence that RUNX1 may also be important during primitive haematopoiesis. This is because in RUNX1 knockout mice, primitive erythrocytes displayed a defective morphology and the size of blast cell population was substantially reduced, apart from the absence of HSPCs which would result in embryonic lethality by Embryonic day (E) 11.5 ‚Äì 12.5. At a molecular level, expression of the gene RUNX1 is upregulated by the RUNX1 intronic cis-regulatory element (+23 RUNX1 enhancer). This +23 RUNX1 enhancer contains conserved motifs that encourage binding of various haematopoiesis related regulators such as Gata2, ETS factors (Fli-1, Elf-1, PU.1) and the SCL / Lmo2 / Ldb1 complex, as well as RUNX1 itself acting in an auto-regulatory loop. As mentioned before, the main role of RUNX1 is to modulate the fate of haematopoietic cells. This can be achieved by binding to the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor/ c-Mpl promoter, followed by the recruitment of transcription activators or repressors in order to promote transition of the hemogenic endothelium to HSCs, or differentiation into lineages of lower haematopoietic hierarchies. RUNX1 can also modulate its own level by upregulating the expression of Smad6 to target itself for proteolysis.  Mutations and acute myeloid leukemia  A broad range of heterozygous germline mutations in RUNX1 have been associated with Familial Platelet Disorder, a mild bleeding disorder associated with a high rate of myeloid leukemia. At least 39 forms of somatic RUNX1 mutation are implicated in various myeloid malignancies. Examples range from RUNX1 point mutations acquired from low-dose radiation leading to myelodysplastic neoplasms or therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, to chromosomal translocation of the RUNX1 gene with the ETO / MTG8 / RUNX1T1 gene located on chromosome 8q22, t(8; 21), generating a fusion protein AML-ETO, categorized as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M2. In t(8; 21), breakpoints frequently occur at intron 5 ‚Äì 6 of RUNX1 and intron 1b ‚Äì 2 of ETO, creating chimeric transcripts that inherit the runt domain from RUNX1, and all Nervy homology regions (NHR) 1-4 from ETO. As a consequence, AML-ETO retains the ability to bind at RUNX1 target genes whilst acting as a transcription repressor via the recruitment of corepressors and histone deacetylases, which is an intrinsic function of ETO. Oncogenic potential of AML-ETO is exerted because it blocks differentiation and promote self-renewal in blast cells, resulting in massive accumulation of blasts (>20%) in the bone marrow. This is further characterized histologically by the presence of Auer rods and epigenetically by lysine acetylation on residues 24 and 43. Other actions of AML-ETO that could induce leukemogenesis include downregulation of the DNA repair enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and increase in the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species, making cells that express AML- ETO more susceptible to additional genetic mutations.  Participation in hair follicle development  Runx1 was first discovered to be expressed in mouse embryonic skin. It is expressed in the epithelial compartment to control hair follicle activation from telogen to anagen through activating Wnt singaling and Lef1 levels At the same time it is expressed in the dermis where it suppresses the same targets to allow for embryogenic development of hair shaft and follicles. In the human hair follicle the expression patterns are similar to the mouse - indicating that it plays a similar role. In addition to hair follicle development, Runx1 is also implicated in skin and epithelial cancer development. Thus there are similarities across tissue in Runx1 behavior.  Interactions  RUNX1 has been shown to interact with: * C-Fos, * C-jun, * SUV39H1 * TLE1, and * VDR. * Stat3  See also  * RUNX2 * RUNX3  References   Further reading       External links   * Category:Transcription factors ","title":"RUNX1"},{"id":"13140610","text":"Cab Calloway's Jitterbug Party is a 1935 American musical short film which was released by Paramount Pictures (later sold to U.M. & M.

Geography A large village some 6 miles (9 km) southeast of Saint-Omer, on the N43 road, located on the banks of the Noeufoss√© canal, the border between the department of Nord and the Pas de Calais. The commune is close to the eastern boundary of the Helfaut plateau, a remarkable geological and ecological area, not typical of the region, which now hosts the Helfaut Nature Reserve. Its flora comprises both dry and wet heathland and some protected fauna, mostly amphibians. History The area has been populated since before Roman times, as testified by artefacts discovered in the commune. The name is probably derived from Rikiwulfinga- haim, referring to the occupation by the Viking Rikiwulf in 880, who also settled nearby Reclinghem. Various wars have been waged around the town, including the war of 1046 to 1056 between Baldwin V, Count of Flanders (the Pious) and Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, one battle of which was fought between Arques and Aire-sur-la-Lys. An artificial border was created on this occasion by digging a defensive canal called the Neufe-Fosse, which eventually became the Noeufoss√© canal.

Behavior and kinematics Neuroscientists have extensively researched human gaze behavior, with studies noting that the use of the gaze is very task- specific, but that humans typically exhibit proactive control to guide their movement. Usually, the eyes fixate on a target before the hands are used to engage in a movement, indicating that the eyes provide spatial information for the hands. The duration that the eyes appear to be locked onto a goal for a hand movement varies‚Äîsometimes the eyes remain fixated until a task is completed. Other times, the eyes seem to scout ahead toward other objects of interest before the hand even grasps and manipulates the object. Eye-guided hand movement When eyes and hands are used for core exercises, the eyes generally direct the movement of the hands to targets. Furthermore, the eyes provide initial information of the object, including its size, shape, and possibly grasping sites that are used to determine the force the fingertips need to exert to engage in a task. For sequential tasks, eye-gaze movement occurs during important kinematic events like changing the direction of a movement or when passing perceived landmarks. This is related to the task- search-oriented nature of the eyes and their relation to the movement planning of the hands and the errors between motor signal output and consequences perceived by the eyes and other senses that can be used for corrective movement. The eyes have a tendency to \\"refixate\\" on a target to refresh the memory of its shape, or to update for changes in its shape or geometry in drawing tasks that involve the relating of visual input and hand movement to produce a copy of what was perceived. In high accuracy tasks, when acting on greater amounts of visual stimuli, the time it takes to plan and execute movement increases linearly, per Fitts's law. Hand-guided saccades Humans have demonstrated the ability to aim eye movement toward the hand without vision, using the sense of proprioception, with only minor errors related to internal knowledge of limb position. It has been shown the proprioception of limbs, in both active and passive movement, result in eye saccade overshoots when the hands are being used to guide eye movement. These overshoots result from the control of eye saccades rather than previous movement of the hands in experiments. This implies that limb-based proprioception is capable of being transformed into ocular motor coordinates to guide eye saccades, which allows for the guidance of the saccades by hands and feet. Neural mechanisms The neural control of eye‚Äìhand coordination is complex because it involves every part of the central nervous system involved in vision: eye movements, touch, and hand control. This includes the eyes themselves, the cerebral cortex, subcortical structures (such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and brain stem), the spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system. Other areas involved in eye‚Äìhand coordination that have been studied most intensely are the frontal and parietal cortex areas for the control of eye saccades and hand-reach. Both of these areas are believed to play a key role in eye‚Äìhand coordination and the planning of movements during tasks. A more specific area, the parieto occipital junction, is believed to be involved in the transformation of peripheral visual input for reaching with the hands, as found via fMRI. This region in particular has subdivisions for reach, grasp, and saccades. In addition to the parieto‚Äìoccipital junction, the posterior parietal cortex is believed to play an important role in relating proprioception and the transformation of motor sensory input to plan and control movement with regard to visual input. Many of these areas, in addition to controlling saccades or reach, also show eye position signals that are required for transforming visual signals into motor commands. In addition, some of the areas involved in reach, like the medial intraparietal cortex, show a gaze-centered remapping of responses during eye movements in both monkeys and humans. However, when single neurons are recorded in these areas, the reach areas often show some saccade-related responses and the saccade areas often show some reach related responses. This may aid in eye‚Äìhand coordination or hint at the ability of cells to wire together as they're used more frequently. * Clinical syndromes Numerous disorders, diseases, and impairments have been found to result in disruption to eye‚Äìhand coordination, owing to damage to the brain itself, degeneration of the brain due to disease or aging, or an apparent inability to coordinate senses completely. Aging Impairments to eye‚Äìhand coordination have been shown in older adults, especially during high-velocity and precise movements. This has been attributed to the general degeneration of the cortex, resulting in a loss of the ability to compute visual inputs and relate them to hand movements. However, while older adults tend to take more time for these sorts of tasks, they are still able to remain just as accurate as younger adults, but only if the additional time is taken. B√°lint's syndrome B√°lint's syndrome is characterized by a complete lack of eye‚Äìhand coordination and has been demonstrated to occur in isolation to optic ataxia. It is a rare psychological condition resulting most often from damage bilaterally to the superior parieto-occipital cortex. One of the most common causes is from strokes, but tumours, trauma, and Alzheimer's disease can also cause damage. Balint's syndrome patients can suffer from 3 major components: optic apraxia, optic ataxia, and simultanagnosia. Simultanagnosia is when patients have difficulty perceiving more than one object at a time. There have been three different approaches for rehabilitation. The first approach is the adaptive or functional approach. It involves functional tasks that use a patient's strengths and abilities. The second approach is remedial approach and involves restoration of the damaged central nervous system by training perceptual skills. The last approach is multicontext approach and this approach involves practising a targeted strategy in a multiple environment with varied tasks and movement demands, along with self-awareness tasks. Optic apraxia Optic apraxia is a condition that results from a total inability of a person to coordinate eye and hand movements. Although similar to optic ataxia, its effects are more severe and do not necessarily come from damage to the brain, but may arise from genetic defects or degeneration of tissue. Optic ataxia Optic ataxia or visuomotor ataxia is a clinical problem associated with damage to the occipital‚Äìparietal cortex in humans, resulting in a lack of coordination between the eyes and hand. It can affect either one or both hands and can be present in part of the visual field or the entire visual field. Optic ataxia has been often considered to be a high-level impairment of eye‚Äìhand coordination resulting from a cascade of failures in the sensory to motor transformations in the posterior parietal cortex. Visual perception, naming, and reading are still possible, but visual information cannot direct hand motor movements. Optic ataxia has been often confused with Balint's syndrome, but recent research has shown that optic ataxia can occur independently of Balint's syndrome. Optic ataxia patients usually have troubles reaching toward visual objects on the side of the world opposite to the side of brain damage. Often these problems are relative to current gaze direction, and appear to be remapped along with changes in gaze direction. Some patients with damage to the parietal cortex show \\"magnetic reaching\\": a problem in which reaches seem drawn toward the direction of gaze, even when it is deviated from the desired object of grasp. Parkinson's disease Adults with Parkinson's disease have been observed to show the same impairments as normal aging, only to a more extreme degree, in addition to a loss of control of motor functions as per normal symptoms of the disease. It is a movement disorder and occurs when there is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons that connect the substantia nigra with the caudate nucleus. A patient's primary symptoms include muscular rigidity, slowness of movement, a resting tremor, and postural instability. The ability to plan and learn from experience has been shown to allow adults with Parkinson's to improvement times, but only under conditions where they are using medications to combat the effects of Parkinson's. Some patients are given L-DOPA, which is a precursor to dopamine. It is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and then is taken up by dopaminergic neurons and then converted to dopamine.

Club career Early career In March 2006, while still playing for Dinamo Tirana, Alikaj was given permission to go to Norway on a one-week trial at V√•lerenga Fotball. Following the trial he was not given a contract after Lars Bohinen, sporting director of the club at that time, claimed that he was not \\"good enough\\" to play for the team. Vllaznia Shkod√´r On 30 July 2009, Alikaj joined Vllaznia Shkod√´r on a one-year contract. He was presented a day later, stating: \\"To be part of a team like Vllaznia it's a pleasure for every player.\\" Kastrioti Kruj√´ After one season in Shkod√´r, on 1 September 2010, Alikaj completed a transfer to fellow Albanian Superliga side Kastrioti Kruj√´ by signing a one-year contract. Alikaj made his first appearance for Kastrioti in the opening league match against Shkumbini Peqin, playing for 54 minutes as the team kicked off the new season with a 2‚Äì2 at the neutral ground of Qemal Stafa Stadium. He missed the second matchday because the club gave him permission to go to Azerbaijan on trial with an unknown team. Kuk√´si On 9 August 2012, Alikaj joined newly promoted Albanian Superliga club Kuk√´si by signing a contract until the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. Alikaj was part of the team which made history by becoming the first Albanian team to reach the UEFA Europa League play-off round, and also the first Albanian team to pass more than a round in the competition. He contributed with seven matches as Kuk√´si was eliminated by Trabzonspor. Sk√´nderbeu Kor√ß√´ On 31 January 2014, one day after leaving Kuk√´si, Alikaj joined the rivals of Sk√´nderbeu Kor√ß√´ by signing until the end of the season, turning down offers from clubs such as Partizani Tirana and Kastrioti Kruj√´. He played his first match with the new team two days later against his former side Vllaznia Shkod√´r, entering in the last 24 minutes of a 2‚Äì1 home win, helping Sk√´nderbeu to extend the lead gap to 9 points. After winning his second consecutive title with Sk√´nderbeu Kor√ß√´, he left the club at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season through a mutual agreement to terminate his contract which was due to expire a year later in 2016. Kastrioti Kruj√´ return On 27 August 2015, Alikaj completed a transfer to Kastrioti Kruj√´ by signing a one-year contract despite being the target of several top flight clubs. During the 2014‚Äì15 season, he served as team captain, and concluded the season with 27 appearances, including 25 in league, scoring 4 goals in the process, as Kastrioti failed to clinch a spot for the Albanian Superliga next season. Elbasani On 13 September 2016, Alikaj joined fellow Albanian First Division side Elbasani by signing a one-year contract, having begun training with the team days before. In December 2016, he along with the rest of the team boycotted the training after not getting paid for months. In an interview, he stated that the club didn't pay him, and that he was one of the five players to urge other players to boycott the training. He was suspended by the club for his actions along with the other four players. Shortly after, he officially terminated his contract with the club, becoming a free agent in the process. Dinamo Tirana return In January 2017, Alikaj begun training with Dinamo Tirana. On 2 February, he officially returned to the club for the first time after 11 years by signing until the end of the season. He made his return debut two days later in the match against Sopoti Librazhd by playing in the last 30 minutes of a goalless draw. Alikaj scored his first goal for Dinamo in his second appearance six days later, netting the final goal of a 3‚Äì1 win at Apolonia Fier. International career A former Albania youth international, Alikaj made his competitive debut with the under-21 squad on 1 April 2003 against Republic of Ireland for the qualifiers of 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He played the whole match as Albania won 1‚Äì0 at Selman St√´rmasi Stadium thanks to an Erjon Rizvanolli winner. Alikaj made only one appearance during the tournament, as Albania had the best result since 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, when it had won the group, as it left two teams behind (Republic of Ireland and Georgia), but was preceded by Switzerland and Russia, and thus failed to qualify to the main tournament. Personal life Alikaj is a practising Muslim. He has said: \\"I have fasting for many years and for me it is usual now, I do not feel any obstacle in my activity as a footballer.

He has also had small parts in other television series. On 12 April 2011, Regan was charged with the murder of a doorman in Liverpool and remanded in custody to await trial. He was cleared of the murder early the following year but was still imprisoned for nearly five years on a lesser charge. Early life and career Regan attended Yew Tree Comprehensive School in Dovecot on the outskirts of Liverpool. He trained as an actor at the Liverpool Playhouse and, in addition to his role in Brookside, has also appeared on television in The Bill, Paparazzo and Murphy's Mob. He also appeared in the early years of Sky TV's Soccer AM as 'The Cat'. He joined the cast of Brookside in 1982, first appearing in episode six. The character of Terry Sullivan was featured in some of the soap's most dramatic storylines, and he was a regular mainstay of the soap until he finally left the series in February 1997.

He was a sub-divisional officer of Habiganj during the Bangladesh Liberation War when he decided to join the war. Later he served as an official of the Mujibnagar Government. After independence, he joined back the civil service and reached to the highest post of Cabinet Secretary. In the meanwhile, he also worked as a university teacher. Towards the end of 2006, he became one of the advisers of the Caretaker Government led by President Iajuddin Ahmed. He resigned along with three other advisers, namely, Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, C M Shafi Sami and Sultana Kamal which went against democracy and helped Lt. Gen. Moeen U Ahmed to take over power in disguise in January 2007 that lasted two years. Sheikh Hasina claimed that Khan and his these associates failed to hold elections and thrown country into dark by resigning from Iajuddin Ahmed's Caretaker Government. In October 2007, the Government of Bangladesh constituted a Regulatory Reforms Commission (RRC) with him as the chair. Following pressure from the government, he had to quit RRC.  Early life and education Khan was born in Nabinagar, Brahmanbaria, a sub-division of the-then Comilla district. He attended Nabinagar Pilot High School. He passed I.Sc. from Dhaka College in 1961. He then studied history at the University of Dhaka and completed his bachelor's and master's from there in 1964 and 1965 respectively, with first class, topping list on both the occasions. Before joining the then Civil Services of Pakistan he served as a teacher in BUET for some time. After a foundation course at the Civil Service Academy in Lahore (1967‚Äì68), he was posted as the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of now defunct sub-district Habiganj in 1969. His uncle Yakub Ali Khan was a former Gov High official. Career  During Bangladesh liberation war  Khan actively participated in the civil disobedience movement in March 1971 before the commencement of the war of liberation on 25 March 1971. When the war began, he decided to supply ammunition to the guerrilla fighters, yet in the capacity of the SDO of Habiganj. As the Mujibnagar government was yet to be formed and war of liberation remained to be formally launched, many police officers disagreed to give arms and ammunition without a written order. Khan fearlessly gave written note ordering to provide the freedom fighters with food and money. Collecting from the sub-divisional treasury, he arranged to send nearly three Crore taka to Agartala by a truck to help run the Bangladesh Government to be formed on 17 April 1971. Later he left Bangladesh, the then East Pakistan, and moved to Agartala, India across the border to physically participate in the war of liberation. He said, \\"After reaching Agartala we focused on building up an 'eastern administration'. Our main aim was to support the freedom fighters and to help the refugees who had escaped Bangladesh and lived in camps. We established a connection with the Mujibnagar Government after a few months of its formation on 17 April 1971. During the initial months, we had to struggle single-handedly\\". In July, he was asked to come to Kolkata (Calcutta) to join the government. There he began working at the Cabinet division as a deputy secretary. Later, in August, he was transferred to Defense Ministry.  After 1971  After the independence of Bangladesh in the December 1971, Akbar Ali Khan was appointed in the Establishment Ministry of the government of Bangladesh. He worked there for six months and helped in the rehabilitation of the freedom fighters and also people who came back from Pakistan. From there he was transferred to the Education Ministry. In 1973 he decided to retire to take up teaching again as the profession. Although he submitted his resignation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the then prime minister of the country, did not accept it. Instead, he was granted leave of absence with a lien to teach in a university. He taught at the Jahangirnagar University until receiving the Commonwealth Scholarship to pursue higher education. He studied at the Queen's University, Canada for PhD in Economics. Upon his return to Bangladesh in 1979, he was shortly promoted to Associate Professor of the Jahangirnagar University. However, eventually, he left teaching and returned to Bangladesh Civil Service. In 1984, he joined the Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC) as a member of the directing staff (MDS). Thereafter, until 1987, he worked at the Rural Development Board, in the Water Resource Ministry and in the Bangladesh Public Service Commission. Later he was appointed in the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington, D.C. as its economic minister. After completion of his tenure in Washington, Dr. Khan returned home and joined the Banking Division of the Finance Ministry as an Additional Secretary. During the period he re-organized BCCI Bank and took over BASIC Bank. He worked in the Environmental Ministry before his promotion as a permanent secretary to the government in 1993. In the capacity of Secretary, Internal Resources Division, he worked as the Chairman of the National Board of Revenue until 1995. Between 1995 and 2001, he worked as the Finance Secretary of the country. As he retired, government chose to nominate him as Alternative Executive Director of the World Bank, Washington where he served till 2005.  Dhaka University scandals  During the period of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Prime Ministership, a scandal arose in the Dhaka University teachers about being Rajakar or not. As the Prime Minister asked the Education Minister to make an inquiry into the matter, he handed it over to Khan. Khan was apprehensive about this investigation as the law rejects the investigation which discarded it. So he filed an investigation as he was ordered and provided a note mentioning about his opposing points. Perusing his note of dissent, President Abu Sayeed Chowdhury asked the Education Minister to convince Prime Minister about Khan's points. In this connection, Dr. Khan said, \\"Every time I did not like or felt something that was against the law, I gave written notes, and in most cases, my experience is saying it was bound to be accepted\\".  Current works  Retiring from World Bank, Khan established Centre for Government Studies at the BRAC University. Currently, he is working there as a visiting professor. Recently he has become a public face as he appears in different TV Talk Shows to explain the current political and economic situation of the country. Besides, he is researching the historic and economic process of the country. On 30 October 2007, Khan was appointed the chairman of the Regulatory Reform Commission to modernise old and ineffective laws of the country. However, he resigned from the post of Chairman of Regulatory Reforms Commission on 16 October 2009 citing the cause that the government is not co-operating with the work of the Commission. Khan has been serving as a trusty board member of Transparency International Bangladesh since 2013.

She was also a politician of the former governing National Party in her own right. De Klerk was murdered in her Cape Town home in 2001.  Biography   Personal life  The graves of Prof W.A. Willemse and his daughter Marike de Klerk in the Pretoria West Cemetery. Her date of birth is March 29, 1937 and her date of death December 3, 2001. Marike was born into an upper-middle class Afrikaner family in Pretoria. Her father, Wilhelm Willemse, was an academic and writer. He was Professor of Social Pathology and Psychology at University of Pretoria. Marike met her future husband, F. W. de Klerk, at Potchefstroom University (where she was studying for a degree in commerce). The couple later married and adopted three children together; Jan, Willem, and Susan. In 1983 Marike came under fire over comments she made about the Coloured community: \\"You know, they are a negative group ... a non-person. They are the people that were left after the nations were sorted out. They are the rest.\\" In 1991 she became embroiled in a personal drama when the South African press revealed that her son, Willem was in an 18-month-long relationship with a coloured woman, Erica Adams. Adams was also from a political background, her father being a politician for the Labor Party. Willem's romance with Erica upsets Marike was the headline published by the Sunday Times. Willem was reportedly under pressure from his mother to end the inter-racial romance, the couple ended their engagement in 1992 and Willem married another woman the following year. Marike was later unhappy with housing arrangements during South Africa's transition to democracy. It was originally intended that after the election in 1994, she and the president would stay in the Libertas home and Nelson Mandela would take up residence in another home known as the Presidency. Mandela later said that he was under pressure from his political party, the ANC to take up residence at Libertas. Therefore, the de Klerks would instead move to the Presidency. Mandela then told the de Klerks that senior colleagues wanted to use the Presidency for other uses. Therefore, they moved into Overvaal, the former home of Transvaal's administrators. Overvaal needed substantial refurbishing and Marike was angry that Mandela carried out a personal inspection to decide what the home needed, costs that the public works department would meet. FW de Klerk later said: \\"She was deeply distressed by all the chopping and changing which she interpreted as a calculated attempt by Mandela himself to humiliate us... This latest humiliation became too much for her to swallow. She became very critical of Mandela and did not hesitate to voice her criticism.\\" The de Klerks later attended Mandela's inauguration as president at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Melanie Verwoerd would later recount that Marike was the only person sitting in the packed public gallery as Mandela entered the room and those around her rose and clapped. One MP implored the former first lady to acknowledge the occasion: 'Get up Marike, you are rude!' Marike remained seated and glared at the MP. In 1994, FW de Klerk began an affair with Elita Georgiades, the wife of Tony Georgiades, a Greek shipping tycoon who had allegedly given de Klerk and the National Party financial support. FW and Marike's marriage ended in 1996 with FW announcing on Valentine's Day that he intended to divorce his wife of 37 years. Marike was opposed to the divorce: 'If you change your mind, I'll forgive everything - up to 70 times seven.' However FW replied: 'I'm certain about my decision. Stop hoping.' F. W. de Klerk married Georgiades a week after his divorce to Marike was official. In 2000, she faced further emotional upheaval when her relationship with her fianc√© and businessman Johan Koekemoer, collapsed. When the media revealed that he was facing impending bankruptcy, Marike de Klerk defended her fianc√©, but soon after he faced a nervous breakdown and checked into a Pretoria clinic. In the later years of her life, she battled depression.  Career  During her husband's presidency, Marike was the leader of the National Party's women's wing. She also founded the Women's Outreach Foundation (WOF), an organisation that focused on the upliftment of rural women. In 1990 de Klerk called for women to play a more active role in the political process. In 1993, she was awarded the Woman for Peace Award in Geneva, Switzerland for promoting the well being and development of rural women. In 1994, de Klerk and her entourage travelled to the United States for a tour of new educational projects in Los Angeles designed to interest African-Americans in science. The WOF was frequently in the news in the 1990s for criticising corruption among ANC leaders. The war of words between the ruling party and the former first lady escalated when the party dismissed her as \\"a bitter person unable to come to terms with the fact that she is an ex- first lady of this country.\\" In 1998, de Klerk published her autobiography, A Journey Through Summer and Winter, in which she explored her marriage of 39 years with FW de Klerk. The book later earned some notoriety after it emerged that FW had censored a chapter that deals with her heartbreak after discovering her husband's affair with Elita Georgiades. Later de Klerk published A Place Where the Sun Shines Again where she offered guidance to women facing divorce later in life.  Murder  On 3 December 2001, Marike de Klerk was murdered at her Dolphin Beach apartment in Blouberg, Cape Town. It was originally reported that the former first lady had taken her own life. Her killer, 21 year-old Luyanda Mboniswa, worked as a security guard in the luxury secure complex where Marike was living. Mboniswa violently gripped de Klerk's neck, breaking several bones in her throat and causing a blood vessel to burst in her eye.

He is best known for his portraits and still-lifes; mostly of floral arrangements. The famous portrait painter, Vicente L√≥pez Porta√±a, was his brother-in-law.  Biography  He studied with Benito Espin√≥s, in the School of Flowers and Ornamentation at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos de Valencia. In 1803, he was named an Academician of Merit for flower painting there and, in 1811, received the same title for history painting.P√©rez S√°nchez (1983), p. 214. While there, he worked at the Estudio de Flores, where he created designs for the silk industry. In 1812, he was appointed an Assistant Professor of painting at the Academia but, in 1814, failed to succeed Espin√≥s as a Professor. Due to this, in 1815, following the Peninsular War, he moved to Madrid, where he presented the King with several canvases depicting the King's recent triumphal return. This earned him a royal appointment. He eventually had to return to Valencia, due to his parents' poor health, but continued to submit paintings to the court; receiving an annual pension of 600 Ducats.Alba, pp. 341-344 In 1821, he was named Director of Painting at the Academia and, two years, became General Director. After the death of King Ferdinand, he continued to be associated with the court; becoming the favorite painter of the Regent, Maria Christina. Following the Confiscation of 1836, he was entrusted with the collection of works that came into the government's possession from the , which now forms part of the Museu de Belles Arts de Valencia. He oversaw the career of his son, Jos√© Felipe (1824-1864), who also became a painter. He died while accompanying Jos√©p on a trip to Madrid; to present his works to Queen Isabella II. His works may be seen at the Museu de Belles Artes, the Royal Palace of Madrid and Valencia cathedral, among others.  References   Further reading  * Alfonso E.

Several other Friends lay under sentence of death at Boston in the same period, but had their punishments commuted to that of being whipped out of the colony from town to town. \\"The hanging of Mary Dyer on the Boston gallows in 1660 marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy and New England independence from English rule. In 1661 King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. In 1684 England revoked the Massachusetts charter, sent over a royal governor to enforce English laws in 1686, and in 1689 passed a broad Toleration act.\\"Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: a comprehensive encyclopediaJohan Winsser Mary Dyer: Quaker Martyr and Enigma  Boston origins  John Winthrop The settlement of Boston was founded by Puritan chartered colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under John Winthrop, and acquired the name of Boston soon after the arrival of the Winthrop Fleet in 1630. It was named after Boston, Lincolnshire, in England. During the 1640s, as the English Civil War reached its climax, the founder of English Quakerism, George Fox (1624‚Äì1691), discovered his religious vocation. Under the Puritan English Commonwealth led by Oliver Cromwell, Quakers in England were persecuted, and during the 1650s various groups of Quakers left England as 'Publishers of Truth'.  Mary Dyer's early work  Mary Dyer was an English Puritan living in Boston, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1637 she supported Anne Hutchinson, who believed that God 'spoke directly to individuals' and not only through the clergy. They began organizing Bible study groups in violation of Massachusetts Colony laws, and for this 'Antinomian heresy' Mary Dyer, her husband William Dyer, Anne Hutchinson, and others were banished from the colony in January 1637/8. They relocated at Portsmouth in the Rhode Island colony, joined by the religious group they had founded.  Voyages of the Speedwell (1656) and the Woodhouse (1657)  Leaving England on 30 May, the Speedwell under captain Robert Locke arrived at Boston on 27 July 1656, having on board eight Quakers including Christopher Holder, John Copeland and William Brend.Charles Frederick Holder, LL.D, The Holders of Holderness. A History and Genealogy of the Holder Family with especial reference to Christopher Holder (Author, California (1902)), pp. 22-26 (Internet Archive). The text includes a full transcript of the original 1656 shipping list in the Massachusetts Colonial Records: the eight were Christopher Holder (25), William Brend (40), John Copeland (28), Thomas Thurston (34), Mary Prince (21), Sarah Gibbons (21), Mary Weatherhead (26), Dorothy Waugh (20).The Speedwell carried the same name as the ship which set out for the Americas with the Mayflower in 1620 but was forced to return to Plymouth having transferred her party of Pilgrims to the Mayflower. As required by Boston law, the authorities were notified of their arrival, and all eight were immediately brought before the court. They were imprisoned on orders of Governor John Endecott, under a sentence of banishment. Shortly after this, Mary Dyer and Anne Burden arrived in Boston from Rhode Island and also were imprisoned. Eleven weeks later, Holder, Copeland and the six other Quakers from the Speedwell were deported to England; however, they immediately took steps to return.James Bowden, History of the Society of Friends in America (Charles Gilpin, London 1850), Vol. I, pp. 42-51. In July 1657 an additional party of Quakers for Massachusetts (including six of those from the Speedwell), set out on the Woodhouse, undertaken by her owner Robert Fowler of Bridlington Quay, Yorkshire, England. The Woodhouse made land at Long Island. Five were set ashore at the Dutch plantation of New Amsterdam (New York): Robert Hodgson, Richard Doudney, Sarah Gibbons, Mary Weatherhead, and Dorothy Waugh.'A true relation of the voyage undertaken by me, Robert Fowler (etc)' in James Bowden, History of the Society of Friends in America (Charles Gilpin, London 1850), Vol. I, pp. 63-67. Read here.  Confrontations with Governor Endecott  John Endecott Mary Dyer, who had returned to England with Roger Williams and John Clarke in 1652, heard the ministry of George Fox and became a Friend. She and her husband returned to Rhode Island in 1657. In time, Holder and Copeland returned to Massachusetts and met with other Friends in Sandwich and other towns. However, they were arrested at Salem by Endecott's order and were imprisoned for several months. They were released, but in April 1658 were rearrested at Sandwich and whipped. In June they went to Boston and were again arrested, and Copeland's right ear was cut off as a judicial penalty. Katherine Scott, Anne Hutchinson's sister, spoke up for them and was imprisoned and whipped.See J. Besse, A Collection of the Sufferings of the People called Quakers (Luke Hinde, London 1753), Vol. 2, Chapter 5 at pp. 177 ff. Read here  Boston law against Quakers  At the end of 1658, the Massachusetts legislature, by a bare majority, enacted a law that every member of the sect of Quakers who was not an inhabitant of the colony but was found within its jurisdiction should be apprehended without warrant by any constable and imprisoned, and on conviction as a Quaker, should be banished upon pain of death, and that every inhabitant of the colony convicted of being a Quaker should be imprisoned for a month, and if obstinate in opinion should be banished on pain of death. Some Friends were arrested and expelled under this law.Christian Life, Faith and Thought in the Society of Friends. Book of Discipline Part 1 (Friends Book Centre, London 1921), p. 31. At that time various punishments of Friends were vigorously and cruelly acted upon, as a letter of James Cudworth written from Scituate in 1658 reveals.'James Cudworth's Letter, written in the tenth month, 1658', in Appendix to Richard P. Hallowell, The Quaker Invasion of Massachusetts (Houghton, Mifflin & Co, Boston/Riverside Press, Cambridge 1883), pp. 162-72. Read here  Stephenson and Robinson  Marmaduke Stephenson had been a ploughman in Yorkshire in England in 1655, when (as he wrote), \\"as I walked after the plough, I was filled with the love and presence of the living God, which did ravish my heart\\". Leaving his family to the Lord's care, he followed the divine prompting to Barbados in June 1658, and after some time there he heard of the new Massachusetts law and passed over to Rhode Island. There he met William Robinson (a merchant of London), another Friend from the company of the Woodhouse, and in June 1659 with two others they went into the Massachusetts colony to protest at their laws. Mary Dyer went for the same purpose. The three were arrested and banished, but Robinson and Stephenson returned and were again imprisoned.Trial and Testament of Marmaduke Stephenson, in J. Besse, A Collection of the Sufferings of the People called Quakers, from 1650 to 1689 (Luke Hinde, London 1753), Vol. 2, pp. 198-202. Read here. During their imprisonment and trial, the ministers Zechariah Symmes and John Norton were instructed to attend them \\"with religious conversation fitted for their condition\\".J.B. Felt, The Ecclesiastical History of New England, 2 vols., (Congregational Library Association, Boston 1862), II, p. 212 (Hathi Trust). Mary Dyer went back to protest at their treatment, and was also imprisoned. In October 1659, Endecott, according to the instruction of the law previously passed, pronounced sentence of death upon the three.  Executions at Boston Neck  The execution day was Thursday 27 October (the usual weekly meeting day for the Church in Boston) 1659, and the gallows stood on Boston Neck, the narrow isthmus of land that connected Boston to the mainland. They spoke as they were led there, but their words were drowned out by the sound of drums. After they had taken leave of one another, William Robinson ascended the ladder. He told the people it was their day of visitation, and desired them to mind the light within them, the light of Christ, his testimony for which he was going to seal with his blood. At this the Puritan minister (John Wilson) shouted, \\"Hold thy tongue, thou art going to die with a lie in thy mouth.\\" The rope was adjusted, and as the executioner turned the condemned man off, he said with his dying breath, \\"I suffer for Christ, in whom I live and for whom I die.\\" Marmaduke Stephenson next climbed the ladder and said, \\"Be it known unto all this day that we suffer not as evil-doers, but for conscience sake.\\" As the ladder was pushed away, he said, \\"This day shall we be at rest with the Lord.\\"J. Besse, A Collection of the Sufferings of the People called Quakers, 1753, Vol. 2, pp. 203-05. In memory of this, October 27 is now International Religious Freedom Day to recognize the importance of Freedom of religion.  Mary Dyer's and William Leddra's executions  \\"Mary Dyer led to execution on Boston Common, 1 June 1660\\", by an unknown 19th century artist Mary Dyer also stepped up the ladder, her face was covered and the halter put round her neck, when the cry was raised, \\"Stop! for she is reprieved.\\" She was again banished, but returned in May 1660. Since her reprieve, others, both colonists and visiting Friends, had brought themselves within the capital penalty, but the authorities had not ventured to enforce it. After ten days Endecott, at the bidding of the courts, sent for her, and asked her if she were the same Mary Dyer who had been there before. On her avowing this, the death sentence was passed and executed.Rogers, Horatio, 2009. Mary Dyer of Rhode Island: The Quaker Martyr That Was Hanged on Boston pp.1-2.

Club career Early career Kuli began his career with the Tropikal Durr√´s youth team, where he played for two years before joining his hometown club Besa Kavaj√´ in 1998. He was with the club for only a year before moving to Turkey to join Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi in the summer of 1999 along with fellow Albanian Bledar Man√ßaku. The pair both joined the club's youth team, and Kuli featured in two under-21 A2 Ligi games in his first season in Turkey, and he was part of the team that finished as runners-up in the 1999‚Äì2000 A2 Ligi. He was then transferred to Samsunspor in 2000 and again joined the club's under-21 side where he became an important player, scoring 11 goals in 22 games to once again finish as a runner-up in the A2 Ligi. He made his professional debut as a 19-year-old with Samsunspor on 12 December 2001 in a Turkish Cup game against Trabzonspor, where he came on as an 80th-minute substitute for Alfred Phiri in the 3‚Äì0 away loss.Trabzonspor 3‚Äì0 Samsunspor He returned to Albania in January 2002 where he loaned out to Albanian Superliga side Partizani Tirana for the remainder of the 2001‚Äì2002 campaign in order to gain first team experience.

However, his goals could not save his side from being relegated after a disappointing season that saw them second to bottom and 12 points away from safety. They were also knocked out of the Albanian Cup by KF Tirana in the quarter-finals.Albania 2003‚Äì2004 On 31 August 2014, Kuli returned to Besa Kavaj√´ for the third time in his career.

Life and career Las Cabras, [Goats], a painting by Jos√© Navarro Jos√© Navarro y Llorens was born in Godella, near Valencia, Spain in 1867. He received his art education at the San Carlos Academy in Valencia, a city to which he remained very attached throughout his life.Caso, E.D., Les Orientalistes de l'√©cole Espagnole, ACR edition, 1997, p.195 He lived in Madrid from around 1920. He travelled extensively through Europe and North Africa, to expand his knowledge of the arts. He visited Morocco while relatively young. In Morocco, he developed an affinity for oriental subject matter. Navarro was a great admirer of Mariano Fortuny, which was possibly the inspiration that impelled him to travel to Morocco.Manuel Mu√±oz Ib√°√±ez, La Pintura Contempor√°nea del Pa√≠s Valenciano (1900-1980), Valencia, Spain, Editorial Prometeo, 1980, p. 391. (translated from the Spanish). He was a friend of the artist, Pinazo Camarlench and like him, landscapes are heavily represented in Navarro's work. However, Navarro's themes also included seascapes, Orientalist themes and people, especially gypsies and Moroccans. His work was influenced by the Spanish greats such as Maria Fortuny and Joaqu√≠n Sorolla.Caso, E.D., Les Orientalistes de l'√©cole Espagnole, ACR edition, 1997, p.195 On account of his talent, Navarro was considered as one of the most worthy painters to represent the Valencian School.Caso, E.D., Les Orientalistes de l'√©cole Espagnole, ACR edition, 1997, p.195 In 1908 he made a trip to Rio de Janeiro, where he exhibited his works and obtained great recognition.Sch√°velzon, D., El Expolio del arte en la Argentina: Robos y Tr√°fico Ilegal de Obras de Arte, Editorial Sudamericana, 1993, p. 98 Navarro died on 6 February 1923 in Valencia. Work His Orientalist scenes often used short brush strokes in an impressionistic style. His work often includes seascapes, especially those depicting dramatic events associated with life at sea; such events were relatively commonplace in 1890s Spain. For example, he produced a work detailing the shipwreck of 1894 that is now located in the Carmen Thyssen Museum, Malaga and is possibly the painting presented to the National Exhibition of 1895, in which it received the Honorable Mention. Also exhibited at that museum is the Arrival of Fishing (1904-1910), a work inspired by Joaqu√≠n Sorolla's La Vuelta de la Pesca (1894), currently at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris.Moreno, Lourdes, Museo Carmen Thyssen M√°laga Colecci√≥n, 2014, p. 318; Caso, E.D., Les Orientalistes de l'√©cole Espagnole, ACR edition, 1997, pp 195-196 He used both oils and water-colours with equal success.Caso, E.D., Les Orientalistes de l'√©cole Espagnole, ACR edition, 1997, p. 195 Select list of works * El Zoco [The Souk or Market at Tangier] * Toros [Bulls] * La Plaza Redonda, [The Round Square] * Escena En La Playa, [Beach Scene] * En El Puerto, [At the Port] * Playa con Barcas Varadas, [Beach with Abandoned Boats] * Gitanillos, [Gypsy Children] * Calle Morocaine, [Moroccan Street], Private collection * Bab-Ftouh, Fes [Bab-Ftouh, Fez] * Evocaci√≥n de Marruecos [Impression of Morocco], Prado, Madrid Gallery File:Jos√© Navarro Llorens - El zoco.jpg|El Zoco (The Souk or market) File:Jos√© Navarro Llorens - Una caravana √°rabe en movimiento.jpg|Una Caravana Arabe en Movimiento.

He is known as a coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto, and other publications on marketing in the Internet era. In a Financial Times Group survey from 2001, he was named as one of the fifty leading business thinkers in the world. Career In the late 1970s, Christopher Locke was working as a construction contractor and cabinet maker, but was forced out of business in the housing downturn of the early 1980s. His interest in artificial intelligence secured him a number of jobs in Tokyo between 1983 and 1985: He was working as a documentation editor for Fujitsu and the Ricoh Software Research Center, and as a technical editor at the Japanese government's Fifth Generation Computer Systems project. In 1986, Locke was working in the marketing department of Carnegie Group, an artificial intelligence firm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he became vice president of corporate communications, a position he also held at Intelligent Technology, another AI firm in Pittsburgh. He was director of industrial relations for the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University before joining Cimlinc in a similar capacity in 1991. In 1993, Locke founded Internet Business Report, an industry newsletter owned by CMP Publications. Serving as the publication's chief editor, he argued for the commercial use of the Internet. His emphasis on respecting the norms of the \\"Internet community\\" provoked a disagreement over editorial direction with the publisher and led to his departure. In 1994 he initiated and oversaw the development and launch of MecklerWeb, an ambitious project that sought to introduce commerce to the Internet and garnered much attention in the business press. Locke's e-commerce concept was abandoned two weeks after the launch by the site owner, who chose to turn MecklerWeb's into a conventional product catalog. Locke subsequently worked as editor and publisher of the Net Editors segment on internetMCI, and as Program Director for Online Community Development at IBM. After leaving IBM, in 1996 and 1997, Locke served as vice president of business development for Displaytech in Longmont, Colorado. In 1997, he set up as an internet consultant under the name Entropy Web Consulting in Boulder, Colorado, practising an alternative to mass marketing he named 'gonzo marketing' after Hunter S. Thompson's gonzo journalism. Gonzo marketing asserts that companies are ineffective in their use of the Internet as a marketing tool when they insist on lecturing instead of conversing, and that companies need to improve their communications with customers to improve the quality of their products and services. In 2004 Locke accepted a job as consultant and Chief Blogging Officer for HighBeam Research. Works Locke's first publications in print were introductory articles on Lisp and natural language processing. He has since written for Wired, Release 1.0, The Industry Standard, Harvard Business Review and many other publications. Since 2005, he has been writing the Mystic Bourgeoisie blog. In 1996, he launched Entropy Gradient Reversals, a \\"strange webzine\\" that specialized in \\"dissecting transparently clueless corporate Internet strategies\\" and introduced RageBoy, Locke's intemperate alter ego who has a penchant for ranting against business orthodoxy. As of April 1999, the publication counted nearly 3,000 subscribers. Locke is a co-author of The Cluetrain Manifesto, a tract that admonishes businesses to join the \\"networked conversations\\" of the Internet. The Manifesto was first posted to the Web in March 1999 and became a business bestseller in an extended book version the next year. In 2009 the book was re-issued as a tenth anniversary edition with a new chapter from each of the original co-authors and commentaries by three new contributors. Locke's new chapter, \\"Obedient Poodles for God and Country,\\" offers a scathing critique of the fake spirituality the author deems pervasive in contemporary American culture. Locke is also the author of Gonzo Marketing: Winning Through Worst Practices, a book that expands on the Cluetrain Manifesto's themes, and of The Bombast Transcripts: Rants and Screeds of RageBoy, a compilation of Entropy Gradient Reversals pieces. Locke has been praised by The Economist for the \\"wisdom of RageBoy.\\" In a Financial Times Group survey, he was named as one of the fifty leading business thinkers in the world.

He has been one of Sydney Bristow's coworkers and the CIA's Director of Joint Task Force. He is portrayed by Carl Lumbly. Character biography Marcus Dixon is an intelligent and strong agent and is fluent in many languages. He is generally level-headed and very keen to the many issues that he must resolve as a leader within the CIA. However, Dixon can be very emotional when his family or loved ones are involved, going so far as to act against orders to protect them. His code name in APO is Outrigger. Storylines Season 1 Before being recruited to SD-6 by Jack Bristow, Dixon was a member of the Recon Marines. At SD-6, Dixon was Sydney Bristow's partner on missions, but unlike Sydney, Dixon was unaware that SD-6 was not actually a covert branch of the CIA. Several times during the first season, Dixon questioned Sydney's loyalties, perceiving actions she took to be against the U.S. government, when in fact the opposite was true. His cover was that of an investment analyst for Credit Dauphine, a corporate bank in downtown Los Angeles. Season 2 Dixon eventually learned the truth about SD-6 after Sydney's latest mission resulted in them acquiring access to the Alliance server, including the access codes to all twelve SD bases; needing to confirm that the current codes were valid, but with Jack Bristow exposed and captured while Sydney's cover was compromised, she was forced to tell Dixon the truth as the only other agent in SD-6 that she could trust. Following the downfall of SD-6 and his resentment at Sydney for not apparently trusting him, Dixon was pressured by his wife Diane who was now angered by the many years of lies from her husband. He initially felt compelled not to take a position within the CIA. However, following Sydney's capture, Vaughn persuades him to help save Sydney as Dixon was the only person to have successfully infiltrated the location where she was captured, and eventually he decides to join the CIA. However, he initially finds that he does not wish to make her worry about him coming home at night, and decides to request at transfer to intelligence, which would mean a desk job in analysis. This changes when Dixon's wife is killed in a car bomb explosion as a retaliatory measure by Arvin Sloane for Dixon's accidental shooting of Sloane's wife, Emily, on what would have been his last CIA field mission. Initially suicidal over the loss, Dixon eventually channels his grief into his field work. Dixon's two children, Robin and Steven, were once kidnapped by The Covenant in an attempt to forcefully extract an artifact created by eccentric 15th century inventor, Milo Rambaldi. Season 3 During the two years between Seasons 2 and 3 (when Sydney went missing), Dixon was promoted to the CIA Director of Joint Task Force, the head of the office where Sydney works. Dixon was one of only a few people who knew that Sydney was alive during that time. Season 4 At the start of the fourth season, Dixon had stepped down as director and resumed duties as a field agent alongside Sydney in the new Authorized Personnel Only (APO) black ops division of the CIA. He became involved in an (initially) clandestine relationship with CIA Director Chase. During pursuit of Arvin Sloane and Elena Derevko, he was shot and seriously wounded by Elena and was absent from the season finale, presumably recovering in the hospital from his wounds. Both his injury and his relationship with Chase appeared to have been forgotten by the start of the fifth season. Season 5 Dixon continued to act as a field agent with APO throughout Season 5, although he tended to spend more time in support roles rather than as an active field agent. In the series finale, a flash forward several years into the future reveals that Dixon has again taken a promotion to the position of Deputy Director (although it is not explicitly stated that APO still exists). He has maintained a close relationship with Vaughn and Sydney.

Biography  His father, Jos√© Espin√≥s (1721-1784), was a painter and engraver who had trained with the Baroque master, Evaristo Mu√±oz. He began his career working in his father's studio, painting decorative designs for the textile manufactory that had been established in Valencia by the (Five Guilds) of Madrid. In 1784, he was named Director of the School of Flowers and Ornamentation at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos, whose primary function was providing design for the silk industry. Through the mediation of the Conde de Floridablanca, he also received commissions from the Royal Court.

The ISO standard ISO 13406-2 distinguishes between three different types of defective pixels, while hardware companies tend to have further distinguishing types.Apple Technician Training A photograph taken with a damaged image sensor Similar defects can also occur in charge-coupled device (CCD) and CMOS image sensors in digital cameras. In these devices, defective pixels fail to sense light levels correctly, whereas defective pixels in LCDs fail to reproduce light levels correctly. Types Dark dot defect A dark dot defect is usually caused by a transistor in the transparent electrode layer that is stuck \\"on\\" for TN panels or \\"off\\" for MVA, PVA, and IPS panels. In that state, the transistor places the liquid crystal material in such a way that no light ever passes through to the RGB layer of the display. Bright dot defect long exposure photograph taken in virtual darkness. Note: Must be viewed at full size. A bright dot defect or hot pixel is a group of three sub-pixels (one pixel) all of whose transistors are \\"off\\" for TN panels or stuck \\"on\\" for MVA and PVA panels. This allows all light to pass through to the RGB layer, creating a bright white pixel that is always on. Partial sub-pixel defect A partial sub-pixel defect is a manufacturing defect in which the RGB film layer was not cut properly. Tape automated bonding fault A tape automated bonding fault (TAB fault) is caused by a connection failure from the TAB that connects the transparent electrode layers to the video driver board of an LCD. TAB is one of several methods employed in the LCD-manufacturing process to electrically connect hundreds of signal paths going to the rows and columns of electrodes in layer 6 (the transparent electrode layer) in the LCD to the video integrated circuits (ICs) on the driver board that drives these electrodes. If an LCD is subjected to physical shock, this could cause one or more TAB connections to fail inside the display. This failure is often caused by horizontally flexing the chassis (e.g. while wall-mounting or transporting a display face up/down) or simple failure of the adhesive holding the TAB against the glass. TAB faults require replacement of the LCD module itself. If these connections were to fail, the effect would be that an entire row or column of pixels would fail to activate. This causes a horizontal or vertical black line to appear on the display while the rest of the display would appear normal. The horizontal failure runs from edge-to-edge; the vertical failure runs from top-to-bottom. Hardware manufacturers and distributors tend to claim that TAB faults, as opposed to other physical defects that may be found in an LCD, do not allow for repair. Stuck sub-pixel A stuck sub-pixel is a pixel that is always \\"on\\". This is usually caused by a transistor that is not getting any power, and is therefore continuously allowing light at that point to pass through to the RGB layer. This means that any given pixel will stay red, blue, or green, and will not change when attempting to display an image. These pixels may only show up using certain applications, or they may be on all of the time. Manufacturer policy In LCD manufacture, it is common for a display to be manufactured that has a number of sub-pixel defects (each pixel is composed of three primary-colored sub-pixels). The number of faulty pixels tolerated, before a screen is rejected, is dependent on the class that the manufacturer has given the display (although officially described by the ISO 13406-2 standard, not all manufacturers interpret this standard the same way, or follow it at all). Some manufacturers have a zero-tolerance policy with regard to LCD screens, rejecting all units found to have any number of (sub-)pixel defects. Displays meeting this standard are deemed Class I. Other manufacturers reject displays according to the number of total defects, the number of defects in a given group (e.g. one dead pixel or three stuck sub-pixels in a five-by-five pixel area), or other criteria. In some cases, a manufacturer sends all screens to sale, and then replaces the screen if the customer reports the unit as faulty, and the defective pixels meet their minimum requirements for return. Some screens come with a leaflet stating how many dead pixels they are allowed to have before the owner can send them back to the manufacturer. Dead pixels may tend to occur in clusters; in most cases, displays with such a cluster problem can be sent back to the manufacturer.

The character subsequently appears in The Amazing Spider-Man #174-175 (November‚ÄìDecember 1977), in which he is killed. The character appears posthumously in the Punisher: Return to Big Nothing graphic novel (1989). Jimmy Pierce first appeared in Punisher Vol. 2 #86 to serve as the Cullen Crime Family's Punisher. He was created by Steve Grant and Hugh Haynes. Fictional character biography Burt Kenyon Burt Kenyon was a Vietnam veteran serving in the same company as Frank Castle, who would later become the Punisher. Kenyon saved Castle's life by killing several enemy soldiers and dragging Castle to safety after he was wounded in an ambush. Castle wanted to know how he could repay Kenyon, to which Kenyon replied that Castle should remember that he owed him a life.The Amazing Spider-Man #175 As the Hitman, Kenyon was a costumed mercenary assassin. He was hired by the Maggia as their version of the Punisher. The Vulture had rejected the Maggia's offer before they hired the Hitman, so the Hitman was sent to humiliate the Vulture by killing Spider-Man before the Vulture could. The two villains fought over Spider-Man, allowing Spider-Man the chance to escape. The Hitman had placed tracers on both the Vulture and Spider-Man, and he continued to harass and attack them both. While Spider-Man feigned weakness, the Hitman coerced the Vulture into attacking Spider-Man, but Spider-Man turned so that the Hitman shot the Vulture's power pack instead of Spider-Man. The Hitman fled and Spider-Man gave the tracer to the Punisher to give him the opportunity to track the Hitman down.The Spectacular Spider-Man #4-5 The Hitman was hired by a terrorist group called the People's Liberation Front (PLF) to kidnap and kill J. Jonah Jameson for editorials written about the group. While looking for the Hitman, the Punisher found himself battling the PLF. As the Hitman confronted Jameson in his office, he attracted the attention of the Punisher and Spider-Man. The Hitman escaped to the roof with Jameson as he fought Spider-Man, but Spider-Man followed him. Hitman managed to escape in his mini-copter despite the Punisher's efforts to shoot Hitman. One of Spider-Man's spider-tracers allowed them to track the Hitman to the Statue of Liberty, where the PLF planned to blow up the statue with Jameson inside. The Punisher and Spider-Man arrived to stop the PLF, and confronted the Hitman. Spider-Man managed to pull Jameson away from the Hitman, and the Punisher shot Hitman, who fell from the statue but managed to grab part of the Statue of Liberty's crown and hang on. Spider-Man was also hanging from another part of the statue, but was wounded, weakening, and also holding on to Jameson with his other arm. Castle was momentarily torn between helping Spider-Man or Kenyon, especially when Kenyon reminded Castle that he owed him a life. Castle chose to help Spider-Man, telling Kenyon to hang on until he could get there. Kenyon declined, saying that he would never last and that Castle had already made his choice. He then said that while Castle had owed him a life, he never said that it had to be his (Kenyon's) life, and that by saving Spider-Man, they were now even. Kenyon then let go and plummeted to his death.The Amazing Spider-Man #174-175 During the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy storyline, Hitman was cloned by Miles Warren and his company New U Technologies.Clone Conspiracy #2 Hitman survives the degenerative disorder that afflicts many of the other clones and becomes an enforcer for Countess Karkov of Symkaria, who deploys Hitman to assassinate Doctor Doom. Jimmy Pierce Jimmy Pierce is the son of Jack Pierce and Midge Cullen. His father resisted \\"Old Man\\" Peach Cullen's efforts to pull him into the Cullen Crime Family. Jack left to serve in the army.Punisher War Journal #70 After the war, Jack Pierce found a new woman where Peach Cullen and Midge killed him. Following his father's death, Jimmy kept himself distant from the Cullens. He served in the Special Forces and was also a former Golden Gloves boxing champion.Punisher War Journal #71 After Punisher was believed to be killed, Peach Cullen tried to force Jimmy into becoming the new Punisher that obeys his commands. Jimmy was resistant at first until Peach Cullen stated that he has his mother hostage. Jimmy ended up donning the costume that was complete with a mask.Punisher Vol. 2 #86 Peach Cullen sent Jimmy to take down some rival operations where he believed that if word got out that Punisher was working for the Cullen Crime Family, they would own New York. Jimmy then busted up a crack house operation which Dean Swaybrick (AKA Yuppunisher) had targeted the same operation. This foiled Dean's publicity stunt.Punisher Vol. 2 #87 Jimmy was sent to Laastekist, Pennsylvania to investigate the sightings of Punisher.Punisher War Journal #63 While in Laastekist, Jimmy was disgusted when the other Cullen Family members shot and seemingly killed Payback and Lynn Michaels. Dean Swaybrick then arrived and killed the Cullen Family members present. Then Dean put the gun to Jimmy's head until Dean's fellow agents fled. This distraction gave Jimmy the opportunity to steal Dean's gun and shoot him. Jimmy was mortified after this and approached Dean's body. As Jimmy kneeled over Dean's corpse, he is shot in the back by Vigil's Blackwell and left for dead.Punisher Vol. 2 #88 Jimmy later ambushed Dave Cullen and Duke Cullen where he forced them to tell him where Peach Cullen was hiding out. He then went to the apartment of his sister Lori Pierce.Punisher War Journal #67 Lori's friend from medical school stitched up Jimmy's wound at Blackwell's hand. Dave Cullen and Duke Cullen tracked Jimmy to Lori's apartment and attacked him. Jimmy defeated Dave Cullen and Duke Cullen. As Jimmy took Dave with him, Duke was left tied up in Lori's apartment and was killed by Lori after Jimmy left.Punisher War Journal #68 Jimmy sneaked into the meeting place of the Cullen Crime Family in order to rescue his mother. However, Midge smashed a coffee pot onto Jimmy's head and was at the mercy of the Cullen Crime Family.Punisher War Journal #69 As Jimmy learned of his father's past, Lori snuck in to the Cullen Crime Family's meeting place and broke him out where the two of them escaped. Lori brought Jimmy to their mother's old chest and told them how the Cullen Crime Family killed his father. He was unable to bring himself to seek vengeance of Peach Cullen and left. While hitching a ride, Jimmy was picked up by Punisher. The Cullen Crime Family managed to locate Lori and capture her. Punisher and Jimmy were ambushed by some members of the Cullen Crime Family and were able to temporarily get away from them. The rest of the Cullen Crime Family tracked Punisher and Jimmy to an abandoned truck stop where Punisher picked them off. Jimmy was able to confront Peach Cullen and Midge where he held them at gunpoint and coerced Peach into ending their war.

His father was the well known painter, Jer√≥nimo Rodriguez de Espinosa, who had relocated to that area and gotten married there in 1596. He was the third child, of six. His family returned to Valencia in 1612.Biography in the Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana Life and work He began his artistic training in his father's workshop, where he produced a precocious painting pf John the Baptist, showing the influence of Francesc Ribalta. At the age of seventeen he enrolled in the newly created Colegio de Pintores, In 1622, he married Jer√≤nima de Castro, the daughter of a local merchant. The following year, he began a long series of commissions; many of them portraits of the nobility. In his later years, he was heavily influenced by the works of Pedro Orrente, especially in his religious compositions. Ribalta's influence continued to be apparent, however. Many of his most notable works were depictions of the Virgin and Child, including an \\"Our Lady of the Rosary\\" at the and the \\"Virgin and Child on a Throne with Angels\\", now in the Museo del Prado. Portraits of individual saints were another popular subject. All of his works are signed and dated, making it easy to trace his creative development. Toward the end of his career, he received a series of commissions from the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy. In 1665, he working on the main altar at the church of the capuchins in Massamagrell; parts of which are now conserved at the Museu de Belles Arts de Val√®ncia. He was interred at the Convent of Santo Domingo. Several works he had left unfinished were completed by his son, Jer√≥nimo. Among the artists he influenced were Vicente Salvador G√≥mez, Pablo Pontons, Mateo Gilarte and Gaspar de la Huerta.

There are distinct types of call which can indicate the genus, and variations in pattern and frequency which indicate the species. For readers not familiar with the different types of bat detector, there is further information below and elsewhere. Bats also make social calls, which are less useful for species identification. They sound different from the echolocation calls and do not have the same frequency patterns. Fuller details on the types of call and other clues to species identification follow below but Pipistrelles (or \\"Pips\\") give good examples of what can be discovered with a bat detector and make a good start to learning how to identify bats. Bat detectors pick up various signals in the ultrasound range, not all of which are made by bats. To distinguish bat and bat species it is important to recognise non-bat species. Captured bats can be exactly identified in the hand but in many countries a licence is required before bats can be captured. Types of call There are four basic types of bat echolocation call. FM calls The term \\"frequency modulation\\" (FM) refer to the \\"chirp\\" type of bat call. On a bat detector it sounds like a sharp click. Tuning a heterodyne detector does not change the sound much, but the level varies. This is a typical call from a Myotis species. It sounds like hard dry clicks. It was recorded at 40 kHz which was not critical, but this was chosen because it was above the crickets and below Pipistrelles. CF calls These calls were recorded using a heterodyne bat detector tuned to an appropriate frequency. The constant frequency (CF) call is a series of peeping calls. The bat emits the calls at a constant frequency, but the heterodyne bat detector exaggerates the doppler effect as it flies. Hockey stick calls Some bats call with a composite call, starting with an FM component and ending in a constant frequency. This is often called a \\"hockey stick\\" call from its appearance on a spectrogram. Pipistrelle spectrogram The Pipistrelle call is an example of a \\"hockey stick\\" composite type FM and CF call with a fast falling frequency FM part ending with a constant frequency, CF section. A spectrogram is a graphic representation of frequencies against time. The colour represents the loudness of each frequency. This spectrogram shows a falling call which becomes a steady note. The yellow and green blotches are noise. On a heterodyne detector this sounds like a ploppy click, but when it is slowed down by eight octaves, a sharply falling call can be heard, slowing to a single note. A heterodyne bat detector will only handle a small range of bat frequencies, so it is necessary to keep retuning the heterodyne frequency to find the point of maximum loudness or, in the case of bats with a hockey stick call, the frequency which gives the lowest sound. This gives the lowest plop sound from the CF end of the calls. Using a heterodyne bat detector A heterodyne bat detector simply downshifts the bat frequencies by the amount shown on the dial or the display on the more posh detectors. For instance with a hockey stick call ending at 45 kHz, this will produce a near zero end frequency when tuned to 45 kHz, If it is tuned too low, or too high, the difference frequency rises as illustrated in Tuning the heterodyne in the Pipistrelle section below. It will only reproduce a limited range of frequencies, typically only 10 kHz out of a bat spectrum of over 90 kHz. A heterodyne bat detector does not give a very accurate measurement of the frequency of a bat call, One reason is that the call frequencies can easily vary by 1 kHz or more due to the doppler shift. To track these changes and to get a more precise frequency, a frequency division bat detector or a time expansion bat detector is used using a computer with sound analysis software. Time expansion detectors are beyond the scope of this article but are described in bat detector Using a frequency division bat detector A frequency division bat detector analyses each bat call and re- synthesises it at typically a tenth of its frequency to make them audible as explained in the bat detector article. It can produce anomalies with sounds with a random structure and can only process periodic or tonal calls with a measurable frequency, but a recording can be used to measure the frequency of all parts of the bat call using a spectrogram display as illustrated below. A FD detector does not require manual tuning as it works on a full range of bat frequencies, but some, like the Duet, also have a heterodyne detector built in. The entire call is preserved and can be recorded on an audio recorder and studied later on a computer. A spectrogram and other analysis software can also show the repetition rates and patterns of the calls which is also useful for species identification. This is what a Pipistrelle sounds like on a frequency division bat detector: Pipistrelle spectrogram with feeding buzz The sound is different from a heterodyne recording and is a squeaky \\"teek\\" a bit more like a heterodyne tuned off frequency. With an FD detector the user cannot easily tell the difference between 45s and 55s by ear. And this is what that recording looks like on a spectrogram up to the feeding buzz. We can measure the end frequency (selected) which comes out as 44.6 kHz after multiplying by 10. The call rate speeds up as a food target is approached ending in a very rapid \\"feeding buzz\\". Note that the call becomes FM only during the feeding buzz. Social calls This is a wide subject and there is still a lot to be discovered about bat social communication and how they use social calls in roosts and when flying. Generally a bat social call is not tonal, in other words it does not consist of a musical type note. Some bat detectors do not produce an accurate recording of a bat social call. Typically bat social calls use a lower frequency range than echolocation calls, and can thus be heard further away. Sometimes a bat will make a social call while echolocating which can cause confusion. We can see and hear how the lower frequency social calls are heard at a greater distance than the higher echolocation calls as the bat approaches and departs. Zooming in on a spectrogram, social calls are atonal and repeated rapidly about five times in each call. The social calls are interleaved between the echolocation calls. They show a ragged frequency distribution around 20 kHz. Note the FD detector divides frequencies by 10. The echolocation calls are single \\"hockey stick\\" calls at a higher repetition rate. At this scale the hockey stick shape is not very clear, but the end frequency can be measured as 45.2 kHz. A doppler shift is recorded as the bat approaches. The frequency was measured as it passes. Image:FD pip socandecho call.png|FD Spectrogram of social and echolocation calls. The spectrogram shows combined slower social calls with faster echolocation calls at a higher frequency. Image:FD pip socandecho call closer.png|FD Spectrogram detail of social and echolocation calls Image:FD pip socandecho call echo.png|FD Spectrogram of echo on calls. This is further zoomed in on two echolocation calls. They appear double due to an echo. The selected portion is 10.8 ms, giving a path length difference of 10.8 times 340 m/s or about 3.7 metres. Note the timings are not altered by the frequency division. Flying speed Calculating flying speed involves some technicalities. A spectrogram can easily reveal a doppler shift in a passing bat. A heterodyne detector will show some shifts in the calls above, but doppler shifts are most readily heard in CF calls such as the Horseshoe's. A rough estimate the speed of a bat can be made from the doppler shift as it flies past. The rule of thumb is that at around 50 kHz a shift is 1 kHz indicates about . A passing bat will produce a total shift of about double this. The Pipistrelles below showed an estimated shift of around 1.5 kHz indicating a speed just over 5 m/s or a bit under . UK species This section is also a practical introduction to the recognition of bat species, using Pipistrelles as an example. More detailed and technical information is given below. Seventeen species of bat are regarded as resident in the UK. The species most often seen and heard are the Common Pipistrelle and the Soprano Pipistrelle, and are a good reference point for comparison with other bat species. In fact it is worth taking time to get familiar with the various calls of the two common species. Common Pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus Soprano Pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus These two species are considered together here. This section also acts as a tutorial for analysing bat calls. The only technical knowledge needed is that kHz is the number dialled into a bat detector. These two pips are distinct species but the frequencies of their calls are very variable and are not an exact indication of the species. They are frequently referred to as \\"45 Pips\\" and \\"55 Pips\\" from the calls as heard on a heterodyne detector. Common Pipistrelle Note the \\"ploppy\\" sound of the call and the \\"feeding buzzes\\" as it homed in on insects. The Soprano Pipistrelle's call sounds very similar, but at a higher frequency setting on the heterodyne bat detector. Tuning the heterodyne As heterodyne bat detector only shifts a limited range of bat call frequencies, it needs to be constantly retuned so as not to miss some species and to identify those heard. One solution sometimes used in bat surveys is to use a second heterodyne detector tuned to a different frequency to detect other species such as Horseshoe bats if these are likely to be present. With Pipistrelles, if it is tuned too low or too high, the difference frequency rises as illustrated in the following example. The first and last sections of this edited recording at about the same frequency as the last part of the hockey stick call, This produces a deeper and wetter ploppy sound. The second section is with the detector tuned too low - this brings the end frequency up and gives a squeaky click sound. The third section is with the detector tuned too high and also gives a squeaky sound but a bit harder. By tuning up and down, the deepest sound as in the fourth section is again produced, and this indicates the approximate frequency of the end of the bat's call. This is important for species identification. 45 and 55 Pips To distinguish between P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus, if a call is around 45 kHz it is a Common Pipistrelle and around 55 kHz it is a Soprano. The rare P. nathusii calls at around 39 kHz and so is easier to distinguish. The problem is that there seems to be an almost continuous spectrum of Pip frequencies from 43 kHz to 59 kHz. More studies need to be done on the call frequency ranges of each species. Another small problem with differing frequencies is the doppler shift and a Pip passing by at 3.4 m/s (8 MPH) will show a doppler shift of about 1 kHz. For bat workers with a suitable licence, an examination in the hand or close up, shows distinct characteristics between the 45 and 55 Pips: *Muzzle colour and shape **P.p has a more bulbous muzzle and darker fur. *Set of eyes **P.p has eyes more deeply set in dark fur. **P.pg has thinner fur or bare skin next to the eyes. *Wing venation **This is difficult to distinguish and can only be seen on a captured bat. If this check is held to be definitive, it does not always correlate with a definite call frequency criterion. Resolving calls The following recording was made on a Duet combined heterodyne and FD detector. The heterodyne frequency was 53 kHz and the corresponding track sounds like this: What can be heard is a lot of background noise from crickets and a rather muddled pass by what is probably a pipistrelle. FD detector whole track A spectrogram of the FD track reveals what happened: FD detector Lesser Horseshoe pass Another bat was completely missed by the heterodyne detector which was set to the wrong frequency for that bat. It was a Lesser Horseshoe emerging from its roost. FD detector two Pips pass The muddle following the LHS resolves into two Pipistrelles flying together with frequencies of 47.7 kHz and 54.5 kHz, in other words, a Common and a Soprano Pipistrelle. Three bats have thus been positively identified using an FD recording These three bats would not have been identified by a heterodyne bat detector. From other recordings taken at the time, the insistent \\"chuck\\" sound was associated with the Soprano Pipistrelle at around 20 kHz, which habitually made this social call while flying. This is where an FD detector falls down as it regenerated the social call at around 40 kHz. FD detectors can only process tonal calls with a measurable frequency and not calls which have a random frequency pattern. Space for other bat species In preparation Non-bat sounds A whole world of ultrasound opens up when a bat detector is switched on. To distinguish bat and bat species it is important to recognise non-bat species. The following minimally edited recording was made in a small nature reserve in North Devon, UK, in September. None of these calls were audible normally. However, the cheat here is that the last sound is from a bat which is making a social call as it flies. Rodents and insectivores Mice, voles and shrews emit ultrasound calls which can sometimes be mistaken for bat social calls. Sometimes other clues must be used to be certain, such as a sound coming and going as a bat flies past. Crickets Crickets make a distinctive sound both audibly and in ultrasound. Some species cannot be heard by the human ear. In the height of summer, they can mask out bat calls and interfere with spectrogram analysis. They can trigger \\"voice activated\\" recorders which can be very annoying when listening back later. This is the other relationship between cricket and bat. Note the reaction of one cricket when approached by a bat detector. Background noises There is an irreducible hiss in the background of every bat detector recording. This is \\"system noise\\" from the microphone and electronics. This can vary widely between bat detectors and various types of bat detectors. Footsteps and contents of pockets like keys and small change can be very noisy at ultrasound frequencies. Wind in trees is often less of a problem as this noise is absorbed by air at a distance. More detailed notes Distance range of bat calls Higher sound frequencies are absorbed by the air over a distance. The amount of absorption depends on the frequency and the humidity of the air. This is why close thunder crackles and distant thunder rumbles; the air has absorbed the higher frequencies. At bat echolocation frequencies, air absorption limits the range both for the bat and for bat detectors. Typically at around 50 kHz the sound level halves every six metres, or put more technically, it is absorbed at around 1 dB per metre. In practice this puts the maximum range of a bat detector at around 30 metres and a bat's ability to locate any object at roughly 20 metres. These are very approximate figures and bats which call at lower frequencies can hear and be heard at much greater distances. Conversely a bat like the Lesser Horseshoe which calls mainly at about 110 kHz is more difficult to detect over 10 metres. Directionality of the ultrasonic sensor in the bat detector can also have a large effect on detection distance. A highly directional sensor such as the Polaroid element will have significantly decreased distance detection if the bat is not in front of the sensor. The directionality of the actual bat call also varies widely from species to species and can affect detection distance. With a small target like an insect, the level of the reflection coming back falls with the inverse fourth power of the distance. In other words, at twice the distance, the level falls 16 times. This puts the maximum range at which a bat can detect an insect in metres. A large object such as a tree, a building or the ground can be detected by the bat at much greater distances. Types of bat call The three basic types of bat call described an illustrated above provide different information to the bat. We cannot know what the bat actually hears, but research is continuing on what a bat can hear and discriminate. A bat does not receive a detailed image like a visual image although it has good eyesight as well, but essentially any ultrasound image it detects will be defocussed due to the comparatively long wavelengths of the sound frequencies used. At 50 kHz, the wavelength is about 7 mm. It is remarkable how well a bat can echolocate. Frequency modulation This is a rapidly falling whistle note and is used by most bat species. An FM call gives a very precise time measurement and enables a bat to detect distances to the accuracy of tens of centimetres. This technique is also used in radars where it has advantages over a very short pulse. As with radar itself, it was discovered that bats had been using these techniques for millions of years before man \\"invented\\" it. Constant frequency The Horseshoe bats Rhinolophus spp. use a mainly CF call. This is heard as a characteristic peeping sound on a bat detector. The frequency of the emitted call depends on the species and gives an immediate identification. Their call is not completely CF as it starts and ends with a \\"grunt\\" as can be seen on a spectrogram. A CF call does not give a precise distance measurement. It however gives a precise relative speed measurement due to the doppler effect. A \\"beep\\" lasting 60 milliseconds gives a linear length of the call of about 20 metres, thus if a target is less than 10 metres distance, the echo will start to return while the bat is still emitting the call. The doppler effect of the CF call from a moving bat is greatly exaggerated by a heterodyne bat detector. This can be used to estimate the speed of a flying bat or to identify bats which are echolocating while roosting. A bat call from a bat approaching or departing at calling at 50 kHz will typically show a doppler shift of +- 1 kHz and pro rats. This can cause uncertainty with some species such as Pipistrelles. Composite FM and CF Some species such as the Pipistrelles start their call with an FM component but the rate of change of frequency slows to an almost CF end part. On a spectrogram, his appears as a \\"hockey stick\\" shape. This in effect gives the best of both worlds, enabling precise distance and speed measurement. Some species alternate calls with and without a CF component, and Pipistrelles usually use an FM only call at short ranges. Detecting bats Acoustic bat detectors There is a range limitation with this method because of the absorption of ultrasound by air. For many bat species the range limit is around 30 metres, but it can be much less with Horseshoe bats and Long-eared bats. Visual identification Bats fly mostly at night but some indication of the species by sight at dusk or dawn can be given by size, flight patterns and proximity to known roosts. An example is when doing a bat roost emergence count at dusk when the likely species is further confirmed using an acoustic bat detector. The range limit depends on the light, surroundings and the night vision of the observer. Infrared Infrared imaging enables bats to be observed without causing them disturbance. This requires an IR illuminator such as a spotlight with a suitable filter or an IR LED emitter. Observation is done by IR binoculars or by IR CCTV. Some home camcorders made by Sony are sensitive to IR enabling an IR video recording to be made at low cost. The range limit is set by the illuminator and the definition of the imager. Species recognition is only by estimating size and by flight patterns. The power of an IR floodlight drops rapidly with distance, and a spotlight will miss bats not in the beam. Thermal Imaging A bat has to be warm to fly and emits heat of the order of 1 watt when flying, depending on size. The range is limited as with IR detection by the definition of the thermal imager. Affordable imagers will not detect distant bats and this method is unlikely to be better than IR illumination except with the most expensive high definition equipment. Ground radar Fixed ground radar is used to detect birds flying near aircraft. Bird/Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) systems are deployed at airfields. Mobile BASH installations are still in the development stage and await further research with bats. They are very expensive to deploy and the licensing arrangements for mobile zoological ground radars is unknown. Anecdotal reports suggest that the most sophisticated radar systems with detection software can identify the presence of bats at a range of around 1 kilometre. The near limit with radars is more distant than the maximum range of the above methods and there may be a substantial distance gap between these systems and radar in which bats cannot be observed.

Sicherungs-Division) was a rear-security division in the Wehrmacht during World War II. The unit was deployed in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union, in the Army Group Centre Rear Area. It was responsible for large-scale war crimes and atrocities including the deaths of thousands of Soviet civilians. Operational history The 286th Security Division was formed on 15 March 1941 around elements of the 213th Infantry Division, initially with one infantry regiment. By 1942 another two Security Regiments, 61 (upgraded from the Landessch√ºtzen-Regiment staff 61) and 122, were attached. A variety of units were subordinated to the division during its existence, including battalions of Russian troops and from February 1944 Grenadier Regiment 638, consisting of French volunteers, the LVF. During this period the division was assigned to Fourth Army, where it carried out occupation, economic exploitation and security duties in rear areas. It was involved in punitive operations against the local populace: these actions were carried out with extreme brutality (in total, Belarus lost up to a quarter of its population during the German occupation). A defendant at one of the post- war Soviet war crimes trials, Paul Eick, stated that he had set out to create and then liquidate a ghetto in the town of Orsha under the division's command.Prusin, p14 In June 1944, the Fourth Army was encircled by Soviet forces during the liberation of the Belorussian SSR, Operation Bagration. The 286th Security Division was overrun and destroyed in the vicinity of Orsha. Its remnants were reorganised late that year at Memel as the 286th Infantry Division, assigned to the Third Panzer Army; it was again destroyed at Neukuhren during the battles in Samland towards the end of the war.

Berr√≠os was charged with carrying out Proyecto Andrea in which Pinochet ordered the production of sarin gas, a chemical weapon used by the DINA. Sarin gas leaves no trace and victims' deaths closely mimic heart attacks. Other biochemical weapons produced by Berr√≠os included anthrax and botulism.Jonathan Franklin, Pinochet 'sold cocaine to Europe and US', The Guardian, July 11, 2006 Berr√≠os also allegedly produced cocaine for Pinochet, who then sold it to Europe and the United States. In the late 1970s, at the height of the Beagle Crisis between Chile and Argentina, Berr√≠os is reported to have worked on a plan to poison the water supply of Buenos Aires. Wanted by the Chilean authorities for involvement in the Letelier case, he escaped to Uruguay in 1991, at the beginning of the Chilean transition to democracy, and what has been identified as his corpse was found in 1995 near Montevideo.  DINA agent  Known in the DINA under his alias \\"Hermes\\", for which he began to work in 1974, Berr√≠os was connected to the creation of the explosive used for Orlando Letelier's car- bombing assassination in Washington, D.C. in 1976. In April 1976, Berr√≠os synthesized sarin. He was also suspected, along with DINA agent Michael Townley, of the torture and assassination of the Spanish citizen Carmelo Soria. In 1978, Townley, in a sworn but confidential declaration, stated that sarin gas was produced by the DINA under Berr√≠os' direction. He added that it was used to assassinate the real state archives custodian Renato Le√≥n Zenteno and the Chilean Army Corporal Manuel Leyton.Townley revel√≥ uso de gas sar√≠n antes de ser expulsado de Chile, El Mercurio, September 19, 2006 Former head of DINA Manuel Contreras declared to Chilean justice officials in 2005 that the CNI, successor of DINA, handed out monthly payments between 1978 and 1990 to the persons who had worked with Townley in Chile, all members of the far- right group Patria y Libertad: Mariana Callejas (Townley's wife), Francisco Oyarz√∫n, Gustavo Etchepare and Berr√≠os.Contreras dice que Pinochet dio orden \\"personal, exclusiva y directa\\" de asesinar a Prats y Letelier , La Tercera, May 13, 2005, mirrored on CC.TT. website According to La Naci√≥n, Berr√≠os also worked with drug traffickers and Drug Enforcement Administration agents.El coronel que le pena al ej√©rcito , La Naci√≥n, September 24, 2005  Frei Montalva  Questioned in March 2005 by Judge Alejandro Madrid about ex- Chilean Christian Democrat President Eduardo Frei Montalva's death, DINA agent Michael Townley acknowledged links between Colonia Dignidad, led by ex-Nazi Paul Sch√§fer, and DINA on one hand, and the Laboratorio de Guerra Bacteriol√≥gica del Ej√©rcito (Army Biological Warfare Laboratory) on the other hand. It is suspected that the toxin that killed Frei Montalva in Santiago's Santa Maria clinic in 1982 was created there. This new laboratory in Colonia Dignidad would have been, according to him, the continuation of the laboratory that the DINA had in Via Naranja de lo Curro, where he worked with Eugenio Berr√≠os in the clandestine unit Quetropill√°n. Townley would also have testified on biological experiments made upon the prisoners in Colonia Dignidad with the help of the two above-mentioned laboratories.Michael Townley fue interrogado por muerte de Frei Montalva , Radio Cooperativa, 30 March 2005  Escape, death and trial  On October 26, 1991,Confirman prisi√≥n de generales (R) en caso Berr√≠os , La Naci√≥n (mirrored by Memoria viva), 12 January 2004 a year before the \\"terror archives\\" were found in Paraguay, Eugenio Berr√≠os was escorted from Chile to Uruguay by the Special Unity of the DINE (Direccion de Inteligencia del Ej√©rcito, Army's Intelligence agency), in order to avoid him testifying before the Chilean court regarding the Letelier case and the case concerning the 1976 assassination of the Spanish diplomat and CEPAL civil servant Carmelo Soria.Caso Berr√≠os - La guerra secreta entre un esp√≠a y un abogado , El Periodista, N¬∞59, 8 April 2004 Rechazan libertad para ex uniformados en caso Berr√≠os , La Tercera (mirrored by Memoria viva), 12 January 2004 He had just been indicted by the magistrate Adolfo Ba√±ados in charge of the Letelier case. \\"Operaci√≥n Silencio\\" started on April, 1991, in order to hinder the investigations of the Chilean legal system regarding crimes committed during Pinochet's dictatorship, and the spiriting away of Arturo Sanhueza Ross, linked to the murder of MIR leader Jecar Neghme in 1989. According to the Rettig Report, Jecar Neghme's death was carried out by Chilean intelligence agents.Neghme Jecar Antonio , Memoria Viva, In September of that same year Carlos Herrera Jim√©nez, who killed trade-unionist Tucapel Jim√©nez, left the country. Berr√≠os followed in October, 1991, using passports from four different countries: Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil, raising concerns about Operation Condor still being in place. In Uruguay, he was protected by members of the Chilean and Uruguayan military intelligence as part of La cofradia, alleged to be the direct heir of Operation Condor. In Uruguay, Berrios was hidden at one of Uruguayan Colonel Eduardo Radaelli's family estates at Parque del Plata, using the alias \\"Tulio Orellana\\".Casella involucra al general Aguerrondo en el caso Berr√≠os , La Republica, 5 February 2007 Berr√≠os, however, escaped imprisonment on 15 November, 1992, asking for sanctuary next door at a retired navy officer's residence who, along with his wife, decided to escort him to the closest police station, Seccional 24 Parque del Plata. There, Berr√≠os claimed that he had been kidnapped by Chilean and Uruguayan military officials, that Gen. Pinochet intended to kill him and asking to be taken into custody since he had entered the country using fake documentation. Radaelli arrived shortly after, demanding the police officers to hand over Berr√≠os since he was \\"[...] out of his mind, delirious, and in need of treatment\\". Police officer Elbio Hern√°ndez was uncertain but later, Uruguayan military officer Tom√°s Casella arrived at the station also demanding the policemen to hand over Berr√≠os. After receiving a phone call from his superior, Hern√°ndez surrendered Berr√≠os to the Uruguayan officers, and he was never seen again alive. https://www.memoriaviva.com/criminales/criminales_b/berrios_eugenio.htm In February 1993, Pinochet travelled to Uruguay, and officer Casella was appointed as his aide-de-camp. In June, 1993, an anonymous letter sent to various Uruguayan deputies denounced Berr√≠os' presence in the country, leading them to request of President Luis Alberto Lacalle's government immediate investigations.Los restos son de Berr√≠os, Clar√≠n, 26 May 1995 On June 6, 1993, Lacalle immediately dismissed the police chief of Canelones, Ram√≥n Rivas, on charges of not having informed him of what had occurred. Three days later official investigations were initiated concerning the Berr√≠os case. On June 9, 1993, 14 Army Generals met with the Minister of Defence Mariano Brito, and two days later, General Mario Aguerrondo was dismissed.Andr√©s Capel√°n, Caso Berr√≠os: la justicia uruguaya entre la espada y la pared., Equipo Nizkor, 20 June 2004 That same June, after the details of the facts surrounding Berr√≠os' murder leaked, Casella, Radaelli and Wellington Sarli (another Uruguayan military officer) travelled to Chile to allegedly attend an Intelligence course which, according to Casella, was later cancelled since intelligence officers from several other countries were unable to attend. They spent a day in Santiago, and were later flown to Osorno so they could spend some days at the Termas de Puyehue, with all expends covered. In a 2007 interview, Casella stated that he had first entered into contact with Berr√≠os in March 1992 under the requests of a Chilean intelligence officer, and that he had immediately informed General Mario Aguerrondo, then head of the SID Uruguayan military intelligence agency (now retired), who allegedly ordered him to remain in contact with the Chileans. Finally, a corpse, identified by the Uruguayan justice as that of Berrios, was found in April 1995 in a beach of El Pinar, near Montevideo, with two gunshots to the head. His hands and feet were tied together, and forensic examinations declared that after his execution he was put inside a burlap sack, which was in turn tied closed with a rope. Forensic dentistry immediately led to his identification as Berr√≠os. Furthermore, DNA fingerprinting was also done several years later. According to the daughter of Carmelo Soria, the Spanish diplomat assassinated in 1976, Chilean Eduardo Aldunate Hermann, second-in-command of the MINUSTAH United Nations force in Haiti, was also involved in the assassination of Eugenio Berr√≠os.Familia de Carmelo Soria pidi√≥ que se interrogue a militar a cargo de tropas en Hait√≠, Radio Cooperativa, 11 October 2005 Three Uruguayan military officers (Tomas Casella, Washington Sarli and Eduardo Radaelli) have been extradited in April 2006 to Chile and were detained there, before being released on bail in September 2006.General (r) Manuel Contreras: Eugenio Berr√≠os est√° vivo, Radio Cooperativa, 10 July 2006 Lev√©e de l'immunit√© de Pinochet pour le meurtre d'un chimiste , news agency cable, 12 October 2006 In October 2006, the Court of Appeal of Santiago stripped Pinochet's parliamentary immunity (who was, in 1992, head of the Chilean military), opening up the way for his judgment concerning the homicide of Berr√≠os. Furthermore, the former directors of the DINE, Hern√°n Ram√≠rez Rurange and Eugenio Covarrubias, have been charged of obstruction to justice in this case. Ram√≠rez Rurange, several other Chilean militaries and one civilian, and the three Uruguayan officers have also been charged of sequestration, while Eugenio Covarrubias was charged with sequestration and homicide.

Contreras' lawyer, Fidel Reyes, alleged that the corpse discovered in El Pinar belonged in reality to a foreigner, and that Berr√≠os allegedly had in 2004 attended the funeral, in Chile, of one of his close relative. According to Contreras' deposition, the cocaine (which was \\"black cocaine\\" especially made to be undetectable) was produced by Berr√≠os in a military installation in Talagante, and both Pinochet's son, Marco Antonio Pinochet, and the businessman Edgardo Bathich were involved in the drug trade. The money from the trade was allegedly directly put in Pinochet's bank accounts abroad. Manuel Contreras' allegations concerning Berr√≠os' alleged survival have been flatly denied by the Uruguayan judge in charge of investigating his assassination, who claims that she is \\"99% sure\\" of the identification of the corpse found in 1995, and added that DNA analysis had been made a few years later.

Synopsis After the death of their mother, siblings Mitch, Kate, Travis, and Lori Robbins go to the Los Angeles Courthouse with their neighbor, Mrs. Forsythe. She tells the judge they have no family and that she is unable to take them in. Kate tells the Judge and a social worker that they have an Uncle Jack, but they don't believe Kate and the Judge decides to put them in a foster home until they get adopted. In the foster home, they are told Lori is going to be adopted. Refusing to be split up, they make a plan to run away. They escape to their old home where Mitch collects all the money he can find (9 dollars), and his Uncle Jack's address, knowing Jack will know where their father is. They also manage to get their dog back. They then get into their mother's old Volkswagen Beetle and drive away, with neighbors spotting them. The police are on their trail. They stop at a gas station but with only $1.25 left, they drive away without paying. Mitch later falls asleep at the wheel and gets the children stranded in the desert. Peggy Williams happens to drive past and notice them, they lie in order to get a ride with her. When she stops at a gas station to call the police after she suspects they're lying, Mitch takes the wheel of Peggy's car and drives away. They successfully manage to escape but they badly damage Peggy's car radiator. The four of them are hungry and stop at a store where Travis wins money on a slot machine with a quarter he picked up from the shop floor. While the children celebrate about the huge amount of money, two gangsters threaten them and claim the money is theirs, since the quarter was theirs. While they are fighting, Peggy (who managed to get a lift) saves them, by using a toy gun to bluff the gangsters into leaving. The children tell her the truth, and as they drive on together, they form a close bond, especially Peggy and little Lori. Peggy's car finally breaks down. They get a lift with a truck driver who drops them off at their uncle's home. Peggy discovers Uncle Jack is not their real uncle, but rather a wealthy friend of their father's. He welcomes them in and introduces himself, his gold-digging girlfriend Teresa and her son Rhett, who starts a fight with Mitch. Rhett subsequently goes and tattles on them to his mother, placing all the blame on them. Peggy takes the children to a motel for the night. Afterward, Jack reveals to Peggy that the children's father is in prison, and Mitch overhears them and sheds tears. The next day, they stop at a caf√©, when suddenly the police arrive. While the police confront Peggy, Mitch, Kate, Lori and Travis escape on a bus, which Mitch drives. With Peggy and the police in pursuit, a plane suddenly appears and lands in front of the bus, forcing them to stop. The pilot is Jack, who asks if he can become the children's guardian. After the hearing takes place, he is allowed to do so.

The Osmond Boys (the sons of Alan Osmond, now performing as The Osmonds Second Generation), performed the main theme, also called \\"On Our Own\\", and other incidental songs and music. The film's video rights were picked up in 1989 by Feature Films for Families, a video distribution company closely associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The video release was heavily re-edited, and an additional framing device was filmed by the distributor in which Peggy's mother, over the phone, recounts the events of the film and provides commentary which often contradicts the film itself. This was likely in an attempt to place the film within the views of the LDS Church. Director Lyman Dayton removed his name from the Feature Films for Families version, credited instead as \\"F.T. Pavlov\\". In March 2018, Questar Entertainment released the original version of the movie on DVD for the first time. In spite of having none of the scenes with the elderly woman providing moral commentary on the phone, the Questar version is actually two minutes longer than the Feature Films for Families version because it restores all the scenes that Feature Films for Families had cut.

The Astros would go on to win the 1986 National League Western Division title without him. Background Funk was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and attended Winnetonka High School and Northwest Missouri State University. In 1982, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. The Astros selected him in the 28th round of the June 1983 free agent draft.

He was enjoying a good year with the Columbus Astros when he was called to the parent club. 1986 season Upon reaching the Majors, Funk quickly filled the role of a left-handed reliever for the Astros bullpen. The team was in the middle of a pennant race and had been lacking a lefty since Frank DiPino had been traded to the Chicago Cubs. In his first seven games Funk would record a stellar era of 2.45. On August 23, 1986 he was summoned from the bullpen at Busch Memorial Stadium to relieve Mike Scott in what was a 3-1 St. Louis Cardinals lead. Funk would proceed to get hammered during the course of the inning. He surrendered four earned runs and helped pad the Cardinals lead to 7 to 1. Funk's era ballooned to 6.48 and he was quickly demoted back to the minors at the behest of manager Hal Lanier. Jeff Calhoun would assume his spot as the left-handed reliever in the Astros bullpen for the remainder of the season. For the year, and his career, Funk finished with no decisions or saves over 8‚Öì innings in eight games with six walks, two strikeouts (Mariano Duncan and Len Matuszek of the Los Angeles Dodgers), and the aforementioned 6.48 earned run average. Debut game Funk appeared in his first big league game on Thursday, July 24, 1986 in a 9-3 Houston win over the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium. He pitched the 9th and last inning of the game. The first batter he faced hit a home run.

Directed by Griffin Dunne, it starred Diane Lane, Donald Sutherland, Anton Yelchin, Kristen Stewart, and Chris Evans. The film explores many facets of family and societal dysfunction, including drug abuse, mental illness, and rape. Plot Trapped in his drug- dependent mother's apartment, 16-year-old Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) wants nothing more than to escape New York City. He wants to spend the summer in South America studying the Ishkanani Indians (known as the \\"Fierce People\\") with his anthropologist father whom he's never met. Finn's plan has to change after he is arrested when he buys drugs for his mother, Lower East Side Liz (Diane Lane), who works as a massage therapist. Determined to get their lives back on track, Liz moves the two of them into a guesthouse for the summer on the country estate of her ex-client, the aging billionaire, Ogden C. Osbourne (Donald Sutherland). In Osbourne's world of privilege and power, Finn and Liz encounter the super rich, a tribe portrayed as fiercer and more mysterious than anything the teenager might find in the South American jungle. (Dirk Wittenborn, the author of the novel on which the film is based, grew up in a modest household and felt like an outsider among the super rich in an upper- crust New Jersey enclave.Joy Press, \\"Privileged Information\\", Village Voice, 11 Jun 2002) While Liz battles her substance abuse and struggles to win back her son's love and trust, Finn falls in love with Osbourne's granddaughter, Maya Langley (Kristen Stewart).

More IITs were soon opened in Bombay, Madras, Kanpur and Delhi as well in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Beginning in the 1960s, close ties with the Soviet Union enabled the Indian Space Research Organisation to rapidly develop the Indian space program and advance nuclear power in India even after the first nuclear test explosion by India on 18 May 1974 at Pokhran. India accounts for about 10% of all expenditure on research and development in Asia and the number of scientific publications grew by 45% over the five years to 2007. However, according to former Indian science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, India is lagging in science and technology compared to developed countries. India has only 140 researchers per 1,000,000 population, compared to 4,651 in the United States. India invested US$3.7 billion in science and technology in 2002‚Äì2003.

While India has increased its output of scientific papers fourfold between 2000 and 2015 overtaking Russia and France in absolute number of papers per year, that rate has been exceeded by China and Brazil; Indian papers generate fewer cites than average, and relative to its population it has few scientists.http://www.nature.com/news/india-by-the-numbers-1.17519 History Homi Jehangir Bhabha was a nuclear physicist known as \\"father of the Indian nuclear program\\".  1947‚Äì1967  The office of the Hijli Detention Camp (photographed September 1951) served as the calling of IIT Kharagpur. India aimed \\"to convert India's economy into that of a modern state and to fit her into the nuclear age and do it quickly.\\" Nanda 2006 It was understood that India had not been at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, and hence made an effort to promote higher education, and science and technology in India. Planning Commission (1950) fixed investment levels, prescribed priorities, divided funds between agriculture and industry, and divided resources between the state and the federal governments. The result of the efforts between 1947‚Äì1962 saw the area under irrigation increase by , food production rise by 34 million metric tons, installed power generating capacity increase by 79 million kilowatts, and an overall increase of 94 percent in industrial production. The enormous population rise, however, would balance the gains. The economically beleaguered country was nevertheless able to build a large scientific workforce, second in numbers only to that of the United States and the Soviet Union. Education‚Äîprovided by the government of India‚Äîwas free and compulsory up to the Age of 14.Prabhu 2006 More emphasis was paid to the enhancement of vocational and technical skills. J. P. Naik, member- secretary of the Indian Education Commission, commented on the educational policies of the time: India's first reactor (Apsara) and a plutonium reprocessing facility, as photographed by a US satellite on 19 February 1966 On 18 August 1951 the minister of education Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, inaugurated the Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur in West Bengal.Vrat 2006 Possibly modeled after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology these institutions were conceived by a 22-member committee of scholars and entrepreneurs under the chairmanship of N. R. Sarkar. The Sino- Indian war (1962) came as a rude awakening to military preparedness.Khan 2006 Military cooperation with the Soviet Union‚Äîpartially aimed at developing advanced military technology‚Äîwas pursued during subsequent years. The Defence Research and Development Organisation was formed in 1958. Radio broadcasting was initiated in 1927 but became state responsibility only in 1930.Schwartzberg 2008 In 1947 it was given the name All India Radio and since 1957 it has been called Akashvani. Limited duration of television programming began in 1959, and complete broadcasting followed in 1965. The Indian Government acquired the EVS EM computers from the Soviet Union, which were used in large companies and research laboratories.Desai 2006  1967‚Äì1987  The roots of nuclear power in India lie in early acquisition of nuclear reactor technology from a number of western countries, particularly the American support for the Tarapur Atomic Power Station and Canada's CANDU reactors.Raja 2006 The peaceful policies of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi may have delayed the inception of nuclear technology in India. Stanley Wolpert (2008) describes the measures taken by the Indian government to increase agricultural output:Wolpert 2008 The Indian space program received only financial support from the Soviet Union, which helped the Indian Space Research Organisation achieve aims such as establishing the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station, launching remote sensing satellites, developing India's first satellite‚ÄîAryabhatta, and sending astronauts into space. India sustained its nuclear program during the aftermath of Operation Smiling Buddha, the country's first nuclear tests. Though the roots of the Steel Authority of India Ltd. lie in Hindustan Steel Private Limited (1954), the events leading up to the formation of the modern avatar are described below:SAIL (2008). Background and History. In 1981, the Indian Antarctic Programme was started when the first Indian expedition was flagged off for Antarctica from Goa. More missions were subsequently sent each year to India's base Dakshin Gangotri.  1987‚Äìpresent  Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Infosys Media Centre in Bangalore Indian agriculture benefited from the developments made in the field of biotechnology, for which a separate department was created in 1986 under the Ministry of Science and Technology.Sharma 2006, Biotechnology Revolution Both the Indian private sector and the government have invested in the medical and agricultural applications of biotechnology. Massive biotech parks were established in India while the government provided tax deduction for research and development under biotechnological firms. The Indian economy underwent economic reforms in 1991, leading to a new era of globalisation and international economic integration.Sharma 2006 Globalization Economic growth of over 6% annually was seen between 1993‚Äì2002. Same year a new permanent Antarctic base Maitri was founded and remains in operation till date. On 25 June 2002 India and the European Union agreed to bilateral cooperation in the field of science and technology.Ketkar 2006 A joint EU-India group of scholars was formed on 23 November 2001 to further promote joint research and development. India holds observer status at CERN while a joint India-EU Software Education and Development Centre is due at Bangalore. Certain scientists and activists, such as MIT systems scientist VA Shiva Ayyadurai, blame caste for holding back innovation and scientific research in India, making it difficult to sustain progress while regressive social organisation prevails. In addition, corruption and inefficiencies in the research sector and have resulted in corruption scandals and undermine innovation initiatives. Bangalore is considered to be the technological capital of India. IT, Biotechnology, Aerospace, Nuclear science, manufacturing technology, automobile engineering, chemical engineering, ship building, space science, electronics, computer science and other medical science related research and development are occurring on a large scale in the country. The southern part of India is responsible for the majority of technology and advancements the country has made. The golden triangle of IT and technology (Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai) forms the backbone of Indian manufacturing, R&D;, science and technology. In 2017, India became an associate member of European Organization for Nuclear Research.  Space exploration   Mars Orbit Mission  Artist's rendering of the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft. The Mars Orbiter Mission, also called \\"Mangalyaan\\", was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is India's first interplanetary mission, making ISRO the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency. The first Asian nation to reach Mars orbit and the first nation to do so on its first attempt was India.  Chandrayaan-1  On 18 November 2008, the Moon Impact probe was released from Chandrayaan-1 at a height of . During its 25-minute descent, Chandra's Altitudinal Composition Explorer (CHACE) recorded evidence of water in 650 mass spectra readings gathered during this time.http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2430.html On 24 September 2009 Science journal reported that the Chandrayaan-1 had detected water ice on the Moon.  Thirty Meter Telescope  The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a planned, eighteen story, astronomical observatory and extremely large telescope to be built on the summit of Mauna Kea in the state of Hawaii. The TMT is designed for near-ultraviolet to mid-infrared (0.31 to 28 Œºm wavelengths) observations, featuring adaptive optics to assist in correcting image blur. The TMT will be at the highest altitude of all the proposed ELTs. The telescope has government-level support from several R&D; spending nations: China, Japan, Canada and India.  Science academies in India  The idea of science academies in India has evolved along with the Indian independence movement. The three major science academies Indian National Science Academy, Indian Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, India were all founded in the pre-independence era (pre-1947) between 1930 and 1935.  Indian Academy of Sciences  Also referred to colloquially as the \\"Bangalore Academy\\", Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS) was founded in 1934 by C. V. Raman, the eminent physicist of his time in Bangalore (now Bengaluru), Karnataka (formerly known as the State of Mysore), India.  National Academy of Sciences, India  The founder and first president of the National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI) was Dr. Meghnad Saha in 1930 in Allahabad (Prayag), Uttar Pradesh, India.  Indian National Science Academy  Founded in 1935 based on a proposal by the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) and National Institute of Science of India (NISI) with Dr. Meghnad Saha's blessings, Indian National Science Academy (INSA) is based in New Delhi, India. According to its charter, the historical aim of the INSA was to be similar to the Royal Society, London, a gathering of learned people to exchange ideas and further science.

","title":"Science and technology in India"},{"id":"13141481","text":"MidwayUSA is a privately held American retailer of various hunting and outdoor-related products. The company is headquartered in Columbia, Missouri, and sells in the continental United States. The company markets online. History Ely Arms, Inc., the original name of MidwayUSA, was a well- planned, small start-up gun shop in Columbia, Missouri ‚Äì opening on June 18, 1977. Larry Potterfield, with his next younger brother Jerry, opened the business in a metal, pole-frame building. Jerry sold his half interest to Larry in 1980 and returned home to farm. The mail-order division was started quite modestly later in 1977, with a small offering of ‚Äòhand-made‚Äô 8mm Japanese pistol ammunition and 25 Remington rifle ammunition. In 1980 Midway received the first shipment of what was to be a total production run of 500,000 rounds of 8mm Nambu brass, produced by B.E.L.L. Labs of Chicago. Much of this brass was loaded into ammunition and can still be found at gun shows in a bright orange box. The first press releases were under the name Ely Arms, Inc., which turned out to be in conflict with the Eley Division of Kynoch Industry; the term Eley was trademarked. So the name Ely Arms, Inc. was changed to Midway Arms, Inc., to avoid the conflict. The name Midway comes from the small community of Midway, in which the business was originally located. The name MidwayUSA was adopted as a dba in April 1998. Starline Brass was just starting up in the mid-1970s and MidwayUSA became their first distributor of bulk pistol brass, and in turn, the grandfather of the bulk components business in the United States. Winchester began selling bulk components to MidwayUSA in 1984 and Remington came on board in 1987. The Volker-McClure act was passed in 1986, modifying the 1968 Gun Control Act to allow the sale of cartridge cases directly to the end consumer and MidwayUSA immediately changed their model from business to FFL, to also include business to consumer. In 1987 the business began adding other reloading products, the first of which was Lee Precision. Computerization played a major role in the development of MidwayUSA; Potterfield had one computer class in college, and in 1982 he purchased the Company's first computer, an Apple III. In 1986 he bought the first IBM; in March 1987 they began networking their computers together. All of this is the basis for the very significant Information System and Website Management Departments at MidwayUSA today. In 2014 MidwayUSA became an online-only retailer moving away from mail orders and the master catalog upon which the company was built. Modern Management Practices MidwayUSA is a proponent of the use of Modern Management Practices in business management. Modern Management Practices include Baldrige, Lean, ISO and Six Sigma. MidwayUSA received the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 2009, and 2015, and is one of only seven organizations to earn the award twice since the first award cycle in 1988. The 2015 Baldrige National Quality Award was a follow-up to MidwayUSA's receipt of the Missouri Quality Award from the Excellence in Missouri Foundation in 2015, an award the organization also received in 2008.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fMLGOdXGl4&index;=5&list;=PL987EF9D5C5133095 NRA support Larry and Brenda Potterfield created two programs and several educational endowments in the National Rifle Association (NRA) Foundation. Brenda also served as the Vice President of the NRA Foundation's Board of Trustees. Since 1992, MidwayUSA has asked customers to round up the total of each order and donate the change to the NRA/ILA.

Its primary purpose is to foster dialogue between different religious groups within the Holy Land (specifically Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze and Bah√° º√≠s). This is done on a grass roots level and throughout Israel and the Palestinian Territories. History In the fall of 2001 ‚Äì in the wake of over a year of violence in the Middle East (from the Second Intifada) and the September 11 attacks in the U.S. ‚Äì the newly formed IEA set itself to the task of building and strengthening a grassroots interfaith movement for peace, justice, and sustainability in the Holy Land and in the Middle East. Envisioning a society in which the \\"otherness\\" of \\"the other\\" is not only accepted, but truly understood and respected, the IEA dedicated itself to promoting real coexistence and human peace in the Middle East through cross- cultural study and inter-religious dialogue. The IEA was founded on the following principles and goals: * Equal representation of all faiths in the IEA. * Gender equality in the decision making processes and activities of the IEA. * Outreach to individuals and communities from all faiths, age groups, walks of life, and levels of society. * Outreach to individuals and communities across the religious-secular and political spectra. * Continual recruitment via committed activists on the local and regional levels. * Implementation of interactive programs that effectively change outlooks and attitudes, such as extended weekend seminars and ongoing study groups. * Continual development of new models for effective encounter. * Ongoing evaluation of all strategies and programs. Since 2001, the IEA has grown from just six groups to one hundred, with a growth of an estimated amount of 800 participants to an estimated amount of 6000 participants. Current Activity Overview The IEA operates within three concentric circles of interfaith work. In the first and most preeminent circle ‚Äì the Inner-Israeli circle ‚Äì the IEA focuses on the promotion of respectful relations between Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze and Bah√° º√≠s living within Israel. According to their website, this process in turn impacts and enables the second circle ‚Äì the Israeli-Palestinian circle ‚Äì where the IEA works in cooperation with 8 Palestinian organizations across the Palestinian Territories. The work of the first and second circles, according to IEA's organizers, aids the work of the third circle ‚Äì the Middle East region ‚Äì where the IEA has been a major founder in establishing the Middle East Abrahamic Forum, along with similar organizations from Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey. Additionally, the IEA maintains three interconnected programmatic sections. The first section, commonly regarded as the general program, is accessible to all segments of society, regardless of age or sex. The Women's Interfaith Encounter (WIE) was launched in the winter of 2001 to address women's needs while the third programmatic section, the Youth Interfaith Encounter (YIE), designs and implements programs specifically for young adults. The YIE was created in the spring of 2002. Lastly, the IEA employs three different program formats through which it facilitates its interfaith encounters: inter- religious study sessions, multi-day conferences, and desert seminars. In bringing Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, and Bah√° º√≠s together to study topics of relevance from their own religious perspectives, interfaith study is used to achieve two main goals. Primarily, it serves as a vehicle towards understanding, acceptance, and respect for \\"the other\\", but it also serves as a way to deepen awareness of one's own religion. The IEA also maintains connections and relationships with many international interfaith organizations and networks. The IEA is a Member Group of the International Association for Religious Freedom, a Member Group of Roots and Shoots of the Jane Goodall Institute and an Affiliate Member of the Council of Centers on Jewish- Christian Relations. The Jerusalem programs of the IEA function as part of the Partner Cities Network of the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions and the Goldin Institute. The IEA is also a member in the Committee of Religious NGOs at the United Nations and a founding member of the Partnership Committee for the United Nations Decade of Interreligious Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals, Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals, and San Francisco Giants . Biography Early life Maxwell is the son of Austin Maxwell, a US Navy dentist who also served as the \\"presidential dentist\\" from 1997 to 2002, providing dental care for US Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and Vice President Al Gore, and their families. His mother, Kathy, was also a Navy officer. He has one sister. He grew up in Maryland and South Carolina, and lived in Japan for four years while his father was stationed there. Maxwell was drafted out of Sherwood High School by the Baltimore Orioles in the 43rd round (1279th overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft, but opted instead to attend college at the University of Maryland. In 2003, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 2004 to play for the Cotuit Kettleers. He was drafted, again, in by the Texas Rangers in the 10th round (291st overall), but declined, and the following year by the Washington Nationals in the 4th round (114th overall). He signed and played most of for the Vermont Lake Monsters, the Nationals Short-Season A team. Professional career Washington Nationals In , he split his time between Low-A Hagerstown, and High-A Potomac, where, he combined to hit .281 with 27 home runs, 83 RBI and 35 stolen bases, the only player in Minor League Baseball to record at least 25 doubles, 25 home runs and 25 stolen bases in 2007.\\" Washington Nationals players celebrate a walk-off grand slam by Maxwell on September 30, After the minor league season ended, the Nationals promoted Maxwell to the major leagues, though he \\"was told not to expect much from his first month in the majors.\\" On September 5, he made his debut, as pinch hitter, and flew out to the warning track. Six days later, in his third pinch hitting appearance, Maxwell recorded his first career base hit, a pinch-hit grand slam off an 0‚Äì2 pitch from Chris Seddon, of the Florida Marlins. After the 2007 regular season, Maxwell played for the Peoria Javelinas in the Arizona Fall League. Maxwell was assigned to the Harrisburg Senators of the Double-A Eastern League in 2008 after hitting .280 in 13 spring training games for Washington, but missed most of the year with a fractured wrist suffered while diving for a flyball in the outfield. Maxwell spent most of the 2009 season with the AAA Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. He was called up late in the season because of injured center fielder Nyjer Morgan. On September 30, Maxwell hit a two-out full count walk off grand slam off of Francisco Rodriguez of the New York Mets on Fan Appreciation Day, the Nationals' last home game of the season. Maxwell split time with the AAA Syracuse Chiefs of the International League and the Nationals in 2010. On September 15, Maxwell hit a grand slam in the 2nd inning off of Mike Minor of the Atlanta Braves giving him three grand slams in four career at bats with the bases loaded. In September, Maxwell sat out two games with a minor thumb injury suffered on September 18. He returned September 21 against the Houston Astros.

The fuel was originally procured under tight security restrictions for the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, and known as LF-1 (lighter fluid one). It was commercial charcoal lighter fluid. A specification, MIL-T-25524, was subsequently written to include an additive for improving its thermal oxidative stability.https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA186752?q=military+jet+fuels+1944, p.5 The fuel is officially called Thermally Stable Aviation Turbine Fuel. JPTS has a lower freeze point, lower viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard Air Force fuels. In 1999 the United States Air Force spent approximately $11.3 million on fuel for the Lockheed U-2 aircraft, and was looking for a lower cost alternative. The U-2 has used JPTS since the aircraft's development in the 1950s. The low viscosity is needed to overcome the partial solidification of the fuel in low temperatures. The fuel also serves as coolant of engines and aerodynamically heated surfaces. As the fuel flow at U-2 operation altitude at cruising flight is about sixteen times lower than at sea level, the dwell time over hot surfaces is longer and increases the chances of thermal breakdown; high thermal stability is therefore desired to avoid coking and deposition of varnishes in the piping. JPTS is a specialty fuel and is produced by only two oil refineries in the United States. As such, it has limited worldwide availability and costs over three times the per- gallon price of the Air Force's primary jet fuel, JP-8. Research is under way to find a cheaper and easier alternative involving additives to generally used jet fuels. A JP-8 based alternative, JP-8+100LT, is being considered. JP-8+100 has increased thermal stability by 100 degrees F more than stock JP8, and is only 0.5 cents per gallon more expensive; low temperature additives can be blended to this stock to add the desired cold performance. The specification includes a flash point of 43 ¬∞C (110 ¬∞F), a freezing point of -53 ¬∞C (-64 ¬∞F) and flammability limits of 1 and 6 %. It has an appearance of a water-white clear liquid with specific gravity of 0.816. It is insoluble in water. It is composed of a complex mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons.

Mitosis in multinucleate cells can occur either in a coordinated, synchronous manner where all nuclei divide simultaneously or asynchronously where individual nuclei divide independently in time and space. Certain organisms may have a multinuclear stage of their life cycle. For example, slime molds have a vegetative, multinucleate life stage called a plasmodium. Although not normally viewed as a case of multinucleation, plant cells share a common cytoplasm by plasmodesmata, and most cells in animal tissues are in communication with their neighbors via gap junctions. Multinucleate cells, depending on the mechanism by which they are formed, can be divided into \\"syncytia\\" (formed by cell fusion) or \\"coenocytes\\" (formed by nuclear division not being followed by cytokinesis). A number of dinoflagellates are known to have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom. Some bacteria, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a pathogen of the respiratory tract, may display multinuclear filaments as a result of a delay between genome replication and cellular division.  Terminology  Some biologists use the term \\"acellular\\" to refer to multinucleate cell forms (syncitia and plasmodia), such as to differentiate \\"acellular\\" slime molds from the purely \\"cellular\\" ones (which do not form such structures). This usage is incorrect and highly misleading to laymen, and as such it is strongly discouraged. Some use the term \\"syncytium\\" in a wide sense, to mean any type of multinucleate cell,Minelli, Alessandro (2009). Syncytia. In: Perspectives in Animal Phylogeny and Evolution. Oxford University Press. p. 113-116. link. while others differentiate the terms for each type. Physiological examples Syncytia Syncytia are multinuclear cells that can form either through normal biological processes, such as the mammalian placenta, or under the influence of certain pathogens, such as HIV, via fusion of the plasma membrane. Other examples include the skeletal muscle cells of mammals, the tapetal cells of plants, and the storage cells of Douglas-fir seeds. The polymorphonuclear leukocytes of mammals are not polynuclear cells, although the lobes of their nuclei are so deeply bifurcated that they can appear so under non-optimal microscopy. Osteoclasts are multinuclear cells that are found commonly in the human body that aid in the maintenance and repair of the bones by secreting acid that dissolves bone matter. They are typically found to have 5 nuclei per cell, due to the fusion of preosteoclasts. The chlorarachniophytes form multinucleate cells by fusion, being syncytia and not coenocytes. This syncytia is called plasmodium, in the sense of a multinucleate protoplast without a cell wall which exhibits amoeboid movement.Hoek, C. van den, Mann, D.G. and Jahns, H.M. (1995). Algae An Introduction to Phycology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge Other examples include some plasmodiophorids, some haplosporidians, and the grex of cellular slime moulds (dictyostelids and acrasids).  Placenta  The placenta, a temporary organ that transports nutrients, oxygen, waste, and other materials between a mother and a developing fetus, is partially composed of a syncytial layer that forms the interface between the fetus and the mother. In addition to performing simple interface duties, the placental syncytia also acts as a barrier to infection from viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, which is likely due to unique cytoskeletal properties of these cells. Coenocytes  Furthermore, multinucleate cells are produced from specialized cell cycles in which nuclear division occurs without cytokinesis, thus leading to large coenocytes or plasmodia. In filamentous fungi, multinucleate cells may extend over hundreds of meters so that different regions of a single cell experience dramatically different microenvironments. Other examples include, the plasmodia of plasmodial slime molds (myxogastrids) and the schizont of the Plasmodium parasite which causes malaria. Pathological examples Multinucleated cells can also occur under pathological conditions as the consequence of a disturbed cell cycle control (e.g., some binucleated cells and metastasizing tumor cells).  Human Immunodeficiency Virus  As previously mentioned, syncytia may be induced through the actions of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, where T-cells are fused by the action of virus-derived proteins on the cell membrane. During viral replication in T lymphoid cells, large amounts of viral Envelope Glycoprotein (Env) are synthesized and trafficked to the cell membrane where they can be incorporated in to new virus particles. However, some of the Env molecules interact with neighboring T-cell receptors, which brings the cells into close enough proximity to enable trigger events culminating in the fusion of two host cells, likely due to the close contact of the two plasma membranes. This interaction is likely specific to CD4+ T-cells, as cells lacking this receptor were unable to form syncytia in laboratory conditions.

The mud whiting was first described in 1985 and is currently known from the north west coast of Australia and the Indian coast. As its name suggests, mud whiting prefer muddy or silty substrates, and are commonly found in association with the banana prawn. Due to this relationship, Australian prawn trawlers take large quantities of the species, but it is currently not marketed. Taxonomy and naming The mud whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three genera in the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt-whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidea. The species was scientifically examined by Dutt and Sujatha their revision of the sillaginid fishes of India and incorrectly assigned the specimen to the preexisting species Sillago macrolepis. Roland McKay reexamined the species during his revision of the Sillaginidae, determining it to be a new species and naming it Sillago lutea. A specimen collected from Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia was assigned to be the holotype for the species. The binomial name of \\"lutea\\" is derived from the Latin meaning \\"belonging to mud\\", also reflected in the common name in reference to its preferred habitat. Description As with most of the genus Sillago, the mud whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the two rows of cheek scales and head. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 20 to 22 soft rays posterior. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 21 to 23 soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 67 to 72 lateral line scales and a total of 33 to 35 vertebrae. The species has a known maximum length of over 16 cm. The swim bladder is similar to the Japanese whiting, characterised by a short central anterior extension with two anteriorly facing anterolateral projections, which may be well or poorly developed. There is a single median posterior extension. The duct like process on the ventral surface of the swim bladder is present. The colour of the fish is a light sandy brown above, with a paler brown to white on the underside and a poorly defined silvery mid-lateral band. The scale margins are occasionally slightly darker than the centres, giving a vague mesh-like appearance above the lateral line. All the fins are transparent, the only exception being the spinous dorsal fin which has a dusting of fine black spots. There is no dark spot at the base of the pectoral fin, another feature used to distinguish between sillaginid species. Distribution and habitat The mud whiting is known to inhabit two regions, the north west coast of Australia from Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia to the eastern Gulf of Carpentaria and the Arafura Sea, as well as the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. Mud whiting are commonly associated with the banana prawn, Penaeus merguiensis de Man in northern Australia, and inhabit most muddy or very silty substrates. Mud whiting occur in a range of depths, from 0 to 60 m. The species reaches sexual maturity at 10 cm. Relationship to humans Mud whiting are most often taken by trawl nets, with large amounts taken by prawn trawlers but as the species grows to only 16 cm, the catch is of no commercial importance at present. Minor amounts of the fish are also taken by trawlers on the north coast of Australia from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Exmouth Gulf. McKay suggests the species could form the basis of a small bycatch fishery, to be exported ungutted.

He was a noted British physician, whose death was commemorated with a long obituary in The Daily Telegraph; his area of specialisation was geriatric medicine and improving conditions for elderly patients. John Wedgwood was the elder son of the Hon. Josiah Wedgwood ‚Äì later the managing director of the Wedgwood pottery firm ‚Äì by his wife the former Dorothy Mary Winser. He was educated at Abbotsholme School and then at Trinity College, Cambridge before going on to Guy's Hospital. He studied surgery but was wounded during the Second World War, which left him unable to stand for long periods of time and therefore unable to practice surgery. He switched to general medicine, initially specialising in cardiology before becoming interesting in geriatric and disability medicine. In 1987 he was appointed CBE for his work. He was twice married, and had three sons and two daughters by his first wife Margaret Mason whom he married 1943 and divorced 1971. He was also survived by his second wife Jo Tamlyn (n√©e Ripsher) whom he married in 1972. From 1970 he was the heir presumptive to his nephew, the 4th Baron Wedgwood.

English colonists adopted use of a Nipmuc dialect word for the territory of this people. History Podunk is of Algonquian origin, meaning \\"where you sink in mire\\", or a boggy place, in the Nipmuc dialect. The Podunk people called their homeplace Nowashe, \\"between rivers.\\" This people lived in territory near the mouth of the Park River at its confluence with the Connecticut River. The Dutch called these waterways the Little River and Great River, respectively. The Dutch indicated their territory on an early 17th- century map with the term Nowass, likely a transliteration of the Algonquian word. Like other Woodland peoples, the Podunk built their summer lodges near the river. They fished for shad and salmon, and lampreys in their season. The men hunted deer and bear, as well as small game. The women cultivated and processed varieties of maize and beans, as well as drying the meats and preparing skins. They used the furs of otter, mink, and beaver for clothing, and used other hides to cover their wigwams. In winter they moved to inland camp sites. As part of their winter diet, they ate dried venison and bear meat. Numerous of their tools and artifacts, and other archeological evidence, has been found along the rivers and in the highlands. The Podunk tribe had three bands: the Namferoke (in Podunk, \\"fishing place\\"), who lived near the present-day village of Warehouse Point; the Hockanum (Podunk, \\"a hook\\", or \\"hook shaped\\"), led by Tantonimo, who lived near what developed as the village known as Hockanum; and the Scanticook (Nipmuc, \\"at the river fork\\"), who lived on the north bank of the Scantic River near the section called Weymouth. Their leader was called Foxen (or Poxen). Foxen/Poxen witnessed land deeds in 1640. He became the great councilor of the Mohegan (\\"wolf people\\"), and his name appears repeatedly in early records. Post-encounter history English colonists entered the Connecticut River valley around 1631; it was inhabited by peoples they called the River Tribes. After the English began to settle in this area, the General Court reserved much of the land to the Podunk as their traditional territory. In the Winter of 1635, the Podunk kept alive the ill- prepared settlers at Hartford with their gifts of \\"malt, and acorns, and grains.\\" During this time, the Podunk were governed by two sachems, Waginacut and Arramamet. Prior to the English-Narragansett war, the Podunk seemed to have had a peaceful relationship with colonists. Until about 1675 they lived in close proximity. However, the English restricted the Podunk in many ways. Smiths were not to work for the Podunk, and none but licensed traders were to buy their corn, beaver, venison, or timber. The English forbade any trade in arms, horses, dogs, or boats, or in \\"dangerous\\" supplies, such as cider or alcohol. The Podunk were forbidden to enter English houses or handle the weapons of the settlers, nor were they to bring their own guns into the towns. If found in the English colony at night, they were at risk of arrest by a guard, or of being shot if they had a conflict. The Podunk were not allowed to harbor outsiders in their villages. In 1653 the English ordered them to give up their arms to prove their loyalty. In 1657, a dispute between the Podunks and both the Mohegans and Tunxis surrounding the murder of a \\"Connecticut sagamore,\\" seems to have led to the outbreak of a war against Uncas, sachem of the Mohegans, where the Podunks were aided by the Pocumtucks. In 1659, Thomas Burnham (1617‚Äì1688) purchased the tract of land now covered by the towns of South Windsor and East Hartford from Tantinomo. \\"Fort Hill\\" is probably the fort to which \\"one-eyed\\" Tantinomo withdrew at the time of his quarrel with chiefs Oncas and Sequassen in 1665, when the English unsuccessfully attempted arbitration between them. In 1675, the Podunks fought the United Colonies during King Philip's War. The Podunk suffered high rates of mortality from infectious endemic diseases carried by the colonists. Together with disruption caused by colonial pressures, their numbers dropped dramatically. By 1736, the remnants of the Podunk had amalgamated with others to form the Schaghticoke tribe. They disappeared from the historic record and are considered extinct as a tribe. In the early 21st century, the former Podunk land is included in the towns of East Hartford, East Windsor, South Windsor, Manchester, part of Ellington, Vernon, Bolton, Marlborough and Glastonbury. According to a late 19th-century history, the region north of the Hockanum River was generally known as Podunk in colonial times; that south of the river, as Hockanum. Etymology A neck of land, a projection or bulge in the land, was called a Podunk or Pautunk. \\"Pautage\\" means a neck, where the land juts out and seems to connect with Podunk, which probably means where the land juts out and people dwell. The prefix \\"paut\\" means poddy, pouting, or bulging, while the suffix \\"age\\" [aki] means land. \\"Pautapaug\\" and \\"Potapaug\\" mean a bulging in the bay, cove, or pond where there is standing water. \\"Paug\\" means bay or bog. \\"Pautipaug\\" was said to mean where you sink in mire, but here it is the suffix \\"paug\\", which means mire or bog not \\"pod\\" or \\"paut\\". The name Podunk does not have a bog element in it and ends with a suffix that means dwelling place or \\"danak\\". Another example is Poodhumsk, which means projecting rock.

Finnegan always wore a Union Flag and a Shamrock on his boxing trunks to signify his joint heritage. Finnegan was introduced to boxing at a young age by his elder brother Terence. His younger brother Kevin also boxed professionally, winning the British and European middleweight titles, and fighting such opponents as Marvin Hagler and Alan Minter.  Amateur career  Juggling his amateur boxing career with his work as a hod carrier, Finnegan was the 1966 ABA middleweight champion, but he considered retiring from the sport after John Turpin, the man he had beaten in the ABA finals, was chosen ahead of him to represent England at the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Jamaica. Finnegan competed at the 1967 European Amateur Boxing Championships in Rome, where he lost on points to Jan Hejduk of Czechoslovakia. Finnegan almost missed out on making the 1968 Summer Olympics team after sustaining an eye injury which prevented him taking the ABA championships.Wallechinsky, David and Jaime Loucky (2008). \\"Boxing: Middlewight\\". In The Complete Book of the Olympics: 2008 Edition. London: Aurum Press, Limited. pp.449‚Äì50. His disappointment about not making the team resulted in a two-week drinking binge. Finnegan's trainer at his Hayes boxing club, Dick Gunn, rescued the boxer from his binge by securing a box-off which Finnegan won. One final obstacle almost prevented Finnegan's participation in the games: ¬£70 owed in National Insurance Stamps, for which he had to appear before a magistrate. When the presiding magistrate heard that Finnegan was due to represent Britain at the Olympics he was given a reprieve, and wished luck in his bid to win a gold medal. When the Games were over, the debt was eventually paid by the British boxing promoter Harry Levene. Fighting in the middleweight division, Finnegan's first opponent at the Olympics was little-known Titus Simba of Tanzania; Finnegan was knocked down in the first round, but climbed off the canvas to win the decision. In the quarter-finals Finnegan guaranteed himself at least a bronze medal by out-pointing the Yugoslav Mate Parlov, who would win gold at the 1972 Olympics and later hold the WBC light-heavyweight championship. In the semi-final, Finnegan won a 4‚Äì1 decision over the American Al Jones despite receiving two standing eight- counts. Finnegan's final opponent was Aleksei Kiselyov of the Soviet Union. Finnegan won by a 3‚Äì2 verdict, the Mexican, Spanish and Cuban judges voting for him, and the Thai and Indian for Kiselyov. Finnegan was the last British boxer to win an Olympic gold medal until Audley Harrison in 2000. For his success Finnegan was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honours, which was presented to him by the Queen Elizabeth II on 12 February 1969. In a famous television interview conducted moments after winning gold, Finnegan's wife back in Britain, Cheryl, remarked: \\"Fuckin' 'ell, you 'aven't fuckin' gone and done it, 'ave you?\\", to which Finnegan replied: \\"Yes, ol' lady, I fuckin' have.\\" When asked of his future plans, Finnegan quipped that he intended \\"to go home and increase the family.\\" Finnegan's biggest problem after his gold medal victory was producing enough urine for the doping test. It would take several glasses of water, three or four pints of beer, encouragement from others, and a victory meal before Finnegan finally had enough urine to produce for the doping test which he finally got at 1:40 AM CST. The test proved negative. Finnegan wrote an autobiography entitled Finnegan: Self-Portrait of a Fighting Man about his boxing career, including his gold medal win at Mexico City which he referred to as a \\"golden rivet\\".  1968 Olympic results  Chris Finnegan won an Olympic gold medal while representing Great Britain as a middleweight boxer in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. Here are his results: * Round of 32: Defeated Titus Simba (Tanzania) by decision, 5‚Äì0 * Round of 16: Defeated Ewald Wichert (West Germany) by decision, 3‚Äì2 * Quarterfinal: Defeated Mate Parlov (Yugoslavia) by decision, 5‚Äì0 * Semifinal: Defeated Alfred Jones (United States) by decision, 4‚Äì1 * Final: Defeated Aleksei Kiselyov (Soviet Union) by decision, 3‚Äì2 (won gold medal) Professional career The story of an unemployed labourer winning a gold medal for Britain at the Olympics had led to the Finnegans being inundated with small donations of money from well-wishers in the UK. Finnegan had considered turning professional even before the Olympics, but his money troubles meant that he was \\"more or less forced to\\". To manage him he hired Sam Burns, who had guided Terry Downes to the world middleweight championship in 1962. Now trained by Freddie Hill, he made his professional debut on 9 December 1968, defeating Mike Fleetham in three rounds. Finnegan won 13 of his first 14 fights, his sole loss a cut-eye stoppage against Danny Ashie. Among his early opponents were Brendan Ingle, who would later go on to be a successful boxing trainer, and Harry Scott, then the number-one ranked British middleweight contender. In his 15th fight, Finnegan was matched with reigning European middleweight champion Tom Bogs in Copenhagen, as a late replacement for the injured Mark Rowe. Finnegan dropped a close 15-round decision, in which the referee and sole judge Herbert Tomser scored four rounds to Bogs and eleven even. Five months later, in January 1971, Finnegan stopped Eddie Avoth in the 15th round to win the British and British Commonwealth light-heavyweight titles. In May 1971, Finnegan travelled to Berlin to challenge for the European light- heavyweight title, held by Conny Velensek of Germany. The fight was scored a draw, although several British and German reporters at ringside felt that Finnegan deserved to win. After a win over Roger Rouse, who had previously fought both Dick Tiger and Bob Foster for the world light-heavyweight title, Finnegan and Velensek met again, this time at the Nottingham Ice Rink. Finnegan won a unanimous 15-round decision to take the title. Finnegan was named Ring Magazine's progress of the year for 1971 and was now being touted as a challenger to reigning world light-heavyweight champion Bob Foster; he was at ringside for Foster's fight with Vicente Rondon and introduced to the crowd after the fight. Finnegan made his first defence of the European title four months later against Jan Lubbers at the Royal Albert Hall, and won by an eighth-round knockout. The world title fight with Foster was arranged for 26 September 1972, to take place at Wembley. Finnegan was considered a heavy underdog against Foster, whose previous two opponents, contenders Rondon and Mike Quarry, had lasted a combined total of six rounds before being knocked out by him. However, Finnegan proved more competitive than expected, finally being stopped by Foster in the 14th round of a gruelling contest. Afterwards, Foster commented that Finnegan had been the best-equipped of all his previous title challengers. The bout was selected as \\"Fight of the Year\\" by Ring Magazine. Six weeks after the Foster fight, Finnegan faced Rudiger Schmidtke at Wembley, having been ordered by the European Boxing Union to defend his European title against him or risk being stripped of it. Finnegan lost by a 12th-round TKO after sustaining a bad cut on his nose. He remained inactive for four months, before successfully defending his British and Commonwealth titles against Roy John, winning a 15-round decision at Wembley. Finnegan's next defence of his British and Commonwealth belts was against new European champion and emerging British light-heavyweight contender John Conteh; Finnegan lost a 15-round decision. He then won a ten-round decision over Mike Quarry, before facing Conteh again. This time Finnegan was stopped on cuts after six rounds. Finnegan then dropped a decision against Johnny Frankham for the British light-heavyweight title, before avenging that loss to win the Lonsdale Belt outright. That proved to be his final fight, as Finnegan retired from boxing in 1975 after undergoing surgery to repair a detached retina. His final record stood at 29‚Äì7‚Äì1. Death Finnegan died at the age of 64 after several weeks in Hillingdon Hospital suffering from pneumonia.

Cast by the Revere Copper Company in Boston, Massachusetts, it is the only Revere bell outside the United States. The bell is in height and in diameter with a clapper underneath. Maria Revere presented the bell to the first Church of St. Andrew in 1843 on condition that it be used to sound a curfew for five minutes at 8:00 pm every night. The curfew bell rang until 1855 when the church was demolished, and was resumed when the second church (which became St. Andrew's Cathedral later) was constructed in its place in 1861 until it was permanently discontinued in 1874. On 6 February 1889, the Revere Bell was replaced by a new peal of bells presented by the family of Captain J. S. H. Fraser. The bell was put into storage until 1911, when it was installed in St. George's Garrison Church in Tanglin Barracks. However, after it became irreparably cracked it was moved to a Royal Engineers storeyard. The Raffles Museum, now the National Museum of Singapore, came to know about the bell in September 1937, and took custody of it after the Anglican Archdeacon of Singapore, Graham White, donated it to the museum. Since then the Revere Bell has been displayed the National Museum, apart from a period between January 1997 and May 2006 when the bell was loaned to the United States Embassy in Singapore while the museum was being renovated. During that time it was showcased behind velvet ropes in the foyer of the Embassy. The bell, now in the museum's Singapore History Gallery, has been called a symbol of the friendship between the peoples of Singapore and the United States.

Background  Timber Country, a bay horse with three white socks and a small nose snip, was born April 12, 1992 in Kentucky. A son of Irish champion Woodman, he was out of the mare Fall Aspen, a daughter of Pretense. Fall Aspen, who won the 1978 Matron Stakes, was also the dam of Grade I winner and champion Bianconi, Grade I winner Northern Aspen, and Grade II winners Elle Seule and Colorado Dancer. Timber Country grew to be a large horse, standing 17 hands high at maturity. Timber Country is closely related to the Dubai World Cup winner, Dubai Millennium, a son of Mr. Prospector and Timber Country's half-sister, Colorado Dancer. Bred by Lowquest Stud, Timber Country sold for $500,000 at the 1993 Keeneland July yearling sale. Future Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas had seen Tmber Country before the sale and planned to buy him. Lukas was having dinner at the home of William Young, owner of Overbrook Farm, along with Graham Beck of Gainesway Farm, when he asked to excuse himself to return to the sale. Lukas said, \\"Graham Beck followed me to my car and asked who the colt was and I said he was out of Fall Aspen. He asked who I was buying him for and I said, 'I don't know but I'm going to buy him.' He said for me to go ahead and buy him and they would put something together.\\" At the sale, he was purchased by Lukas for a partnership between Overbrook Farm, Gainesway Stable, and Robert and Beverly Lewis. Racing career 1994: two-year-old season Racing at age two in California, the colt won four of his seven starts. At Del Mar Racetrack, he won the Balboa Stakes and was third in the Del Mar Futurity. Sent East, Timber Country won the Grade I Champagne Stakes at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York while running on the lead setting the pace. His victory made him the betting favorite for the most important race of the year for his age group, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. In that race, Timber Country came from well back to win going away. His 1994 performances earned him U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt honors. 1995: three-year-old season In the spring of 1995 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California, three-year-old Timber Country ran third in the San Rafael Stakes and second in the San Felipe Stakes. Going into the Kentucky Derby the colt was winless in all three of his 1995 starts and was up against a field that included strong competition such as Tejano Run, who had finished third to Timber Country in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile; Thunder Gulch, who was also trained by D. Wayne Lukas and who had won that spring's Fountain of Youth Stakes and Florida Derby; Talkin Man, the Canadian Two-Year-Old Champion coming off an impressive win in the Wood Memorial Stakes; plus the future Hall of Fame filly Serena's Song, who was owned by Robert and Beverly Lewis, one of Timber Country's owners. Drawing the difficult post position seventeen in the Kentucky Derby's nineteen-horse field, Timber Country was among the trailers for most of the race. A horse who liked to come from behind (although he won on the lead setting the pace in the 1994 Champagne Stakes), entering the homestretch he was still only in tenth place and, bunched between a congestion of challengers, lost time when he had to swing to the outside to find some running room. In the stretch drive jockey Pat Day and Timber County made a late move to get between horses and came on strongly enough to finish third behind runner-up Tejano Run and winner Thunder Gulch. In the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, Timber Country was the parimutuel betting favorite. The colt won the race after he passed five horses through the turn and homestretch and won by half a length over runner-up Oliver's Twist and third-place finisher Thunder Gulch. Timber Country's win marked the first time since the establishment of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 1984 that a winner of that race went on to win one of the American Classic races. Made the heavy favorite to win the third and final leg of the Triple Crown, Timber Country had to be withdrawn from the Belmont Stakes on the day before the race as a result of a high fever from a virus that saw his temperature nearing 103 degrees. After returning to training post-fever, he suffered a tendon injury, and was retired. Stud career Retired to stud duty, Timber Country was first sent Shadai Farm, a breeding operation located in Hokkaido, Japan, owned by brothers Teruya and Katsumi Yoshida. While there, he was also shuttled to Australia, where he notably sired Eremein, a five-time Group One winner with career earnings in excess of A$4 million. In 2001, Timber Country stood in Dubai, then was returned to Japan, this time standing at Lex Stud in Hokkaido, where he remained. Timber Country was not a consistent stallion, though he sired a Grade I winner in all three countries he stood in. His best foal is Japanese- born son Admire Don, who won seven Grade I races in Japan and was named Japanese Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 2001 and Champion Older Male Horse of 2003 and 2004. He is also the sire of Australian gelding Eremein, a five-time Grade I winner with career earnings in excess of A$4 million. He is the sire of filly Balletto, born in Dubai, who won the Grade I Frizette Stakes in the United States. Timber Country is the damsire of Mukhadram, who won the 2014 Eclipse Stakes in Great Britain, Copano Rickey, two-time winner of the February Stakes in Japan, and Sweet Idea, who won The Galaxy Stakes in Australia.  Death  Timber Country died the night of February 24, 2016 at around 10:00 PM. The 24-year-old, who had suffered from cardiac issues during his last years of life, died of heart failure. \\"We extend our heartfelt condolences to him,\\" said Akira Maeda, mager of Lex Stud. \\"We will erect a monument to his memory in Cherry Blossoms Park near our Lex Stud.\\" D. Wayne Lukas said of Timber Country, \\"He was a beautiful horse, with a great disposition and great to train.\\" Timber Country was buried at Sakuramaima Park, an equestrian center, near Lex Stud.

Deming (1913-2007) for the popular television show of the same name. Sir Graves was a vampire whose persona, look, and exaggerated laugh (\\"Nnnnyeah-ha-ha-ha-haaaaaaaaah!\\") were intended to parody the cliched portrayal of vampires in horror films of the time. Other characters on the show included Sir Graves' sidekick Baruba, a ghostly apparition known only as The Glob, and a cemetery caretaker named Reel McCoy, who traditionally opened each episode by unearthing a movie reel from what appeared to be a grave. The show followed a consistent format of back-to-back horror films, interspersed with brief sketch comedy pieces featuring the many characters. The program was originally billed as Sir Graves' Big Show, but later became known simply by the character's name. Sir Graves Ghastly had its longest run Saturday afternoons on WJBK, TV2 in Detroit, from 1967 to 1982: fifteen seasons in all. In the 1970s, Deming marketed the show to Cleveland and Washington, D.C., where it also became a hit, but his popularity in those markets never quite reached that of the Detroit-area audience. The growing popularity of televised sports in the early 1980s, particularly college football, sent Sir Graves into hiatus in November 1982. A management change during this time led to the program being officially cancelled in 1983 before any other shows were produced. As he did while his show was running, Deming continued to do speaking engagements and personal appearances well into the 1990s. External links * SirGravesGhastly.com (archived) * Lawson J.

It was presented by Nicolas II as an Easter gift to his wife, the Tsaritsa Alexandra Fyodorovna. It is currently held in the Kremlin Armoury Museum in Moscow. Design The Romanov Tercentenary egg is made of gold, silver, rose-cut and portrait diamonds, turquoise, purpurine, rock crystal, Vitreous enamel and watercolor painting on ivory. It is in height and in diameter. The egg celebrates the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty, the three hundred years of Romanov rule from 1613 to 1913. The outside contains eighteen portraits of the Romanov Tsars of Russia. The egg is decorated in a chased gold pattern with double-headed eagles as well as past and present Romanov crowns which frame the portraits of the Tsars. Each miniature portrait, painted by miniaturist Vassily Zuiev, is on ivory and is bordered by rose-cut diamonds. The inside of the egg is opalescent white enamel. The egg sits on a pedestal that represents the Imperial double-headed eagle in gold, with three talons holding the Imperial scepter, orb and Romanov sword. The pedestal is supported by a purpurine base that represents the Russian Imperial shield. Among the 18 rulers represented are Michael, the first of the Romanov dynasty in 1613, as well as Peter the Great (1682‚Äì1725), Catherine the Great (1762‚Äì1796), and Nicholas II himself as the final Tsar in 1913. Surprise The surprise is a rotating detailed globe made of dark blue enamel, varicolored gold and steel. The globe portrays one hemisphere showing Russian territory under Tsar Michael in 1613, and on the opposite side the Russian territory under Nicholas II in 1913. The dark blue enamel colors areas of the ocean while landmasses are portrayed in colored golds. History In May 1913, Nicholas II and Alexandra Fedorovna made a pilgrimage retracing the journey made by Michael Romanov on his way to the throne in 1613. The tercentenary celebrations across Russia were extravagant and well attended by the masses, in spite of Nicholas II's unpopularity since the 1905 Russian Revolution. While traveling the country, Nicholas and Alexandra were so well received by the people that it seemed as if public opinion had turned in their favor. This experience colored Alexandra's perspective throughout the next four years when the monarchy began to crumble during World War I. She refused to believe that the Russian people could turn on them so quickly. Yet, by 1917 the February Revolution would lead to Nicholas' abdication and the family's execution in 1918. In 1917, the Romanov Tercentenary Egg was confiscated by the Provisional Government during the Russian Revolution, along with many other Imperial treasures. It was transported from the Anichkov Palace to the Kremlin Armoury, Moscow, where it remained. The Romanov Tercentenary Egg is one of ten Faberge Eggs in the collection at the Kremlin Armoury. Others include: Memory of Azov Egg (1881), Bouquet of Lilies Clock egg (1899), Trans- Siberian Railway egg (1900), Clover Leaf egg (1902), Moscow Kremlin egg (1906), Standart egg (1909), Alexander III Equestrian egg (1910), Alexander Palace egg (1908), Steel Military egg (1916).PBS, Faberge Eggs.

Renter√≠a was believed by the United States government to be holding a leadership position within the drug cartel, he had been labeled \\"one of Colombia's most powerful and sophisticated narcotics traffickers\\" by Adam Szubin, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, United States Department of the Treasury. The Attorney General of Colombia and the Colombian National Police accuse Renter√≠a of drug trafficking and money laundering. Role As chief in the Norte del Valle Cartel, it is believed Renter√≠a shared in the decision making of the cartel in aspects of transportation of drug shipments, bribery of political officials and assassinations. Renter√≠a also operated his own organization under the Cartel capable of multi-ton cocaine shipments, as well as investing in other cocaine smuggling transports. The Norte del Valle cartel operates principally out of the North Valle del Cauca region. It is believed the cocaine is shipped from around the neighboring Colombian Departments as well as Peru and other South American countries before being transported again via trucks and airplanes to the Pacific Coast port of Buenaventura, Colombia. From Buenaventura the cocaine, through Renter√≠as' operation, is primary transported to Mexico before being shipped again to the United States via go-fast boats, fishing vessels, and other maritime shipping methods. Government actions Law enforcement While it is believed Renter√≠a had been involved in drug trafficking since the 1970s. The first indictment regarding Renter√≠a was unsealed in 1994 in the Southern District of Florida, charging Renter√≠a with conspiracy to import, possess and distribute cocaine in the United States. In 2004 an indictment was unsealed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, charging Renter√≠a with violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). In addition to the indictments a reward of $5 million was placed for information leading to the capture of Renter√≠a. Finances Beginning on March 17, 2005, the United States Department of Treasury announced its first actions targeting the financial holdings of Renter√≠a. In 2005 Renter√≠a was first declared a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker, the label permits the United States to seize assets connected to Renter√≠a through front companies and associates. Since 2005 the Department of Treasury had announced over seven actions targeting Renter√≠as financial holdings. The companies designated range from agricultural, clinics, hotels, accounting firms and the Colombian soccer team Cortulu√°. It is believed Renter√≠as' money contributed significantly to the economic growth in the area, as business operations, hotels and clinics began to be built to launder his money through. On September 1, 2006, Colombian authorities confiscated around 34 properties in the northern Caribbean region, mainly in the city of Cartagena and in other regions of Colombia; in the capital Bogot√° and near his major area of operations; Valle del Cauca Department. The operation was dubbed \\"Patria 44\\" by the Colombian Central Directorate of the Judicial Police and Intelligence (DIJIN).

With a maximum of 65 pupils on roll, each is treated very much as an individual, hence the school's motto \\"An individual approach to success\\" The school's aim is to create a genuine community in which no child is anonymous and in which each acquires the self-confidence that comes from being recognised and from achieving. History Canbury School was founded by Mr John Wyatt in 1982. He had previously taught in several large schools with high academic standards and had come to believe that such standards could be applied to children with a broader range of ability. A smaller school would allow children to be more involved in their progress and in the community and to be more motivated and happier. In 1997, Mr Wyatt retired and the school became an educational charity administered by a Board of Governors, thus assuming its long-term stability. Mr Cedric Harben was appointed Headmaster. Further developments took place and, following a rigorous inspection, the school gained full accreditation from the Independent School's Council and joined the Independent School's Association (I.S.A.). Mr Harben retired in 2002 succeeded by Mr Robin Metters. Following Robin Metters retirement, Ms Louise Clancy became Canbury School's first Headmistress, in September 2014. Facilities The school is on Kingston Hill at the corner of Warboys Approach. It has a new modern science laboratory and prep room, up-to-date computer facilities, an art studio equipped with a pottery area and kiln and access to local facilities for a wide range of sporting activities including athletics, cricket, netball, softball, swimming and watersports. Notable fact Formerly a domestic residence, Canbury was once owned by Malcolm Campbell and his son Donald Campbell who was born there.

Family and early life  Henry was born in Adrianople (modern day Edirne) in Turkish Thrace, the son of William Nosworthy Churchill. His second name was derived from his place of birth. His father was familiar with the Turkish language and the Ottoman Turkish script, having worked as a dragoman for the American Embassy in Constantinople (now Istanbul) and founded the first semi-official newspaper Ceride-i Havadis . His mother Beatrix (n√©e Belhomme) was the daughter of a French merchant who had settled in Turkey. He married Maria Braniefska (b. Warsaw 1839? ‚Äì d. Par√°, Brazil 1905) with whom he had 7 children. Four of his five sons, Harry Lionel (1860‚Äì1924), Sidney John Alexander (1862‚Äì1921), William Algernon (1865‚Äì1947), and George Percy (1877-1973) followed him into the diplomatic service.  Education In 1837, when aged nine, his father sent him to England to attend boarding schools in Ewell and then Kentish Town, where he learnt English and mathematics. In 1841 he went to Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris where he studied languages, mathematics, and art. In 1846 he returned to Constantinople aged 18.  Career   Turco-Persian Boundary Commission In 1848 at the age of 20 Churchill began his career in the service of the Crown by assisting the British Commission for the Delimitation of the Turco-Persian Boundary as part of the 1849‚Äì52 Turco-Persian Frontier Commission.Obituary While serving in the Frontier Commission, along with friend and fellow archaeologist William Loftus and a detachment of troops, he rode across the desert and marshes of Chaldaea from the Euphrates to the lower Tigris, observing remains as they went. During their travels Churchill made extensive detailed drawings and sketches, which were subsequently deposited in the British MuseumTravels and researches in Chaldaea and Susiana with an account of excavations at Warka, the Erech of Nimrod, and Shush, Shushan the Palace of Esther, in 1849-52.

British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers, 1870 Unfortunately, the heavy workload and the adverse climate took a toll on his health and in September 1868 he sailed to Bombay but after reaching Somalia the ship was forced to return to Zanzibar, upon which Churchill found his health had improved and he continued his duties. However his recovery was short lived and in 1869 his Vice Consul and physician John Kirk advised him to leave for London for the sake of his health. Churchill's relationship with Sultan Majid became so close that upon his departure from Zanzibar he received a valuable diamond ring. Churchill returned briefly to Zanzibar and worked to keep the peace after Sultan Majid died in October 1870, then in November 1870 wrote to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs advising that he had sent a reinforcement of seven men to Dr David Livingstone to replace seven men in his expedition who had died of cholera.Letter from Mr. Churchill, Consul at Zanzibar, concerning Dr. Livingstone.

A payment terminal, also known as a Point of Sale (POS) terminal, credit card terminal, EFTPOS terminal (or by the older term as PDQ terminal which stands for \\"Process Data Quickly\\" or in common jargon as \\"Pretty Damn Quick\\"), is a device which interfaces with payment cards to make electronic funds transfers. The terminal typically consists of a secure keypad (called a PINpad) for entering PIN, a screen, a means of capturing information from payments cards and a network connection to access the payment network for authorization. A payment terminal allows a merchant to capture required credit and debit card information and to transmit this data to the merchant services provider or bank for authorization and finally, to transfer funds to the merchant. The terminal allows the merchant or their client to swipe, insert or hold a card near the device to capture the information. They are often connected to point of sale systems so that payment amounts and confirmation of payment can be transferred automatically to the merchants retail management system. Terminals can also be used in stand alone mode, where the merchant keys the amount into the terminal before the customer present their card and personal identification number (PIN). The majority of card terminals today transmit data over cellular network connections and Wi-Fi. Legacy terminals communicate over standard telephone line or Ethernet connections. Some also have the ability to cache transactional data to be transmitted to the gateway processor when a connection becomes available; the major drawback to this is that immediate authorization is not available at the time the card was processed, which can subsequently result in failed payments. Wireless terminals transmit card data using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, or even satellite networks in remote areas and onboard airplanes. Prior to the development of payment terminals merchants would capture card information manually (using what are called \\"ZipZap\\" machines). The development of payment terminals was led by the advantage of efficiency by decreased transaction processing times and immediate authorisation of payments. In terms of security, terminals provide end to end card data encryption and auditing functions. Nevertheless, there have been some cases of POS pin pad malware. There have also been incidence of skimming at card terminals and this led to the move away from using the magnetic strip to capture information using EMV standards. History A typical fixed install card terminal from 2006 Prior to the development of payment terminals, merchants would use manual imprinters (also known as ZipZap machines) to capture the information from the embossed information on a credit card onto a paper slips with carbon paper copies. These paper slips had to be taken to the bank for processing. This was a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Point of sale terminals emerged in 1979, when Visa introduced a bulky electronic data capturing terminal which was the first payment terminal. In the same year magnetic stripes were added to credit cards for the first time. This allowed card information to be captured electronically and led to the development of payment terminals. A typical counter-top payment terminal from 2007 One of the first companies to produce dedicated payment terminals was Verifone. It started in 1981 in Hawaii as a small electronic company. In 1983 they introduced the ZON terminal series, which would become the standard for modern payment terminals. Hungarian-born George Wallner in Sydney, Australia, founded rival Hypercom in 1978 and in 1982 started producing dedicated payment terminals. It went on to dominate the Oceania region. The company signed a deal with American Express to provide its terminals to them in the US. To consolidate the deal, Hypercom moved its head office from Australia to Arizona in the US. It then faced head-to-head competition with VeriFone on its home market. Over a decade later in 1994 Lipman Electronic Engineering, Ltd. was established in Israel. Lipman manufactured the Nurit line of processing terminals. Because of Verifone's already firm place in the payment processing industry when Lipman was established, Lipman targeted an untapped niche in the processing industry. While, Lipman holds about a 10% share in wired credit card terminals, they are the undisputed leader, with more than 95% share in wireless processing terminals in the late 1990s. Verifone would later acquired both of these major rivals, acquiring Lipman in 2006 and the payment part of the Hypercom business including its brand in 2011. In 1980 Jean-Jacques Poutrel and Michel Malhouitre in 1980 established Ingenico in France and developed their first payment terminal in 1984. Its Barcelona-based R&D; unit would lead the development of payment terminals for the next decade. Ingenico, through a number of acquisitions, would dominate the European market for payment terminals for a number of years. They acquired French based Bull and UK based De La Rue payment terminal activity as well as German Epos in 2001. Initially, information was captured from the magnetic strip on the back of the card, by swiping the card through the terminal. In the late 1990s, this started to be replaced by smart cards where the chip was embedded in the card. This was done for added security and required the card to be inserted into the credit card terminal. In the late 1990s and early 2000s contactless payment systems were introduced and the payment terminals were updated to include the ability to read this these cards using near field communication (NFC) technology.

Major manufacturers alt=There are 3 main global players who offer both a wide range of payment terminals, sell worldwide, and continue to develop to the latest international payment industry standards. In most countries terminals are provided to merchants via a multitude distributors that support and pre-configure devices to operate with local payment networks or financial institutions. * Ingenico * PAX Technology * VeriFone Alternatives A touch screen based VeriFone MX 915 series payment terminal. A merchant can replace the functionality of dedicated credit card terminal hardware using a terminal application running on a PC or mobile device, such as a smartphone. They usually work with dedicated hardware readers that can transfer magnetic stripe data to the application, while there are also some that also work with smart cards (using technology such as EMV), although this is rarely seen on smartphone readers. In case the necessary hardware is unavailable, these applications usually support manual entry of the card number and other data. In addition, more and more devices are beginning to offer built-in RFID or NFC technology to accommodate contactless or mobile device payment methods, often without requiring additional external hardware. Some payment processors offer virtual terminals for processing payments without the card being present, for example when taking payments over the phone. Mobile payment systems such as those based on QR code payments by-pass the need for payment terminals altogether relying on smartphones and a printed QR code.

The Ovi services could be used from a mobile device, computer (through Ovi Suite) or via the web. Nokia focused on five key service areas: Games, Maps, Media, Messaging and Music. Nokia's aim with Ovi was to include third party developers, such as operators and third-party services like Yahoo's Flickr photo site. With the announcement of Ovi Maps Player API, Nokia started to evolve their services into a platform, enabling third parties to make use of Nokia's Ovi services. Ovi was first announced in 2007 and was a move into the world of Internet services and applications. It was initially available for internet-enabled Nokia feature phones and S60 smartphones, and also accessible via the web and on PC. Throughout its lifetime it faced strong competition particularly from Apple's App Store. As of January 2012, there were exactly 10 million downloads every day,Nokia Developer - Global reach statistics . Developer.nokia.com (31 January 2012). Retrieved 2013-07-17. also 158 developers reached over 1 million downloads for their Applications.

History Ovi was announced on 29 August 2007 at the Go Play event in London. The public beta was released on 28 August 2008. Nokia has acquired key building blocks for Ovi over time. These include intellectual property (IP), patents and core components such as synchronization. Acquired IP, patents include companies such as Starfish Software, Intellisync, NAVTEQ, Gate5, Plazes and others. Other components have been developed internally. On 20 May 2009, at the Where 2.0 event in San Jose, CA, USA, Nokia announced the release of the Ovi Maps Player API, allowing web developers to embed Ovi Maps into a website using JavaScript.

Here, customers could download mobile games, applications, videos, images, and ringing tones to their Nokia devices. Some of the items were free of charge; others could be purchased using credit card or through operator billing in selected operators. The content in Ovi Store was sorted into the categories: Featured (previously Recommended), Games, Personalise, Applications, and Audio & Video. The Ovi Store replaced the older Nokia services Widsets, Download!, and MOSH. Ovi Store was intended to offer customers content that was compatible with their mobile devices and relevant to their tastes and locations. Customers could share recommendations with their friends, see what they are downloading, and let them see items of interest. For content publishers, Nokia offered a self-service tool to bring their content to the Ovi Store. Supported content types included: Java ME, Flash applications, widgets, ringtones, wallpapers, themes, and more for Nokia Series 40 and Symbian S60 devices and also Symbian^3. Nokia offered a 70% revenue share of gross sales, net of refunds and returns, less applicable taxes and, where applicable, fixed operator billing costs.

The Ovi Store also looked different on Symbian handsets to suit the new brand transformation - it was blue instead of green and the Ovi store was the third biggest mobile download site on the market (behind Apple's App Store and Google Play) in 2012. From 2014, developers were no longer able to publish new apps and app updates for the Symbian and MeeGo platforms to Nokia Store. Microsoft officially stopped accepting new applications to the Nokia Publish service and new registrations to the Nokia Publish and Nokia Developer websites since the 18th of February 2015, and officially retired the Nokia Developer site in March 2015 and encouraged developers to go to the MSDN and Windows Developer site to develop applications for Windows Phone and Windows. Microsoft discontinued Nokia Store in 2015, and users were transitioned to Opera Mobile Store as the new application store for legacy Nokia devices. Ovi Suite Ovi Suite allows Nokia mobile users to organize and share their photos and PIM data between their PC and their handset. It was the next generation of Nokia PC Suite and eventually Nokia Ovi Suite became the only computer application offered by Nokia. The commercial version of Nokia Ovi Suite was 3.3.86.Nokia Ovi Suite Download A Mac OS X-compatible version was announced in November 2008, and has been \\"expected soon\\" ever since.The scoop on Nokia Ovi Suite for Mac Instead, Nokia phones can connect with Mac computers via Apple's iSync application. Ovi Sync Ovi Sync allows the synchronization of contact and calendar data between Nokia Symbian phones and the Nokia Ovi data center. Synchronization is initiated on the phone and is bidirectional. Ovi Contacts Ovi Contacts is the address book section of ovi.com and allows contact information to be viewed and modified. Nokia has announced on the Ovi website that web access to contact information will be discontinued on 25 January 2012. However, Nokia stated that Ovi Sync will function after this date, allowing Nokia Symbian phone users to continue to transfer phone contact data to and from Nokia data center servers. As a result of the discontinuation of web access to the contact data as well as their transition to Windows Phone 7 devices that synchronize data with Microsoft Hotmail, in late 2011 Nokia added the capability to download all Ovi Contacts information in CSV format for importation into another online contact provider. Nokia stated that this download capability will remain via URL contactsui.ovi.com even after web access to contact data has ended.Export Contacts page. Exportcontacts.ovi.com (30 November 2011).

Web access to Ovi Calendar ended on 31 August 2011. Ovi Calendar data can still be exported in iCalendar format at calendar.ovi.com. Nokia stated it will continue to provide this download capability even though web viewing and editing of calendar data has ended, and Ovi Sync will continue to synchronize Nokia Symbian phone calendar data with their data center servers. Ovi Maps With the Ovi Maps Internet service, customers can browse places from all over the world, plan trips, search for addresses and points of interest, and save them on Ovi. Ovi Maps for web can be used on any browser and any operating system for PC or Mac. To install the Ovi Maps plug-in that enables more features, one needs to have either Microsoft Windows XP/Vista with Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and later or Mozilla Firefox 3 or later, or Apple Mac OS X with Safari 3 and later. If the Ovi Maps 3.0 application (formerly known as Nokia Maps) is installed to your compatible Nokia mobile device, you can synchronise places, collections, and routes between Ovi Maps and your mobile device. You need to have a Nokia account to be able to synchronise. Using Nokia Ovi Suite or Nokia Map Loader on Microsoft Windows XP or Vista, users can download and preload map data and navigator voices to their mobile device. This allows customers to save time and money as little data is required to be downloaded over-the-air during operation. Map data can also be downloaded without Nokia Ovi Suite or Nokia Map Loader by pointing a web browser to the map file locations. Ovi Mail Ovi Mail is an email address designed for access from Nokia mobile devices and compatible desktop browsers. The beta phase started in December 2008, and became available to all Ovi users on 20 February 2009. 1 million accounts were activated in its first six months, 650,000 on mobile devices. 5 million accounts were activated in its first year. According to the Ovi Mail website, Ovi Mail was popular in Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Indonesia, South Africa, the Philippines, Mexico, Brazil and India.Ovi Mail Over 35 different S40 and S60 phone models supported Ovi Mail.

Apart from using accounts with other popular IM service providers (e.g., for the ICQ network), a user could also use his Ovi account to send and receive instant messages to and from other Ovi users. Depending on the user's tariffs for sending SMS text messages vs. connecting to the Internet from the mobile phone, using instant messaging can prove to be either significantly cheaper (volume-based data plan) or significantly more expensive (time-based data plan). Ovi Share Ovi Share was media sharing website. Originally called Twango, the site allowed the upload and storage of photos, videos, etc. Users can upload media directly from Nokia mobile phones through the Share Online 3.0 application, or can alternatively use their PCs. Ovi Files Ovi Files was a service that allowed users to remotely access, send, and create an online mirror of files stored on their Windows PC and Macintosh computers from any mobile or computer web browser. Supplemental features enabled users to upload content to their remote computer and preview Microsoft Office and Adobe PDF documents without the need for a browser plug-in or locally installed application. Ovi Files was based on the \\"Access and Share\\" service created by Avvenu Incorporated, which Nokia acquired on 5 December 2007. Originally a premium service, Ovi Files was made free of charge in July 2009. The service closed on 15 October 2010.

Publishing content  Publishers of content, or Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), may join the Ovi programme for a fee of 1 ‚Ç¨. Nokia keeps 30% of the developers' revenue from sales of their product. However, if the product was purchased using Operator Billing, then between 40%-50% of the price paid by the consumer is first given to the operator. Content which the publisher develops was reviewed by Nokia before publication. Symbian, Java and Flash lite applications must be Symbian signed. Symbian Signed is the signing programme administered by the Symbian Foundation. Applications could be signed for free as part of the Ovi programme. Discontinuation In May 2011 Nokia discontinued the OVI brand in favor of the Nokia brand. The decision was taken to avoid brand confusion.

Olybrius has been characterized as belonging to \\"the breed of flexible politicians who did well both under Valentinian I [...] and under Gratian.\\"Hagith Sivan, Ausonius of Bordeaux: Genesis of a Gallic Aristocracy (London: Routledge, 1993), p. 133 online.  Life  Olybrius was a member of the senatorial aristocracy of Rome. He was the son of Clodius Celsinus Adelphius, who had been praefectus urbi in 351, and of Faltonia Betitia Proba, a poet. His brother, Faltonius Probus Alypius, was praefectus urbi of Rome in 391. Proba converted to Christianity, and later had her husband and their sons, Olybrius included, convert to the same religion. Olybrius married Tirrania Anicia Juliana, a member of the Anicia gens, whose father, Anicius Auchenius Bassus, would become praefectus urbi of Rome in 382 and 383. Olybrius and Juliana had a daughter, Anicia Faltonia Proba. He reached the rank of vir clarissimus, then consularis of Campania (before 361 he is attested as patron of Formia), proconsul of Africa Province (361), praefectus urbi of Rome (369-370), Praetorian prefect of Illyricum, Praetorian prefect of the East, and consul in 379. He died between 384 and 395. During his office as praefectus urbi, which was generally calm and balanced, he arrested two suspected poisoners. He led the investigations, but he got ill and they passed to the praefectus annonae, Maximinus. He was then succeeded by Publius Ampelius. In his consulate he was posterior to his colleague, the poet Ausonius, because he was the younger prefect. Ausonius had been in fact appointed Praetorian prefect of Gaul in late 377. Olybrius had been appointed prefect of Illyricum by emperor Gratian probably at the beginning of 378, in the wake of the preparations for the war against the Goths in Thracia that led to the defeat and death of emperor Valens in the Battle of Adrianople in August of that year. It is also known that Olybrius was in Sirmium when he was appointed consul by Gratian, who also had already conferred upon Olybrius the Praetorian prefecture of the East. Quintus Aurelius Symmachus records a trial in which he was a judge. A land-owner called Scirtius had been dispossessed of his property and had complained to Symmachus, who had then issued a decree giving the land back to Scirtius. Symmachus tells that he discovered that Olybrius was behind this misappropriation and that some of the agents had tried to avoid the restitution of the stolen property, even kidnapping people and bribing witnesses. Thus Olybrius is depicted as violent and greedy. This view is somehow confirmed by Ammianus Marcellinus' description of Olybrius' office as prefect: the historian, in fact, describes Olybrius as overly interested in luxury.Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, Relatio 28; Ammianus Marcellinus, XXVII.11.1; cited in Jill Harries, Law and Empire in Late Antiquity, Cambridge University Press, 2001, , pp. 116-7.

Illustration to the Akbarnama, miniature painting by Nar Singh, ca. 1605. The IbƒÅdat KhƒÅna (House of Worship) was a meeting house built in 1575 CE by the Mughal Emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605) at Fatehpur Sikri to gather spiritual leaders of different religious grounds so as to conduct a discussion on the teachings of the respective religious leaders. In his eagerness to learn about different religions, Akbar built call of prayer at Fatehpur sikri in 1575 known as the Ibadat Khana. At this place, he invited selected mystics, intellectuals and theologians, and held discussions on religious and spiritual themes. He invited scholars belonging to various religion such as Hinduism, Islam , Zoroastrianism , Christianity and even atheists. He conducted religious debates with these people. They visited Ibadat Khana and discussed their religious belief with Akbar. The result of these discussions at the Hall of Prayer led them to the conclusion that all religions lead to the same goal. Historical background Akbar built the IbƒÅdat KhƒÅna as a debating house. He encouraged Hindus, Roman Catholics, Zoroastrians, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs and even atheists to participate. Religious leaders and philosophers from around this diverse empire, as well as those passing through, were invited to Akbar's Thursday evening discussions. Akbar's spiritual inclinations were roused to a large extent by the example of Sulaiman Kirani, a past ruler of Bengal, who was said to spend nights in the company of over a hundred ratiocinating spiritual men. Akbar also wanted to sharpen his theological grasp because he had been told of the imminent arrival to his court of Mirza Sulaiman of Badakshan, a Sufi with a predilection for spiritual debates. Faith of the Divine By the late 1580s CE, Akbar began an attempt to reconcile the differences of all religions by creating a new faith, the Din-i-Ilahi (\\"Faith of the Divine\\"), which incorporated both pantheistic versions of Islamic Sufism (most notably Ibn Arabi's doctrine of Wahdat al wajood or Unity of Existence) and bhakti or devotional movements of Hinduism. Even some elements of Christianity (like crosses), Zoroastrianism (fire ceremonies) and Jainism were amalgamated in the new religion. Akbar was greatly influenced by the teachings of Jain Acharyas Hir Vijay Suri and Jin Chandra Suri and gave up non-vegetarian food because of their influence. He declared Amari or non- killing of animals on the holy days of Jains like Paryushan and Mahavir Jayanti. He rolled back the Jizya tax from Jain pilgrimage places like Palitana. This faith, however, was not for the masses. In fact, the only \\"converts\\" to this new religion were the upper nobility of Akbar's court. Historians have so far been able to identify only 18 members of this new religion. Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Akbar‚Äôs Dream lauds the IbƒÅdat KhƒÅna, ascribing tolerance and humanity to his \\"Divine Faith\\", while implicitly criticising the intolerance of 19th century British Protestant Christianity.Notes to Akbar‚Äôs Dream, from The Death of ≈ínone, and Other Poems by Alfred Tennyson (1892). A painting depicting the scenes of the IbƒÅdat KhƒÅna. Discovery of Ibadat Khana Different archaeologists and historians had different thoughts on the location of Ibadat Khana. Saeed Ahmed Mararavi, followed by Athar Abbas Rizvi and Vincent Flynn suggested that the mound between Jama Masjid and Jodha Bai's Mahal is the site of Ibadat Khana. However, they had no tangible proof to support their argument. In early 1980s, KK Muhammed working under Prof. R. C. Gaur of Aligarh Muslim University excavated the mound and found the steps, platforms and boundary wall, which matched the painting of Ibadat Khana from Akbar's period.

It was written by John Cornwell and subtitled An Angelic Riposte to The God Delusion. Cornwell runs a \\"Public Understanding of Science\\" programme at Jesus College, Cambridge, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Cambridge. He has previously written reviews of religious and scientific books, including other works of Dawkins. He stated that he finds The God Delusion harmful in its failure to tackle the problem of extremism, and wrong on many important issues. Summary In this book, Cornwell adopts the persona of the guardian angel of Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel, who is now looking after Richard Dawkins. He pens a letter to Dawkins in 21 chapters.The summaries here are quotes or direct paraphrases from the relevant chapters of Darwin's Angel. # A Summary of your Argument suggests that Dawkins regards all claims about God's existence as \\"the exclusive province of science and reason\\". # Your Sources suggests that the book ignores distinguished scholarship and uses inappropriate sources. # Imagination suggests that Dawkins takes things too literally. # Beauty suggests that Dawkins misunderstands the links between beauty, creativity and faith, and suggests he studies George Steiner, William Blake, T. S. Eliot and C. S. Lewis. # What is Religion suggests that religion is not science and that Dawkins should study sociologists of religion such as √âmile Durkheim. # Is God Supernatural? claims that Dawkins' image of God is not what most theists believe in. # Celestial Teapots suggests that the comparison with Russell's teapot is misplaced because Cornwell claims there are prima facie, albeit inconclusive, grounds for believing in God. # God's Simplicity claims that Dawkins imagines that God is an object but this is not how theologians think about God. # Theories of Everything claims that Stephen Hawking and others now believe a \\"Theory of Everything\\" is impossible due to G√∂del's incompleteness theorems. # Dawkins versus Dostoyevsky suggests that Dawkins mistakenly attributes the nihilistic views of Ivan Karamazov to Dostoyevsky. Dawkins responded to this chapter specifically by saying that he was either misunderstood or misquoted.Richard Dawkins' Response to Cornwell # Jesus, the Jews and the \\"Pigs\\" suggests that Dawkins relies on a single source when he discusses \\"the moral consideration for others\\" in Judaism and Christianity being originally intended to apply only to a narrowly defined in-group. # Dawkins's Utopia claims that Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Hitler all used \\"science as an ideology combined with militant atheism\\".Darwin's Angel p 86 He also claims that Stalin's atheism was foundational to his entire ideology, and that as atheism doesn't necessarily lead to violence, nor does religion. # Fundamentalism suggests that it is important to distinguish between tolerant and violent forms of faith. Cornwell also claims it is a category error to confuse creationism and the \\"doctrine of creation\\".ibid. p 98 # Is Religious Education Child Abuse? questions whether being indoctrinated in a faith is tantamount to child abuse.

Christians don't just hope for an afterlife, Christians \\"affirm in the creeds belief in a final judgement, a resurrection of the body, and an everlasting life.\\" In Dawkins' response to the book, he criticised Cornwell for quoting him out of context in this section. # Religious People Less Clever than Atheists? suggests that scientific eminence does not guarantee sound judgement, and that scientists are prejudiced against religious believers. # Does our Moral Sense have a Darwinian Origin? claims that there is more to morality than evolution can explain. # The Darwinian Imperative claims that attempts to explain religion via evolution are simplistic. # Religion as a Bacillus discusses Dr Gerhard Wagner, and states that describing all religious believers as infected with a virus has deplorable overtones.DA p 141-145. # Does God Exist? suggests that Dawkins does not understand the question \\"why is there something rather than nothing?\\", which is why he finds it ridiculous.DA pp152-153. Cornwell goes on to say \\"the ludicrous anthropomorphic deity that rightly appals\\" Dawkins is not the view of God most Christian theologians hold. # Being Religious suggests that being religious is not a question of factual beliefs but a personal relationship and quest based on prayer and love.

She also suggested that both books are part of a modern debate that is suffering from the fact that the two sides do not concentrate on one definition of religion.Review: An angelic riposte to the God Delusion by John Cornwell ‚Äì 22 September 2007 ‚Äì New Scientist Space Darwin's Angel is listed on the RichardDawkins.net website as one of several \\"fleas\\" following The God Delusion. According to Dawkins, the book contains a number of inaccurate portrayals of what he actually said. Dawkins questions whether these are \\"honest mistakes or willful mendacity\\". He suggests six examples where his writing has been quoted out of context or otherwise misrepresented. For example, Cornwell suggests that Dawkins would have been in favour of Social Darwinism when in A Devil's Chaplain Dawkins has explicitly condemned such views and says no one supports such ideas any more.

That year, Jackie Robinson, the first black player to integrate baseball since the 1880s, entered the Dodgers farm system and was assigned to the Royals. Hopper, who opposed integration of baseball at the time, asked Branch Rickey, the general manager of the Dodgers, to assign Robinson to a different Dodgers affiliate, but Rickey kept Robinson assigned to Montreal. Robinson reported that Hopper treated him well, and the Royals won the Governors' Cup as the International League champions. The Sporting News named Hopper the Manager of the Year for all of minor league baseball that season. Hopper recommended the Dodgers promote Robinson to the major leagues for the 1947 season. Hopper remained Montreal's manager through the 1949 season. Between 1946 and 1949, Hopper managed three Governors' Cup champions.

In the fourth inning, Albaladejo struck out the side, and then was relieved. New York Yankees On December 4, 2007 he was traded to the New York Yankees for relief pitcher Tyler Clippard. The deal is regarded, years later, as one of the worst in Brian Cashman's tenure as Yankees General Manager.http://bronx.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2015/11/02/revisiting-the- yankees-tyler-clippard-for-jonathan-albaladejo-trade/ He made the Yankees' Opening Day roster in 2008, but only pitched in 7 games because of an elbow injury suffered on May 9, 2008.

She studies early modern, Renaissance, late 16th- and 17th century England. She writes about Tudor-Stuart literature; religious, political, and legal thought; neo-Latin; and censorship of that period. Early life and education Shuger was born in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan. Before her first birthday, her family moved to Rye, New York, where she lived until 3rd grade, when the family moved again, this time to Armonk, New York. She entered Carleton College as a freshman, married, and moved with her husband to Vanderbilt University, where she earned her B.A. (summa cum laude, 1975), M.A. (1978), and M.A.T. (1978). She earned her PhD from Stanford University (1983). Shuger taught at the University of Michigan and the University of Arkansas before moving to UCLA, where she has been since 1989. While in college, Shuger married Scott Shuger, who created the Today's Papers column for Slate.com. Scott died in 2002. They had one daughter. Shuger is the oldest of three sisters. Her parents are Alan Kuller, retired Vice President for real estate of Caldor, and Nancy Schoenbrod Kuller (deceased, 1993), a sculptor and painter. Works and interests Although Shuger has written most extensively on religion in early modern England her interests range across a number of fields: Tudor-Stuart devotional poetry and prose, theology and biblical exegesis, legal history, political thought, rhetoric, and life writing (biography, memoirs, diaries, etc.). She has also studied and written about gender, sexuality, colonialism, Classics, and Shakespeare and has published articles on Spenser, Shakespeare, Sidney, Milton, Donne, Jonson, Middleton, rhetoric, hagiography, and mirrors. September 2006 She contributed the essay on early Stuart religious literature to the Cambridge History of Early Modern English Literature (2002). Her recent graduate seminars have focused on political theory from antiquity through the late Middle Ages, 17th century life-writing, Elizabethan religious prose, the sacred literature of the Jacobean era, early modern English law, Saint Augustine, and Renaissance commentaries on Paul's Epistle to the Romans. Her latest book challenges the assumption that early modern censorship was an instrument used by governmental power to punish dissent. Shuger tries to prove that this is an anachronistic error, and that censorship usually had demonstrably more to do with the prevention of slander than it did with the suppression of popular rights‚Äîmore to do with civility than with mass mind-control. Shuger's previous book confronted the longstanding assumption that the English church had been fully complicit with the repressive hegemonic powers of government in this period. Instead, the church was often a key haven for humane resistance to such repression, a place where ideas of social justice could sustain themselves, and as a resource for individual and collective action‚Äîto put it as what recent scholarship would deem an oxymoron, it was a benign patriarchy. Political Theologies uses Shakespeare‚Äôs Measure for Measure to show that the laws of the church and of the state interacted in ways that modern researchers have overlooked (resulting in a distorted understanding of the play as well as history) by anachronistically imposing our own categories to differentiate moral from administrative questions. Honors Shuger has been a resident fellow at the Liguria Study Center for the Arts and Humanities, the National Humanities Center,Fellows of the National Humanities Center, P - Z and the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin,Former Fellows of the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, alphabetically as well as a recipient of Guggenheim,Guggenheim Foundation, list of fellows NEH, Huntington Library Mellon Foundation Fellowship, and UC President's fellowships.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. Early life Born in 1890, Herr joined the army of Imperial Germany in 1911 as an Fahnen-junker (officer cadet) in the infantry. Serving in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, he commanded the 3rd Battalion of the 33rd Infantry Regiment.  World War II Herr commanded an infantry regiment, part of the 13th Motorized Infantry Division, from 8 September 1939 to 14 October 1940, taking part in the Invasion of Poland (September 1939) and France (May 1940 to October 1940). In October 1940, the division was reformed in Vienna as 13th Panzer Division. Herr was given command of 13th Rifle Brigade, which controlled the division's two infantry regiments, on 14 October 1940. In the invasion of Poland, the division used civilians as human shields in the battle with the retreating Polish Prusy Army and on September 8, 1939 attacked a medical column marked with the Red Cross signs near Odrzyw√≥≈Ç. A day later, soldiers from the division took part in the revenge killing of 11 civilians and two Polish priests including Dean Stanis≈Çaw Klimecki in the nearby town of Drzewica in retaliation for their own military losses. Killings have also been reported in nearby settlements of Gielni√≥w, Kamienna Wola, Klw√≥w, Ossa, Przysucha, Potok, Rozwady and Zarzƒôcin. In May 1941 the regiment returned to Germany to take part in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, as part of 1st Panzergruppe under Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist in Army Group South. In December 1941, Herr was given acting command of 13th Panzer Division. On 31 October 1942, on the Terek River deep in the Caucasus, Herr suffered a serious head wound, being struck by shrapnel, and was repatriated to Germany to recuperate. He was later appointed commander of the LXXVI Panzer Corps stationed in France; in August 1943 it was sent to Italy. In Italy, his unit faced the British Eighth Army in Calabria, and the U.S. Fifth Army in Salerno. Herr commanded the corps in the Italian Campaign until 24 November 1944. He also temporarily took command of 14th Army for a brief period from late November to mid-December 1944. On 18 December 1944, he was awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross. On 15 February 1945 he took command of 10th Army.James Holland, Italy's Sorrow. A Year of War, 1944-1945, London, 2008, Harper Press.

It is located in the center-north of the Mexican Plateau. The Basin is shared by the states of Durango, Coahuila, Chihuahua, and Zacatecas. It takes its name from Mapim√≠, a town in Durango. The largest city in the basin is Torre√≥n. Parts of the basin host much industrial and agricultural activity. However, most of the region is sparsely populated. Geography The Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠ is a large area, measuring more than 200 miles (320 km) north to south and the same distance east to west, lying between 25 and 29 degrees north latitude. The total area is about 50,000 square miles (129,000 km2) and the average elevation is 3,000 feet (900 meters).\\"Mapim√≠ Basin\\", http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/363554/Mapimi-Basin, accessed 21 Feb 2013 The Greater Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠ covers adjacent areas extending north to the Rio Grande, which are similar in terrain and climate but have streams which have outlets to the Gulf of Mexico. The Bols√≥n is bounded on the west by the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Conchos River basin, by the basin of the Rio Grande to the north, and by the mountain ranges of the Sierra del Carmen and Sierra Madre Oriental to the east. At its southern edge, near the state line of Zacatecas, the Bolson shades into another endorheic basin called Llanos El Salado. Major rivers flowing northward into the basin are the Nazas River and its tributaries, which originate in the Sierra Madre Occidental in Durango, and the Aguanaval River, which flows north from central Zacatecas. The two rivers terminate in the southern part of the Bols√≥n in an area called the Comarca Lagunera, centered on the city of Torre√≥n, Coahuila, which formerly contained large, shallow lakes, now usually dry. The Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠ consists of desert plains separated by low mountain ranges. Cerro Centinela, which rises to 10,269 feet (3,130 m), south of Torre√≥n is at the southern edge. Within the Bols√≥n most of the mountain ranges are 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200-1,500 m) in elevation. Los Alamitos range near the center of the Bols√≥n reaches 6,516 feet (1,984 m)Google Earth Abundant water permits irrigated agriculture in the Cuatro Ci√©negas valley. The Bols√≥n is the southernmost extension of the Chihuahua Desert. The area receives between 8 and 16 inches (200 to 400 mm.) of precipitation annually, mostly falling in summer. The city of Torre√≥n receives 9.0 inches (228 mm). Summer temperatures are hot. June is the hottest month in Torre√≥n with an average temperature of 82.6 F (28.1 C). Winters are mild with an average temperature of 58 F (14.5 C) in December in Torre√≥n. Freezes are common in winter.\\"Normales Climatologicas 1951-2010\\" Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional, , accessed February 19, 2013 The conurbation of Torre√≥n, with more than a million inhabitants, is the largest city. Most of the Bols√≥n is sparsely populated, with settlements centered on mines and areas where irrigated agriculture is possible. History Prior to the arrival of the Spanish the Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠ was inhabited by nomadic hunter-gatherers. Bands of the Toboso Indians, of whom little is known, inhabited most of the Bols√≥n. In the north lived the Chisos who had a similar culture. Spanish penetration into the Bolson began in the 1590s with Jesuit missionaries, slave traders, and Tlaxcalan Indians whom the Spanish persuaded by grants of land and freedom from taxes to move north to aid in assimilating the Indians and resolving the long-running Chichimeca War.Powell, Phillip Wayne Soldiers, Indians & Silver Berkeley: University of California Press, 1952, pp. 191-199 The Toboso and Chisos began raiding Spanish settlements at an early date and participated in wars against Spanish settlements in 1644, 1667, and 1684. Most of the Toboso and Chisos were absorbed into the Spanish population in the early 18th century.Griffen, William B. Indian Assimilation in the Franciscan Area of Nueva Vizcaya Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1979, pp. 4-24 In the 19th century the Bols√≥n was still largely unpopulated. In the 1840s and 1850s the Bols√≥n became a base for Comanche Indians from Texas who met at well-watered locations, consolidated their forces, often numbering hundreds of warriors, and struck off in every direction on destructive raids of mines and ranches.Smith, Ralph A. \\"The Comanche Bridge between Oklahoma and Mexico, 1843-1844\\" The Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 39, No. 1, 1961, p. 56 (See Comanche-Mexico War)  See also  * Mapim√≠ Silent Zone References External links  Category:Drainage basins of Mexico Category:Endorheic basins of North America Category:Mexican Plateau Category:Landforms of Chihuahua (state) Category:Landforms of Coahuila Category:Landforms of Durango Category:Landforms of Zacatecas Category:Natural history of the Mexican Plateau ","title":"Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠"},{"id":"13142572","text":"Clodius Celsinus Adelphius or Adelfius (fl. 333-351) was a politician of the Roman Empire.

The programme originally launched on August 18, 1962. The sportsreader was Anssi Kukkonen and the programme was gathered up by Seppo Kannas. Kukkonen is also the father of the name Urheiluruutu (\\"sports screen\\") which was inspired by Swedish Sportspegeln. Before Urheiluruutu the sports news was read in the end of normal news broadcast. In the beginning Urheiluruutu was broadcast only once in a week: 15 minutes at Sunday evenings. Later it was broadcast also on Thursdays and Saturdays. In 1993 the daily broadcasting began. The audiovisual appearance of Urheiluruutu has changed many times during the years, previously in February 2013. The first opening sequence from 1963 included an animated rooster, originating from a pun of Anssi Kukkonen's name (\\"kukko\\" being the Finnish word for rooster). The most well-known theme music is the Leevi and the Leavings song Tuhannen markan seteli, used from 1983 to 1993. Nowadays the broadcasting times of Urheiluruutu are 7:16 p.m. in YLE TV2 and 8:55 p.m. in YLE TV1 (the main broadcast).

The school is the only secondary school in the town of Devizes and it also serves many surrounding villages. Built around the Georgian Southbroom House, the school now comprises additional teaching blocks of a more modern style, set within its own sports fields. Ofsted has graded the school Good in each of the past four visits, the latest in 2015. Admissions The school has been awarded specialist Sports College and ICT College status. School enrolment in 2012 was 1,181 students. Traditions Devizes School has a house system comprising four houses, which each student in Year 7‚Äì13 belongs to: Gandhi, King, Mandela and Teresa. Each house is named after a historical figure who worked towards understanding using peaceful methods. The names of the houses were selected by a vote. Each house has its own house colour: Gandhi is green, King is blue, Teresa is red and Mandela is yellow. History The school was formed in 1969 by the merging of two schools to form a comprehensive school. These were the co-educational Devizes Grammar School, built on Bath Road in 1906, and the Southbroom Secondary School (at first a Wiltshire County Council senior school, later a secondary modern) which was established in 1925 around Southbroom House, a Grade II* listed mansion built in 1773. The new school used the Southbroom site; the Grammar School's lower school was taken over by St. Peter's School (which left the site in 2012) while the upper school, Braeside, became a residential education centre. The Southbroom buildings were enlarged and by January 1973 there were 1,373 pupils on the school roll. Further new buildings were erected and in 2002 there were 1,065 pupils with a sixth form of around 150. In 1980, two Chipperfield's Circus lions found their way onto the grounds of Devizes. On 8 August 1990, the Queen attended the school to open the swimming pool at the adjacent Devizes Leisure Centre, when the headmaster was Colin Isted. Shelley Rudman, the Olympic skeleton silver medallist, worked at the school as a classroom manager. In February 2005, a 52-year-old builder, David Evans, was taunted by some teenage boys at the school. He confronted two of them, pushing two of them.

He became the World Sculling Champion in 1868 and was one of three great Tyneside oarsmen, the other two being Harry Clasper and Robert Chambers. Early history He was born to James and Jane Renforth in New Pandon Street in the Manors district of Newcastle upon Tyne. The year after his birth, his family moved to Rabbit Banks in the Pipewellgate area of Gateshead. His father was an anchorsmith and the young James became employed as a smith's striker at the age of about 11. The work involved swinging a heavy hammer to strike pieces hot metal of positioned by the smith. The job was physically demanding, but developed his upper body muscles and his stamina, something that served him well in his later career. There is some doubt over the next stage in his career. There are claims that he joined the army at the age of 21 and travelled abroad. However, other claims state that there is evidence that he remained on Tyneside. In 1861, he married Mary Ann Bell in Newcastle. In 1862, Mary gave birth to a daughter, Margaret, Jane. They were living at Dean Court, Newcastle. In 1863, Margaret, Jane died of bronchitis. That same year, a second daughter, Ann Elizabeth, was born. The family were living at Tuthill Stairs, Newcastle. In 1866, Renforth was employed on the demolition of the old Tyne Bridge, ferrying men and materials back and forth. This may have first given him the idea to take up competitive rowing as a means to make more money and help support his wife and child. In 1868, a third daughter, called Margaret Jane was born; the child died later that year. The family were now living at Church Street, Gateshead. Sculling career Renforth made his debut in 1866, in a sculling race and won easily. He won a succession of other sculling races and began to have difficulty in finding opponents who would take him on. He therefore entered several local regattas, which paid smaller prize money. His career took a marked upward turn when he entered for a sculling race at the Thames Regatta in 1868. Renforth won the race, beating Harry Kelley amongst others and received a ¬£90 prize. Tyne crews also won the fours and pairs at the same regatta. Renforth's victory at the Thames Regatta had catapulted him into prominence as a sculler. Kelley was the current World Sculling Champion and Renforth was the obvious contender, so a match was arranged between the two men. The race was to be over the Putney to Mortlake on the Thames and was to be rowed in November 1868. Renforth trained hard for the race and, in the event, won it easily, by four lengths. He became the new World Champion, a title he held until his death in 1871. See also English Sculling Championship. Later career In 1869, Renforth became the landlord of the Belted Will Inn on Scotswood Road, Newcastle, a career move that both Clasper and Chambers had made before him. After six months, in 1870, he moved on, to take over the Sir Charles Napier Inn, Queen Street, Newcastle. In July 1870, Clasper died and Renforth was a pall-bearer at his funeral. Renforth had begun to race in pairs and fours, perhaps because of the difficulty of finding opponents as a sculler. He became stroke of the Tyne Champion Four and, with this crew, defeated a London crew on both the Thames and the Tyne in November 1869. As when he was sculling, Renforth began to have difficulty in finding opponents who would race against him. Racing in Canada A challenge was received from Canada to race a crew of four fishermen from Saint John, New Brunswick. This crew had already competed successfully at the Paris Regatta and were known locally and internationally as the \\"Paris Crew\\". The challenge was accepted and Renforth's crew travelled to Canada in August 1870. The race was held at Lachine, near Montreal, Quebec, in September, and the Tyne crew won easily. Due to the high level of betting, the Tyne crewmembers made rather a financial killing. They received an enthusiastic reception on their return home. However, during the preparations for the race there had been a difference of opinion that led to a split within the crew upon their return. Two boats had been taken and whilst Renforth favoured one, the bowman and coach, James Taylor, favoured the other. Renforth had prevailed, but this led to bitterness and so the crew split up, leaving Renforth crewless. Final race Renforth promptly formed a new crew, which included his old sculling rival Kelley. In 1871, he accepted another challenge from the Canadians to race in Canada, and the crew prepared to travel to Saint John, New Brunswick. The race was to take place over six miles on the Kennebecasis River. It was rowed on 23 August starting at seven in the morning. The Saint John crew were first away from the start but were soon half a length down. They started to come back at the English crew and at that point it was noticed that something was wrong with Renforth's rowing. He was swaying from side to side and not producing any effort. He finally collapsed into the lap of the rower behind him. The other crewmembers brought the boat ashore, where he was attended by two doctors but was pronounced dead. His last words were reputed to be, \\"What will they say in England\\". A post-mortem found nothing unusual, but rumours persisted of poison.https://www.gnb.ca/0007/Heritage/rowing/ReNc146.htm The most likely cause of his death is heart failure, perhaps brought on by an epileptic fit. He had been known to collapse with a fit after a race in the past. An account of his final race and subsequent death was published in the Newcastle Daily Chronicle on 12 July 1871: > :\\"The Tyne crew won the toss for choice of sides, and took the inside berth. > As previously agreed on, Mr. William Oldham acted as umpire for the English > crew, and Mr. James Stackhouse filled the same office for the St. John crew. > The Honourable Thomas R.

Kelly held the poor champion, while Percy and > Chambers rowed the boat to Appleby's Wharf. :Renforth (who was quite > insensible when he was landed) was then carried from the boat on the arms of > his mates, put into a conveyance, and driven a mile and a half to Claremont > House, their training quarters. Here he was laid on his own bed. Kelley took > him in his arms, while Percy and I rubbed his feet.

It was claimed that 100,000 mourners attended his funeral. It is true to say that Tyneside was shocked by the death of a 29-year-old athlete in his prime, especially so soon after the deaths of Chambers in 1868 and Clasper in 1870. As with the other two oarsmen, a funeral monument was commissioned to stand over his grave. In 1992, it was restored and moved to a site outside the Shipley Art Gallery in Gateshead, where it remains. Renforth's name was not forgotten in Canada. The community in which his last race took place in New Brunswick was named Renforth in his honour. > \\"In 1868 Renforth, one of the most powerful men that ever sat in a boat, > easily defeated Kelley. With the subsequent history of this noted sculler > everybody is familiar. His untimely death in America cast a gloom over the > whole of the United Kingdom. I believe him to have been one of the fastest > men that ever handled a pair. His loss to us at that most critical time was > irreparable, for from his death may be dated the decline of English > sculling\\" :Otago Witness, Issue 1951, 11 April 1889, Page 25 See also * List of people from Newcastle upon Tyne References External links * The Resurfacing of James Renforth's Sculls and the 1871 Tyne Four's Oars * N.E.Rowing - History Timeline for a timeline of Renforth's life Bibliography * Whitehead, Ian (2002).
