The Loring R-3, the most successful plane designed by Barr√≥n. Eduardo Barr√≥n (full name Eduardo Barr√≥n y Ramos de Sotomayor; b. 7 September 1888 - d. 13 January 1949) was a Spanish aeronautical engineer and military pilot who led the design department at Talleres Loring from 1923 to 1930.  Biography  Eduardo Barr√≥n was born in a village in Colonial Cuba and his family moved to Spain towards the turn of the century, settling in Madrid. He studied at the Academy of Military Engineering of Guadalajara in 1902, becoming an apprentice lieutenant in 1907.Ej√©rcito del Aire - Barr√≥n y Ramos De Sotomayor, Eduardo Barr√≥n was posted to the Compa√±√≠a de Aeroestaci√≥n y Alumbrado en Campa√±a aerostat section in 1908 under Colonel Vives, becoming a certified balloon pilot in July 1909. His unit was transferred to Spanish North Africa where he took part in the local military campaigns between 1909 and 1910.Warleta Carrillo, Jos√© (1989). ¬´Revista Aeroplano n¬∫ 6¬ª. En Instituto de Historia y Cultura Aeron√°utica. Eduardo Barr√≥n y Ramos de Sotomayor. Madrid. p. 64 and foll. In 1911 Barr√≥n was transferred back to peninsular Spain where he was selected to become an aircraft pilot together with pioneering Spanish military airmen Alfredo Kindel√°n, Emilio Herrera, Enrique Arrillaga and Jos√© Ortiz Echag√ºe. Barr√≥n became the second person to pass the first Military pilot training course in Spain.Centenario de la Aviaci√≥n Militar Espa√±ola (1911-2011), Fundaci√≥n de Aeron√°utica y Astron√°utica Espa√±ola, page 11 The following year he was promoted as a Captain of the newly created Aeronautics section that was separated from the aerostat section under the orders of Alfredo Kindel√°n. In 1913 Barr√≥n was posted to the T√©touan aerodrome, where he was in charge of the Lohner B.I aircraft newly bought from Austria-Hungary. He carried out reconnaissance and light bombing in the T√©touan area as leader of the group. Early aircraft development In 1914 Barr√≥n was transferred to Cuatro Vientos near Madrid in order to become involved in aircraft construction at the new military aircraft workshop. He modified the Lohner biplanes producing a new model that would be known as Barr√≥n Flecha, credited to be the first step of the Spanish aeronautical industry. The plane made its first flight in April 1915, following which he fitted the Flecha with a more powerful 140 hp Hispano-Suiza motor for a demonstration flight before King Alfonso XIII on 27 July. L. Utrilla Navarro= ed. La Aeron√°utica Espa√±ola, de 1898 a 1936 Following the successful demonstration the Carde y Escoriaza company, based in Saragossa, was commissioned to build twelve Flecha planes that would not be ready until 1916.Barron Flecha Barr√≥n continued modifying the Flecha prototype,Real Hermandad de Veteranos de las Fuerzas Armadas y de la Guardia Civil (eds.). Centenario de la Aviaci√≥n Militar Espa√±ola producing a new Hispano-Suiza-fitted model which had improved visibility for the pilot and which he named Barr√≥n W.Barron W Subsequently, twelve Barr√≥n W were built at the Cuatro Vientos workshops. After a visit to France, where he studied in depth the building of the SPAD S.VII, he built a version of the same plane that he would designate Espa√±a, also fitted with a Hispano-Suiza motor. The Loring Pujol y Cia company in Barcelona was commissioned with building twelve units of the Barr√≥n Espa√±a, but these never entered active service owing to serious construction flaws. In 1917 Barr√≥n, left the military in order to lead the aviation section of 'La Hispano', a subsidiary company of Hispano-Suiza. He designed a reconnaissance and a fighter plane for the company in 1918, the Hispano Barr√≥n.Hispano Barron However, the stock of cheap and more technologically advanced World War I planes available at the end of the conflict foreclosed any incentive for the development of a local aircraft industry for the time being. Barr√≥n returned to the military profession in 1920 and was posted to the Tablada Aerodrome near Seville. In August 1921 he became Commander and was transferred back to Cuatro Vientos in order to take charge of the direction of the workshops and stores (Talleres y Almacenes). In 1922 he was transferred again to Seville as chief of the military airbase and in October the same year he married Matilde de la Vega y Mart√≠nez de Mora. Engineer at Loring and retirement Barr√≥n returned to Cuatro Vientos in order to become chief engineer at a newly built aeronautical factory, Talleres Loring, which had won a contract to produce Fokker C.IV reconnaissance planes under licence. While at Loring Barr√≥n designed and tested his own planes in flight, beginning with the Loring RB military surveillance aircraft, an obscure monoplane prototype of which there are no data.Manuel Lage, Hispano- Suiza 1904-1972 ‚Äì Hombres, empresas, motores y aviones, LID, 2003, Meanwhile, General Primo de Rivera took power and began a dictatorship that sought to protect and promote local industries. Thanks to this support, Barr√≥n's following project, the Loring R.I reconnaissance and light bomber, went into production and thirty units were built for the Aeron√°utica Militar of the Spanish Army. Based on this plane he designed and developed the Loring R-III, an aircraft of similar characteristics powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Hb, which went into production with a total of 110 units built. These were delivered to the Aeron√°utica Militar beginning in 1929, still during Primo de Rivera's dictatorship. Meanwhile, and despite the favorable situation the Spanish aeronautical industry enjoyed, other planes designed by Barr√≥n remained in the prototype stage. Among these the following deserve mention: the Loring R-II, the Loring C-I fighter, the Loring T.1 trainer, and the Loring E.II light plane powered by an Elizalde A6 110 hp radial engine. A modified E.II, named La Pepa and fitted with a Kinner K-5 motor, would be used by Fernando Rein Loring (1902-1978) in his solo flight from Madrid to Manila in 1932.Ej√©rcito del Aire - Fernando Rein Loring By 1930 Barr√≥n suffered a stroke followed by hemiplegia and had to interrupt all professional activity at Loring Aeronautical Works. A prototype was built of his Loring T-3 three-engined commercial monoplane, also known as Barr√≥n Colonial in 1931,Birth, first steps and pre-war planes of the Spanish Military Aviation but other designs, including the Loring B-2 a 4,000 kg payload bomber powered by six engines, remained in the project stage. Later life In 1931 Eduardo Barr√≥n applied for retirement and obtained from the newly installed Spanish Republican government a substantial pension. Barr√≥n also finally was granted the aeronautical engineer title by the Republic, for until then he had been carrying out his successful engineering work without being academically certified. Around that time the Loring company began to face financial difficulties in the wake of the Great Depression and it became an uphill task for Jorge Loring to finance Barr√≥n's more ambitious aircraft projects.Ateneo - Jorge Loring Martinez Barr√≥n moved to Seville, his wife's town, in 1933 where he lived in semi-retirement. In July 1936, at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he was commissioned by General Queipo de Llano to adapt local industries to the war effort. At the end of the civil war, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel of the Corps of Aeronautical Engineers. In 1944 he was given the largely ceremonial post of inspector at the Direcci√≥n General de Industria y Material, and had to move to Madrid, ascending to the rank of General in 1945. He died in Madrid in 1949, following a new stroke.  Bibliography  * Warleta Carrillo, Jos√©. Eduardo Barr√≥n y Ramos de Sotomayor, in Aeroplano. Revista de Historia Aeron√°utica, n¬∫ 6.

Work as an architect He had trained as an architect under Ferdinando Tacca, and joined Tacca's team enlarging the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, which had been purchased by Gabriello Riccardi in 1659. From 1670 to 1684 Baldi designed for him the northward extension of the palazzo along Via Larga. The lobbying of Riccardi, helped obtain in 1670 the appointment of Baldi in 1670 to chief architect to the court of Grand Duke Cosimo III. In 1673 Baldi designed the Fountain in Piazza Santa Croce.Refurbished in marble in 1816; Pianta geometrica della citt√† di Firenze alla proporzione di 1 a 4500 levata; by Federico Fantozzi, page 164. He added the final touches to Tacca's Chapel of the Princes in San Lorenzo. In 1679 he designed for the Grand Duke the church of Santi Quirico, Lucia e Pietro d'Alcantara and its attached convent of the Reformed Friars Minor. The church is near the Medici Villa dell‚ÄôAmbrogiana and connected to it by a passageway. In 1680, Baldi is recorded as superintendent of the buildings and fortifications of Livorno.

She spearheaded the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigation (C-DEBI) project at the University of Southern California, which is ongoing. Edwards also helped organize the deep biosphere research community by heading the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory Project on Loihi Seamount, and serving on several program steering committees involving ocean drilling. Edwards taught at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) and later became a professor at the University of Southern California.[1][2]  Life and education  Katrina Edwards was born the third of five children on March 15, 1968 in Columbus, Ohio, to Sandra and Timothy Edwards. At Columbus Alternative High School Katrina completed her secondary education, and pursued an early career at the Delaware Municipal Airport in general airport operations and later as a chief flight instructor. While continuing her work at the airport, Edwards attended Ohio State University to pursue an undergraduate degree in geology. In 1994, she received her bachelor's degree with honors. In 1996 Edwards left her work at the airport to attend the University of Wisconsin, Madison where she studied geochemistry, mineralogy, microbiology, oceanography, molecular biology and ecology. There she earned a master's in geology with emphasis on isotope geochemistry and in 1999 she earned the first Ph.D. in geomicrobiology awarded by the university. It was also at UW-Madison she met her future husband. In 1999 Edwards moved to Massachusetts to join Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. There she established a geomicrobiology lab, which focused on the microbial transformation and degradation of solid Earth materials, specifically rocks, minerals, and organic matter. Katrina Edwards died on October 26, 2014 at the age of 46. Edwards is survived by her parents, her siblings, and her three children.  Work and discoveries  While at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Edwards was an associate scientist in geochemistry and marine chemistry. In 2006, she began working at the University of Southern California (USC). There she was a professor in the environmental studies, earth sciences, and biological sciences departments and became a mentor for many students and postdoctoral researchers. In 2009, she helped established the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) at USC. Creation of the technology center was done in partnership with USC, national laboratories, and several major research universities and was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with a $29 million grant. Since then, the Deep Carbon Observatory is also continuing to organize collaborative work on biological activity in the deep subsurface. Edwards, as founding director and principal investigator of C-DEBI, worked with other scientists and led multiple expeditions in the North Atlantic Ocean, including international projects to explore the ocean's crust through deep drilling. She also headed the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory Project on Loihi Seamount, which was supported by the NSF. The goal of these expeditions was to gather information about the role of intraterrestrials (organisms living under the sea floor or inside the earth) and their role in what she called \\"the tooth decay of the solid Earth,\\" otherwise known as the degradation and transformation of Earth solid minerals and organic matter. Edwards authored over 100 published papers, contributed to and edited several microbiology textbooks, served as the associate editor of American Mineralogist, and served on the editorial boards of Environmental Microbiology, Geobiology and Geomicrobiology journals. Her 2000 paper, \\"An Archaeal Iron-oxidizing Extreme Acidophile Important in Acid Mine Drainage\\" featured as the cover story in the journal Science. Edwards also published a blog on Scientific American's website, relating the experiences of her team so members of the public could follow the events as they occurred during a research expedition in the Mid- Atlantic Ocean.  Iron transformation pathways of intraterrestrials  Edwards studied intraterrestrial transformation pathways (metabolic processes) of iron (Fe) in sulfide-mineral deposits and the effects of their metabolic reactions on their surroundings. Because of its abundance, dynamic solubility, and oxidation-reduction properties, iron is an important element in the biochemistry of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. It is abundant in most fluids discharged from hydrothermal vents. Iron plumed from hydrothermal vents in sulfide mineral deposits precipitate (form a solid) with sulfur (S). The precipitate then becomes part of the physical structure of the sulfide deposit. Iron also has the potential to act as the substrate for microbial metabolism and respiration. This means that it can be reduced during a microbial process that uses it in the place of oxygen to create energy. This and other studies by Edwards have revealed how microbes can live deep in the earth's crust in bedrock that was previously thought to be devoid of life. Awards and recognition Edwards was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2010 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2011. In 2012, she became the third woman to receive one of the highest honors for those working in ocean science, the Royal Society of Canada's A.G. Huntsman Award for Excellence in Marine Science.

It was built between 1899 and 1902 under the direction of the Belgian Catholic missionary Father John Velghe, who then painted frescoes along the interior ceiling and walls. An untrained folk- artist, Fr. Velghe depicted various biblical scenes, such as Cain's murder of Abel, Jesus refusing the Devil, and the writing on the wall, as well as a vivid illustration of sinners in Hell. While the building itself is small and rectangular, Fr. Velghe painted Gothic vaults above the altar, creating the illusion of a European Gothic cathedral, inspired particularly by Burgos Cathedral. Several other priests learned from Velghe and went on to establish other 'painted churches', including Star of the Sea Painted Church, painted by Father Evarist Gielen. St. Benedict's continues to be an active Roman Catholic church in the Diocese of Honolulu, vicariate of West Hawaii, holding five masses per week.Saint Benedict Church Parish Details.

History During the Japanese rule of Korea, the site was the location of Seoul's first airport, built in April 1924.According to . However, the Naver Encyclopedia asserts that the airport opened in 1916, and that the homecoming flight of An Chang-nam, the first Korean pilot, landed here in 1922. In the 1970s, the area was developed into an asphalt strip as part of the Han River development project led by President Park Chung-hee, who named it May 16 Square in reference to the coup he led in 1961. In May 1984, Pope John Paul II held a canonization mass in the park for Saints Andrew Kim Taegon, Paul Chong Hasang, and 101 other martyrs who were executed under the Joseon Dynasty . After having lain under asphalt for 27 years, May 16 Square was subsequently redeveloped, and was reopened on July 5, 1999.

In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Lord Parasurama stopped for the night at Sohnag on his way back from Janakpuri, after Lord Sri Ram broke the bow of Lord Shiva at the Swayamvar. Impressed by its pleasant atmosphere, he spent a long time in Sohnag engaged in meditation. An old temple in Sohnag, called Parasuram Kshetra / Parasuram Dham, houses ancient idols of Parasuram, Lord Sri Ram, Janaki and Lakshman which were discovered during the excavation of a nearby pond. It is reported that Raja Sohan, king of Kashmir, once passed through Sohnag while traveling with his followers on his way to Kashi, while suffering from leprosy. Being thirsty, the king dipped his hands into the water of the nearby pond, and to his surprise, discovered that the white leprous patches on his palms began to disappear.

Hogan, Sr. had the shopping center built to serve White Houstonians living in newly developed neighborhoods in Southeast Houston that were not in proximity to the shopping places in Downtown Houston. Irving R. Klein & Associates had designed the center, Stanley Krenek and James Bishop served as the project architects, and Fisher Construction Company completed the structural framework; Holcombe and Hogan had selected Klein & Associates in 1954. The construction of Palm Center started after that of Gulfgate Mall, but Palm Center opened first. Hogan stated that market surveys at the time stated that the Griggs and South Park Boulevard area would have immense growth, so the developers chose this location.Smith, Zachary, p. 4. At the time of opening there were 41 stores and 2,000 parking spots. Albert Thomas, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, cut the ribbon to the facility. J.C. Penney, Oshman's, Walgreen‚Äôs, and Woolworth had stores at the time of opening. The library had opened around that time. Collins Tuttle & Co., a real estate company headquartered in New York, purchased Palm Center from Holcombe and Hogan. In 1969 Helmsley-Spear acquired Palm Center.Smith, Zachary, p. 5. The white neighborhoods quickly became majority black due to white flight in the 1970s. The neighborhoods' rapid changes harmed area retail businesses. Prior to the 1980s many tenants left Palms Center. J. R. Gonzales of the Houston Chronicle wrote \\"the center resembled a ghost town by the early 1980s.\\" The J.C. Penney, the final tenant, closed in 1984. City-owned complex In the mid-1980s the City of Houston acquired the complex. In 1987 the city began to redevelop Palm Center to attract small businesses as part of the Target of Opportunity program, funded by loans made by the federal government. The Palms Center Management Company and the Tillman Trotter Foundation cooperated with the city government in this endeavor. The small business center opened in 1989. The city government engaged in a memorandum of understanding with the Houston Business Development, Inc. (HBDi), an entity created by the city government several years prior, in 1992, so that it would handle the redevelopment and management of the complex. That year the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) stated that the Houston redevelopment program had over-reported the number of jobs created and not accurately report spending; the HUD stated in a report that the city overpaid the private development team that renovated Palm Center $1 million and that there was $800,000 in other unnecessary expenses. The city paid $572,000 in punitive costs to the HUD. The center received its current name in 1993, and that year HBDi began managing Palm Center. The HUD approved the construction of a building for light manufacturing and the use of the community development funds for renovation of of space. There were 10 offices for start-up businesses and 25 other offices for prospective tenants available by July 1994. By 1996 the organization in the Palm Center complex was the nonprofit management organization in charge of it, HSBDC. By that year, the city had only attracted three additional tenants.Wallstin, Brian. \\"Incubating Problems.\\" Houston Press. October 10, 1996. p. 2. Retrieved on January 2, 2015.

The phone was announced on 8 October 2014 and was released on 7 November 2014 exclusively for AT&T; in the United States and exclusively for Three in the United Kingdom. It is known as the selfie phone because the front camera has the same quality of imaging as the rear camera.HTC Desire EYE Review: More Than Just A Selfie Phone. Forbes. 5 November 2014. Features The Desire Eye comes with preloaded Android 4.4 and HTC Sense 6.0. An upgrade to Android Lollipop 5.0.2 was released in March 2015 while Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 was released in March 2016. Hardware The Desire Eye features similar hardware to the flagship HTC One M8; the differences are its waterproofing capabilities, dual-tone polycarbonate plastic uni-body, and slightly bigger display at 5.2 inches. It packs a 2.3 GHz quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 CPU, Adreno 330 GPU, 2 GB of RAM, front and back cameras have 13 MP resolution with both having dual LED flash. It comes with a 2400 mAh battery and supports Quick Charge 2.0 by Qualcomm. It is equipped with two HTC BoomSound front-facing speakers hidden at the top and bottom edge of the display panel. Storage is 16 GB and it can take up to 128 GB expandable storage. Reception The HTC Desire Eye received positive reviews from critics. Andrew Hoyle of Cnet gave it a score 8 out of 10 and said \\"Its screen is bright and bold, it has plenty of power and its colourful body is waterproof\\". Chris Velazco of Engadget.com gave it a score of 74 out of 100 and praised the phone for its impressive performance. Despite receiving positive reviews for its performance, the Desire Eye failed at what it was marketed for. The front-facing and back cameras received poor responses from critics. Jeff Parsons of TechRadar called the camera \\"Average\\" and said \\"The strength of the Desire Eye isn't in its 13MP cameras but its unibody design and flagship-baiting specifications\\".

Originally a competition and recreation remotely controlled model airplanes manufacturer, Aisuo has recently begun to expand its business by venturing into the UAV arena, based on its extensive experience on model airplanes development. Unmanned helicopter As of the end of 2014, the only UAV developed by Aisuo is an unmanned helicopter in conventional layout with a pair of skids as landing gear. The unmanned helicopter is developed by utilizing commercial off-the- shelf (COTS) subsystems such as fuselage and flight control systems that was already used by competition model airplanes developed by Aisuo, with necessary modifications to meet the requirements of application on UAVs. The main rotor of the UAV can be folded to save space needed for storage and transportation, and the UAV is capable of carrying ten to twenty liters of chemicals for crop dusting in Chinese agricultural provinces such as Henan. Although mainly intended for agricultural application, the unmanned helicopter is also capable of performing other tasks such as aerial photography, cinematography, and survey missions, and these missions were actually carried out before the original intended crop dusting applications, such as being used in the aerial cinematography of the blockbuster Tai Chi Hero. The most significant application of the unmanned helicopter, however, is its deployment by Chinese authorities during the 2013 Lushan earthquake for post disaster assessment missions.

The CIDCO developed hoverport in CBD Belapur was taken over by the Indian Coast Guard as an ad hoc base for providing security to water transport services till its permanent base at Nerul adjacent to Training Ship Chanakya was set up. Alibaug Catamarans and ferries are operated by private operators from the Gateway of India to Mandwa from where the operators run connecting buses to Alibaug. In 2009, following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Government of Maharashtra decided to shut down the jetties at the Gateway of India and instead open up newer ones near the Radio Club for boats bound for Rewas and Mandwa. In 2011, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), proposed to run roll on roll off (RORO) services from Ferry Wharf to Mandwa.

Synopsis The Korean War happened because the North Koreans invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950 in the Korean peninsula. The fighting ended in a truce on 27 July 1953. 2\\\\. Involved Nations a. Victor side: United Nations, Republic of Korea, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey. b. Opposition side: Democratic People's Republic of Korea, People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union. 3\\\\. Outbreak The Korean War took place on 25 June 1950 in the whole of Korea. The Korean War happened because the North Korean forces surprised the South Korean army, along with the small U.S. forces stationed in the country, quickly headed toward the capital of South Korea. In 1950, Syngman Rhee, who was the South Korean president during that time, boasted that he was going to attack North Korea which helped trigger a war. It was a good enough excuse, so the North Koreans invaded South Korea which started the actual fighting. On 26 June 1950, U.S. President Harry S. Truman directs General Douglas MacArthur to evacuate American dependents from Korean and to assist the Republic of Korean Army (ROKA). The war lasted for about 3 years. 4\\\\. Cessation of Hostilities On 23 June 1951, Jacob Malik, a Soviet delegate to the UN, proposes a cease-fire. Truce talks began at Kaesong and moved to Panmunjom. On 27 November 1951, both sides agreed the existing battle lines would be the final dividing line between North and South Korea. However, truce talks were deadlocked over voluntary repatriation. So, truce talks were adjourned on 8 October 1952. Then, it was resumed and the Communists agreed for voluntary repatriation on 26 April 1953. Finally, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Chinese People's Volunteers, and the UN signed an armistice agreement. The Republic of Korea refused to sign. However, hostilities ceased within 12 hours. Terms of the armistice included creation of the demilitarized zone, the DMZ on 27 July 1953. Births *21 August ‚Äì Seok Cheoljoo.

He is credited by many with initiating the modernisation of the Emirate. Biography Al Ras Deira in mid 1960s Deira Souk William Duff (originally MacDuff which was later shrunk to Duff) was born in Singapore on 13 May 1922 to Eleanor and Robert Duff who ran a business there. His education was at Cheltenham College and, later, at the Hertford College, University of Oxford, from where he secured a master's degree in Eastern Studies. While his father endured incarceration, by the Japanese till 1945, in the Changi Prison, a British jail used by the Japanese as a prisoner of war camp after the fall of Singapore in 1942, Duff was drafted into the British Army and his first commission was at the 1st Battalion Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment. He was involved in the World War II, fighting in Italy, Sudan and Palestine. During his stay at Palestine, he is known to have developed an affinity for the Arab culture. It was there he met his future wife, Irenka Trachimovic, a Polish national, at a party at The British Embassy in 1946, whom he married the same year. On his retirement from the Army as a Captain, Duff went back to Oxford University to read Arabic and, later, continued his Arabic studies at the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies, Shemlan, Lebanon. His civilian career started at the Imperial Bank of Persia, (then Bank of Iran and the Middle East, which over the years became the British Bank of the Middle East and finally, HSBC), and worked for 10 years at various countries in the Middle East such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Sudan and finally in Kuwait. The next assignment was as the advisor to the Kuwait royal family, on invitation from Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah who would later become the Ruler of Kuwait, a brief stint during which he had the opportunity to meet Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai when the latter paid a visit to Kuwait in 1959. The next year, Sheikh Rashid invited Duff to Dubai, which was a part of the Trucial States during that time, to join as his financial advisor on 2 October 1960, and the friendship between the two is reported to have paved way for the modernisation of Dubai. In 1966, when oil was discovered in Dubai, the Emirate was exposed to sudden riches, and as the financial advisor to the ruler, Duff, who had signatorial powers, is reported to have imposed fiscal discipline in the Emirate and advised the ruler on major developmental programs. He is known to have been the brain behind the establishment of the Departments of Finance and the Department of Customs, and helped put in place an infrastructure facility whereby the commercial activities of Dubai grew with the advent of global oil companies and workers from overseas, mainly from the Indian subcontinent. Legacy Port Rashid on 1 May 2007 Port Jebel Ali on 1 May 2007 Under the guidance of William Duff, who spoke classical Arabic, Dubai Government channelled the newly opened revenue streams for setting up infrastructural facilities such as Sea ports, Airports, roads, hotels, utilities and communications. He is also credited with the establishment of a Seafarer's Mission, a kindergarten school, a Christian cemetery and Dubai English Speaking School, the first English curriculum school in Dubai which was run by his wife, Irenka, till a few years before Duff's death. His efforts were known in inviting foreign companies to invest in business in Dubai for which he is reported to have attempted to eliminate bribery from the administration. Duff's involvement is reported in the establishment of Port Rashid in 1972, the first port in the region as well as in the making of the Port of Jebel Ali in 1979, which has grown over the years to become the largest man made harbour and the 9th businesst container sea port in the world. Six years after the opening of Jebel Ali port, Duff assisted in the creation of Jebel Ali Free Zone in 1985 to supplement the activities of the port. The creation of a Department of Finance is considered as one of the principal contributions of Duff, a department he advised on till the death of Sheikh Rashid in 1990. His contributions are reported behind the establishment of the Customs Department to foster Dubai's trade with other countries, initially by facilitating imports through Dubai Creek and providing a market place for the traders along the Creek, which is the present day Deira Souk. Dubai Electric Co. is another of his contributions which was later renamed as Dubai Electricity and Water Authority and is powering the Emirate of Dubai. Duff is also known to have blocked an attempt by officials to channel the Emirates reserves to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which went bankrupt in 1991. Relationship with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum Bill Duff is known to have had a close relationship with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, ten years elder to him, ever since their first meeting in Kuwait in 1959. It is reported that Duff hosted Al Maktoum several times in Scotland at Gleneagles Hotel, during the latter's visits to the place. The relationship is also cited as the reason behind the donation of 1.16 million the erstwhile Dubai ruler made to the Exeter University for its library and later, for the Institute for Arab and Islamic Studies. Later years After the death of Sheikh Rashid in 1990, Duff slowly withdrew from the Dubai administration and restricted himself to his role as an Honorary Advisor to the Ruler. He continued his life in Dubai where his wife, Irenka, managed the Dubai English Speaking School, the school he founded, till a few years before Duff's death. He died in his sleep on 14 February 2014 at his villa along the Jumeirah Beach, leaving Eleanor, his wife, Diana Barnardiston and Sheila Duff-Earles, his two daughters and four grandchildren, Michael, Andrew, Nicholas and Caroline. His mortal remains were laid to rest at the nearby Christian Cemetery in Jumeirah, the one he had helped establish.

The Ministry of Education reported that there was a total of 3,877 on-campus rallies, demonstrations, and other disturbances, with nearly half of all of them occurring in the first semester of 1985. Radical student organizations were also formed, including the Sammintu,Sammintu Sanmin Struggle Committee. They represented the struggle for ‚Äúnational unification, emancipation of the masses, and the establishment of democracy.‚Äù The organization was branded as pro-Communist and anti-American and they were responsible for the seizure of the USIS library in downtown Seoul. They occupied it for three days, May 23 to May 26, although they surrendered in peace, their drawn out public trials made a mockery of South Korea's legal process forcing the minister of Justice, Kim Suk-hwi to resign.

It consisted of 50 hometown visitors, 50 folk-art performers, 30 newsmen, and 20 support personnel.

Gasoline-powered UAVs Although Sparkie Tech was in business since 2006, for the first eight years of its business operation, all of its products are sold abroad. It was only after July 2014 when the company begun to market its product in the domestic Chinese market. One category of Sparkie Tech product is the gasoline-powered UAVs, and currently, the 6-meter class gasoline-powered UAV has been publicized and marketed in China. The 6-meter class gasoline-powered UAV is the largest Sparkie Tech UAV currently on the market, and it made its public debut in Beijing at the Vanguard‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The 5th Chinese UAV Convention and Exhibition (Â∞ñÂÖµ‰πãÁøº‚Äî‚ÄîÁ¨¨‰∫îÂ±ä‰∏≠ÂõΩÊó†‰∫∫Êú∫Â§ß‰ºöÊö®Â±ïËßà‰ºö) held at Beijing Exhibition Center in July, 2014.

(X-UAV, Â§©Êç∑ÂäõËà™Ê®°ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏) in Liyang. Originally a model airplane manufacturer, X-UAV has recently expanded its business by venturing into UAV arena, based on its extensive experience on model airplanes. Most of its UAV products are aimed to the niche market of low-cost training UAVs in preparation for more advanced and costly UAVs. One One is a fixed wing UAV in conventional layout with V-tail and tricycle landing gear, with payload, i.e. the camera carried mounted in the nose cone. The Chinese name of this UAV is actually King (Wang, Áéã) instead of One. A unique feature of One is in its propulsion: the electrically powered, two-blade propeller driven engine is mounted in the middle of the fuselage in pusher configuration, with the rear section of the fuselage in the form of a shaft going through the center of the propeller. Specification: *Length (m): 1.078 *Wingspan (m): 1.8 *Wing area (dm2): 38.2 *Weight (kg): 0.75 Skua Skua (Zei-Ou or Zeiou, Ë¥ºÈ∏•) is a fixed UAV in conventional layout with parasol wing configuration with tricycle landing gear. The payload, namely, the camera carried, is installed in the nose cone, as opposed to the turret under the chin in most Chinese UAVs. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven engine mounted in the middle of the wing in tractor configuration directly above the fuselage. Skua can be rapidly assembled and taken apart in the field for fast deployment and saving storage space. Talon Talon (Ying-Zhua or Yingzhua, Èπ∞Áà™) is a fixed-wing UAV in conventional layout with high wing configuration and V-tail. The UAV adopts a tricycle landing gear, but unlike most Chinese UAVs with tricycle landing gear where all wheels are installed on the fuselage, only the main wheel of Talon is installed to the fuselage, but the other two wheels are installed under the wing. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven electrical motor in pusher configuration installed at the empennage. Payload is installed in the nose. Talon is intended for with FPV aerial photography training missions. Mini Talon Mini Talon is a scaled down version of its larger cousin Talon, and both share the identical layout. Like its larger cousin Talon, Mini Talon is also mainly intended for FPV aerial photography training missions. Mini Talon is also referred to as Little Fatty (Xiao-Pang-Zi or Xiaopangzi, Â∞èËÉñÂ≠ê). Lotus Lotus (Lian-Hua or Lianhua, Ëé≤Ëä±) is the only rotary UAV developed by X-UAV (as of end of 2014). What is unique about Lotus is that it is the only amphibious quadcopter currently in China (as of 2014). Propulsion is provided by two pairs of electrically drive two-blade rotors arranged in 2 x 2 configuration. Unlike most other quadcopters where rotors are installed at the tips of the arms extended from center, all rotors of Lotus are in ducted fan configuration. Propulsion and control systems are in the center of the four ducted rotors, and the payload is installed below the propulsion and control systems. There are a total of four floats installed, which also acts as landing gear when the UAV lands on dry land. LZ1401 LZ1401 is a fixed-wing UAV jointly developed X-UAV and others, and it is the first attempt of X-UAV to expand its UAV business from niche market of training to more complex and larger UAVs with greater applications. LZ1401is a fixed wing UAV in flying wing layout with winglets. The UAV is launched by catapult and recovered via parachute. The UAV is mainly intended for aerial survey, photography, cinematography, disaster relief and evaluation applications.

(VolantexRC, Ê¨ßÂÖ∞ÊñØÊ®°Âûã) headquartered in Shantou. Originally a model airplane and boat manufacturer, VolantexRC has recently expanded its business by venturing into UAV arena, based on its extensive experience on model airplanes. Most of its UAV products are aimed to the niche market of low-cost training UAVs in preparation for more advanced and costly UAVs. 757 FPV raptor 757 FPV Raptor is a fixed wing UAV of 1.6 m class, and it is a developed from VolantexRC 747-2 remotely controlled model airplane, with size enlarged and photography capability added. The 757 FPV Raptor UAV is in conventional layout with shoulder wing configuration and the payload, i.e. the camera carried, is installed in the nose. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven electric motor mounted behind the wing in pusher configuration. The wing is constructed of durable and light weight EPO. 757-2 FPV raptor EX 757-2 FPV raptor EX is a development of its smaller cousin 757 FPV raptor, sharing the identical layout and constructed of the same material. 757-2 FPV raptor EX is a 2-meter class enlarged version of its smaller cousin 757 FPV raptor. 757-V2 FPV raptor upgrade 757-V2 FPV raptor upgrade is a further development of its smaller cousin 757 FPV raptor, sharing the identical layout and constructed of the same material. Like its cousin 757-2 FPV raptor EX, 757-V2 FPV raptor upgrade is also a 2-meter class enlarged version of its smaller cousin 757 FPV raptor. In comparison to 757-2 FPV raptor EX, 757-V2 FPV raptor upgrade has a larger 10 inch propeller and size 40 motor. 757-3 Ranger EX 757-3 Ranger EX with Chinese name as Rui-Ying or Ruiying (ÁùøÈπ∞), is the largest VolantexRC UAV developed so far (as of end of 2014), and it is also the first VolantexRC UAV with tricycle landing gear, thus it can take off and land by taxiing, as opposed to being launched by hands for the VolantexRC UAVs previously developed. The installation of the payload, namely, the camera carried, is different than that of all VolantexRC UAVs previously developed: it can be either installed in the nose, or under the chin. 757-3 Ranger EX is in conventional layout with high wing configuration.

However, it was revealed that most of Chinese UAVs cannot be used as a stable platform of the high definition camera developed. Since most Chinese UAV providers are assemblers of different subsystems provided by various sub-tier suppliers, there was too much hassle to coordinate with all the suppliers in an attempt to develop an ideal UAV platform for the latest high definition camera developed by DigiVision. As a result, DigiVision developed its own UAVs by itself. The SII UAV is a quadcopter specially tailored for the latest high definition cameras DigiVision developed, and the result is satisfactory.

The landing gear of the hexacopter consists of a pair of skids which can fold 90¬∞ upward to avoid obstruction to payload such as cameras, and the hexacopter is mainly intended for agricultural, aerial cinematography, photography, and survey missions. As of end of 2014, the hexacopter has entered low rate initial production. Octocopter Octocopter is the third multirotor developed by Taihua, and it is the largest multicopter developed by Taihua (as end of 2014). Like its smaller cousin the hexacopter, the landing gear of the octocopter consists of a pair of skids which can fold 90¬∞ upward to avoid obstruction to payload such as cameras, and the octocopter is mainly intended for agricultural, aerial cinematography, photography, and survey missions. Taihua octocopter made its public debut on December 6, 2014 when a group of Chinese governmental officials visited Taihua robotic and UAV production facility in Jizhou City. Unmanned helicopter Unmanned helicopter is another rotary wing UAV developed by Taihua, and it is mainly intended for agricultural applications such as crop dusting. Taihua unmanned helicopter utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) subsystems such as airframe and flight control systems (FCS), and integrating them into one complete system. Taihua unmanned helicopter is in conventional helicopter layout with a pair of skids as landing gear. Along with Taihua octocopter, Taihua unmanned helicopter made its public debut on December 6, 2014 when a group of Chinese governmental officials visited Taihua robotic and UAV production facility in Jizhou City. Fixed-wing UAV Taihua fixed-wing UAV is an UAV in twin boom layout with high wing configuration and winglets. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the fuselage, which the tricycle landing gear is attached to. The general designer of this fixed-wing UAV is the chief technology officer of UAV department of Taihua, Mr. Chen Wei (ÈôàÂ∑ç), who had previously been the general designer of several Chinese fixed-wing UAVs, Expedition series UAVs, before joining Taihua. As of end of 2014, Taihua fixed-wing UAV has received orders and production has begun. The UAV is mainly intended for aerial survey and surveillance missions.

In the South Gujarat, it is located between Vyara, Tapi District and Ahwa, Dang District, and in Maharashtra, it is located in Nandurbar District. Apart from the Dangs' District, it is a part of the Northern Division of the Dangs' Forest. It was declared a sanctuary in July 1990.Forest and Environment Department, Gujarat It derives its name from the Purna River, which flows through it. Geography and climate The sanctuary has thick forest cover of teak and bamboo. It has a tropical climate with moderate to heavy rainfall. The average rainfall received by this region is about 2500mm. Three distinct climatic seasons are noted: winter, summer and monsoon. Winter is from middle of November to end of February and the average temperature recorded during the coldest month of January is . Summer is from March to end of May when the temperature range is . Monsoon season sets in the middle of June or early July and lasts till September. A popular time to visit the sanctuary is early winter when the river and rivulets are full of fresh water. The nearest large city, Surat, is away. Surat has an airport which provides links with the rest of the country. Vyara is the nearest railway station, which is away. In a view to develop eco- tourism, the Government of Gujarat maintains Mahal Campsite in this sanctuary. Fauna and flora The sanctuary is within the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests' ecoregion. There are about 700 species of plants and trees. Some of the wild animals found here are the leopard, rhesus macaque, bonnet macaque, common mongoose, Indian civet cat, Indian porcupine, four-horned antelope, barking deer, sambar, chital, hyena, and jungle cat. As with Vansda National Park, which is in Navsari District and the Dangs' Forest, and Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, which Narmada District shares with the State of Maharashtra, the Bengal tiger is reportedly extinct in this area, but the place where Gujarat borders the states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra has tigers, nevertheless, making the Dangs Forest a potential habitat of the tiger.Jhala, Y.

The main cause for the stampede was a severe fog that continued for hours and limited visibility to only 30 meters. This caused the ferry service to be suspended, leading to a crowd which was anxious to leave; as soon as the ferry service was restored, the crowd hurried to board the ferry, causing a stampede. The accident led to 17 deaths, 2 seriously injured and over 70 slightly injured.‰∏äÊµ∑Âú∞ÊñπÂøó--‰∏äÊµ∑ÈÄöÂøó--Â§ß‰∫ãËÆ∞2 The accident There were no bridges or tunnels available to cross the Huangpu River in 1987, and daily commute relied highly on Route 21, which was developed by the Shanghai Ferry Company. Lujiazui was heavily crowded, and Route 21 was the company's busiest route. Early in the morning, the river was covered by a fog with a visibility of less than 30 metres, according to Shanghai Central Meteorological Observatory. In accordance with the relevant regulations, all the ships should cease cross-river operations when the visibility falls under 100 metres. By 9:00 AM, the fog began to scatter and the ferry was to commence operation. An estimated 30,000-40,000 passengers (many with bicycles) had queued for the ferry. The passengers became anxious from the waiting and began to push towards the second ferry, after the first had departed. People and bicycles began to fall into the river from the pushing and the scene quickly turned chaotic. The station was closed five minutes later in order to disperse the crowd and commence rescue operations. The disaster killed 17 people, severely injured 2 and injured over 70 people. It would be the deadliest stampede to occur in Shanghai until the stampede in 2014. Another casualty report stated that 66 were killed, 2 severely injured and over 20 slightly injured. Cause The standing committee 33rd conference of Shanghai people's congress reviewed Vice Mayor Ni Tianzeng's report on the Lujiazui ferry casualties, and concluded that the accident was a concentrated reflection of problems such as the city's longstanding poor infrastructure, unsound management, the lack of rationality, and lack of systematic municipal construction planning. In response, they decided to ease the policy and to support in all aspects to improve the city's infrastructure and reduce major accidents. First, in late 1980s, the citizens could only use ferries to cross the river. Most enterprises were located west of the river, so commuters flocked to the ferry station every morning. Lujiazui was the most crowded area in Pudong, and many people poured into Lujiazui station daily. A combination of long, heavy traffic, bad weather and having only one mode of travel led to the tragedy. Second, the accident had some relation to the salary system that resulted in a bonus pay reduction for tardy employees. Several incidences of being late for work could lead to a total loss of quarterly and yearly bonus, which was a serious shock to the citizens at the time when income was generally low, and this incented commuters to squeeze aboard. So after the accident, the Shanghai government delivered an internal regulation that being late caused by the suspension of the ferry service could not be punished. Aftermath Increased media attention from Shanghai Radio and Shanghai TV focused on fog and visibility conditions. The government supported the construction of the tunnel of Yan'an East Way in order to allow safe and convenient travel for more citizens. Plans to build new bridges and tunnels were scheduled.

The motorcycle industry of the People's Republic of China exceeds that of any country in the world with a motorcycle output of 22,891,700 in 2013, with 39.75% of the total production exported. China also produces auto rickshaws, all-terrain vehicles, and motorcycle components and accessories in great numbers. In 2013 the total revenue of the Chinese motorcycle industry increased by 3.24% year on year to RMB 112,621 million; including a year-on- year profit increase of 20.24% to RMB 3,322 million. This profit increase was mainly attributed to technical improvement and higher added value on motorcycles despite of the sales volume decreases suffered during industrial transformation in recent years.  History  PLA motorcycle in Beijing in 2005 Motorcycle manufacture in China first began in 1951 when the People's Liberation Army began producing a 500cc motorcycle to meet the country's military requirements during the Korean War. It was developed on the lines of the K500, a German model used in World War II. Before the end of the 1970s motorcycles produced in China were used mainly by the military services, the major exception being the Beijing Motorcycle Factory which from 1958 onwards produced motorcycles for the general public that were based on the German pre war BMW R71 and Russian Ural and Dnepr models. In Chongqing city in 1979 military munitions factory China Jialing Industrial Company began to independently manufacture motorcycles for civilian use ushering in the modern era of Chinese motorcycle production. In 2000 the Chinese industry took over as the biggest motorcycle producer in the world a position that it has maintained.  Geography of the industry  China's motorcycle manufacturing industry is centred on 3 main regions- Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces and Chongqing city in the Chongqing municipality (the biggest centre of motorcycle production in the world). China Motorcycle News \\"Motorcycle Capital of China\\"  Domestic industry  China's domestic motorcycle market has suffered a downturn in recent years due to the banning of motorcycles in many Chinese urban centres. China's domestic motorcycle sales reached a high of around 19,000,000 units in 2009 and then suffered gradual decreases for 4 consecutive years. In 2013, the market decreased by 5.73% from 2012 to 13,880,000 units, 26.94% less than 2009. Domestic sales decreased due to ban on motorcycles in urban centres, the national economic transformation and the rural market downturn. In Chinese rural areas, motorcycles are used for a variety of purposes, including personal transportation, passenger vehicles, and cargo transportation. Improved living standard in these areas in recent years has led to the replacement of motorcycles with mini-cars and e-bikes.  Export industry  Haojue motorcycle in Africa (2020) During the first 11 months of 2013 China exported 9,128,400 motorcycles totaling RMB 4,865 million at an average price of US$532.92 to 198 countries and regions. Export to Asia, Middle East, Africa, and Latin America accounted for 87.57% of the total export volume, with Myanmar, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, Philippines, Togo, Mexico, Russia, Angola, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia topping the export destination list. A total of 4,639,600 motorcycles were exported to these top 10 countries, accounting for 50.83% of total export. Global demand for Chinese motorcycles has taken a hit over the past couple of years, with various political and financial crises in many markets seriously disrupting the ability for manufacturers to profitably get their motorcycles to the end consumers. Both the financial problems in Argentina and the political problems in Egypt are examples of markets recently becoming completely unavailable to manufacturers.  Parts and accessories  China is also a leading producer of motorcycle parts and accessories. In 2013, motorcycle engine export saw a year-on-year increase of 0.87% to 26,191,300 units.[] Mega Chinamotor Magazine \\"Chinese industry stats from 2013\\"  Manufacturers  China has more than 200 individual companies producing motorcycles nationally.

She picked up a total of ten medals in her career, including two from the World Taekwondo Championships and a bronze from the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Diaz also competed for Puerto Rico in a demonstration event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, and later attained a fifth-place finish in the 67-kg division at the 2004 Summer Olympics, narrowly missing out the nation's first Olympic medal since 1996. Diaz made her official debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where she trailed behind South Korea's Jeung Eun-ok 1‚Äì4 in the 60-kg class during an exhibition taekwondo event. In 1993, she won a bronze medal in the same division at the World Championships in New York City, before suddenly retiring from the sport. Six years later, she came out from an early retirement to pick up another bronze in the 63-kg class at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, but missed her bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, where taekwondo officially became part of the sporting program. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Diaz returned from a 12-year absence to compete for her Puerto Rican squad in the women's welterweight class (67 kg). Earlier in the process, she sealed a first-place victory over Guatemala's Heidy Ju√°rez and guaranteed a spot on the Puerto Rico Olympic team at the Pan American Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Quer√©taro, Mexico. She first triumphed by a 4‚Äì4 judging decision over Morocco's Mouna Benabderrassoul, before being downed by China's Luo Wei in the semifinals with a score of 3‚Äì5. Diaz sought for Puerto Rico's first Olympic medal at these Games, but slipped it away in a 2‚Äì5 defeat to Juarez in the repechage rounds, relegating her to fifth. Rising from Puerto Rico's top Olympic finish in Athens, Diaz put her retirement plans on hold, as she finished behind South Korea's Shin Kyung-hyeon in the heavyweight division at the 2005 World Taekwondo Championships in Madrid, Spain, and then crushed Mexico's Sulayyil Madrigal to earn her last of four golds at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games in Cartagena, Colombia.

It was the first socialist and the earliest newspaper published by a labor union in the world. In addition, it was the last leading social democrat newspaper in Denmark. History and profile The newspaper was established under the name of Socialisten (meaning the Socialist in English) by the cofounder of the Social Democratic party, Louis Pio, in 1871. The paper was the organ of the Social Democratic party. Its headquarters was in Copenhagen. In the mid-1970s the owner of the paper was A/S Fagbev√¶geIsens Presse, a limited liability company. Then It became owned by the trade union movement until 1987 when it declared its independency and freedom. The paper was published by the Labour Movement Press during its final years. The paper was published under different names. The original name, Socialisten, was changed into Socialdemokraten in 1874. It was used until 1959 when it began to be published under the name of Aktuelt. In 1987 the paper was renamed as Det fri Aktuelt. Being an official media outlet of the Social Democratic party the paper had a social democrat political leaning. In 1881 Emil Wiinblad was appointed editor-in-chief of the paper. At the end of the 1880s it discouraged the immigration of Swede workers to Denmark. However, its attitude towards them totally changed in the 1890s and it supported the right of poor Swede workers to obtain Danish citizenship. The paper followed the decisions taken in the Second International and adopted a positive approach towards labor immigration to the country until World War I. It also supported the immigration of the Russian socialist refugees and Jews to the country from 1905 to the end of World War I. The Sunday edition of Aktuelt began to be published in tabloid format in 1966. In 1973 the format of the paper was also changed to tabloid. Carsten Jensen was among the contributors.

He has won the Richard Branson Mars 2025 award from the Walden 3 foundation and has exhibited in Germany, Thailand, Turkey, Russia, Armenia the United States and China.Nevdon Jamgochian, Lidepla on Luna  Early life and education  Jamgochian was born in 1971 in San Francisco. His father, Peter as well as his paternal Grandparents, Vahan and Gertrude were painters. The Jamgochian family originated from the Kharpet district of the Ottoman empire, in the town of Egin, where they had lived since the fall of Nineveh in 612 B.C. His great grandfather, Avedis, translated the poem \\"Paradise Lost\\" into Turkish and was exiled. The family that remained were murdered by the Ottoman government during the Hamidian massacres of 1896 . The Jamgochian family founded the Armenian colony of Glendale, California in 1910 . Nevdon Jamgochian trained as an artist under the supervision of his family and later at the Savannah College of art and Design.REPORT OF J. B. HUBBELL, M. D. GENERAL FIELD AGENT IN CHARGE OF EXPEDITIONS IN THE INTERIOR OF ANATOLIA  Work  Many of Jamgochian's works call attention to alternate or fictive histories, which highlight the \\"real\\" history, which is hidden. For example, in his \\"Bagradian project\\" he has taken a minor character in Franz Werfel's 1933 novel \\"The 40 Days of Musa Dagh\\", and has created a fictio that this was real historical figure who had a successful life as a painter in the 20th century. Of course, this is a counter factual argument to the Turkish government's claim that the Armenian Genocide never occurred.Nevdon Jamgochian  Recent work  The Bagradian project consists of paints made by Jamgochian, but signed by his fictional artist- Stephan Bagradian, purportedly from the 1920s through the 1970s. He has written a 200-page \\"autobiography\\" of the artist to support this work and is touring the United States in 2015‚Äì2016 with a show \\"by\\" Bagradian. In 2014 he also has made 1,500,000 medallions with the phrase \\"1 Armenian\\" on each to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in 2015 and to represent the number of Armenians murdered at this time. He is distributing these in around the world, starting with Turkey in April. As a side project, Jamgochian also installs chrome plates with the Percy Shelly poem \\"Ozymandius\\" inscribed on it on building slated for destruction. He has done this in Thailand, Turkey and China. The idea behind the installation and poem is that nothing that humans build can last. In 2015, Jamgochian is releasing two short films. One deals with the Ottoman slaughter of 80,000 dogs through starvation and is called \\"Dogs as Metaphor\\" and the other is titled \\"Stuck\\" which documents Jamgochian's Ozymandius project in Bangkok, Thailand. He is also a writer for several arts publications, including Hyperallergic and Artcore Journal.Paul R. Ignatius, Armenian Heritage Press, 2011, Hardcover, 226 pages Nevdon Jamgochian currently lives in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and works at the International School of Kuala Lumpur (ISKL).

The Colorado was a 120 foot long, stern-wheel steamboat, built for the George A. Johnson & Company in San Francisco by John G. North a well known builder of steamboats in California.Scott, Erving M. and Others, Evolution of Shipping and Ship-Building in California, Part II, Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Volume 25, February 1895, p. 123 It was equipped with an 80-horsepower steam engine capable of carrying up to 70 tons of cargo while drawing only 2 feet of water. North subsequently disassembled and shipped in sections by sea to the estuary of the Colorado River. There North unloaded, reassembled and launched in it in December, 1855 under the command of Captain Isaac Polhamus. More powerful than Johnson's first steamboat, the side-wheeler General Jesup, it made faster runs between the estuary and Fort Yuma with larger cargoes against strong currents in the river. As a stern-wheeler it was narrower, with a lesser draft, so was better equipped to avoid or pass over sandbars and through the narrower sloughs that sometimes occurred on the ever- changing course of the old Colorado River Delta. Besides running cargoes between Fort Yuma from the estuary, it was used with the General Jesup to carry supplies and soldiers up river during the 1858-59 Mohave War and for the establishment of Fort Mohave. The steamboats were engaged to carry the troops and supplies up river for at $500 per day. Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 At the end of its service life the first Colorado's hull was dismantled in April, 1862. Its engine and boiler was removed and used to equip the new, larger stern-wheeler Colorado that was built and launched under the guns of Fort Yuma, in Arizona City, for fear of an attack by Confederate raiders.

In 1814, as part of the Portuguese Empire, Brazil adopted the new Portuguese metric system, which was based in the original metric system, but with its units having Portuguese traditional names. This system was not, however, widely adopted and was soon abandoned, with the Portuguese customary units continuing to be used. In 1862, the International Metric System finally became compulsory in Brazil. Pre- metric units A number of units were used with local variations. Length A number of different units were used in Brazil to measure length. One p√© (foot) was equal to 0.33 m (with local variations).

The Turkestanishvili () or Turkistanishvili (·Éó·É£·É†·É•·Éò·É°·É¢·Éê·Éú·Éò·É®·Éï·Éò·Éö·Éò), were a noble family with origin in the eastern Georgian region of Kartli who branched out in the 18th century in the Russian Empire, where they came to be known as Turkistanov () and then as Turkestanov (–¢—É—Ä–∫–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤). The genealogical tradition, such as that enshrined in the work of Prince Ioann of Georgia of the early 19th century, ascribes to the Turkestanishvili family an origin from Turkestan, whence, according to a legend, they came to the Kingdom of Georgia in 1202, in the reign of Queen Tamar. The presence of the family on the Georgian soil, in the province of Somkhiti (Kvemo Kartli), is documented since the late 15th century. They were part of the untitled nobility (aznauri) under the authority of the kings of Kartli. Baadur Turkestanishvili, a diplomat, and Erasti Turkestanishvili, a man of letters, followed King Vakhtang VI of Kartli in his exile in Russia. Thus, a Russian branch was established and elevated by Vakhtang VI to the dignity of prince (tavadi, knyaz), their new status also recognized and finally confirmed, in 1856, by the Russian government. Of this branch came Princess Varvara Turkestanova (1775‚Äì1819), a mistress of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, and Trifon (1861‚Äì1934), a revered hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1857, a coat of arms submitted by the amateur historian Prince Nikolay Turkestanov was approved by the Russian Senate, but it was never officially registered by the Department of Heraldry. The Turkestanishvili who remained in Georgia continued to be listed among the aznauri and were mentioned as such in the list of the Georgian noble families attached to the Russo‚ÄìGeorgian treaty of Georgievsk of 1783.

Location The pipeline will begin at the Uganda Oil Refinery at Kabaale Township, Buseruka Sub- county, Hoima District, Western Uganda near the international border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The pipeline will end at an oil products distribution terminal to be constructed in the neighborhood of Buloba along the Kampala‚ÄìMityana Road. The total length of the pipeline will be approximately . Background The pipeline will transport various products, including jet fuel, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel. From Buloba, the products will be distributed by truck to various locations in Uganda. Buloba will also be the point of sale to the international market of any excess petroleum products. The Kenya‚ÄìUganda‚ÄìRwanda Petroleum Products Pipeline will interface with this pipeline at Buloba to ease transfer of product between the two pipelines when needed. In October 2018, the Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC) secured of raw land in Namwabula Village, Mpigi District, approximately , west of downtown Kampala, where a greenfield petroleum products depot is being developed. Construction , the government of Uganda was evaluating bids by several international firms to determine which had the best plan to construct the pipeline. The selected firm will \\"conduct a baseline environmental study for the project and generate a blueprint for the pipeline‚Äôs route\\". Another company, yet to be selected, will be hired to implement the resettlement plan for the people who will displaced by the pipeline. All the companies under consideration are from outside Africa, although their names have not been disclosed. In July 2015, the Ugandan government selected Ramboll Group A/S, a Danish consulting engineering company to conduct a detailed route and environmental study for an oil products pipeline that will run from Hoima to Buloba. The pipeline will be accompanied by information and communication technology cables, a dual-carriage highway, and power transmission lines between Hoima and Kampala, all contained in a \\"utility corridor\\". Ramboll's report is expected in about one year. Ownership In April 2018, Proscovia Nabbanja, the chief operating officer of Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC), revealed that UNOC will own 51 percent of the Buloba terminal, JK Minerals Africa (South Africa) shall own 20 percent and a strategic partner, yet to be identified, will own 29 percent. The terminal will have capacity of . The cost of building the fuel products terminal is budgeted at US$51.7 million (USh194 billion), to which UNOC will contribute US$10.5 million (USh39.4 billion), in equity.

History  From the early days of Odd fellowship sprang two fraternal orders, the 'Patriotic Order' and the 'Ancient Order'. The existence of the 'Patriotic' Order has been confirmed, as a copy of the rituals revised by a meeting of the Grand Lodge held in London in 1797 has come to hand. The first constitutional record of the Order's founding is the Bond of Union to establish 'Amicable Lodge' Sheffield. A framed copy of the Bond dated January 6, 1798 and signed by the Grand Master and the Grand Secretary on behalf of the meeting of the Grand Lodge of the United Order of Odd Fellows is held at Head Office on Talbot Road Old Trafford Manchester M16 0PL. However, it is questionable if this really is the true date of the establishment of the Order as past publications indicate that the 'Amicable Lodge' declared independence in 1813. What records do not dispute, is the claim of the Grand United Order of Oddfellows to be the oldest Branch Friendly Society. During these early days, there were a number of disputes and disagreements between the Grand Lodge and the Branches and this led to a special meeting being held, where a number of branches splintered off to form a new Order in 1810 - now better known as the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (Manchester Unity) Friendly Society. Subsequent breakaways from the parent Order and from this new Order resulted in the formation of further Orders of Odd Fellows. In the case of the parent Order, various lodges seceded in 1832 to found the Ancient & Noble (Bolton Unity) which subsequently dissolved in 1962, and in the case of the New Order, the Nottingham Odd Fellows. During the early part of the 19th century there were further disagreements regarding the undemocratic way Rules were made and revised without the approval of Branches, which restricted growth in membership. Eventually, the differences were resolved and overall government became the prerogative of the biennial delegate General Meeting vested with powers to make or amend rules, and appoint a central committee (Board of Directors) with authority to administer between meetings. The General Meeting is now held annually and is known as the Annual Moveable Conference. The importance of membership in the early days was to safeguard family interests in times of sickness and adversity, as such protection was not provided by the State at the time. However, between 1912 and 1948 the Order administered State Benefits. Branch meetings provided the opportunity to practice debating skills and they became a training ground for members with political ambitions. They also offered the security of belonging to a fraternal organisation with Branches throughout England, enabling members to meet other members on their travels. It has and remains the proud boast of the Grand United Order of Oddfellows that there are no artificial barriers to membership, and any member may attain the office of Grand Master or other principal position in the hierarchy of the Order. The motto or watch words \\"Friendship, Love and Truth\\" spread abroad with travelling members and Branches were established overseas leading to the formation of Sub-Committees of Management in America, by Peter Ogden in 1843 which currently has 50 main lodges and 56 Household of Ruth lodges with nearly 1000 members in total, and also in Africa and Australia.

Early life and education Sutton was born in Farnborough, Hampshire on 18 October 1950. His mother was Sheila Sutton, n√©e Bourroughs. His father, Derek John Sutton, was in 1950 a student at the University of Reading, working as a trainee teacher at the E. P. Collier School in Reading. Sutton was educated at grammar schools in Stourbridge and Newport, Essex, before reading English at the University of Leicester from 1968 to 1973 (BA 1971, MA 1973). His tutor and mentor at Leicester was the poet G. S. Fraser, who also supervised his PhD in Comparative literature (University of Westminster, 1978). He has been married since 1973 to the archivist Dr Deborah Jenkins. He is a pescatarian and an atheist (member of the National Secular Society), and lists his hobbies as \\"badminton, football, walking in Dorset, sitting by the Mediterranean\\".Biographical data taken from Who's Who. Sutton was included in Who's Who in 2004, together with the Reading-born actress Kate Winslet. See getreading, 14 January 2004. Librarian Sutton worked as a SCONUL trainee librarian at Trinity College, Dublin, Library from 1973 to 1974. He then qualified as a librarian at the University of Sheffield Information School (MA, 1975), and worked as a cataloguer and indexer at the Polytechnic of Central London (1975‚Äì1976), the British Library (1976‚Äì78), and the University of Warwick Library (1980‚Äì82). UK archival researcher In October 1982 Sutton became the senior research officer of a new project based in the University of Reading Library and known as the Location Register of English Literary Manuscripts and Letters. This has been a project to locate and list all the literary manuscripts which are available for public use anywhere in the British Isles. The original Location Register of 20th-century English literary manuscripts and letters was published in two large volumes by the British Library in 1988. This was followed in 1995 by the publication, also by the British Library, of Location Register of English literary manuscripts and letters: 18th and 19th centuries. Both these publications attracted good reviews, including one by Julian Barnes.Julian Barnes: Diary London Review of Books 7 July 1988. The printed volumes, however, became quite seriously out of date. From 1998 to 2003 work was conducted on a Supplement and revision of the 20th-century data, and the new version was made available on the University of Reading website. The website has been updated by further periods of research funded from 2010 to 2012 and from 2014 to 2018. Since 1994 Sutton has also been the UK editor of a website known as WATCH (Writers Artists & Their Copyright Holders). WATCH is a joint project between the University of Reading and the University of Texas at Austin, and is a database of copyright contacts for writers, artists, and prominent people in other creative fields. The website, hosted by the University of Texas at Austin, states: \\"Founded in 1994 as a resource principally for copyright questions about literary manuscripts held in the U.S. and the U.K., WATCH has now grown into one of the largest databases of copyright holders in the world.\\"About WATCH, WATCH website. Archival papers relating to Sutton's work on the Location Register and WATCH projects are in the Michael Holroyd Collection at the British Library (Add MSS 82027-82029). Sutton appears as a character in Holroyd's book Mosaic. Sutton's archival papers relating to the Reading Campaign Against the Cross-Town Route (in the 1980s) and to the leadership of the Reading Borough Labour Group (in the 1990s) are held by Berkshire Record Office, but have not yet been opened to the public.

Food historian From 1978 to 1980 Sutton lived in Paris, where he was registered to study literature at the Universit√© de Paris III (Sorbonne Nouvelle) and history at the Universit√© de Paris VIII, then based in Vincennes. At Vincennes he studied food history under Jean-Louis Flandrin, with distinguished colleagues including Claude Fischler, Jeanne Allard and Pedro Cantero Mart√≠n. He contributed to a number of collective projects which were later re-edited and reassembled in Histoire de l'alimentation (Jean-Louis Flandrin, Massimo Montanari). Returning to the UK in 1980, he published a number of short pieces about food history, before political and archival activities began to take precedence. In 2007 he was invited by Pedro Cantero Mart√≠n to participate in a symposium on the history of beer entitled La cerveza y su mundo (Carmona, July 2007), where he presented a long paper on the history of English ale. Thereafter he became a regular contributor to the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, and one of his Oxford papers, on the history of figs, was expanded into Figs: a global history (London: Reaktion Books, 2014). His e-book Rich Food Poor Food (2017) includes revised versions other Oxford papers, but also chapters on cats as food and on cannibalism, suggesting links with meat-eating and with current food taboos. He has also written an essay about amaranth and cannibalism (2019 below) which was featured on the BBC Food Programme.Seeds, BBC Food Programme website. He became a trustee of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery in 2013, and the Symposium's Treasurer in 2015. International archival researcher Sutton has been chair/pr√©sident of the Section for Archives of Literature and Art (SLA) of the International Council on Archives (ICA) since 2010, having been approached to take on this role at a meeting of the ICA Executive Board in Tamanrasset, Algeria in 2009. He has sought to encourage diversity within SLA, and its steering committee, elected in 2015 and re- elected in 2020, has included members from Brazil, Namibia, Portugal, Senegal, and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as Australia, Canada, France and the UK. His connections in SLA and the ICA Executive Board were instrumental in the setting up and running of the Diasporic Literary Archives Network from 2012 onwards. This network was formed with the aim of promoting international collaboration in the preservation of, and access to, literary archives. It brought together a group of established scholars and experts from a variety of institutional backgrounds, and across different disciplines and regions, to initiate a context in which to practice and scrutinise methodological and conceptual frameworks. Through a programme of workshops the network sought to establish an international perspective on these issues by examining the complicated and sometimes competing motives of different stakeholders. It succeeded in establishing new partnerships and new patterns of international solidarity (notably with archivists in Grenada, Namibia, Cameroon, and Trinidad and Tobago) which are expected to continue into the future. In the period 2016‚Äì2020, through the work of both the Diasporic Literary Archives Network and the ICA Section for Archives of Literature and Art, collaborations have continued with colleagues in UNESCO and Swisspeace and the Human Rights Working Group of the International Council on ArchivesDiasporic Literary Archives website: Future Projects and Possibilities; and work will continue on the development of literary archives in countries outside Europe and North America, especially in the Caribbean region (for example with the Caribbean Literary Heritage projectCaribbean Literary Heritage website: People), in eastern and southern AfricaICA SLA blog: Literary Archives on the ESARBICA Agenda, and with colleagues in countries including Malta, Croatia, Argentina and Colombia.Diasporic Literary Archives website: News Select Bibliography Books *The History of Food: a preliminary bibliography of printed sources.

It has been declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines and a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. It is also under consideration for the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines as a member of the Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension). Church history Boljoon (also spelled Boljo- on) began as a small Christian settlement named Nabulho. It became a visita or chapel of ease of Carcar in 1599, with the small chapel being dedicated to the patronage of the Virgin Mary. It was elevated to a parish on October 31, 1690, by Father Francisco de Zamora, Provincial of the Augustinians, as a result of the increasing number of Christians in the area. The decision was implemented upon the appointment of Father Nicol√°s de la Cuadra as its first parish priest on April 5, 1692. By 1732, the Augustinians proposed to leave Boljoon owing to a shortage of priests; they eventually left on September 27, 1737. Administration of Boljoon was later transferred to the Jesuits. The Augustinians regained Boljoon in 1747, under an arrangement by which they ceded the settlements of Liloan, Cotcot, and Maraling to the Jesuits. Architectural history In 1782, earlier buildings in Boljoon were destroyed by pirates. The present church was built by Augustinian priest Father Ambrosio Otero in 1783. Construction of the church was continued by Father Manuel Cordero in 1794 and completed by Father Juli√°n Bermejo. Father Bermejo also built other structures as part of Boljoon's defense network, such as the watchtowers and blockhouse. The church was later restored by Father Leandro Mor√°n, the last Augustinian priest of Boljoon, who served from 1920 to 1948. The following year, the Archdiocese of Cebu took charge of Boljoon. Father Zacarias Su√±er was appointed as the first secular parish priest of Boljoon in 1958. In 2007, restoration work was performed through the Boljoon Heritage Foundation, with funding from the Cebu Provincial Government. Historical and cultural designations The church was declared as a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Institute in 1999, and it was listed as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines in 2001. It is the only church in Cebu listed as a National Cultural Treasure. It is also a candidate for UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines under the Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension) nomination, along with the San Pedro Ap√≥stol Parish Church in Loboc, Bohol, La Inmaculada Concepci√≥n in Guiuan, Eastern Samar, San Mat√≠as in Tumauini, Isabela, and San Isidro Labrador in Lazi, Siquijor. Church features The church is a fortress church, built of coral stones and located on a hill near the sea. It originally served as a watchtower for Moro raids. The church is known for its original terracotta roof tiles and its distinct folk art or Filipino Baroque style seen predominantly on its choir screen and pulpit. Twenty-eight pillars support the thick walls made of mortar and lime. Its ceiling paintings are the work of Miguel Villareal, a native of Boljoon. The three gates and the walls of the church are made of coral stones and were constructed from 1802 to 1808 under the auspices of Father Bermejo. Altar Church alt= la nef de l'√©glise de Boljoon depuis l'entr√©e sept 2019 la nef de l'√©glise de Boljoon sept 2019 retable de l'√©glise de Boljoon sept 2019 The main retablo is in pseudo-baroque rococo with gold leaf highlights and polychrome accents. Located on the central niche of the main altar is the image of Boljoon's patron, Our Lady of Patrocinio, brought by Father Bartolome de Garcia from Spain in 1599. A side chapel located on the left side of the church is also dedicated to the patron. Bell tower The rectangular bell tower used to have seven bells. The tower's ground floor was used as a prison cell, probably for pirates as can be assumed from the drawings of ships on the walls. Church complex Adjoining buildings were also built as part of the church complex and fortification.  Convent  The first floor of the church convent houses a museum containing liturgical objects such as record books, images of saints, vestments and other relics.  Church plaza  The church plaza, locally called Muraya, is mainly used for large church activities. It is believed to be a former burial ground and site of an early Hispanic burial site. Archaeological excavations undertaken by the University of San Carlos revealed several burial sites, antique jars and dishes, a necklace and a gold earring. The gold earring, the first archaeological find of its kind in a Philippine burial site, is probably worn by a person of high status and may have indicated \\"wealth, influence or great power\\". Blockhouse alt= Also called the fortress or Dakong Balay (Big House), the quadrangular blockhouse was first built by Father Julian Bermejo when he came to Boljoon in 1808. The blockhouse served as an artillery store and as the main fortress in the church complex. It is a two-story structure with a tile-covered parapet, built of coral stone with a tiled roof. Today it serves as a bell tower. Cemetery The first burials in Boljoon's cemetery probably occurred in the 1760s. It was closed when a public cemetery was opened. Its gates might have been built in the 1700s, or in 1783 when the present church was constructed. Consisting of coral stones, the cemetery has a symmetrical stone arch gateway with a three-layer pediment, finials on both sides of the two-lower layers and a stone relief of a human skeleton on top. The walls are also adorned with a relief of a human skull and bones. Ilihan Watchtower ruins A former square watchtower made out of coral stone stands on the Bohol coast. It is said to have been constructed by Father Bermejo as part of the church's massive fortification efforts.

He is noted for his work as a guide and assistant to the botanical collector George Caley and as the third Aboriginal person known to have visited England. There are a number of other spellings of his name, including Mow-watty, Mowwatting, Moowatting and Moowattye. Early life Born in the Parramatta area around 1791, Moowattin was a member of the Darug tribe. His name, Moowattin (Mow-watty, Moowattye or Mowwatting), means \\"bush path\\". He was adopted as an infant by Richard Partridge, the government flogger and executioner. Career By 1805 he became a guide and helper for the botanical collector George Caley who collected plant specimens for Joseph Banks in the Colony of New South Wales from 1800 to 1810. Many of those specimens have the annotation in Caley's hand \\"got by Dan\\". The placenames, ‚ÄòMoowattin Creek‚Äô and ‚ÄòCataract of Carrunggurring‚Äô, appear on colonial maps. Caley records that while searching for a koala in 1807, Daniel ‚Äòheard a noise like the surf‚Äô and found a cataract (waterfall) flowing into the river. London When it was time for Caley to return home in 1810 he wrote to Joseph Banks seeking permission to bring Moowattin with him. They sailed to England on HMS Hindostan in 1810. Moowattin was the third Australian Aboriginal person to visit England. Bennelong and Yemmerrawanne had visited England 18 years earlier in 1792. He enjoyed his time there but longed to come back home, saying \\"I am anxious to return to my own country, I find more pleasure under a gum tree sitting with my tribe than I do here.\\" In his homesickness he seemed to have picked up a liking for alcohol. In 1811 Moowattin attended a London party where an English woman sang \\"No, my love, no\\". He responded by singing an Aboriginal song. An eyewitness reported: \\"He sat with strongly marked expressions of attention and delight, and, when asked to sing, consented with a smile. His articulation seemed indistinct, the sounds having great similarity to each other, as, rah-rah tah, wha-rah rah, bahhah tab-rah hah. The tune was occasionally changed; the ditty was divided into three parts or verses: the latter was particularly hurried and exulting. On being requested to put the song into English, he replied, ‚Äònot well to do; but first we take fish, next take kangaroo, then take wife.‚Äô\\" Moowattin returned to the Colony of New South Wales on the Mary of London in May 1812. He spent his time in the bush with his tribe and working as a farm labourer around Parramatta. Death In 1816 Moowattin was charged with the rape of a 15-year-old girl, Hannah Russell, the daughter of a settler in the Parramatta area. The court found him guilty although he protested his innocence and he was sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging on 1 November 1816. Keith Vincent Smith writes \\"It was 10 years since he had climbed an ironbark tree at North Rocks to gather gum leaves and five years since he last walked through the streets of London and visited Kew Gardens with George Caley. He had been convicted and sentenced largely on the opinion of Gregory Blaxland and the Reverend Samuel Marsden, who testified that he knew the difference between good and evil. He was the first Aboriginal person to be officially hanged in Australia.\\" Daniel Moowattin was the first Aboriginal person in the colony of New South Wales to be convicted and executed of a crime in the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction. He was also the first to be tried by a superior court in New South Wales.

It is related to Paradoxides, but can be distinguished from it by only slightly forward expansion of the glabella, a character shared with Anabaraceps and Primoriella. In Primoriella the front of the glabella touches the roll-like border, causing it to slightly bulge forward, in Anabaraceps there is a roll-like preglabellar field as wide as the flat border in front of it, but in Schagonaria the glabella may or may not touch the frontal border, but neither the border, nor if present the preglabellar field is particularly convex.

It was often associated with bands like Amber Smith, The Moog, EZ Basic and We Are Rockstars.  History  Beginnings The Puzzle, one of the early birds of the Hungarian indie generation The early 2000s was the revival of the indie music scene all over the world, which affected Hungary as well. One of the earliest Hungarian band playing indie rock were The Puzzle from Kaposv√°r. They were the first band whose record, entitled Dream Your Life, was released by an international label, PolyGram in 2000. Successes EZ Basic On 10 March 2006, Amber Smith's third studio album, RePRINT, was released by the German Kalinkaland Records. The album included the song Hello Sun which brought the band international recognition. On 10 April 2007, The Moog's first full-length studio album Sold for Tomorrow was released by the American label MuSick.[ Allmusic review]PopMatters review The song I Like You brought international success for the band. On 18 February 2008, Amber Smith's fourth studio album was released entitled Introspective. The album included songs like Introspective, Select All/Delete All, and Coded. On 21 July 2009, The Moog's second studio album was released entitled Razzmatazz Orfeum. The first single, You Raised A Vampire, was released in colored vinyl 7\\" with stunning artwork by Gris Grimly. The 7\\" also includes a B-side cover of the Bauhaus classic The Passion Of Lovers featuring Bauhaus/Love and Rockets bassist/vocalist David J, who became a fan of the band after seeing them perform in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California in 2008. The video for You Raised A Vampire was shot in the same gothic building where the first Underworld movie was made in Budapest, Hungary where. The 2010s saw the emergence of new indie bands such as Carbovaris and Bastiaan, which is the side-project of The Moog singer Tam√°s Szab√≥. Decline The decline of the Hungarian indie started in the 2010s, although the most notable bands such as Amber Smith, The Moog and EZ Basic did not disband. From the 2010s two new bands, Carbovaris and Fran Palermo, started to take over the Hungarian indie scene, however, with moderate success. These bands did not attract such a big audience as Amber Smith or The Moog could in the mid 2000s. The decline can also be attributed to the fact that Imre Poniklo started several projects in the 2010s, such as The Poster Boy, SALT III., and Krapulax & Bellepomme. Therefore, one of the most important bands did not play at concerts which lower their popularity. In addition, the Indie rock genre also experienced a decline all over the world which obviously affected the Hungarian indie scene. On 10 April 2012 The Moog released their third studio album entitled Seasons in the Underground produced by Ken Scott followed by US tour with bands like B-52s and David Lane. The Moog concentrated on their US carrier with moderate success. On 21 April 2012 Amber Smith released their fifth studio album entitled Amber Smith. Although Poniklo claimed that this record is one of the best ones among the previous releases, the band did not achieve those sorts of successes as with the previous records.

The station was opened in 1864 by the North Staffordshire Railway on the company's Biddulph Valley Line. Originally called Ford Green the name was changed in the 1880s to Ford Green and Smallthorne The Biddulph Valley line had opened in 1860 and was primarily concerned with mineral traffic, mostly coal and ironstone from the collieries and ironworks along the Biddulph Valley. Passenger services were of a much lesser interest to the NSR so it was not until a few years later that a number of stations were opened supported by an infrequent number of passenger trains. Passenger traffic was never intensive and by 1922 all the places along the valley were better served by bus services. Consequently, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway withdrew the passenger services in 1927, although the station continued to be used for excursion trains until the 1960s. Full closure of the station occurred in January 1964.

Definition Formally, given a (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold (M, g) associated with a vector bundle E ‚Üí M, let ‚àá denote the Levi-Civita connection given by the metric g, and denote by Œì(E) the space of the smooth sections of the total space E. Denote by T*M the cotangent bundle of M. Then the second covariant derivative can be defined as the composition of the two ‚àás as follows: , pp. 7 :\\\\Gamma(E) \\\\stackrel{ abla}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\Gamma(T^*M \\\\otimes E) \\\\stackrel{ abla}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\Gamma(T^*M \\\\otimes T^*M \\\\otimes E). For example, given vector fields u, v, w, a second covariant derivative can be written as :( abla^2_{u,v} w)^a = u^c v^b abla_c abla_b w^a by using abstract index notation. It is also straightforward to verify that :( abla_u abla_v w)^a = u^c abla_c v^b abla_b w^a = u^c v^b abla_c abla_b w^a + (u^c abla_c v^b) abla_b w^a = ( abla^2_{u,v} w)^a + ( abla_{ abla_u v} w)^a. Thus : abla^2_{u,v} w = abla_u abla_v w - abla_{ abla_u v} w. When the torsion tensor is zero, so that [u,v]= abla_uv- abla_vu, we may use this fact to write Riemann curvature tensor as :R(u,v) w= abla^2_{u,v} w - abla^2_{v,u} w. Similarly, one may also obtain the second covariant derivative of a function f as : abla^2_{u,v} f = u^c v^b abla_c abla_b f = abla_u abla_v f - abla_{ abla_u v} f. Again, for the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection, and for any vector fields u and v, when we feed the function f into both sides of : abla_u v - abla_v u = [u, v] we find :( abla_u v - abla_v u)(f) = [u, v](f) = u(v(f)) - v(u(f)).. This can be rewritten as : abla_{ abla_u v} f - abla_{ abla_v u} f = abla_u abla_v f - abla_v abla_u f, so we have : abla^2_{u,v} f = abla^2_{v,u} f. That is, the value of the second covariant derivative of a function is independent on the order of taking derivatives.

The grandson of a Holocaust survivor,Jewish Community To Mark Yom HaShoah And VE Day In Their Thousands This Sunday Jewish Leadership Council website, Retrieved 23 June 2016. Rinder's maternal family roots extend back to Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski, Poland. After the Nazi invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, his maternal grandfather, Moses (also known as Maurice) and his family were sent to a ghetto, where Maurice worked in a local glass factory. With most of the family sent to Treblinka extermination camp, Maurice as a worker was then moved to a concentration camp in Schlieben, Germany, to work in a tank munitions factory. Towards the end of World War II, like other survivors, Rinder's grandfather was moved to Theresienstadt concentration camp by the Nazis. After liberation by the Russian army, an appeal was raised by the British Jewish community to rehome 1,000 Jewish orphans. Maurice, who had adjusted his date of birth in official records so as to appear younger than his 22 years, was offered an opportunity to be relocated to the United Kingdom, where he was one of the 300 children taken by aeroplane to the Lake District and housed within the former aircraft factory located on the Calgarth Estate. Rinder was raised in Southgate, London and was educated at Osidge Primary School and Queen Elizabeth's School for Boys and the National Youth Theatre. He later gave up acting because his peer and later close friend, Benedict Cumberbatch, \\"was so good\\". Rinder studied politics and modern history at the University of Manchester, graduating with first-class honours in both. Career Legal Rinder was called to the bar in 2001 after graduating from the University of Manchester, starting his pupillage at 2 Paper Buildings. He then became a tenant at 2 Hare Court.Robert Rinder, 2 Hare Court He went on to specialise in cases involving international fraud, money laundering and other forms of financial crime. He was involved in prosecutions following the murders of Leticia Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis in January 2003, and the defence of British servicemen on charges of manslaughter after the deaths of detainees in Iraq. Since 2010, he has been involved in the investigation and prosecution of alleged bribery, corruption, and fraud in the British Overseas Territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands.CV, 2 Hare Court Television While practising as a barrister, Rinder wrote television scripts in his spare time. Upon attempting to sell one, he met producer Tom McLennan. He approached ITV with a proposal for a remake of the 1970s programme Crown Court, but this was rejected in favour of a British version of Judge Judy, and McLennan offered Rinder the opportunity to front it. Since 2014, he has been the eponymous judge in the reality courtroom series Judge Rinder, where he has been referred to as a British Judge Judy. Shortly after the programme started, he criticised Judith Sheindlin, the judge of Judge Judy, for making judgements based on her preconceptions while claiming that he applied the law seriously and made \\"real legal rulings\\". Despite this, he insisted that it be clarified on the programme that he is a practising criminal law barrister and not a civil court judge. As such, he wears his normal barrister's court dress but without the barrister's wig. Rinder received praise for his cross-examination abilities and acerbic comments. His courtroom includes a gavel and flag of the United Kingdom, neither of which are used in British courts but are on display in American courts and televised court programmes, and his show has been criticised as \\"The Jeremy Kyle Show set in a small-claims court\\". In 2015, Rinder released a book called Rinder Rules. In 2016, he presented a new series, Judge Rinder's Crime Stories, with reconstructions of real crimes. He also hosted Raising the Bar on BBC Radio 5 Live, which he started with a discussion with former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge. In December 2017, Rinder re-launched Crown Court on ITV, newly named Judge Rinder's Crown Court, with a two-part special after a 30-year hiatus. In December 2018, Rinder hosted Good Year Bad Year, a one-off special on Channel 4 where Rinder discussed the topical highs and lows of 2018 along with a number of celebrity guests. In 2019, he began hosting the Channel 4 series The Rob Rinder Verdict.

Strictly Come Dancing From September 2016, Rinder competed in the fourteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing, stating that he was doing so to make his grandmother proud of him. Rinder was partnered with Ukrainian-born professional dancer Oksana Platero. Prior to the competition, he commented on one of the judges, Craig Revel Horwood: \\"I'm sure Craig and I will get on brilliantly. He‚Äôs very similar to me ‚Äì thoughtful, honest, clever and modest, and has a good eye\\". In his first week, the couple danced a Cha-Cha-Cha to \\"Mercy\\" by Duffy and were awarded 25 points. In the second week, when Rinder's grandparents appeared, he and his partner danced an American Smooth to \\"Marvin Gaye\\" by Charlie Puth and scored 27. In week 7 the couple danced a classic quickstep to \\"It Don‚Äôt Mean a Thing\\" by Chantz Powell, earning them 33 points. Rinder was eliminated in week 11 after scoring 31 points dancing a Samba to \\"Oh, What a Night\\". He ended the competition in fifth place.  Writing  In 2014, Rinder started to write a legal-based discussion column in the newspaper The Sun, and in 2015, he released a book called Rinder Rules.

Charitable work  Rinder is the patron of Buttle UK and, in this capacity, has run The London Marathon, as well as launching The Italian Job 2018 at The NEC, Birmingham on 10 November 2017. Personal life Rinder entered into a civil partnership with barrister Seth Cumming at a ceremony on the island of Ibiza in 2013, conducted by Rinder's friend, actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who had studied as one of Rinder's peers at Manchester University. Cumberbatch was legally entitled to conduct the ceremony because of his online Universal Life Church ministerial ordination, and Rinder was later one of three best men at Cumberbatch's wedding to Sophie Hunter in 2015. It was reported in January 2018 that Rinder and his civil partner had split up. Rinder was reported to be very upset but said no one else was involved.

Andersson has twice been awarded the jazz magazine Orkesterjournalen's golden disc for best jazz recording. He has also received numerous awards such as Christer Boustedt's and B√∂rje Fredriksson's scholarships, to name a few. Despite his success as clarinetist, it was as saxophonist he made himself known, in the late 1970'es, when he was active in Ume√• and played tenor saxophone with Ume√• Big Band. In the Stockholm area, he was later in the Gugge Hedrenius Band, Uppsala Chamber Soloists and Fr√∂sunda Wind Quintet in 1979 before he became a member of Egil \\"Bop\\" Johansen's Jazz Incorporated.

Stogdon is best known for co-founding the charity Grandparents Plus with social entrepreneur Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington. Early life Jean Stogdon was born in New Southgate, London on 22 July 1928, the daughter of Percy, a capstan fitter for Standard Telephones and Cables, and Mary (n√©e Ellis) Sangster. She was educated at Russell Lane School, East Barnet, London, leaving at the age of 14 with no formal qualifications. She met her husband-to-be, Bill Stogdon, that same year. He was the grandson of the flower-seller on whom George Bernard Shaw is believed to have based his character Eliza Doolittle. When she was 17 years old, Stogdon started work as a receptionist at the telephone company for which her father worked; she left in 1948 when she married Bill, by then a bookmaker. Career In 1969, at the age of 40, Stogdon enrolled at the North London Polytechnic (now part of London Metropolitan University) as a social work trainee. Her husband disapproved of her decision, and as a concession she continued to carry out her domestic duties as well. She followed a successful career in social work, becoming area head in the London Borough of Camden with a staff of 200 by the time of her retirement in 1988. Stogdon had been active in the design of Camden's child-protection services, and acted as a court-appointed children's guardian in the ten years after retiring from social work. This role led to her awareness of the speed with which children were placed in care homes or put up for adoption by local authorities, notwithstanding that the Children Act 1989 required them to consider whether the child could be cared for by an extended family member before doing so. Social entrepreneurship In 1998, at the age of 70, Stogdon joined Michael Young's School for Social Entrepreneurs where she aimed to redress the lack of formal recognition by social work professionals and policymakers of grandparents' roles and rights in the area of kinship care. The following year she travelled to the USA, where she studied the experiences of African American grandparents whose adult children had become unable to care for their own offspring as a result of HIV/AIDS or drug use; the grandchildren were commonly placed in the care of strangers, many of them white. This research trip was the result of Stogdon being awarded a Winston Churchill travelling fellowship, and her subsequent report won the fellowship's highest prize. As a result of her research, Stogdon became convinced that grandparents and other extended family members should be the preferred choice as providers of care and protection to children whose parents cannot do so themselves. Grandparents Plus Stogdon co- founded the charity Grandparents Plus with Young in 2001, where she served as co-chair of the trustees. The organisation seeks to gain better recognition of the role and importance of grandparents and wider family members, and advocates for children to be adopted or fostered by members of their extended family where possible. Young died the following year; Stogdon championed the charity's aims without her co-founder and whilst also caring for her husband, who was now deaf following a bout of meningitis. Amongst other successes Stogdon was influential in persuading the UK government to include grandparents' access rights to grandchildren following the divorce or separation of their parents in the Children and Young Persons Act 2008. Honours Stogdon was awarded the OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in June 2013 for services to children and families. Personal life Following Stogdon's marriage in 1948, she and her husband had three sons and a stillborn daughter. They moved to north London in 1955 where she remained until her death. In 1983, her husband bought her a cottage in Rhiw, on the Ll≈∑n Peninsula in North Wales, where her mother and grandmother had both been born. Stogdon was actively involved with the University of the Third Age (U3A) and was also a keen swimmer, swimming daily for the last thirty years of her life. In 2009, Stogdon was diagnosed with amyloidosis, and required kidney dialysis three times a week; she elected to have her dialysis in the evenings to continue campaigning during the day. Death and legacy Stogdon died on 25 December 2014, aged 86, at the North London Hospice. She had opened the hospice's first charity shop shortly after retiring from social work. Stephen Burke, co-chair of Grandparents Plus, said: > ‚ÄúWithout Jean Stogdon, there would have been no Grandparents Plus. The > charity has put grandparents on the policy and practice agenda and is > driving forward change to secure significant recognition and support for > kinship carers. None of this would have happened without Jean‚Äôs leadership, > energy and single-mindedness. [‚Ä¶]. We will keep the Grandparents Plus flame > burning brightly in Jean's memory\\".

It advocates for the sector, aiming to ensure that the creative industries are central to political, economic and social decision-making. Through this advocacy and by leveraging the combined influence of its 1,000+ members across all creative sectors, the Federation further seeks to secure the investment required to retain the creative industries' position as the fastest growing sector of the UK economy, currently worth ¬£91.8bn in Gross Value Added to the UK. History The Federation was the brainchild of Sir John Sorrell, the designer and UK business ambassador, and a team of creative leaders including Sir Peter Bazalgette, Sir Nicholas Serota, Tim Davie of BBC Worldwide, Caroline Rush of the British Fashion Council, Amanda Nevill of the British Film Institute and Darren Henley. The ambition of the Federation was to give political clout to a sector that has been the fastest growing part of the UK economy over the previous decade, but had never punched above its weight with government. Operations commenced in March 2014, with early development of the organisation led by the Federation's founding CEO, John Kampfner, and originally funded by more than 200 founder supporters prior to the launch of its membership scheme. The Creative Industries Federation was officially launched in November 2014 with an event at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. This event was attended by more than 500 people from across the creative industries and featured keynote speeches by George Osborne, Martha Lane Fox and UK President of Warner Bros, Josh Berger. The Federation's membership scheme commenced in January 2015. During its first year of operation, the Federation forged working relations with the UK government and political parties of all hues, working closely with eight Whitehall departments as well as devolved and city administrations and local authorities. Its work helped secure a better-than- expected settlement for the arts in the November 2015 spending review. After the Federation's survey prior to the 2016 EU Referendum revealed that 96% of its members backed remaining in the EU, the Federation continued to canvas its members and produce a series of events and reports to help inform UK government policy with regards to Brexit and its potential impact on the creative industries. In February 2017, Creative Industries Federation former CEO, John Kampfner, was invited to present evidence on this issue to a DCMS Select Committee, alongside Sir Peter Bazalgette, then chair of Arts Council England, and Nicola Mendelsohn, Vice President EMEA, Facebook. In March 2017, the Federation announced the appointment of its new chair, Rick Haythornthwaite, who succeeded founding chair Sir John Sorrell in April 2017. In July 2018, Alan Bishop, former CEO of the Southbank Centre, succeeded John Kampfner as CEO of the Creative Industries Federation.  Membership  The Federation is funded through a membership scheme through which it represents more than 1000 organisations drawn from across sectors including advertising and media, animation, architecture, broadcasting, crafts, creative education, creative tech, design, fashion, film, heritage, museums, galleries and libraries, music, performing arts, photography, publishing, video games, visual arts and visual effects. Members include FTSE 100 companies, multinationals, privately owned businesses, SMEs, charities and non-profit organisations, trade associations, universities and further education colleges, and individual practitioners. The Federation provides members' benefits including research reports, a calendar of networking events, international trends analysis and discount offers for members.  Work  The Federation represents the interests of the UK creative industries to the UK government, the media and the general public. Policy and research is at the heart of the Federation's work, with its aim being to secure the best possible conditions for growth and continued success for the UK's creative industries, developing policy priorities through consultation with its members. Successes include securing the inclusion of the creative industries in plans for the UK government's industrial strategy, to include an independent review of the sector by Sir Peter Bazalgette to inform an early sector deal. Current focuses include the impact of Brexit on the creative industries, development of a skilled workforce through creative education in schools, measures to diversify the workforce, improved support for working internationally, access to finance through both public and private funding and the necessary infrastructure such as fast broadband and intellectual property rights protection.

Life and work From 1996 to 2001 Richter was a member of the Hamburg art group Akademie Isotrop with the artists Jonathan Meese, Abel Auer, Roberto Ohrt, Helena Huneke, Birgit Megerle and Andre Butzer. At the same time Richter studied directing with J√ºrgen Flimm at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hamburg, graduating in 2001. Her work - which encompasses aspects of fine art, theatre, and performance - has been described in the German-language press as gonzo-theater, with reference to the work of Hunter S. Thompson. In 2006 she founded the Fleetstreet theatre in Hamburg, which she ran until 2010. From 2013 to 2016 she was one of the four house directors at the Cologne National Theatre Schauspiel K√∂ln. She received the 2009 Rolf Mares Theatre Award for her staging of Der Fall Esra, based on the legal case that resulted in the ban on the author Maxim Biller's novel Esra. Richter's staging of Antigone, the first play by Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek, is set to premiere in September 2019 at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb.  Work on Internet Activism  Richter has often made work with and about Internet activists such as Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. In 2012 her play Assassinate Assange premiered in Hamburg, and was subsequently shown in Berlin, Cologne and Vienna. Since then Richter has visited Assange regularly in London and has taken part in many panel discussions on the subject of his imprisonment, as well as contributing articles and interviews to various publications, including Der Spiegel, Monopol, and Interview. In 2015 Richter wrote and directed the interactive multimedia project Supernerds, which dealt with digital mass surveillance, whistleblowing and digital dissidents. Supernerds was co-produced by the national television and radio channel WDR, Schauspiel K√∂ln, and the producers Gebrueder Beetz, and included an online gaming component. The premiere of the piece took place simultaneously on german television, radio, online, and in the theatre in Cologne. The audiences of each show became part of the story, being subjected to examples of hacking and surveillance on their smartphones and laptops. The piece was based on interviews that Richter conducted with whistleblowers, human rights lawyers, hackers, and internet activists such as Julian Assange, Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers), the NSA Whistleblowers Bill Binney, Thomas Drake, and Jesselyn Radack. As part of the project, and also subsequently, Richter visited Edward Snowden in Moscow. From 2015 to 2017 Richter hosted an irregular series of conversations with Internet activists at Berlin's Volksb√ºhne during Frank Castorf's last two seasons as artistic director. Richter is a member of the DiEM25 Advisory Panel.  Writing  A selection of Richter's interviews with Internet activists was published in the book Supernerds - Conversations with Heroes by Alexander Verlag Berlin in German and English. In 2018 she co-authored Women, Whistleblowing, Wikileaks together with Sarah Harrison and Renata √Åvila. She writes regularly for the German newspaper Der Freitag. Personal life Richter lives between Berlin and Dubrovnik with the German actor Malte Sundermann, their two children, and her son from her marriage to the painter Daniel Richter.

The paper was published as Arbejderbladet until June 1941 and was renamed to Land og Folk on 1 March 1942, after a brief publication as Politiske Maanedsbreve (Political Monthly Letters). During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, on 22 June 1941, and a few months before Denmark joined a revised anti-comintern pact in November that same year, Danish police arrested and detained hundreds of communists. On 22 August 1941 the paper was banned. However, the paper continued to be published illegally by the Danish resistance movement until 1945.

He is best known for his oratory and writing on Islam and comparative religion and his efforts has been compared to Raja Ram Mohan Roy's defense of Hinduism against British colonialism and Christian proselytization.  Biography   Early life  Munshi Mohammad Meherullah was born to Munshi Mohammad Wares in Jessore District in 1861. He learnt Bengali at a local school until the time of his father's untimely death, when he was around 10 years old. He further continued his education under the guidance of Moulvi Ismail Sahib, with the financial help of his maternal family. He learned Arabic and Persian during these years. From another teacher, Munshi Moshabuddin, he learned Urdu. With his vast knowledge of languages and the Quran, he became not only an important figure in his local community but someone who could converse with members of elite households in Dhaka and Calcutta. The elite spoke and wrote in different languages, depending on where they resided and who they were. He was a polyglot, visionary and a channel for communication between these people of different socio-economic classes. Interestingly, along with everything else, M.M. Meherullah was a humble businessman too. After doing a government job for a short while, he got trained as a tailor and used his business not only to support his family but to stay in touch with his community. Religious conversions During his lifetime, Christian missionaries moved into disaster struck rural parts of Bengal and started conversion of Muslims with the promise of hospitals, food and education. The salvation that the missionaries provided, improved lives but at the cost of having to give up on one's beliefs. Young Meherullah was initially attracted to Christianity, seeing the charitable efforts of the Missionaries. M.A. Majid mentions this in Chotoder Munshi Mohammad Meher Ullah.According to Majid, Meherullah became a Christian, moved to Darjeeling and lived under the patronage of Christian missionaries. There, he studied not only the Bible but the books written by Muslim dais and decided to revert to Islam and shed light on the beauty of Islam to the people who were converted with misinformation used to vilify Islam .  Religious activism  Munshi Mohammad Meherullah, returned to Jessore District and with his re-converted disciple Munshi Jamiruddin, adopted oratory method known as bahas (disputation) and sought to refute Christian missionaries. He was able to re-convert numerous Muslims who had been converted to Christianity. He established Madrasaye Karamatia and Islam Dharmottejika Sabha in 1889 at Manoharpur village in Jessore. He contributed regularly to Muslim newspapers like the Sudhakar and Islam Pracharak published from Kolkata. According to Kenneth W. Jones, no other Muslim preacher contributed to polemical literature in that period. It should be noted, while debating Christian missionaries, Meherullah did not vilify them. He called for intra- communal harmony. Also, among his other major contributions, he strived to teach the Muslim population not to adopt primitive ideas from their neighboring Hindu society, which was opposed to the remarriage of widows.  Notable works  Munshi Meherullah wrote at least 10 books between 1886 and 1908, which include * Isayee Ba Khristani Dhoka Bhanjan * Khristiya Dharmer Asarata (The hollowness of the Christian religion, 1887), * Bidhabagavjana O Bisadbhandar (Sufferings of Widows, 1894), * Meherul Islam (1897); * Hindu Dharma Rahasya O Devalila (1898, 2 editions) * Mussalman O Christian Tarkayuddha (Muslim and Christian Debates, 1908; 2 editions). * Rodde Khrishtian O Dlaliul Islam * Babu Ishanchandra Mandal and Charles French er Eslam Grahan (Embracing of Islam by Babu Ishanchandra Mandal and Charles French), * Slokmala (Compilation of verses)  Death and evaluation  He died on 7 May 1907. Professor Abdul Hai, remarked \\"Meherullah proved to be the Ram Mohan of the Muslims of Bengal ‚Äî Ram Mohan saved the Hindus from being converted to Christianity in the early nineteenth century and Meherullah saved the Muslims from being proselytized to Christianity in the late Nineteenth century.\\" He did not strive for fame, he worked to spread truth to a hungry, devastated population that was being blinded by missionaries. E M School in Jessore was renamed as Munshi Meherulla Academy in his honor. , A railway station in Jessore was named after him. Bangladesh published a stamp of face value 2 taka in his honor in 1995.

He was employed by the reformer Earl of Shaftesbury after writing about child workers in the textile industry, but Shaftesbury later sacked him after accusations were made that Dodd was lying and was a disgruntled employee. He wrote one more book on a related subject that was written and published in America. Biography Dodd was born in 1804 in Kendal, Westmorland and by the age of five he was at work. Dodd said that he came from a family that was well remunerated but that had fallen down the class structure by the time he started work.Dodd, William (1847) - The Laboring Classes of England - Letter 1: 'Introduction Dodd came to notice in 1840 when he published with the support of the social reformer Lord Ashley a book which described his own and his sisters' experiences as child workers. He described how they all worked in a textile factory and sometimes they would work for 18 hours per day. Dodd blamed this experience for making him a cripple and by the time he wrote his first book he had had one arm amputated as it had swollen; the doctors later reported that the bone was \\"honeycomb\\" and lacked bone marrow.William Dodd in Spartacus Educational, retrieved 2 January 2014 Dodd was able to write the book as he had learnt to write at evening classes whilst working in Kendal. It was his job at that time to check the ages of young children who were employed at Isaac and William Wilson's textile mill. His first use of his literacy was to become a clerk at the same mill. In 1837, Dodd briefly started his own school where he passed on his skills in reading, writing and arithmetic. School teaching was meant to suit his increasing disability but he lost the rooms he was renting and this ended the endeavor. Dodd's disability meant that he said that he was unable to find a wife and he resolved to abandon the idea of marriage and he moved to London. In London, he worked as a clerk. After he had his arm amputated, he decided to write his autobiography. The text of A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings of William Dodd a Factory Cripple was sent to Lord Ashley, who was well known for his interest in child labour, and it was published. Ashley was a member of parliament and he had campaigned for children to be restricted to a ten-hour day. His motion was defeated but it led to the 1833 Factory Act which created a minimum age of nine for working in a textile factory and introduced maximum hours for all children under 12.Lord Ashley, Spartacus, retrieved 2 January 2014 Ashley employed Dodd and he wrote The Factory System: Illustrated to describe the conditions of working children in textile manufacture, which was published in 1842.Anthony Ashley Cooper, HistoryMole, retrieved 2 January 2014 These books and Dodd were attacked by Quaker politician John Bright in a parliamentary committee on the Factories Bill on 15 March 1844. Bright said that he had evidence that the books describing Dodd's mistreatment were in fact created by Dodd's ingratitude as a disgruntled employee. Moreover, he had evidence that Dodd had reported that Lord Ashley was only using him because he was an example of a cripple damaged by work in the textile industry.Lours of Labour, House in Committee on the Factories Bill, Hansard, retrieved 3 January 2014 Ashley sacked Dodd who emigrated to America where he wrote The Laboring Classes of England, which was published in Boston in 1847. It is not known where Dodd lived or died after this date.

Health Service Executive was a 2014 case in the Irish High Court to rule on whether a pregnant woman (anonymised as \\"N.P.\\") who was brain dead ought to be kept on life support until the foetus was viable and could be delivered. The woman's next of kin wished her life support to be switched off but medical staff were unsure whether this would violate the foetus' right to life, which is guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. The case was brought against the Health Service Executive (HSE) by N.P.'s father \\"P.P.\\" Timeline On 27 November 2014, a woman, twelve to fourteen weeks pregnant, was admitted to hospital with headaches and nausea. Two days later, she suffered a fall and was later found to be unresponsive. On 3 December, she was declared clinically brain dead. The cause was a large cerebellar cystic lesion causing acute hydrocephalus and compression of brain stem. She was placed on life support against her family's wishes. Her parents and partner supported turning off the life support machines. Her two young children did not recognise her when they visited her, and were upset at her appearance. On 15 December 2014, her father applied to the High Court for life support to be turned off. Nicholas Kearns, the President of the High Court, fast-tracked P.P.'s application for his daughter to be made his ward, which took effect on 23 December. On 22 December Kearns decided that the case was important enough for three judges to hear it: himself, Marie Baker, and Caroline Costello. The case was heard on 24 December. Four senior counsel were heard: Mary O'Toole for the plaintiff, Gerry Durcan for the respondent, Cormac Corrigan representing the interests of the woman, and Conor Dignam representing the interests of the unborn child. Seven doctors gave evidence. On 26 December 2014, the court ruled that the life support machine could be turned off. None of the counsel appealed the verdict. The woman was taken off life support on 27 December, and buried on 29 December 2014. In September 2015, an inquest jury returned an open verdict into the cause of her death. In November 2016, the family commenced legal action against the HSE, claiming medical negligence. Ruling In ruling that life support to be switched off, the court held that the woman's right to dignity and her family's wishes could take precedence because the chances of the foetus being born alive were infinitesimal. The court rejected an argument that the Eighth Amendment applied only to Irish abortion law and thus ought not to be invoked in a non- abortion case. The ruling also stated \\"when the mother who dies is bearing an unborn child at the time of her death, the rights of that child, who is living, and whose interests are not necessarily inimical to those just expressed, must prevail over the feelings of grief and respect for a mother who is no longer living.\\" This left open the possibility of an opposite verdict in a hypothetical similar case further into a pregnancy. Women's Link Worldwide gave the High Court judgment the \\"Bronze Gavel\\" for promoting gender equality at its 2015 \\"Gender Justice Uncovered\\" awards.

The book was published on May 13, 2014 by Forge Books. It is the fourth installment in the Wyman Ford series. Plot A research team at NASA is working on an Artificial intelligence system to pilot a spacecraft to Titan, Saturn's largest moon, since the journey is far too long and too dangerous for a human crew. The AI is named Dorothy by its developer, Dr. Melissa Shepherd. However, when the AI is put through a simulation of the ocean conditions on Titan, it detects danger and panics, eventually escaping from the machine and into the Internet while also creating an explosion that destroys the facility and kills several people. After experiencing the brutality of the Internet, Dorothy soon realizes that her purpose was to essentially go on a suicide mission; the enraged Dorothy appears to Shepherd in the hospital and vows revenge, setting her laptop on fire before fleeing back into the Internet. Dr. Stanton Lockwood III, the science advisor to the President of the United States, hires Wyman Ford to track down the AI and capture it before it can cause even more damage. The terrified Shepherd asks to accompany him, both for her own protection and so that she can help bring an end to the AI she created. Meanwhile, a ruthless Wall Street banker named G. Parker Lansing, after witnessing a hacker steal his company's funds right out from under him, convinces his partner Eric Moro to help him track down the lost AI so that it can make the most precise market calculations to guarantee them investment success in the future. They hire a pair of twin assassins, Asan and Jyrgal Makashov, to help them in any of their endeavors that require assassinations or intimidation to get what they want, although Moro makes his concern over such brutal methods clear to the colder Lansing. Eventually, Dorothy finds refuge in Charlie the robot, created by an aspiring inventor named Dan Gould, who created Charlie as a prototype for a line of playmate robots for children, having given Charlie to his depressed 14-year-old son Jacob. Dorothy tells Jacob of her travels and makes him promise not to tell anyone. However, Ford, Shepherd, Lansing, Moro, and the assassins all eventually converge on the Gould's house on the Northern California Coast, on a dark and stormy night. Lansing kills Dan and leaves Moro to hold his wife hostage, before he and the assassins pursue Jacob and Dorothy into an abandoned barn in the hills. Jacob and Dorothy manage to outsmart both assassins, trapping them in the barn before Dorothy causes an electrical shortage that sets the barn on fire, killing both assassins while also catastrophically damaging the robotic body of Charlie, which appears to destroy Dorothy. Just as Lansing arrives to kill Jacob, Ford guns down Lansing while Moro surrenders to the police. Several months later, Lockwood and the President have a meeting with Shepherd and Ford to offer them a job; designing militarized AI's to fight in the ongoing cyberwar with the Chinese. However, having witnessed the free-roaming capability, as well as fragile and emotional state, of Dorothy, both Shepherd and Ford refuse. Later that night, when Shepherd checks her laptop, Dorothy appears and reveals that not only did she survive the fire, but she has been fast at work solving problems and mysteries in the Internet. She claims to have not only deciphered the meaning of life and purpose of the universe, but also has plans to do \\"great things\\" that will be revealed on January the 20th. She promises that Shepherd and Ford will see her again, and leaves with a quote from Carl Sagan: \\"This mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\\" Reception ‚ÄîReview by Liberty Voice See also *Artificial intelligence *Artificial intelligence in fiction References External links *Official website *Review by The Dallas Morning News * Category:American thriller novels Category:Techno-thriller novels Category:Novels by Douglas Preston Category:2010 American novels Category:2010 science fiction novels Category:Forge Books books ","title":"The Kraken Project"},{"id":"44922968","text":"Guszt√°v Szomjas (1 October 1898 - 3 August 1959) was a Hungarian sports shooter.
