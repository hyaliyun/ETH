He was a pioneer of Palynology (pollen analysis) and modern settlement archaeology, but is controversial because of his role before and during the period of National Socialism. Life Hans Reinerth was born in Bistritz, Austria- Hungary on 13 May 1900 to a Transylvania Saxon family. Reinerth completed his doctorate in 1921 in T√ºbingen in a short course of study, followed in 1925 by habilitation. The T√ºbingen Prehistoric Research Institute (T√ºbinger Urgeschichtliche Forschungsinstitut ) under the direction of Robert Rudolf Schmidt carried out extensive excavations at the Federsee, where Reinerth soon played an important role. He examined, among other things, the Bronze Age water castle at Buchau, but never published a complete report of the excavation during his life. Reinerth was a member of the v√∂lkisch-minded, anti-Semitic Militant League for German Culture (Kampfbund f√ºr deutsche Kultur) and joined the Nazi Party in 1931. In March 1933 he signed the declaration of 300 professors for Adolf Hitler (Erkl√§rung von 300 Hochschullehrern f√ºr Adolf Hitler). From 1933 until the end of the Second World War Reinerth was head of the Reichsbund f√ºr Deutsche Vorgeschichte. In 1944 he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 1934 Reinerth succeeded Gustaf Kossinna in the chair at the University of Berlin. He became editor of the magazines Germanen-Erbe and Mannus, Zeitschrift f√ºr Deutsche Vorgeschichte and in addition was department head for pre- and early history with the Nationalsozialistischen Kulturgemeinde, the successor organization of the Kampfbund. In 1936 he was instrumental in the construction of the Archaeological Open Air Museum in Oerlinghausen. In 1937 he wrote in the magazine Volk und Heimat: \\"Whoever reviles and depreciates our Germanic ancestors is no longer confronted today with the isolated nationalist fighter but with the united front of all National Socialist Germans.\\"\\"Wer unsere germanischen Vorfahren schm√§ht und herabsetzt, steht heute nicht mehr dem vereinzelten v√∂lkischen K√§mpfer, sondern der geschlossenen Front aller nationalsozialistischen Deutschen gegen√ºber‚Äú In June 1938, with the Gauleiter of Baden Robert Wagner in attendance, Reinerth inaugurated an open-air museum he had designed with fourteen reconstructed Stone Age huts in Radolfzell. In 1939 he was in Alfred Rosenberg's Beauftragter des F√ºhrers f√ºr die √úberwachung der gesamten geistigen und weltanschaulichen Schulung der NSDAP (Amt Rosenberg) in charge of the prehistory department. From 1940 Reinerth served as head of a special prehistory staff for the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce (ERR), which expropriated so-called \\"ownerless cultural property of Jews\\", whose owners had usually been previously killed. In 1941, after the German conquest of Greece, he directed the excavation of a Neolithic settlement in Thessaly, by which he \\"proved\\" that Germans had colonized Greece from the north. Some of the finds were transferred to Germany and surfaced only after his death in his private holdings in Unteruhldingen, from where they were reptriated in 2014 by Gunter Sch√∂bel. In September 1942 Rosenberg assembled a \\"Working Group for Greek-Iranian Antiquity Research in the Occupied Eastern Territories\\", as a branch of the Institute of Indo-European Intellectual History, based in Munich. The research in this area was to be led by Richard Harder. Reinerth, as head of the special prehistory staff, was appointed as his representative in order to strengthen the cooperation between the staff and this working group. In a letter of September 29, 1942 Rosenberg wrote to Harder: > From the 21st of September, 1942 onwards I have tasked Dr. Reinerth with the > identification, protection, and research of pre- and protohistoric Germanic > and Slavic finds and other legacy items in the museums, scientific > institutes, private collections, and other places in the occupied eastern > territories. \\\\- Rosenberg to Harder, Bundesarchiv (Germany), signature NS > 8/265, p. 15‚ÄûVom 21.

The ostensible reason was that he had \\"friendly relations with Jews\\". The real reason was turf war between the Amt Rosenberg and the SS Ahnenerbe, since Reinerth worked for Amt Rosenberg. After the Second World War, Reinerth became director of the Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen, which for a long time provided a very conservative picture of prehistory. He was one of the few archaeologists tainted by National Socialism who could not continue their career in the post-war period. In 1949 he was excluded in a resolution of the scientific community of prehistoric and early historians by colleagues, including several former SS members such as the former SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Herbert Jankuhn, later professor of prehistory and early history in G√∂ttingen, from a meeting in Regensburg because of \\"unobjective and tendentious science of prehistory\\". Between 1954 and 1958 Reinerth was the first chairman of the newly founded Association of German Scuba Divers (Verband Deutscher Sporttaucher-VDST) In 1958 he was appointed Honorary President of the VDST. From 1954 to 1961 he led the underwater research department within the association. During those years Reinerth published several articles in the Delphin, the member magazine of the VDST, on his research on the stilt houses at Unteruhldingen.

The Bard Fort was commanded by Captain Josef Stockard von Bernkopf with approximately 300 Austrian troops and 100 Piedmontese soldiers.  Prelude  On May 13, Napoleon entered the current Italian region of Aosta Valley from the little Swiss town of Bourg- Saint-Pierre. Until May 16, the French had not engaged the Austro-Piedmontese enem but as they entered Aosta, there was light fighting against the Austrian army. The Siege Napoleon's advance began to slow when a force led by generals Dupont and Dufour reached the village of Bard, dominated by a small fort that covered the main routes with the exception of a mule path that was used by Napoleon's advance guard to continue on to Ivrea. On the evening of May 20, Dupont demanded the surrender of Stockard Von Bernkopf, commander of the Austrian company in the fort, who refused. In the meantime, French engineers widened and filled in the holes in the mule path to allow the rest of the army to continue, with the exception of the artillery. On the night of May 21 the village of Bard was conquered by the French army, which proceeded to surround the fort. On May 22 three Austrian cannons captured after the battle of Ch√¢tillon started to fire on the fort, dealing little to no damage. In the morning of May 26, the fort was attacked by 300 grenadiers in order to distract the garrison from a smaller force that tried to cross the Dora river. The defenders killed or wounded more than 200 of the grenadiers. General Dufour died while trying to cross the river on a raft. Napoleon himself was worried by the tenacious resistance of the defenders, and the advance of an enemy army coming from Piedmont. On May 27, Napoleon ordered a division commanded by Joseph Chabran to besiege the fort, and continued on with the rest of the army, rejoining his advance guard. A regiment of 1,243 riflemen led by 119 officers started to attack the fort, but the hidden French support cannons were too small to do serious damage to the building. The siege until May 29, where a 12-inch cannon named \\"cannone di Andreossi\\" (Andreossi's cannon in Italian) was positioned in the church behind the fort, where it could not be seen by the enemy. On June 1, the cannon began to fire on the fort, destroying a part of its walls. At the end of the day, Bernkopf surrendered, having lost half of his forces. The Italians were allowed to leave the fort with the honours of war before being made prisoner, as was custom at the time after a besieged force had surrendered.http://www.napoleonbonaparte.eu/1800-05-19-forte-di-bard.html Aftermath The Fort, called by Napoleon \\"vilain castel de Bard\\" (evil castle of Bard in French)http://www.marengomuseum1800.com/sala_5-6_testi.html was destroyed completely by Napoleon, only being rebuilt in 1830 by Charles Albert of Savoy. The surprise attack at the Austro-Piedmontese forces on the Po river in Lombardy planned by Napoleon was delayed. Napoleon later took over Piedmont and Lombardy by defeating the Austrians in the Battle of Marengo.

Although the Sui dynasty preceded the Tang, it was extremely short lived, ending in 618. The two dynasties share many similar trends and behaviors in terms of military tactics, strategy, and technology. It can therefore be viewed that the Tang continued the Sui tradition, or that the Sui set the precedent for the Tang dynasty. Organization The ten jiedushi in 745 The 48 buffer towns in 820 The Sui dynasty inherited the Twenty-four Armies from the Northern Zhou. The system of recruitment that created these armies would come to be known as fubing, or \\"territorial soldiery\\". Fubing soldiers were originally recruits drawn from the old military households of previous dynasties. Unlike the mass conscription of the Han dynasty, these soldiers were promised tangible rewards such as exemption from taxes and labor for their families. Later on, these soldiers were formed into units presiding over a plot of land on which they would farm while off duty to support themselves. At its height under the Tang dynasty, some 600 units of fubing were maintained, each with 800 to 1,200 soldiers. During the Sui dynasty, the fubing answered only to local administration, but the Tang implemented a centralized Ministry of the Army to which fubing units were answerable to. Each unit was further subdivided into battalions of 200, platoons of 50, and squads of 10. They rotated in and out of the capital for guard duty and training depending on their distance to it. Those nearest to it served one month in five, those furthest from it, two months out of every eighteen. Some men were assigned to three year tours in frontier garrisons. Deployment of the fubing units was monopolized by the court through the use of bronze tallies with the names of each unit on them. Half of the tally was kept at the Credentials Office while the other half was kept at unit headquarters. Only when the two halves were joined together could a unit be mobilized. While the fubing was well suited to local conflicts and short term campaigns, its shortcomings became apparent in the late 7th century as protracted wars and the needs of permanent static defense took their toll. The initial benefits of entering the system wore off as more men died in wars in far off lands, never to return. The military structure was not suited to properly reward soldiers who performed meritorious service in battle. Many who were supposed to be rewarded and compensated were not. Families of dead soldiers were also not compensated properly, resulting in reduced morale, and widespread desertion as well as dereliction of duty. The geographical distribution of fubing units was highly unevenly distributed, with the northwestern part of the empire shouldering most of the burden, while two thirds of the empire contained not even one unit of fubing. With so many units concentrated in one region, the government found it difficult to find enough farm land for their soldiers, who also competed with regular farmers under the equal-field system. The fubing system was gradually replaced with a standing army. First, frontier garrisons were taken over by permanent troops known as jian'er in 677. In 710, frontier forces were bolstered to withstand invasions without the help of levied troops. Nine frontier commands were established, each with their own defense army and military governor, the jiedushi. In 737, the court decided to replace irregular troops entirely with permanent soldiers, recruited from volunteers in the general population. The fubing system was abolished in 749. The shift to a permanent army resulted in a sevenfold increase in the defense budget, from two million strings of copper cash in 712 to twelve million in 742, and then fifteen million by 755. By 742 the frontier had been organized into ten regional military commands. Nine were headed by jiedushi. The post of jiedushi was an imperial commissionership with authority over the military, public revenue, and state lands. In essence, it was a provincial governorship. One jiedushi eventually rebelled in 755, causing the An Lushan Rebellion. Despite its defeat in 763, the number of jiedushi proliferated in response to the rebellion and had increased to approximately 40 by the end of the rebellion. The Tang court failed to reign in the northeastern jiedushi, who were functionally independent warlords, in particular and the balance of power seesawed between the two forces until the Huang Chao rebellion from 874 to 884. The Tang dynasty then collapsed. Army operation According to the Tongdian (Comprehensive Canons), an expeditionary army consisted of 20,000 men in seven divisions of 2,600 or 4,000 men. Only 14,000 were actual combat troops while the rest guarded the baggage train. Of those 14,000, there were 2,000 archers, 2,000 crossbowmen, 4,000 cavalry, and the rest regular foot soldiers. Twelve thousand men were to be provided with armour. The basic operational tactical unit was a platoon of 50 men, fixed five ranks deep. It had five officers: commander, deputy, standard-bearer, and two color guards. For every six platoons, one guarded the baggage train. When the entire army was deployed, the troops were formed into two lines with cavalry at their flanks. Movements were communicated with drums and gongs. Drum beats to advance and gongs to halt. Directions came from five flags, each with a different color to indicate the five directions. When two flags were crossed, it signaled for the platoons to combine into a larger formation. The Tang army also made use of scouts on campaign. A pair of scouts were sent out for each of the four directions at different distances. Two at five li, another two at ten li, and so on until they reached 30 li. Military examination In 702, Wu Zetian introduced military examinations for the recruitment of military officers. Examinees were tested on their skill with the bow and arrow, cavalry lance, as well as physical strength and command \\"presence\\". The imperial military exams had very little effect on the composition of the officer corps. While local military exams were administered, the final decision came down to the military governors, whose personnel appointments were routinely approved by the court. For example, at the beginning of 755, An Lushan replaced 32 Han Chinese commanders with his own barbarian favorites without any repercussions. Equipment Sui (581‚Äì618) The Sui dynasty made prodigious use of heavy cavalry and both men and horses were often heavily armoured. The Book of Sui provides an account of the \\"first cavalry battalions\\" of the dynasty's Twenty- four armies. They wore \\"bright-brilliant\\" (mingguang) armour made of decarburized steel connected by dark green cords, their horses wore iron armour with dark green tassels, and they were distinguished by lion banners. Other battalions were also distinguished by their own colors, patterns, and flags, but neither the bright-brilliant armour or iron armour are mentioned.

In one instance Li Shimin's cousin, Li Daoxuan, was able to cut his way through the entire enemy mass of Xia soldiers and then cut his way back again, repeating the operation several times before the battle was won, at which point he had so many arrows sticking out of his armour that he looked like a \\"porcupine.\\" The effective range of a composite bow against armoured troops in this era was considered to be around 75 to 100 yards. Li Shimin's elite cavalry forces were known to have worn distinctive black \\"iron clad\\" armour, but heavy cavalry declined as Turkic influence became more prevalent and light cavalry became the dominant mode of mounted warfare. Tang expeditionary forces to Central Asia preferred a mixture of light and heavy Chinese horse archers. After the An Lushan rebellion of the mid 8th century and losing the northwestern pastures to the Tibetans, Chinese cavalry almost disappeared altogether as a relevant military force. Many southern horses were considered too small or frail to carry an armoured soldier.

Armour could be manufactured natively or captured as a result of war. For instance 10,000 suits of iron armour were captured during the Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War. In the early Tang period when the fubing system was still active, soldiers were supposed to supply themselves with clothing and weapons at the outset of a campaign. However, after the fubing system was replaced with permanent soldiers known as jian'er in the late 7th century, the Tang government began supplying them themselves. Armour and mounts, including pack animals, were supplied by the state through state funds, and thus considered state property. Private ownership of military equipment such as horse armour, long lances, and crossbows was prohibited. Possession was taken as intent of rebellion or treason. The army staff kept track of armour and weapons with detailed records of items issued. If a deficiency was discovered, the corresponding soldier was ordered to pay restitution. The state also provided clothing and rations for border garrisons and expeditionary armies. Soldiers not on active duty were expected to pay for themselves, although \\"professional\\" soldiers were given tax exemptions. Officers, however, were permanently employed.

The dao, a single edged blade (saber), was separated into four categories during the Tang dynasty. These were the Ceremonial Dao, Defense Dao, Cross Dao, and Divided Dao. The Ceremonial Dao was a court item usually decorated with gold and silver. It was also known as the \\"Imperial Sword\\". The Defense Dao does not have any specifications but its name is self-explanatory. The Cross Dao was a waist weapon worn on the belt, hence its older name, the Belt Dao. It was often carried as a sidearm by crossbowmen. The Divided Dao, also called a Long Dao (long saber), was a cross between a polearm and a saber. It consisted of a 91 cm blade fixed to a long 120 cm handle ending in an iron butt point, although exceptionally large weapons reaching 3 meters in length and weighing 10.2 kg have been mentioned. Divided daos were wielded by elite Tang vanguard forces and used to spearhead attacks. Crossbow Illustration of a rectangular Tang volley fire formation using crossbows. From Li Quan ÊùéÁ≠å, Shen ji zhi di tai bai yin jing Á•ûÊ©üÂà∂ÊïµÂ§™ÁôΩÈô∞Á∂ì, ca. 759. After the Han dynasty, the crossbow lost favor until it experienced a mild resurgence during the Tang dynasty, under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen. Li Jing and Li Quan prescribed 20 percent of the infantry to be armed with standard crossbows, which could hit the target half the time at a distance of 345 meters, but had an effective range of 225 meters. Spearmen were all supposed to carry a bow and crossbowmen and armed with halberds for self- defense, but it's not clear how well this worked in practice. During the An Lushan Rebellion the Tang general Li Guangbi successfully deployed a spear crossbow formation against the rebel cavalry forces under Shi Siming. In 756 Shi Siming raced ahead of the main army with his mounted troops to intercept Li Guangbi's Shuofang army near the town of Changshan. Li took Changshan in advance and set up his men with their backs to the town walls to prevent a sneak attack. The spearmen formed a dense defensive formation while 1,000 crossbowmen divided into four sections to provide continuous volley fire. When Shi's cavalry engaged Li's Shuofang army they were completely unable to close in on his troops and suffered heavy losses, forcing a withdrawal. The concept of continuous and concerted rotating fire, the countermarch, may have been implemented using crossbows as early as the Han dynasty, but it was not until the Tang dynasty that illustrations of the countermarch appeared. The 759 CE text, Tai bai yin jing (Â§™ÁôΩÈô∞Á∂ì) by Tang military official Li Quan (ÊùéÁ≠å), contains the oldest known depiction and description of the volley fire technique. The illustration shows a rectangular crossbow formation with each circle representing one man. In the front is a line labeled \\"shooting crossbows\\" (ÁôºÂº©) and behind that line are rows of crossbowmen, two facing right and two facing left, and they are labeled \\"loading crossbows\\" (ÂºµÂº©). The commander (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç) is situated in the middle of the formation and to his right and left are vertical rows of drummers (Èºì) who coordinate the firing and reloading procedure in procession: who loaded their weapons, stepped forward to the outer ranks, shot, and then retired to reload. According to Li Quan, \\"the classics say that the crossbow is fury. It is said that its noise is so powerful that it sounds like fury, and that's why they named it this way,\\" and by using the volley fire method there is no end to the sound and fury, and the enemy is unable to approach. Here he is referring to the word for \\"crossbow\\" nu which is also a homophone for the word for fury, nu. The encyclopedic text known as the Tongdian by Du You from 801 CE also provides a description of the volley fire technique: \\"[Crossbow units] should be divided into teams that can concentrate their arrow shooting.... Those in the center of the formations should load [their bows] while those on the outside of the formations should shoot. They take turns, revolving and returning, so that once they've loaded they exit [i.e., proceed to the outer ranks] and once they've shot they enter [i.e., go within the formations]. In this way, the sound of the crossbow will not cease and the enemy will not harm us.\\" Large mounted crossbows known as \\"bed crossbows\\" were used as early as the Warring States period. Mozi described them as defensive weapons placed on top the battlements. The Mohist siege crossbow was described as humongous device with frameworks taller than a man and shooting arrows with cords attached so that they could be pulled back. By the Han dynasty, crossbows were used as mobile field artillery and known as \\"Military Strong Carts\\". Around the 5th century AD, multiple bows were combined together to increase draw weight and length, thus creating the double and triple bow crossbows. Tang versions of this weapon are stated to have obtained a range of 1,160 yards, which is supported by Ata-Malik Juvayni on the use of similar weapons by the Mongols in 1256. According Juvayni, Hulagu Khan brought with him 3,000 giant crossbows from China, for the siege of Nishapur, and a team of Chinese technicians to work a great 'ox bow' shooting large bolts a distance of 2,500 paces, which was used at the siege of Maymun Diz. Constructing these weapons, especially the casting of the large triggers, and their operation required the highest order of technical expertise available at the time. They were primarily used from the 8th to 11th centuries. Mail armour Mail was already known to the Chinese since they first encountered it in 384 AD when their allies in the nation of Kuchi arrived wearing \\"armor similar to chains\\". However they did not procure a suit of mail until 718 AD when Central Asians presented to the Tang emperor a coat of \\"link armour\\". Mail was never used in any significant numbers (typically belonging to high ranks and those who could afford it) and the dominant form of armour continued to be lamellar. Mountain pattern armour References to mountain pattern armour () appear as early as the Tang dynasty, but historical texts provide no explanation or diagram of how it actually worked. There are also no surviving examples of it. Everything that is known about mountain pattern armour comes from paintings and statues, typically of the Song and Ming periods. It is not unique to China and has been found in depictions in Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and even Thailand, however non-religious depictions are limited to only China, Korea, and Vietnam. Reconstruction projects of this type of armour have largely failed to produce good results. The current theory is that this type of armour is made from a multitude of small pieces of iron or steel shaped like the Chinese character for the word \\"mountain\\" (Â±±). The pieces are interlocked and riveted to a cloth or leather backing. It covers the torso, shoulders and thighs while remaining comfortable and flexible enough to allow movement. Also during this time, senior Chinese officers used mirror armour () to protect important body parts, while cloth, leather, lamellar, and/or Mountain pattern armor were used for other body parts. This overall design was called \\"shining armor\\" ().

In 585, Ishbara Qaghan was defeated by Sui forces at the Baidao Pass, near modern Hohhot. In the summer the T√ºrks returned and killed the Sui commander in Youzhou. Western Liang (587) In 587, the Sui dynasty annexed Western Liang and began preparations for an invasion of the Chen dynasty. Chen dynasty (588‚Äì589) War vessels were built in Donghai Commandery, Qichun, and Yong'an. The largest ships were the Five-Banner ships that had five decks and were capable of accommodating 800 men. They were armed with six 50-foot-long, spike-bearing booms, that could be dropped vertically onto enemy vessels to pin them down for missile fire. The second largest class were known as Yellow Dragons and could carry 100 men each. Other smaller crafts also existed. By the late fall of 588, the Sui dynasty had marshaled three fleets and five armies along the Changjiang, in total some 518,000 men. The Chen dynasty had perhaps 100,000 men. In the winter, Yang Su led his fleet downstream from Yong'an. They encountered at Wolf Tail's rapids a Chen fleet of 100 Green Dragon ships with support from several thousand men in palisade forts on north and south banks. Yang Su waited until night time before launching a three pronged attack on the Chen position. He himself took a large portion of the fleet past the palisades while two land columns attacked the palisades. The attack was a success and all the Chen troops were taken prisoner. Further downstream at Qiting, the Chen general L√º Zhongsu had stretched three iron chains across the river. The initial Sui offensives were met with failure and suffered some 5,000 casualties. Finally a night attack succeeded in overcoming the Chen defenses and the chains were removed. L√º Zhongsu fled with his fleet to Yan Island beneath Mount Jingmen, but the Sui sent four Five-Banner ships and chased them down. Using the spiked booms, the Sui ships were able to destroy a dozen Chen vessels, leading to the surrender of the Chen fleet. Chen commander Chen Huiji tried to bring 30,000 men down the Changjiang but was blocked by Yang Jun at the confluence of the Han River. On 22 January 589, Sui commander Heruo Bi crossed the Changjiang from Guangling with 8,000 men. The move came as a complete surprise to Chen forces on the southern bank due to a series of deceptions by Heruo Bi involving pretending to rotate soldiers and conducting practice hunts. The Chen forces could not stop the crossing since the majority of their fleet was concentrated at Jiankang. Heruo took Jingkou on 27 January. Meanwhile, a crack force of 500 men under Han Qinhu slipped across the Changjiang upstream of Jiankang and captured Caishi. They were then reinforced with 20,000 men. On 10 February 589, a Chen army met with Heruo's forces east of Jiankang, but of the five contingents, only one under Lu Guangda was willing to attack Heruo. Heruo was pushed back and his army suffered 273 casualties. Seeing that the situation was turning against him, Heruo set fire to the grass and escaped under cover of smoke. He then attacked another Chen division and routed it. The defeat reverberated throughout the entire Chen army, causing a general rout. While the battle was taking place, Han Qinhu approached Jiankang, which surrendered without a fight. General Yang Guang had the Chen ruler write letters of submission for his generals to follow, which most of them did. Wang Shiji's fleet moved south from Qichun to receive their surrender. The only commander to offer any significant resistance was the governor of Wu Commandery. He was defeated by a two pronged attack from overland by Yang Guang and oversea by Yan Rong. In late 590, a large rebellion occurred at Lake Tai in response to rumors that the Sui government was planning on relocating hundreds of thousands of northerners to the north. The rebellion spread south all the way to present-day Vietnam. However the rebel forces suffered several defeats to Yang Su and his commander Shi Wansui. The rebellion was eventually ended when Yang Su persuaded one of the two primary rebel leaders to turn on his colleague and hand him over to the Sui in return for his own life. Demobilization On 16 June, 590, it was decreed that the Twenty-four Armies would be demobilized and registered under the Equal- field system. On 12 April 595, it was decreed that all weapons in the empire and any southern boat longer than 30 feet would be confiscated. Cuanman (593‚Äì602) In 593, the Cuanman rebelled in Yunnan. A punitive expedition was launched in 597 and the Cuanman were defeated in 602. 1st Goguryeo (598) Tributary envoys from Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla. Painting produced 7th century AD by Yan Liben (c. 600‚Äì673). 1st Goguryeo-Sui War, 598 In early 598, Goguryeo and the Mohe people raided Sui territory. The Sui retaliated with a 300,000 strong army on 4 August. Due to torrential rains, food shortage, and sickness, the army withdrew in October. A waterborne invasion from Shandong encountered storms and lost many of its vessels. 2nd G√∂kt√ºrks (599) In 599, Tardu attacked the Sui dynasty but was defeated by Yang Su. Early L√Ω dynasty (602) In 602, Sui forces under Liu Fang annexed the Kingdom of V·∫°n Xu√¢n ruled by the Early L√Ω dynasty. Emperor Yang of Sui (604‚Äì618) Champa (605) In 605, Sui forces under Liu Fang invaded Champa. The Champan army fielded elephants against the Sui army. Liu Fang had his soldiers dig pits and cover them with grass. When the elephants blundered into them while chasing a feigned flight, the Sui forces turned around and shot the elephants with crossbows. The elephants stampeded into the Champans and routed their own army. Liu Fang went on to sack the Champan capital but died from disease on the way back. Tuyuhun (608) In 608, Sui forces defeat the Tuyuhun, a people of mixed Xianbei and Qiang descent in modern Qinghai Province. 2nd Goguryeo (612) 2nd Goguryeo-Sui War, 612 Emperor Yang of Sui began preparations for a campaign against Goguryeo in 610 when he imposed a new tax on wealthy families to purchase horses for his army. He officially announced the expedition on 14 April 611. Three hundred seagoing vessels were constructed in Donglai and 10,000 marines were transferred from the southern river systems to crew them. In addition to the regular forces, 30,000 javelin-men were recruited from Lingnan and 30,000 crossbowmen as well. On 1 June, the emperor arrived in Zhuo Commandery, south of modern Beijing. Connecting this location to the Huai River was the Yongji canal, which allowed the buildup of military materiel. Craftsmen in were ordered to construct 50,000 carts to transport clothing, armour, and tents. Some 600,000 men were mobilized to move wheelbarrows of grain northeast of Zhuo Commandery. According to the History of Sui, the combined 30 armies gathered for the expedition numbered 1,133,800 combat troops, and another two million serving in logistical capacity. David Graff gives a reduced estimate of 600,000 for the land forces and another 70,000 for the fleet. On 8 February 612, the vanguard began their march for Goguryeo. They reached the Liao River on 19 April. The Sui army made two attempts to cross the river before succeeding and defeated the Goguryeo army arrayed before them. Emperor Yang besieged Ryotongseong (near modern Liaoyang). Meanwhile, the Sui fleet under Lai Huer set sail from Donglai and entered the Taedong River, arriving near Pyeongyang by the middle of July. They defeated a Goguryeo force and laid siege to Pyeongyang with 40,000 men. The defenders feigned flight, luring the invaders past the outer walls into an ambush, and drove them back to their ships with heavy losses. Lai remained on the coast for the rest of the campaign. The fortress of Ryotongseong had not fallen and the siege was taking too long, so Emperor Yang sent nine of the thirty armies ahead with 100 days' supply of grain. However, by the time they had reached the Yalu River, most of the provisions had been spent. Some of the soldiers stored the grain underground because they could not bare the burden. One of the army commanders, Yuwen Shu, suggested that they retreat, but Yu Zhongsheng, who was in overall command refused. Eventually they were forced to retreat due to lack of provisions, but as the nine armies were crossing the Sa River, a strong attack by Goguryeo inflicted immense casualties on the units remaining on the southern bank. On 27 August, Emperor Yang received news of the defeat and called off the campaign. 3rd Goguryeo (613) On 28 January 613, Emperor Yang of Sui ordered a new army to be gathered at Zhuo Commandery. The new army crossed the Liao River on 21 May and laid siege to Ryotonseong while another column attacked Sinseong (near modern Fushun). Yuwen Shu and Yang Yichen attacked Pyeongyang. On 20 July, news of a rebellion by Yang Xuanguan at Liyang reached Emperor Yang, forcing him to withdraw. Yang Xuanguan (613) Transition from Sui to Tang (613‚Äì628) Transition from Sui to Tang (613‚Äì628) On 25 June 613, Yang Xuangan rebelled in Liyang. He laid siege to Luoyang for several weeks before giving up and fleeing further west where he was killed by Sui forces. 4th Goguryeo (614) On 4 April 614, Emperor Yang of Sui ordered a new campaign against Goguryeo. The new army arrived on the Liao River on 27 August but failed to make any headway against the border fortresses. Lai Huer crossed the Bohai Sea and defeated a Goguryeo army. Yeongyang of Goguryeo sued for peace and Emperor Yang declared victory, withdrawing across the Liao. 3rd G√∂kt√ºrks (615) In the summer of 615, Emperor Yang of Sui was surrounded at Yanmen Commandery by Shibi Khan, but managed to escape after machinations at the G√∂kt√ºrk court caused them to retreat. Transition from Sui to Tang After failing to defeat Goguryeo several times over, the Sui dynasty erupted into war among several competing factions. By the summer of 618, there emerged nine major contenders for power: *Dou Jiande, \\"King of Changle/Xia\\", who occupied central Hebei *Du Fuwei, occupied the region between the Huai River and the Changjiang *Li Mi, \\"Duke of Wei\\", who occupied Henan *Li Yuan, \\"Emperor of Tang\\", who occupied Taiyuan and Chang'an *Liang Shidu, \\"Emperor of Liang\\", who occupied Shuofang Commandery *Liu Wuzhou, who occupied Mayi Commandery *Wang Shichong, who occupied Luoyang *Xiao Xian, \\"Emperor of Liang\\", who occupied the region south of the Changjiang *Xue Ju, \\"Hegemon King of Western Qin\\", who occupied eastern Gansu Battle of Yanshi (618) Li Mi advanced on Wang Shichong in Luoyang in 618. On 4 October, Wang Shichong sortied out with 20,000 of his elite troops and bypassed Li Mi's forward positions. He advanced deep into enemy territory and engaged with Li's 40,000 strong army the next day. Wang sent several hundred cavalry across the canal to skirmish with Li's general Shan Xiongxin while he built bridges to cross the canal. The two sides disengaged when night set in, but Wang deployed his forces in the darkness and set up offensive formations near the enemy camp. When Li's camp became aware this, they tried to set up defensive positions, but it was already too late. Wang's army struck them before they had finished deploying while horsemen set fire to their tents. Li escaped with 10,000 men and fled to Li Yuan in the west. His forces were either killed or surrendered to Wang Shichong. Battle of Qianshuiyuan (618) On 6 August 618, Xue Ju inflicted a serious defeat on Tang forces at the first battle of Qianshuiyuan, forcing them back to Chang'an. The Tang general, Li Shimin, returned in September, at which point Xue Ju had already died. His son Xue Rengao was now in command. From the fortified camp near Gaozhe, Li sent small units to skirmish with the enemy but refused to commit his whole army to battle. After some sixty days, Xue's army ran out of supplies and his generals started defecting to the Tang side. At this point, Li sent out two detachments in succession to lure out the enemy army. While Xue's army was engaged with the vanguard detachments, Li attacked with the rest of the army from another direction. The result was complete victory and Xue Rengao's surrender on 30 November. Du Fuwei (619) Du Fuwei surrendered to the Tang in 619. Battle of Jiexiu (619‚Äì620) Liu Wuzhou and his general Song Jin'gang attacked Taiyuan and the Fen River valley in late autumn of 619. Li Shimin countered them by building a strong fortified camp at Bobi. Li avoided any major confrontations, and like the previous battle at Qianshuiyuan, he sent out small units to skirmish with the enemy. After a confrontation lasting several months, the Liu army under Song ran out of supplies. In the middle of May 620, Li gave chase and demolished the opposing force in a piecemeal fashion, taking them apart from 21 May to 1 June. In the final battle, Li sent troops to pin the left and right flanks before driving his elite cavalry into the center line for a decisive blow. Liu Wuzhou fled to the T√ºrks. Battle of Hulao (621) Battle of Hulao Li Shimin began his advance on Wang Shichong's Luoyang in August 620 with 50,000 men. By the end of the month he had fortified the hills approaching Luoyang and territories to its north and south. He also occupied the strategic pass of Huanyuan, triggering a number of defections from Henan to the Tang side, reducing Wang's territory to just Luoyang, Xiangyang, and Xuzhou. Li defeated Wang's army several times outside the walls of Luoyang and enacted a blockade on the city. By the spring of 621, the inhabitants of Luoyang had been reduced to starvation and cannibalism. Wang tried to make a break for it on 11 March, but failed and lost several thousand men. Meanwhile, Dou Jiande saw an opportunity to defeat both the Tang army and eliminate Wang Shichong at the same time. In April 621, Dou marched for Luoyang with 100,000 soldiers. Li Shimin broke off from the main army with a light column to block Dou's advance at Hulao Pass. Li occupied the towns and hills above the pass and refused to engage with the enemy army. In late May, Li sent cavalry forces to raid Dou's supply line. Dou responded with an attack on Hulao Pass on 28 May. He deployed his army in front of the Yellow River facing the enemy position and the two sides sent cavalry to skirmish in the early morning. Dou's army wavered at the sight of a strong cavalry offensive and attempted to withdraw to a more defensible position. Seeing weakness in the enemy lines, Li personally charged in with a detachment of light cavalry and cut off their retreat. The main body of the Tang army followed up and collapsed on the opposing force. Dou was injured by a lance and captured. Wang Shichong surrendered on 3 June. Battle of Jiangling (621) Beginning in 620, Tang forces under Li Xiaogong made preparations for an invasion of Xiao Xian's territory. Together with Li Jing, Li Xiaogong launched a river campaign in the autumn of 621. They defeated the Xiao fleet at the mouth of the Qing River and proceeded to defeat the Xiao army outside the walls of Jiangling. Xiao Xian capitulated on 10 November. Rebellions (621‚Äì624) When Dou Jiande was executed in June 621, his former generals elected Liu Heita as their leader and rebelled. Xu Yuanlang, a Shandong bandit chief also joined them in rebellion. They were both defeated by spring of 623. Du Fuwei's lieutenant Fu Gongshi also rebelled. He was crushed in the spring of 624. G√∂kt√ºrks 1st Eastern Turkic Khaganate (623‚Äì626) From 623 to 626, Illig Qaghan carried out raids across the northern Tang frontier. In 624, Illig and his nephew Ashina Shibobi planned on a major invasion of the Tang, but Li Shimin convinced Shibobi not to invade, so the campaign ground to a halt. In 626, only a few weeks after Emperor Taizong of Tang took power, the T√ºrks approached the northern bank of the Wei River, near Chang'an. On 23 September, Taizong agreed to a payment of tribute to the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. Liang Shidu (628) In 628, an ally of the Turks, Liang Shidu, was killed by his cousin who surrendered to the Tang. 2nd Eastern Turkic Khaganate (629‚Äì630) Tang campaign against the Eastern Turks (629‚Äì630) Preparations for a campaign against the Eastern Turkic Khaganate were completed by the autumn of 629. Emperor Taizong of Tang contacted the Xueyantuo north of the Gobi Desert and made an alliance with them. On 11 September, Li Jing was appointed commander-in-chief of the expeditionary army. On 13 December, he commenced the offensive operation. Six Tang armies marched against the Eastern Turks. Li Jing marched north from Mayi toward Dingxiang, where Illig Qaghan was encamped. Li Jing occupied the ridge south of Dingxiang with 3,000 light cavalry. At night, the Tang forces attacked Dingxiang and penetrated the outer wall, forcing Illig to flee north to a place called Iron Mountain. Meanwhile, Li Shiji's forces joined Li Jing at Baidao Pass. Illig tried to sue for peace. As negotiations were underway, Li Jing and Li Shiji made a surprise attack on Illig's camp on 27 March 630. The T√ºrks were caught unaware and a one sided massacre ensued where some 10,000 T√ºrks were killed. Illig was able to escape but was later caught and handed over to Tang officers on 12 May 630. The surrendered T√ºrks were settled on the marginal borderlands of the Tang between them and the Xueyantuo. A hundred or so T√ºrks were made generals of the Tang army. 1st Xueyantuo (641) In 641, Li Shiji inflicted a major defeat on the Xueyantuo at Nuozhen River. 2nd Xueyantuo (645‚Äì646) In 646, the Xueyantuo were defeated and submitted to the Tang. 1st Western Turkic Khaganate (651‚Äì652) In the winter of 651, the Tang sent 30,000 soldiers and 50,000 Uyghur cavalrymen against the Western Turkic Khaganate. In 652, they were intercepted by the Chuyue, who were vassals of the Western Turks, and defeated them. The Tang army established prefectures in present-day Fukang and Miquan before returning home due to a shortage of provisions. 2nd Western Turkic Khaganate (656‚Äì657) In the winter of 656, the Tang army set off to defeat the Western Turkic Khaganate. In the fall of 657, they defeated the Chuyue and Karluks subordinate to the Western Turks at Yumugu (nearly present day Urumqi). After securing a victory against the Western Turks at Yingsuo River, the two commanders in charge of the Tang forces got into an argument over their next course of action. They eventually agreed on organizing their troops into a tight formation for better protection, but the delay made it impossible for them to find and engage Ashina Helu's main forces, and the expedition ended inconclusively. 3rd Western Turkic Khaganate (657) Conquest of the Western Turks and the Western Regions, 638‚Äì658 Another expedition was dispatched under the leadership of Su Dingfang, Ashina Mishe, and Ashina Buzhen. The Tang generals convinced Axijie, leader of the strongest tribe under Ashina Helu's command, to defect by releasing his tribesmen captured in previous campaigns. Su Dingfang defeated the Chuyue and convinced the Turgesh to surrender. He engaged Ashina Helu's main army at the Battle of Irtysh River. Ashina Helu encircled Su's army and attacked the infantry first, but the Tang soldiers stood their ground and used their long spears to force back the enemy cavalry. Su then counterattacked, killing tens of thousands of T√ºrks. Ashina Helu fled and the Tang army chased after him. After meeting up with the southern army, the combined Tang army made a final attack on Ashina Helu's camp, but he managed to escape again. Ashina Helu's retinue reached Shiguo before being captured by the locals who handed them over to the Tang. Ashina Helu was brought back to Chang'an in 658, where he was pardoned, but died soon after anyway. Ashina Duzhi (677‚Äì679) In 677, Ashina Duzhi rebelled and allied himself to the Tibetan Empire. In 679, Pei Xingjian attacked Ashina Duzhi at Suiye (Tokmak) and defeated him. Suiye was turned into a Tang garrison Ashina Nishufu (679‚Äì680) In 679, Ashina Nishufu rebelled on the northern border of Hedong (Shanxi). They were defeated by Pei Xingjian in 680.Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 202 Ashina Funian (680) In 680, Ashina Funian rebelled, but he eventually surrendered and was executed in Chang'an. 1st Second Turkic Khaganate (681‚Äì687) In 681, Ilterish Qaghan rebelled with the remnants of Ashina Funian's followers and declared the Second Turkic Khaganate in 682. The Second Turks conducted annual raids on Tang territory until 687. 2nd Second Turkic Khaganate (693‚Äì702) The Second Turkic Khaganate conducted regular raids from 693 to 702 under Qapaghan Qaghan until Wu Zetian accepted his marriage proposal in 703. 3rd Second Turkic Khaganate (706‚Äì707) The Second Turkic Khaganate conducted raids in 706 and 707. 4th Second Turkic Khaganate (720) In 720, Bilge Khagan of the Second Turkic Khaganate invaded and extracted tribute. A Tang, Basmyl, Khitan counterattack was defeated. Turgesh 1st Turgesh (703) In 703, the Turgesh seized Suiye. 2nd Turgesh (708‚Äì709) In 708, the Turgesh attacked Qiuci and in 709, defeated a Tang army. 3rd Turgesh (717) On 15 August 717, a Turgesh led army of Tibetans and Arabs laid siege to Uch Turfan and Gumo. General Tang Jiahui defeated them. The Arab general Al-Yashkuri fled to Tashkent. 4th Turgesh (726‚Äì727) From 726 to 727, the Turgesh and Tibetan Empire attacked Qiuci. 5th Turgesh (735‚Äì737) In 735, the Turgesh attacked Tingzhou. The Tang counterattack defeated them in 737. 6th Turgesh (740‚Äì744) In 740, K√ºl-chor of the Turgesh submitted to the Tang dynasty but later rebelled anyway and was killed in 744. 7th Turgesh (748) In 748, the Tang recaptured Suiye and destroyed it. 8th Turgesh (750) In 750, the Turgesh rebelled along with Chach in modern Tashkent. They were defeated. Uyghurs 1st Uyghurs (843) In 843, Shi Xiong attacked the Uyghurs displaced by the fall of their khaganate and slaughtered 10,000 Uyghurs at \\"Kill the Foreigners\\" Mountain (Shahu). Korea First conflict of the Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War Tang-Korean wars Silla-Tang War, 672-676 1st Goguryeo (645) Preparations for a campaign against Goguryeo began in 644. A fleet of 500 ships was constructed to transport 43,000 soldiers across the sea. On land, some 60,000 soldiers gathered at Youzhou under the command of Li Shiji. Li Shiji's army set off from Yincheng (modern Chaoyang) in April 645. He laid siege to Gaemo on 16 May and captured it on 27 May. He then headed southwest and defeated a Goguryeo army of 40,000. Li Shiji was joined by the emperor with 10,000 heavy cavalry. They took Liaodong (Ryotong) on 16 June and Baekam on 27 June. When they reached Ansi City on 18 July, news reached them that a large Goguryeo-Mohe army was on its way. Taizong ordered Li Shiji to lure out the enemies with only 15,000 men while he himself ambushed them from the rear. The remaining enemies fled atop a hill where they were surrounded and forced to surrender, yielding 36,800 captives, 50,000 horses, 50,000 cattle, and 10,000 suits of iron armour. All the Mohe soldiers were put to death while the rest were freed. Despite the initial success, the Tang expedition ground to a halt at Ansi, which refused to fall. The naval force took Bisa but failed to meet up with the land army or capture Pyeongyang. After the defenders at Ansi made a successful sortie to secure a strategic location in the southeastern corner of the city, Taizong called an end to the expedition and ordered a withdrawal on 13 October. 2nd Goguryeo (647) In 647, Emperor Taizong of Tang sent a naval force to harass the coast of Goguryeo while Li Shiji led 10,000 horsemen to raid across the Liao River frontier. Baekje (660‚Äì663) In the fall of 660, Su Dingfang led a naval invasion of Baekje. The Tang army defeated the army of Baekje at the mouth of the Geum River. They then sailed up the river and captured Baekje's capital, Sabi, conquering the kingdom. The natives rebelled soon after and besieged Liu Renyuan in the capital until Liu Rengui could bring in reinforcements. A stalemate ensued with Baekje holding some cities while Silla and the Tang occupied others. Baekje called the Yamato for help. In the autumn of 663, a combined Tang-Silla army marched for Churyu, the capital of the rebels. Meanwhile, the Tang fleet encountered and destroyed the Yamato fleet at the Battle of Baekgang at the mouth of the Geum River. Churyu was captured on 14 October and the rebellion was vanquished. 3rd Goguryeo (661‚Äì662) In the summer of 661, Su Dingfang led an army of 44,000 across the sea and laid siege to Pyeongyang while another Tang army under Qibi Heli advanced overland. Qibi Heli defeated a Goguryeo army at the Yalu River but Su Dingfang failed to take Pyeongyang. The invasion was called off in the spring of 662 when a subsidiary Tang force was defeated. 4th Goguryeo (667‚Äì668) In early 667, a Tang invasion of Goguryeo was launched with Li Shiji at its head. The Tang army easily swept away the border fortifications and pressed into Goguryeo's heartland in the spring of 668. Pyeongyang fell on 22 October and the Tang annexed Goguryeo. Silla (672‚Äì676) In 672, Silla attacked Tang positions in Korea. By 674, they had taken all the territory of what was previously Baekje. In 675, Liu Rengui attacked Silla and defeated them in Gyeonggi. In response Munmu of Silla dispatched a tributary mission to Tang with apologies. Emperor Gaozong of Tang accepted Munmu's apologies and withdrew Tang troops to deal with the Tibetan threat in the west. Seeing the Tang's strategic weakness, Silla renewed the advance on Tang territory, taking all of Korea by 676. Lesser Goguryeo (699) In 699, Go Deokmu rebelled and created Lesser Goguryeo; the Protectorate General to Pacify the East was moved to Pingzhou, in modern Lulong County. Tibet 1st Tuyuhun (623) Tang-Tuyuhun War, 634‚Äì635 In 623, the Tuyuhun, a people of mixed Xianbei and Qiang stock residing in modern Qinghai Province, invaded the northwest but were defeated by Chai Shao. 2nd Tuyuhun (634‚Äì635) In 634, Li Jing and Hou Junji embarked on a campaign against the Tuyuhun. They traveled for five months before catching up with the Tuyuhun northeast of Qinghai Lake and defeated them in 635. Murong Shun surrendered to the Tang but failed to keep power in his territory and was killed. Tuyuhun was thereafter ruled by Murong Nuohebo until it was conquered by the Tibetan Empire in 663. 1st Tibetan Empire (639) The Imperial Sedan Chair: Emperor Taizong depicted giving an audience to Gar Tongtsen Yulsung, the ambassador of the Tibetan Empire, in a painting by court artist Yan Liben (600-673 AD) In 639, Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire personally led an army against Songzhou (Songpan). The neighboring prefectures of Kuazhou and Nuozhou defected to the Tibetan side. Songzhou's governor attacked the Tibetans but lost. The Tang court dispatched 50,000 soldiers under Hou Junji to relieve Songzhou. Hou attacked Songtsen Gampo's camp at night, killing some 1,000 Tibetan soldiers. Songtsen Gampo called off the campaign and sent an envoy to Songzhou to apologize. However he insisted to a marriage alliance, to which Emperor Taizong of Tang agreed to in 640. 2nd Tibetan Empire (659‚Äì665) In 659, the Tibetan Empire sent 80,000 soldiers to attack Heyuan River in modern Qinghai Province. They were defeated by only 1,000 troops under Su Dingfang. The Tibetans returned the next year and attacked Shule, then Khotan in 663 and 665. They were repelled. 3rd Tibetan Empire (667‚Äì674) Battle of Dafei River, 667‚Äì674 In 667, the Tibetan Empire launched an attack on the Anxi Protectorate, taking 18 prefectures. In the spring of 670, Emperor Gaozong of Tang dispatched two expeditionary forces, one to Qinghai, the other to the Western Regions. The Qinghai expedition under Xue Rengui split into two columns. The column under Guo Daifeng was intercepted by a Tibetan force of 20,000 and forced back to abandon their supplies to flee to Dafei River on a plain southwest of Qinghai Lake. Xue Rengui hurried back to join Guo Daifeng but they were defeated anyway. The Tibetans annexed the former territory of the Tuyuhun, conquered Qiuci, sacked Shule and attacked Gumo. The Tang force to the Western Regions retook Shule in the middle of 673 and reverted the Kingdom of Khotan and Qiuci to Tang suzerainty. 4th Tibetan Empire (676‚Äì681) In 676, the Tibetan Empire attacked Diezhou, Fuzhou, and Jingzhou. Fengtian and Wugong were sacked. In 677, the Tibetans captured Qiuci. In 678, they defeated a Tang army in the Qinghai region. Their advances were reversed in 679 when Pei Xingjian defeated them and re-established control over the Western Regions. However the Tibetans returned the next year and captured the Anrong fortress in Sichuan. A Tibetan invasion of Qinghai was defeated in 681. 5th Tibetan Empire (690‚Äì696) After the Tang dynasty abandoned the Western Regions in 686 due to excessive military expenditures, the Tibetan Empire took control of the region. Wu Zetian later on decided to retake the region and sent two expeditions against the Tibetans. The first one in 690 was defeated at Issyk- Kul while the second one succeeded in 692. The Tibetans returned in 694 and attacked the Stone City (Charklik). In the spring of 696, the Tibetan Empire dealt a great defeat to a Tang army at Suluohan Mountain in Taozhou and attacked Liangzhou.

Zhang went on to capture Ganzhou, Suzhou, and Yizhou in 850, and then submitted a petition to Emperor XuƒÅnzong of Tang, offering his loyalty and submission. In 851, Zhang captured Xizhou and the Tang emperor made him Guiyi Jiedushi (Ê≠∏Áæ©ÁØÄÂ∫¶‰Ωø, Governor of the Guiyi Circuit) and Cao Yijin his secretary general. In 849, Tibetan commanders and soldiers in eastern Gansu defected to the Tang. 26th Tibetan Empire (861) In 861, Zhang Yichao retook Liangzhou, extending the Guiyi Circuit's authority to Xizhou, Guazhou, Ganzhou, Suzhou, Yzhou, Lanzhou, Shanzhou, Hezhou, Minzhou, Liangzhou, and Kuozhou. 27th Tibetan Empire (866) In 866, Zhang Yichao defeated bLon Khrom brZhe and seized Tingzhou and Luntai but immediately lost them as well as Xizhou to the Kingdom of Qocho.

Gaochang was annexed on 19 September 640 and became Xizhou. 1st Yanqi (644) In 644, Guo Xiaoke was sent against Yanqi, which had allied itself to the Western Turkic Khaganate. When the Tang army arrived, it defeated a Western Turk army and tributized Yanqi. 2nd Yanqi (648) In 648, the Yanqi king was overthrown by a cousin, so another Tang army under Ashina She'er was sent in to place another member on the royal throne. The new king declared himself a Tang vassal. Kucha (648‚Äì649) In 648, Ashina She'er conquered Kucha and put under the control of Guo Xiaoke. Remnants of Kuchean forces retook the city soon after and killed Guo, but Ashina She'er returned and defeated them as well as taking five other cities. An additional 11,000 inhabitants were killed as reprisal for the death of Guo Xiaoke. Since the Kingdom of Khotan and the Shule Kingdom had already previously submitted to Tang authority in 632, with Shache following as well in 635, and Gumo (Aksu) in 644, the Tang dynasty now had complete control over the Western Regions. Khotan (725) In 725, the king of Khotan rebelled but was immediately replaced with a Tang puppet by the Anxi Protectorate. Little Balur (745) In 745, Gao Xianzhi marched across the Pamirs with 10,000 men and conquered Little Balur (Gilgit), a client state of the Tibetan Empire. Chach (750) In 750 the Tang intervened in a dispute between their vassal Fergana and the neighboring kingdom of Chach, located in modern Tashkent. The kingdom of Chach was sacked and their king was taken back to Chang'an, where he was executed. In the same year Tang also defeated Qieshi in Chitral and the Turgesh. Talas (751) In 751, Tang forces under Gao Xianzhi suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Talas against the Abbasid when their Karluk allies defected to the enemies.

Li died soon after and Sun succeeded him, only to be defeated by the Second Turkic Khaganate. 2nd Khitans (720) In 720, the governor- general of Yingzhou sent 500 Tang soldiers to back Suogu against Ketuyu in Khitan politics but was defeated. 3rd Khitans (730‚Äì735) In 730, Ketuyu attacked the Tang but was heavily defeated in a counterattack in 732. Although he allied himself with the T√ºrks, they were defeated again in 733 by a Tang and Kumo Xi army. Zhang Shougui defeated the Khitans again in 734 and Ketuyu was finally murdered by Guozhe in 735, who became the next leader of the Khitans. 4th Khitans (736) In 736, An Lushan attacked the Khitans but was defeated. 5th Khitans (745) In 745, two Khitan tribes revolted and were defeated by An Lushan. 6th Khitans (752) In 752, An Lushan attacked the Khitans. Nanzhao Nanzhao (738‚Äì937) 1st Nanzhao (751) In 751, Xianyu Zhongtong attacked Nanzhao with an army of 80,000 but was utterly defeated, losing three quarters of his original force. 2nd Nanzhao (754) In 754, Yang Guozhong invaded Nanzhao but failed to engage with the enemy until supplies ran out, at which time they were attacked and routed. 3rd Nanzhao (829) In 829, Nanzhao sacked Chengdu. 4th Nanzhao (846) In 846, Nanzhao raided Annan. 5th Nanzhao (860-861) In 860, Nanzhao attacked Bozhou and Annan, briefly taking ƒê·∫°i La before being driven out by a Tang army the next year. 6th Nanzhao (863‚Äì866) In 863, local people in Annan allied with Nanzhao. Nanzhao sent an invasion force numbering 50,000 and besieged Annan's capital ƒê·∫°i La in mid-January. On 20 January, the defenders led by Zai Xi killed a hundred of the besiegers. Five days later, Zai Xi captured, tortured, and killed a group of enemies known as the Puzi Man. A local official named Liang Ke was related to them, and defected as a result. On 28 January, an enemy Buddhist monk, possibly Indian, was wounded by an arrow while strutting to and fro naked outside the southern walls. On 14 February, Zai Xi shot down 200 enemies and over 30 horses using a mounted crossbow from the walls. By 28 February, most of Zai Xi's followers had perished, and he himself had been wounded several times by arrows and stones. The enemy commander, Yang Sijin, penetrated the inner city. Zai Xi tried to escape by boat, but it capsized midstream, drowning him. The 400 remaining defenders wanted to flee as well, but could not find any boats, so they chose to make a last stand at the eastern gate. Ambushing a group of enemy cavalry, they killed over 2,000 enemy troops and 300 horses before Yang sent reinforcements from the inner city. After taking ƒê·∫°i La, Nanzhao laid siege to Junzhou (modern Haiphong). A local commander attacked the enemy boats by ramming them and sank 30, drowning them. In total, the invasion destroyed Chinese armies in Annan numbering over 150,000. Although initially welcomed by the local Vietnamese people in ousting Tang control, Nanzhao turned on them, ravaging the local population and countryside. Both Chinese and Vietnamese sources note that the Vietnamese fled to the mountains to avoid destruction. The Tang launched a counterattack in 864 under Gao Pian with 5,000 troops and experienced initial success against Nanzhao, however political machinations at court led to Gao Pian's recall. He was later reinstated and completed the retaking of Annan in 866, executing the enemy general, Duan Qiuqian, and beheading 30,000 of his men. Gao Pian renamed Annan to Jinghaijun. 7th Nanzhao (869‚Äì870) In 869, Nanzhao laid siege to Chengdu but failed to take it. Annan Annan was the southernmost region of Tang Empire, where the main inhabitants were Vietnamese.

Champa (803) In 803,Champa seized southern Annan. Troops working on garrison fortifications also revolted. From 803 to 863, local rebels killed or expelled no fewer than six protector-generals of Annan. D∆∞∆°ng Thanh (820‚Äì837) In 820, D∆∞∆°ng Thanh seized ƒê·∫°i La but the Tang regained control in 837. Annan (858) From 854, Annan jiedushi Li Zhuo killed the local chieftain ƒê·ªó T·ªìn Th√†nh. He also killed the chieftain of the Qidong Man in Aizhou (Ngh·ªá An, central Vietnam). These actions provoked the natives into an alliance with Nanzhao. Fan Chuo, a Tang official in Annan reported: \\"‚Ä¶The native chiefs within the frontiers were subsequently seduced by the Man rebels‚Ä¶\\" and \\"again became close friends with them. As days passed and months came, we gradually had to encounter raids and sudden attacks. This caused a number of places to fall into rebel hands.\\" In 858, the Tang court sent a new jiedushi to protect Annan. They upgraded the Tang garrisons with heavy-armored cavalry and infantry, and fortified ƒê·∫°i La with a reed palisade. Anti-Tang Vietnamese allied with highland people, who appealed to Nanzhao for help, and as a result invaded the area in 860, briefly taking ƒê·∫°i La before being driven out by a Tang army the next year. Annan (874‚Äì879) A campaign against local aboriginals in Annan was conducted from 874-879. Guangxi (877) In 877, troops deployed from Annan in Guangxi mutined. Annan (880) In 880, the army in Annan mutinied, took the city of ƒê·∫°i La, and forced the military commissioner Zeng Gun to flee, ending de facto Chinese control in Vietnam. An Lushan Rebellion (755‚Äì763) An Lushan Rebellion, 755‚Äì763 An Lushan (755‚Äì757) An Lushan was the son of a Turkish mother and Sogdian father. Their family fled to the Tang in 716 due to turmoil in the Second Turkic Khaganate. Illiterate in Chinese, An Lushan nonetheless rose to become a prominent military commander in the Tang military. By 733, An had become a deputy under Youzhou governor Zhang Shougui. In 742, An became jiedushi of Pinglu. In 744, An also became jiedushi of Youzhou (Fanyang). In 751, An was given command of Hedong. When the chancellor Yang Guozhong started arresting An's supporters in the capital in 755, An rose in revolt under the pretense of having received a secret edict to suppress Yang. An marched south with 150,000 men from his base in Youzhou on 16 December 755. News of the rebellion reached the capital on 22 December. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang immediately sent order to raise soldiers in Hedong and Luoyang with Feng Changqing in overall command. An crossed the Yellow River northeast of Luoyang on 8 January 756. Feng attempted to block An at Hulao Pass with 60,000 soldiers, but his hastily raised army could not stand up to An's elite cavalry, who trampled them under their hooves. After two more battles, Feng fled west to Shanzhou and An took Luoyang on 19 January 756. Feng was joined by Gao Xianzhi, who commanded another 50,000 troops, but they decided to withdraw from Shanzhou and retreat to the more defensible Tong Pass. However the retreat degenerated into a confused and panicked flight. Gao's eunuch supervisor Bian Lingcheng denounced the commanders and had them put to death on Xuanzong's orders. Gao and Feng's troops were joined by 80,000 soldiers recalled from the frontier under the command of Geshu Han. Together, an army around 200,000 strong now stood guard at Tong Pass, blocking An's way to Chang'an. On 5 February, An Lushan proclaimed himself Emperor of Yan. In the same month, Tang loyalists under the leadership of Li Guangbi rebelled against An in Hebei. An sent Shi Siming against the rebels. Shi raced ahead of the main army with his mounted troops to intercept Li Guangbi's Shuofang army near the town of Changshan. Li took Changshan in advance and set up his men with their backs to the town walls to prevent a sneak attack. The spearmen formed a dense defensive formation while 1,000 crossbowmen divided into four sections to provide continuous volley fire. When Shi's cavalry engaged Li's Shuofang army they were completely unable to close in on his troops and suffered heavy losses, forcing a withdrawal. In May, Li was joined by the new jiedushi of Shuofang, Guo Ziyi, and besieged Shi at Boling. In the summer of 756, Yang Guozhong convinced Xuanzong to order Geshu Han to take the offensive against An. On 5 July, the Tang army marched toward Shanzhou. On 7 July, the Tang met the rebels in battle and were defeated. The Tang sent in their vanguard, who were lured into a narrow defile where it became impossible for them to use their weapons. The rebel Tongluo cavalry attacked them from the rear, causing mass panic in the main army, which dissolved into a rout. The rebels followed up by taking the Tong Pass and capturing Geshu Han, who was sent to Luoyang. On 12 August, Xuanzong fled for Chengdu. When they reached the Mawei post station, the soldiers accompanying him forced him to have both Yang Guozhong and Yang Guifei put to death. The rebels took Chang'an soon after. On the same day Xuanzong fled Chang'an, the crown prince Li Heng declared himself emperor (posthumously Emperor Suzong of Tang) at Lingwu. The Shuofang army abandoned their campaign in Hebei and marched west to protect their new emperor. Despite taking Chang'an, An Lushan's forces failed to make any headway in the south. Major towns such as Yingchuan, Suiyang, and Nanyang resisted all attempts to capture them. In early 757, An Lushan was killed by his close associates, who installed his son An Qingxu as the new emperor. An Qingxu (757‚Äì759) On 29 October 757, a Tang-Uyghur army under the command of Guo Ziyi marched for Chang'an. On 13 November, the Tang engaged in battle with the rebels near Xiangji Temple. The rebels were initially successful in driving back the Tang line and throwing them into confusion, but the Tang counterattacked from the rear with a contingent of Uyghur cavalry under Pugu Huaien. When the rebel cavalry forces were defeated, Pugu launched an attack on the primary body of the rebel army, defeating them. The Tang recovered Chang'an on 14 November. The rebels tried to stop the Tang advance on Luoyang in the narrow defiles where Geshu Han had previously been defeated, but the Tang routed them on 30 November and entered Luoyang on 3 Demcember. An Qingxu fled to southern Hebei. In November 758, the Tang launched another campaign against An and laid siege to him in Xiangzhou (Anyang). On 7 April 759, Shi Siming attacked the Tang army, but a large dust storm broke off the engagement. While Shi was able to recover fairly quickly, the storm sent a wave of confusion throughout the large Tang army. Each Tang commander decided to retreat in a different direction to their own territory. On 10 April, Shi Siming killed An Qingxu. Shi Siming (759‚Äì761) In the fall of 759, Shi Siming captured Luoyang, whose commander Li Guangbi decided to retreat to a more defensive position at Heyang, northeast of Luoyang. The situation remained static for three years, with neither side able to make any headway against the other. Shi Siming was killed by his son, Shi Chaoyi, in the spring of 761. Shi Chaoyi (761‚Äì763) In the fall of 762, the Tang launched a two pronged attack on Shi Chaoyi in Luoyang. Pugu Huai'en and Li Guangbi defeated the rebels in November and Shi fled east, but his subordinate generals refused to harbor him. One by one, the rebel generals submitted to nominal Tang authority while still retaining control of their territory and armies, effectively becoming autonomous kingdoms within the empire of the Tang. Shi Chaoyi committed suicide in 763, putting an end to the rebellion started by An Lushan in 755. Warlords (Jiedushi) Rebellious provinces in the post-An Lushan Tang Empire. Red provinces were lost to the Tang forever while the orange provinces were reincorporated. In the post-An Lushan Tang empire, approximately 75% of all provincial governors were military men regardless of their titles and designations. Four of the them were former rebels in Hebei. In return for their surrender, they were allowed to remain in command of their armies and to govern their own land as they saw fit. They were Zhaoyi (modern Changzhi), Youzhou (modern Beijing), Chengde, and Weibo. The provincial governors in Pinglu (Shandong) and Huaixi (Zhangyi) started out as a loyalists but joined the former rebels as autonomous powers. In 775, Tian Chengsi of Weibo attacked and absorbed a large portion of Xiangzhou from Zhaoyi, resulting in the Three Fanzhen of Hebei. Although nominally subordinate to the Tang by accepting imperial titles, these former rebels governed their territories as independent fiefdoms with all the trappings of feudal society, establishing their own family dynasties through systematic intermarriage, collecting taxes, raising armies, and appointing their own officials. Chengde Chengde was ruled by Li Baochen, a man of Kumo Xi origins. He was succeeded by his son Li Weiyue in 781, but he was killed by the Khitan Wang Wujun in 782. Wang Wujun was succeeded by his son Wang Shizhen in 801. Shizhen was succeeded by his son Wang Chengzong in 809. Chengzong was succeeded by his brother Wang Chengyuan in 820.

Tingcou was succeeded by his son Wang Yuankui in 834. Yuankai was succeeded by his son Wang Shaoding in 855. Shaoding grew ill and died in 857, and was succeeded by his brother Wang Shaoyi. Shaoyi died in 866 and was succeeded by his nephew Wang Jingchong. Jingchong was succeeded by his son Wang Rong in 883. Wang Rong's state of Zhao was destroyed in 921 when he was killed in a coup by his adopted son Zhang Wenli, who in turn died soon after. Wenli's son Zhang Chujin was captured by Li Cunxu the next year. The people of Zhao hated the Zhang family and requested that his family be turned into minced meat. Chujin was dismembered at the marketplace. Weibo Tian Chengsi of Weibo was succeeded by his nephew Tian Yue in 779. Yue was killed by his cousin Tian Xu in 784. Xu was succeeded by his son Tian Ji'an in 796. Tian Ji'an was succeeded by his son Tian Huaijian in 812. On 17 November 812, Tian Huaijian was removed from power and succeeded by a distant relative, Tian Hongzheng. Tian Hongzheng submitted to imperial authority and the court made him jiedushi of Chengde, however he was killed by Wang Tingcou on 29 August 821. The post of Weibo was taken up by Li Su, who grew ill soon after and was replaced by Tian Hongzheng's son, Tian Bu. Tian Bu tried to take vengeance for his father by attacking Chengde, but his soldiers deserted him. He committed suicide on 6 February 822. Shi Xiancheng took over Weibo and eventually submitted to imperial authority. However the soldiers grew angry that Shi was stripping Weibo of its wealth in preparation to move to another imperial post, and killed him on 30 July 829 under the leadership of He Jintao. Jintao was succeeded by his son He Hongjing in 840. Hongjing was succeeded by his son He Quanhao in 866. He Quanhao was killed in a mutiny by soldiers in 870 and replaced by Han Yunzhong. Yunzhong was succeeded by his son Han Jian in 874. Han Jian tried to expand Weibo's territory but failed and was replaced by Le Yanzhen in 883. Le Yanzhen abdicated in 888 and was replaced by Zhao Wenbian, who was killed and replaced by Luo Hongxin. Hongxin was succeeded by his son Luo Shaowei in 898. Shaowei's territory was eventually integrated into Later Liang, and he died as grand preceptor and palace secretary in 910. Youzhou Li Huaixian of Youzhou (Lulong) was killed by Zhu Xicai in 768. Zhu Xicai was killed by Li Huaiyuan in 772 and replaced by Zhu Ci. In 774, Zhu Ci submitted to Tang authority, but his brother Zhu Tao remained in Youzhou as acting jiedushi. In 783, Zhu Ci rebelled and declared himself emperor in Chang'an but was defeated the next year. Zhu Ci died in 785 and was succeeded by his cousin Liu Peng. Liu Peng died in the same year and was succeeded by his son Liu Ji. Liu Ji was poisoned by his son Liu Zong in 810. In 821, Liu Zong abdicated and became a monk. The court appointee, Zhang Hongjing, was removed in a mutiny and replaced by Zhu Kerong. Zhu Kerong was killed by his soldiers in 826 and replaced with his son Zhu Yansi. Zhu Yansi was killed in the same year by his officer Li Zaiyi. Li Zaiyi was ousted by Yang Zhicheng in 831. Yang Zhicheng was removed from power by his soldiers in 834 and replaced with Shi Yuanzhong. Shi Yuanzhong was killed in 841 and two more followed him in quick succession before Zhang Zhongwu took power in Youzhou. Zhongwu was succeeded by his son Zhang Zhifang in 849. He was immediately ousted by his soldiers and replaced by Zhou Lin. Zhou Lin died the next year and was succeeded by Zhang Yunshen. Yunshen was succeeded by his son Zhang Jianhui in 872. Zhang Jianhui fled to the Tang court in 873 and was succeeded by Zhang Gongsu. Zhang Gongsu was defeated by Li Maoxun in 875. Maoxun abdicated to his son Li Keju in 876. Li Keju was attacked by Li Quanzhong in 885 and committed suicide. Quanzhong was succeeded by his son Li Kuangwei the next year. Kuangwei was overthrown by his brother Li Kuangchou in 893. Li Keyong attacked Youzhou in 894 and forced Li Kuangchou to flee to Yichang (modern Cangzhou). Yichang's governor Lu Yanwei killed Li Kuangchou. Youzhou was given to Liu Rengong. Rengong ruled until 907 when he was overthrown by his son Liu Shouguang. Shouguang's short lived state of Yan was conquered by Li Cunxu in 913. Zhaoyi Xue Song of Zhaoyi (modern Changzhi) was succeeded by his son Xue Ping in 773. Xue Ping immediately abdicated to his brother Xue E. Tiang Chengsi of Weibo invaded Zhaoyi in 775, conquering four of its six prefectures. Xue E fled to the Tang court, who took control of the two remaining prefectures. Liu Wu submitted to imperial authority and was made jiedushi of Zhaoyi in 820. Liu Wu was succeeded by his son Liu Congjian in 825. When Liu Congjian died in 843, imperial forces invaded Zhaoyi and slaughtered his family. Pinglu Li Zhengji of Pinglu was succeeded by his son Li Na in 781. Li Na was succeeded by his son Li Shigu in 792. Shigu was succeeded by his half brother Li Shidao in 806. In 818, imperial forces invaded Pinglu. Li Shidao was killed by his own officer Liu Wu in 819. Liu Wu submitted to imperial authority and was made jiedushi of Zhaoyi (modern Changzhi) in 820.

In 874, the bandits rebelled under Wang Xianzhi in Changyuan, and ravaged the region between the Changjiang and Yellow River. When Wang Xianzhi died in 878, he was succeeded by Huang Chao, a failed examination candidate from a wealthy salt trading family. Huang Chao led his forces south to avoid conflict with government forces and sacked the city of Guangzhou in the summer of 879. From there he moved north again, crossing the Changjiang in the summer of 880, and capturing Luoyang on 22 December. Huang Chao's army easily routed the old and feeble soldiers of the Shence Army in January 881 and took Chang'an on 8 January. Emperor Xizong of Tang fled to Sichuan. In 883, the Tang court called in the Shatuo Turk Li Keyong, who defeated Huang Chao's army at Liangtian Hill. Huang Chao evacuated Chang'an in May and headed eastward. After an unsuccessful siege operation and several defeats against imperial forces, Huang Chao was finally hunted down in Shandong and killed in the summer of 884. Miscellaneous rebellions Li Jingye (684) In 684, Li Jingye rebelled in Yangzhou and was defeated. Pugu Huai'en (764) In 764, Pugu Huai'en rebelled and joined the Uyghur Khaganate and Tibetan Empire in attacking Chang'an, but Pugu died on the way there. Li Lingyao (777) In 777, Li Lingyao rebelled in Biansong (Kaifeng) and was defeated. The majority of his territory was taken over by Li Zhengji of Pinglu. Jingyuan Incident (781‚Äì786) When Li Baochen of Chengde died in 781, Emperor Dezong of Tang refused to recognize his successor, Li Weiyue. In response, Li Weiyue rebelled with the support of Tian Yue of Weibo and Li Na of Pinglu. Zhu Tao of Youzhou sided with the court and dealt several defeats to Li, and as a result Li was overthrown by Wang Wujun. However both Wang and Zhu were disappointed in the rewards they received for their service and rebelled against the Tang in 782. By the end of the ear, the jiedushi of Huaixi (Changzhi), Li Xilie, had also rebelled, cutting off the Bian Canal. On 23 November 783, troops from Jingzhou passed through Chang'an on their way to the battlefront. When they found out that they had only been paid a fraction of the normal soldier's salary, they rebelled and took the capital. Dezong fled to Fengtian while the Jingzhou troops enthroned Zhu Ci as the new emperor. In 784, Dezong pardoned Wang Wujun, who then turned against Zhu Tao and defeated him on 29 May. With the northeastern front settled, Tang forces recovered Chang'an in the next month. Li Xilie was poisoned by Chen Xianqi in 786 and the area was brought back under nominal Tang authority. Li Huaiguang (784‚Äì785) In 784, the Shuofang general Li Huaiguang rebelled. His troops refused to his orders and he committed suicide in 785. Wu Shaocheng (799‚Äì800) In 799, Wu Shaocheng of Huaixi (Changzhi) invaded Tang territory. After several inconclusive battles, Wu halted his aggression and received a pardon from Emperor Dezong of Tang. Chengde (809‚Äì810) In 809, the Tang attacked Chengde. The invasion ended in failure and peace was restored in 810. Huaixi (815‚Äì817) In 815, the Tang invaded Huaixi (Changzhi) with a force 90,000 men. They surrounded the warlord province but failed to make headway against its fortifications for two years. In the winter of 817, the Tang general Li Su penetrated the border defenses during a snowstorm took the undefended capital, ending the war. Pinglu (819) In 819, the Tang invaded Pinglu. Its jiedushi, Li Shidao, was killed by his own officer, who submitted to Tang authority. Qiu Fu (860) In 860, the Qiu Fu Uprising in Zhejiang was suppressed. Guizhou (868‚Äì869) In 868, the garrison of Guizhou rebelled under Pang Xun and moved north, taking the provincial capital by the end of the year. They were crushed in the fall of 869 by Shatuo cavalry commander Zhuye Chixin. Collapse (886‚Äì907) Collapse of the Tang dynasty, 907 While the rebel forces of Huang Chao were defeated in 884, Tang authority had essentially ceased to exist. The newly recruited army of Tian Lingzi, 54,000 strong, was soon destroyed trying to bring two northern warlords to heel. Emperor Xizong and his successors Zhaozong and Ai Di became pawns of the military governors. The Tang Empire collapsed into numerous rival warlord states, ushering in the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. In the south emerged the kingdoms of Wuyue, Min, and Southern Han. In the north, Li Keyong of Hedong and Zhu Quanzhong of Bianzhou vied for supremacy. Zhu held the last two Tang emperors as captives and controlled the North China Plain. He made an unsuccessful attempt to murder Li in 884 and proclaimed himself Emperor of Later Liang in 907. Zhu's Liang dynasty survived for only 11 years after his death in 912, and it was conquered in 923 by Li Keyong's successor Li Cunxu, founder of Later Tang. In 937, the Later Tang gave way to a number of short lived military regimes from which the Song dynasty eventually emerged, reuniting most of China by 979. However the Song never quite achieved the hegemonic status of the early Tang. It was, militarily speaking, at best only equal and at worst completely inferior to its northern neighbor, the Khitan Liao dynasty, followed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty.

It arose in the early 13th century following the victory of the Catholic church over the Cathars, as the church sought to re-establish its authority in the region. As a result, church buildings typically present features drawn from military architecture. Taking into account the Cathars' criticism of the Catholic Church, Southern French Gothic is simpler and less ornate than northern French Gothic, and further differs in that the construction material is typically brick rather than stone. Over time, the style came to influence secular buildings as well as churches and spread beyond the area where Catharism had flourished.  Origins  During the rise of Catharism, the luxury of the Roman Catholic Church faced constant criticism by the Cathar ecclesiastics. After the political eradication of the Cathar aristocracy during the Albigensian Crusade (1209‚Äì1229), the clergy of southern France understood that after having won the war, it was necessary for them to win back the minds of the populace. The ideology of Medieval Inquisition was reflected in the adoption of a more austere and uncluttered architectural style.fr:La cath√©drale Sainte-C√©cile, page 6 It is quite interesting to note that the same criticisms were made again a few centuries later with the rise of Protestantism, and that the reaction then adopted by the Roman Catholic Church was completely different since it gave rise to the exuberant decorative richness of the Baroque architecture.  Geographical area  Southern French Gothic, as its name suggests, is found in the southern part of France, mainly in the regions where Catharism had developed, and which were subjected to religious and military repression from the North. The reconquest by the Catholic hierarchy gave rise to the construction or reconstruction of many religious buildings, but also of secular ones. The regions concerned are therefore the current d√©partements of the Haute-Garonne (Toulouse), the Tarn (Albi), the Tarn-et-Garonne (Montauban), the Ari√®ge, the Gers, the Aude, the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, the H√©rault, with instances in neighboring d√©partements as well.  Characteristics  Southern French Gothic is characterized by the austerity of the constructions, such as the use of solid buttresses rather than flying buttresses, while the openings are few and narrow. Romanesque architecture persisted for longer in the south of France than in the north, and the transition to Gothic was gradual. Many of the buildings in the Southern Gothic style are thus built with a single nave, and roof-frames resting on diaphragm arches cover them.  Brick construction  Jacobins of Toulouse, illustration from the Dictionary of Viollet-le-Duc In an area poor in stone, the typical construction material was brick, whose use in the Southern French Gothic of the regions of Toulouse, Montauban and Albi became one of its distinguishing marks. The builders used techniques adapted to this material, such as the miter arches typical of this style. Brick lends itself to geometric decorative compositions, and consequently, there are few sculptures integrated into the architecture. Depending on the type of clay used, the bricks can be molded or rounded by abrasion. Some buildings use stone sparingly to create color contrasts. Neighboring regions were coming under this influence but dominated by stone construction often adopted the same architectural vocabulary.  Single nave  After the Cathar episode, one goal of the Catholic Church was the recovery of the faithful through preaching (hence the foundation by Dominique de Guzm√°n of the order of the Friars Preachers). To this end, the preference was for the single nave, which promotes acoustics and places all the faithful under the gaze of the preacher. The nave is lined with side chapels, lodged between the buttresses, and surmounted by large windows that illuminate it. The very first example of Southern French Gothic architecture is the nave of the Toulouse Cathedral, built from 1210 to 1220 and probably the widest nave in Western Europe at its completion (19 metres wide), from which architectural research will then follow in the city's mendicant convents. However, the presence of a single nave is not necessarily related to this desire but may be connected to other considerations such as a single pre-existing nave. Conversely, the vast nave of the Jacobins of Toulouse is divided by a row of pillars but is nevertheless a single entity. There, the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \\"palm tree\\", because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column like palm trees.https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/ Another jewel of Southern French Gothic, the cathedral of Albi took two centuries to build, from 1282 to 1480, but it was to be completed by 1390. Its unusual dimensions for a Southern French Gothic building (interior length: 100 metres, interior width: 30 metres, height of the vaults: 30 metres) and its slightly later completion make it a unicum within its family. In opposition to the party developed for the Jacobins and in the rest of the region, the master of Albi preferred to reinforce the overall unity of the construction, minimising breaks in the plan, reducing the horizontal division of the volume and softening the rhythm of the ship's bays. The architect of Albi had the skill to place the buttresses inside the wall, giving them a cylindrical shape towards the outside.

Octagonal \\"Toulouse\\" bell tower  In the Toulouse region, the typical bell tower appeared in the Romanesque period, with an octagonal floor plan and stories progressively decreasing in size. In the transition to Gothic, only the shape of the bays changed. Bell towers are usually surmounted by a spire, but a certain number of these are missing, either because they have been destroyed, or because the construction was interrupted. The first and typical example is the bell tower of Saint-Sernin of Toulouse, enhanced in the Gothic period with miter arches succeeding circa 1270 the Romanesque arched windows, but there are also ogival bays.

Here again the first model was a church in Toulouse: Notre-Dame du Taur.

Most of the time, except in cases where the church is included in a defensive system, these elements have only a decorative and especially a symbolic role, tending to assert the power of the Church. At the church of Notre-Dame de Simorre, it was the 19th-century architect and conservationist Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc who added battlements and watchtowers to the top of the buttresses.

The same architectural principles of sobriety of construction, absence or limitation of carved decoration, massive appearance, and defensive elements can, however, be found in buildings used for other purposes. Examples in Toulouse include mansions and the Saint-Raymond College; in Albi, the Berbie Palace, etc.  Photo gallery  Eglise vue a√©rienne.jpg|Church of Saint-Germain, Alairac Gers Condom Cathedral of Saint-Pierre outside 01.jpg|Cathedral of Saint- Pierre, Condom Montagnac (34) St-Andr√©.jpg|Church of Saint-Andr√©, Montagnac (H√©rault) FR-81140_cathstalain01.jpg|Lavaur Cathedral Clo√Ætre et clocher des Jacobins.jpg|The cloister of the Jacobins convent (Toulouse) Couvent des Jacobins de Toulouse.jpg|Jacobins church of Toulouse Albi_Sainte- C√©cile.JPG|Albi Cathedral Toulouse - clochers de St Sernin et ND du Taur.jpg|The bell towers of ND du Taur (on the right, seen by the edge) and Saint-Sernin (in the center), models of the bell towers of southern French Gothic.

The poster with the inscription ¬´Life imprisonment. Privet, Rob¬ª May 19, 2019, Yerevan. Poghos Poghosyan (; 1958‚ÄìSeptember 25, 2001) was an ethnic Armenian from the Javakhk region of Georgia. He was killed at Poplavok cafe in Yerevan on September 25, 2001 by the bodyguards of then President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan. Kocharyan's bodyguards pleaded not guilty to the accusations. While at the cafe, a seated Poghosyan saw Kocharyan (a former classmate) leaving the cafe with Charles Aznavour and greeted him by saying \\"Hi Rob\\" (’∫÷Ä’´’æ’•’ø ’å’∏’¢, privet Rob) as they left. This very casual greeting was taken as an insult by the president, and his bodyguards approached Poghosyan's table and asked to have a word with him. He was taken to the toilet where he was beaten and declared dead 10 minutes later by an ambulance paramedic. It took days for the media to report on this murder by the president's bodyguard, witnessed by hundreds of people. Human Rights Watch said that witnesses feared coming forward during the trial. The trial was quick, with one of President Kocharyan's bodyguards, Aghamal Harutiunyan, also known as Kuku, charged with involuntary manslaughter. He was sentenced with a year of probation. After the 2018 Armenian revolution this case was eventually reopened, with testimony by witness Steven Newton, which was not allowed in the original trialhttps://armtimes.com/hy/article/180387. Re-trial arguments are scheduled to be heard beginning February 27, 2020. On March 7, 2020, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was on Yerevan's metro handing out booklets supporting a referendum his party had initiated. A young woman tore it up and threw the pieces at him. Pashinyan took it in stride saying to the people around that \\"This is what democracy is for.\\" He later reflected on the event on Facebook, making a reference to Poghos Poghosyan's murder when he stated ‚Äúthe safety of this young woman is not threatened, she will not be ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô beaten up in the nearest restroom, she will continue to live her usual life, freely express her views...‚Äù. In January 2020, prosecutors asked the Court of Appeals to overturn Aghamal Harutiunyan's guilty verdict and order a retrial. They said there was additional proof that the death was a murder committed by \\"a group of individuals.\\" On July 6, 2020, the court accepted the request of prosecutors and the case was sent back to Yerevan's court of first instance.

It was here that he learnt from Pobassoo, the captain of the fleet, that Macassan praus came to the coast of northern Australia every year on the north-west monsoon winds to collect and dry trepang or b√™che de mer which they then sold to the Chinese.Flinders 1814: Chapter 9  Interactions between Aboriginal people and Macassans  Dried sea cumber Flinders' encounter with Pobassoo is the first Australian record of the north Australian trepang industry. Macassans had probably started to visit the northern Australian coast before 1650Ta√ßon et al. 2010 but Dutch East India Company documents suggest that the intensive catching and processing of trepang for the Chinese market probably began in about 1750.Macknight 1986Macknight 2011: 133-134 Macassan involvement in the industry ended in 1906 when the South Australian Government, which administered the Northern Territory at that time, restricted the issuing of licenses to locally-owned vessels. The distribution of tamarind trees (an exotic species), trepang processing sites and the depiction of Macassan praus and other items of Macassan material culture in rock art provide direct material evidence for the Macassan trepang industry. Trepang processing sites are found on the Kimberley coastCrawford 1968Crawford 2001Morwood and Hobbs 1997 and on the Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt coasts.Macknight 1976: Chapter 5 While depictions of praus and items of Macassan material culture are not unusual in the rock art of Arnhem LandTa√ßon et al. 2010May et al. 2010 and offshore islands like Groote Eylandt,McCarthy 1960Clarke and Frederick 2006 Chasm IslandMcCarthy 1960 and Bickerton Island,Turner 1973 such images are rare in the Kimberley.O'Connor and Arrow 2008 These data and Aboriginal oral tradition suggest that the relationship between Macassans and Aborigines in the Kimberley was different to the relationship between Macassans and Yolngu with the former relationship characterised by hostility.Australian Heritage Council 2010 Aboriginal people in Arnhem adopted a number of items of Macassan material cultureWarner 1932Thompson 194Berndt and Berndt 1954Russell 2004 including dugout canoes and iron. This transformed Aboriginal economies so they had an increased marine focus. This is shown by the large numbers of dugong and turtle bones in middens on the Coburg Peninsula that date from the time of the Macassan trepang industryMitchell 1996and an increased marine focus on Groote Eylandt.Clarke 2000aClarke 2000b There is also evidence for changes in the way Aboriginal people used space and evidence for changes in their exchange networks.Mitchell 2000Clarke 2000aClarke 2000bMay et al. 2010 Aboriginal people living in Arnhem Land incorporated the memory of Macassans into their social and cultural life. For example, Macassans and their voyages are important in some ceremonies and song cycles where songs may reference Muslim prayers.Thompson 1949Berndt and Berndt 1954Russell 2004Macknight 2011 Oral tradition also provides accounts of Aboriginal people working for Macassans on trepang sites and undertaking voyages on praus to the Celebes and further afield.Berndt and Berndt 1954:43, 51-53Macknight and Gray 1970 The close relationship between Macassans and Aborigines is reflected in the large number of Macassan borrowed words found in Aboriginal languages in Arnhem Land and on Groote Eylandt which includes words for different parts of praus and the rigging on these vessels. Aboriginal people in these areas use the Macassan names for some parts of praus and their rigging that are depicted in rock art.Turner 1974: 54, 180-181  The stone pictures at Wurrwurrwuy  perahu, the padewakang The stone pictures at Wurrwurrwuy are part of the story of Macassan Aboriginal interactions in Arnhem Land. They lie within the territory of the Lamomirri clan but on the death of the last responsible Lamomirri man they were taken into the custody of the Gumatj clan. A father and son, Yumbul and Dhatalamirri, created the pictures, probably in the second half of the nineteenth century.Macknight and Gray: 1970 Oral histories recorded in 1967 indicate that Yumbul, possibly with the aid of some of his fellow clansmen, made the first pictures. The site was entrusted to his second son, Dhatalamirri, who added further pictures at a later date. The stone pictures created by Yumbul and Dhatalamirri depict Macassan praus, canoes, houses with multiple rooms, fireplaces where trepang were boiled, trepang drying houses, a house for storing wood, and stones for sharpening iron knives. There are also pictures of an Aboriginal fish trap and Aboriginal dwellings that may not have been made by the father and son. When Macknight and Grey recorded the site in 1967,Macknight and Grey 1970: 5 two Aboriginal informants, Munggurrawuy (a Gumatj custodian) and Mawalan (a relative of Yumbul and Dhatalamirri), were able to explain how the divisions within the pictures of the praus represented different parts of the vessel: the crews' quarters, the galley, the eating space, the store and the water tank. They also provided Macassan names for the different parts of praus, the rudder, bowsprit and the tripod mast with its sail and rigging. These pictures show that Yolngu visited trepang sites and spent enough time on praus to learn the various parts of the vessels and where the crew lived and ate. This is consistent with historical records showing that Aboriginal people travelled in praus to the Celebes,Berndt and Berndt 1954: 54-58Macknight 1972: 286 a trip that was made by Munggurrawuy's father.McKnight and Gray 1970: 6 The custodians told Macknight and Gray that Wurrwurrwuy was a legacy from the past with no sacred associations.Macknight and Gray 1970: 37 They felt that it was useful as it provided younger men with some idea of the way of life of Macassans who had come to the area to collect trepang. The pictures are a permanent reminder of Yolngu knowledge about this past.  Description  Map showing the Australian National Heritage List boundaries, 2013 Wurrwurrwuy stone arrangements is at about 1.41ha, 10km south east of Yirrkala, being those parts of Northern Territory Portions 1044 and 1692 designated Northern Territory Portion 6647(A). The stone pictures at Wurrwurrwuy that depict aspects of the Macassan trepang industry lie on an open rocky shelf about ten kilometres south east of Yirrkala in Eastern Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. The area is bounded to the north by a small creek: on the west by a strip of dense coastal vine thicket and to the east and south by the sea. The vegetation on the shelf is low grass and stunted shrubs. The stone pictures cover an area of about 80 metres by 70 metres. They are divided into three groups with a few outlying features. The group of pictures at the southern end of the site mainly depicts Macassan subjects in simple outlines. The northern group also depicts Macassan subjects, but the style is different, with stones of different sizes used to give weight to parts of the pictures. The western group comprises a mixture of Macassan and Aboriginal subjects.  Condition  When first recorded in the 1960s there was some minor damage to the site from buffalo mainly at the southern end, but there has been no evidence for subsequent deterioration. The site has been fenced and paths and interpretive signs have been installed. The place is maintained by Dhimurru Corporation Aboriginal Rangers. The stone pictures at Wurrwurrwuy are nationally significant as a rare example of stones arranged to depict secular subjects rather than the arranged stones being associated with ceremony and the sacred. The stone pictures depict a range of subjects including Aboriginal camps, fish traps and images relating to the Macassan trepang industry including praus, canoes, the stone fireplaces where trepang were boiled and Macassan houses. The depictions of praus at Wurrwurrwuy show the internal arrangements of the vessels, which is rare in Aboriginal depictions of praus in any medium. The creators of the stone pictures would have acquired their knowledge of the internal arrangement of praus during visits to, or voyages on, such vessels. Wurrwurrwuy stone arrangements was listed on the Australian National Heritage List on 9 August 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion B: Rarity The stone pictures at Wurrwurrwuy have outstanding heritage value to the nation as a rare example of stones arranged to depict utilitarian and secular objects rather than the arranged stones being associated with ceremony and the sacred. It is also a place with rare depictions of the internal arrangements in praus. This is knowledge that the creators would have acquired either during visits to or voyages on such vessels.

In 1919 the building was used in the filming of the now-lost silent film Anne of Green Gables, starring Mary Miles Minter. By the 1920s improvements in local highways led to reduced service on the Stoughton Branch, with both Springdale and West Stoughton in danger of being closed. They and other low- traffic stations were further endangered by the New Haven's 1935 bankruptcy.

As a two-year-old in 2018 she was one of the best fillies of her generation in Europe, winning the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes and the Prix Morny. Background Pretty Pollyanna is a bay filly with a white blaze and a white sock on her left foreleg bred by her owner Bill Gredley at his Stetchworth Stud near Newmarket, Suffolk. As a yearling the filly was put up for auction at Tattersalls in October 2017, but the bidding stopped short of the reserve price of 50,000 guineas. The filly was sent into training with Michael Bell at Newmarket. She was sired by Oasis Dream, a sprinter who won the July Cup and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 2003 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Midday, Muhaarar and Power. Pretty Pollyanna's dam Unex Mona Lisa was an unraced daughter of Friendlier who was a half-sister to Gredley's great racemare User Friendly. Racing career 2018: two-year-old season On her racecourse debut Pretty Pollyanna started a 14/1 outsider in an eight-runner maiden race over six furlongs at Yarmouth Racecourse on 15 June. Ridden by Hayley Turner she tracked the front-running favourite Assembly of Truth before taking the lead in the last quarter mile and despite veering left in the final furlong she won by half a length from Kareena Kapoor. Eight days after her win at Yarmouth the filly was stepped up sharply in class to contest the Group 3 Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot and was ridden for the first time by Silvestre de Sousa. Starting a 28/1 outsider she came home fifth of the eighteen runners behind Main Edition, La Pelosa, Fairyland and Angel's Hideaway. De Sousa was again in the saddle when the filly started at 20/1 for the Group 2 Duchess of Cambridge Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 13 July when her eight opponents included La Pelosa, Main Edition and Angel's Hideaway. Pretty Pollyanna took the lead two furlongs out and drew right away to win by seven lengths from Angel's Hideaway despite being eased down in the final strides. After the race Michael Bell said \\"It was very impressive. There was a little bit of scrimmaging in behind so some might have been closer, but either way it was a good time and she won very easily so you can't be more than very impressed with her. She was impressive at Yarmouth and Ascot last time was a learning curve for her. She has clearly improved a lot from Ascot, but she has only done one piece of easy work. There is a lot to look forward to\\". On 19 August Pretty Pollyanna was sent to France and matched against male opposition in the Group 1 Prix Morny over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse. Ridden by De Sousa she was made the 1.6/1 favourite against eight opponents including Land Force (winner of the Richmond Stakes), Signora Cabello (Queen Mary Stakes, Prix Robert Papin), Sexy Metro (Prix La Fl√®che) and Comedy (Prix de Cabourg). Racing down the centre of the wide track Pretty Pollyanna went to the front and half way and held off a sustained challenge from Signora Cabello to win by three quarters of a length, with the pair coming home well clear of the rest. De Sousa commented \\"She travelled well, like she did last time. Mr Bell said to keep it simple. She's an improving filly and did it the hard way. I think going up to a mile [for the 1000 Guineas] shouldn‚Äôt bother her\\". In the Group 1 Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket on 29 September Pretty Pollyanna started the 6/4 favourite but despite staying on well in the closing stages she never looked likely to win and came home fourth behind Fairyland, The Mackem Bullet and So Perfect, beaten one and three quarter lengths by the winner. Two weeks later at the same track, the filly was stepped up in distance for the Group 1 Fillies' Mile in which she was partnered by Danny Tudhope. She disputed the lead from the start and went to the front approaching the last quarter mile but was overtaken in the final furlong and finished third behind the Irish-trained fillies Iridessa and Hermosa. 2019: three-year-old season On 26 May Pretty Pollyanna made her three-year-old debut at the Curragh in the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile when she was ridden by Frankie Dettori and started at odds of 9/1 in a ten-runner field. After racing just behind the leaders she kept on well in the closing stages to finish second behind Hermosa. She faced Hermosa again in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot but after leading for most of the way she faded badly in the closing stages and came home seventh of the nine runners. The filly then reverted to sprint distances and was matched against older horses and male opposition in the July Cup at Newmarket in which she finished fourth to Ten Sovereigns, Advertise and Fairyland. At Deauville in August she was beaten less than two and a half lengths when running sixth to Advertise in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. Later that month Pretty Pollyanna was dropped back to Listed class for the Hopeful Stakes at Newmarket and started 10/11 favourite against nine opponents. She took the lead inside the final furlong but was caught near the finish and beaten a head by the six- year-old gelding Raucous.

VBSDC is the first planetary science instrument to built by students. The dust counter was launched in 2006, and named later that year after Venetia Burney, the young girl who originally named Pluto. The detector works when dust strikes films of polarized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which generates an electrical charge. The space dust is then detected over the course of the New Horizons spacecraft flight out of the Solar System and past Pluto. Overview In 2010, VBSDC collected data on dust past 18 AU (1.67 billion miles), which is the distance the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 dust counters stopped working. Five other spacecraft have carried dust detectors beyond the asteroid belt including Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Ulysses (heliocentric orbit out to the distance of Jupiter), Galileo (Jupiter Orbiter), and Cassini (Saturn orbiter). The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft did detect dust by using data from the Plasma Wave instrument, but did not have dedicated dust detection instruments. The Pioneer dust detectors stopped working at 18 AU. The impacts of the dust is calculated to provide the mass and the velocity of the dust. One of the natural structures of the Solar System the VBSDC is design to detect, is the Zodiacal cloud. The instrument is designed to detect dust between 10 ng and 10 pg in mass and between 0.5 and 10 Œºm in size. By December 2008 it had taken dust measurements between 1.2 and 11.0 AU from the Sun. By April 2012, the dust counter had produced data up to 23 AU. The direction of the dust impact is calculated by noting what direction the instrument is facing due to the orientation of the spacecraft. The instrument has very low power consumption. Examples of periods of Measurements: *6.76-7.10 A.U. *9.02-9.91 A.U. *10.01-10.80 A.U. *11.91-13.84 A.U. *14.29-15.51 A.U Data collected in the inner Solar System was compared to similar data from Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft. VBSDC recorded the first measurements of sub-micron space dust in the outer Solar System. In the outer Solar System VBSDC recorded an average flux of dust of grain size larger than 2 √ó 10‚àí12 grams of 2.5 √ó 10‚àí4 m‚àí2 s‚àí1. The dust detection within the orbit of Jupiter registered by the VBSDC were compared to previous observations by dust detectors on the Ulysses and Galileo spacecraft. The results from VBSDC were consistent with the previously recorded data. The VBSDC was designed and is operated by students, and between 2002 and 2010 there were 32 students that worked on the project. By the 2010 there was team about half-a-dozen students working on the mission, but at the team was as large as 20 students at its start. The students were typically undergraduate or graduate level, with participants rotated in and out of the project over time. Naming In June 2006 the student dust counter was named in honor of Venetia Phair (n√©e Burney) who came up with the name Pluto in the 1930s as a girl, and she was given a plaque related to this naming in December, 2006. Venetia suggested the name Pluto after the discovery of the new planet by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 at Lowell Observatory. The name Pluto was selected in a vote by the observatory's astronomers. In 2006 , the NH Principal Investigator was able to present Venetia with a plaque about the naming of the Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter after her. Previously the instrument was called the Student Dust Counter.

The official figure is used here. was a Canadian bryologist specializing in mosses and liverworts native to Nova Scotia. She concentrated her collecting work on Cape Breton, but also collected specimens from Trinidad, Puerto Rico, Spain, France, and Jamaica.  Family and early life  Margaret Sibella Brown's parents were Richard Henry Brown (1837-1920) and Barbara Davison (1842-1898). Margaret Sibella had a twin sister (Elizabeth Purves), and three other siblings (Annie, Richard Charles, and Lillian Seward). The Brown family lived in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia. Brown had a paternal aunt who was also named Margaret Sibella Brown (1836-1854). Sibella Annie Barrington was a distant cousin. The name Sibella or Sibyl in the Brown family is traced back to Isabella French (born about 1731 or 1732), wife of John Barrington.  Education  Brown attended the Anglican School for Girls in Halifax. She earned a B.A. at Kings' College. She attended the Anglo-German Institute finishing school in Stuttgart, Germany. After returning to Nova Scotia in 1885, she attended the Victoria School of Art and Design.  Scientific career  There is little contemporaneous record of Brown's scientific career. There is one known paper she published in 1937, in which she categorized a collection of moss samples gathered in Syria by William Bacon Evans. She is known to have worked with Elizabeth Gertrude Britton, Nathaniel Lord Britton, and Joseph Edward Little, as co-collectors of specimens. One expedition with Elizabeth and Nathaniel Britton, to Puerto Rico, was undertaken in January 1922, with a planned duration of ten weeks. The results of that expedition were presented in April of that year.  Society and board memberships  Brown was a member of the Moss Exchange Club (later known as the British Bryological Society) and the Sullivant Moss Society (later known as the American Bryological and Lichenological Society). She was president of the Halifax Floral Society. She was a member of the Nova Scotian Institute of Science; when she died at the age of 95, she was the oldest living member. Brown served on the board of the Victoria School of Art and Design (later known as NSCAD University or Nova Scotia College of Art and Design), and was a member of their education committee. During World War I, she was honorary secretary of the Halifax Branch of the Canadian Red Cross Society.  Awards  Brown was awarded an honorary M.A. from Acadia University on May 16, 1950, at the age of 84. She had been offered an honorary Ph.D., which she declined and accepted the M.A. instead. In 1934, she was awarded an honorary diploma from the Victoria School of Art and Design. Brown was inducted into the Nova Scotia Scientific Hall of Fame in 2010.

And it is in Ohafia Local Government Area.  History  Nkporo is said to be one of the oldest communities among clans that are referred to by Anthropologists and Sociologists as the Cross River Igbos. The movement of the main body of Nkporo people and the eventual opening and settling in their present-day location took almost three hundred and fifty years. Nkporo people came from a group of people who were mainly from a single sanguinary stock which lived together with some offspring of the same ancestor, who later evolved as the Efiks within the Nkanal Ikot or Okoro Nkon Ikpe zone of the present Ibibio or Efik land. The first settlement of the Nkporo people was called Ama Mpoto which means \\"mpoto square\\". The leader of the people was named Okwo Nkwoghoro who was popularly called \\"Okwe\\" in abbreviation. It was believed that before moving to Okpukpu-Iyi Aro, Okwo Nkwoghoro begat Iwowo also known as \\"Iwo\\" who in turn begat Aja. From Ama Mpoto, Nkporo people migrated to Okpukpu-Iyi Aro which is believed to be around the present Amuvi village in Arochukwu. Many reasons were responsible for this movement but some of the major reasons are; as the population of the people increased, the need for a larger space that will accommodate its growing population arose, inter tribal war between the Nkporo people and Afachima Achi the then leader of the Ibibios, and as well as the issue of settling in a more fertile and fruitful land which was also paramount in the minds of the people. Iwo was a very skilled diplomat and he enjoyed a good relationship with the Ibibio king, Afachima Achi. They both respected their friendship and enjoying peace until Iwoo died and his son Aja who was young and full of youthful exuberance succeeded his father. Being a young man, Aja was not as tolerant and wise as his late father in his dealings with the older Ibibio king and he did not hide it. Nkporo people are war-like in nature and this also did not allow the young Aja to sustain the cordial relationship that existed between them and the Ibibios in his late father's years. The people of Nkporo always found themselves at loggerheads with the Ibibio warriors under the leadership of Afachima Achi and they strongly believe where they were was not their promise land. All these factors made it imminent for them to move from Ama Mpoto to Okpukpu Iyi Aro. They lived here for a very long time before moving to Ugwu Iyi Ekirika which is around the present Nde Okpo Ihechiowa, where it is believed that a group that still calls itself Nkporo was left behind. From there they continued to Ugwu Isiagha located between Ihechiowa and the present Nde Uduma Awoke village from were they moved out again and established a place called Udara Ebuo Elu. At this time the Aja who led the people out from Ama Mpoto was no longer alive but due to how famous he became as a no-nonsense war-like leader who dealt with the Ibibio people and their king, he had already earned the name \\"Nkporo\\" for his people, \\"Nkporo\\" is an Ibibio language which means \\"Buffalo\\", the Ibibios referred to king Aja (Eze-Aja) and his people as Nkporo due to how they battle and destroy their enemies without mercy. Before his death, King Aja was very popular especially in Okpukpu-Iyi Aro when Afachima Achi sent a message to the king of Arochukwu advising him to always make sure he is at peace with king Aja whom he described as \\"Nkporo\\" ( Buffalo ) that is war-like and ever ready to fight, and that is the reason behind the cordial relationship and friendship between the people of Arochukwu and the people of Nkporo till date. In Okpukpu-Iyi Aro, Aja was being referred to as Eze-Aja while his people were being referred to as the Nkporo people, over time these names became adopted and till date anyone who ascends the throne of the Nkporo ancient kingdom is being referred to as the Eze-Aja of Nkporo. Geography Nkporo is one of the three clans that make up Ohafia Local Government Area of Abia state Nigeria, the other two being Abiriba and Ohafia. Nkporo is bounded on the South by Abiriba, on the west by Item on the North by Akaeze and Oso-Edda, on the East by Edda, and on the South East by Ohafia.

The first emblem of the city was approved in 1840, changed in 1890, 1967, and 2001. The dimensions of the emblem are: width ‚Äì 100 mm, height ‚Äì 140 mm. Description and symbolism The field of the emblem of Baku is blue. The field is charged with three golden flames and three wavy horizontal stripes that symbolize the waters of the Caspian Sea. The flames refer to the country's nickname, The Land of Fire. The field is surrounded by a thin golden contour. In the bottom part of the emblem, the black-colored area indicates the presence of petroleum. History Coat of arms of Baku Governorate, Russian Empire In 1841, General Golovin, commander-in-chief of the Caucasus, and Senator Gan, chairman of the Commission for Establishing Governance of the Transcaucasian region appointed by Russian Tsar, Nikolai II, notified the capital that the Caspian region (including Baku), and the other Caucasian districts did not have any coat of arms. On 21 May 1843, Tsar approved a coat of arms for the Georgian-Imeretian governorate and the Caspian region (which included Baku). The first coat of arms of Baku city was in the form of a shield, divided in two. The upper half contained a golden background and the lower part had a blue background. The figures used in emblem included a camel carrying saffron, a tiger, burning gas that bursting from the ground, and an anchor. The 1843 Baku coat of arms did not directly represent the city. On 16 March 1883, a new coat of arms for Baku city designed and received imperial approval. The coat of arms designed in1883 resembled a black shield with three golden flames on it. On the top emblem, there was a golden crown with two turrets and it was flanked by two golden spikes. The coat of arms of Baku also included a black shield with three golden flames which signified the natural resources such as oil and gas of the Absheron peninsula. After the Soviets came to power, all the symbols were changed in the Azerbaijani heraldic coat of arms, as in other Soviet republics. In addition, the city and region's emblems were redesigned. The emblem which previously designed in 1883, was adopted on April 14, 1967, with some modifications, and finally, in 1975, some additions were made. In 1967, three golden flames on the emblem were not changed but stylized. In addition, five sea waves were added to the lower part of the emblem.

It served in the Liverpool Blitz and later in the Faroe Islands, the Middle East and North Africa. Postwar it continued in the TA until 1955. Origin Anti-Aircraft (AA) units of the TA were mobilised during the Munich Crisis of 1938. Although they were stood down after just three weeks, the crisis accelerated the expansion of AA defences for Britain's cities.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. On 1 November the Liverpool-based 70th (West Lancashire) AA Regiment formed an additional battery (267 (Wirral) AA Battery) across the River Mersey in Birkenhead on the Wirral Peninsula of Cheshire. After Munich, the TA was doubled in size, and on 1 April 1939, 267 (Wirral) AA Bty provided the cadre for a new 93rd Anti-Aircraft Regiment. The new unit was based in Birkenhead with the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 756, 778.Monthly Army List, May 1939.Litchfield, p. 32.93 HAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. * Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) at Birkenhead * 267 (Wirral) AA Bty at Birkenhead * 288 AA Bty at Birkenhead * 289 AA Bty at Birkenhead * 290 AA Bty at Chester The commanding officer (CO) was Lieutenant-Colonel A.F. Behrend, and among the new officers appointed to the unit on 15 April 1939 was Second lieutenant Howard Erskine Johnston; he later commanded 103rd HAA Rgt and an AA Assault Group at the D-Day landings. Most of the recruits for 93rd AA Rgt came from the shipping and insurance offices and banks of Liverpool. World War II Mobilisation In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August the whole of Anti-Aircraft Command was fully mobilised, ahead of the declaration of war.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 93rd AA Regiment formed part of the Liverpool-based 33rd (Western) Anti- Aircraft Brigade in 4th Anti-Aircraft Division.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LX, p. 378. Phoney War Christmas lunch for the men of 289 AA Bty, 93rd AA Rgt, at New Ferry near Birkenhead, 14 December 1940. At this point the Gun Defended Area (GDA) around Liverpool had a strength of just 19 Heavy AA (HAA) guns (3-inch, 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch), plus three guns out of action.Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376; Table LIX p. 377. During the period of the Phoney War, the AA defences of NW England were not tested in action, and the time was spent in equipping and training the TA units. On 1 June 1940, the Royal Artillery's AA Regiments were redesignated Heavy AA (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light AA (LAA) regiments being formed. By the start of the Battle of Britain, in July 1940, the number of HAA guns deployed in the Liverpool GDA had reached 52.Farndale, p. 106.Collier, Appendix IX. The first Luftwaffe attack on Liverpool came on 28 August, and there were a number of raids thereafter.Collier, Chapter XIII.Collier, Chapter XVI.Collier, Appendix XIV.Collier, Appendix XV. Liverpool Blitz Victoria Monument in foreground, the burned-out shell of the Custom House in middle distance Another panoramic view, looking towards the River Mersey The cities of NW England were heavily bombed during the winter of 1940‚Äì41 (the Liverpool Blitz and Manchester Blitz) and 'the actions fought [by the AA batteries] were as violent, dangerous and prolonged as any in the field'. The wide Mersey Estuary left a gap in the Liverpool defences that could not be fully covered by AA guns, and by mid-1941 AA Command had begun constructing three Maunsell Forts in the estuary on which to mount AA guns.Routledge, pp. 394‚Äì5. The night raids continued into the following Spring, during which period Liverpool and its docks along the Mersey became the most heavily bombed area of Britain outside London, with particularly heavy attacks in December 1940 (the Christmas Blitz); in April 1941; and again the following month (the May Blitz).Collier, Chapter XVII.Collier, Appendix XXX. Mid-war When the Blitz ended in May 1941, 93rd HAA Rgt was still in 33 AA Bde, and this continued to be the case for over a year.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80. The regiment sent two cadres to 211th HAA Training Regiment at Oswestry to provide the basis for new batteries: 392 HAA Bty was formed on 14 November 1940 and later joined 117th HAA Rgt, while 426 HAA Bty formed on 24 April 1941 and joined 126th HAA Rgt. Later it sent another cadre to 206th HAA Training Rgt at Arborfield for 484 (Mixed) HAA Bty formed on 25 September 1941 for 139th (Mixed) HAA Rgt ('Mixed' units were those into which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated). A final cadre went to 210th HAA Training Rgt at Oswestry for 522 (M) HAA Bty, formed on 15 January 1942 for 154th (M) HAA Rgt.Frederick, pp. 758‚Äì60. In May 1942 the regiment was joined by 416 HAA Bty, which had previously been in 81st HAA Rgt in 4 AA Division. As the flow of new AA units from the training centres continued, experienced units began to be prepared for overseas service, and 93rd was one of these, but units under training for overseas service were often lent back to AA Command. In June, 93rd HAA Rgt moved to 70 AA Bde, and the following month to 44 AA Bde, both still within 4 AA Division in NW England, but by now 416 HAA Bty had transferred to 115th HAA Rgt. 290 HAA Battery was the first part of the original regiment to go overseas, being sent to the Faroe Islands (see below). From the end of August 1942 the rest of the regiment was unbrigaded, (with a brief return to 33 AA Bde during September), before leaving AA Command entirely in December. It then came under direct War Office control until February 1943, when it embarked for the Middle East.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 22 November 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/8 and WO 33/1962. 290 Heavy Anti- Aircraft Battery, RA Preserved 3.7-inch HAA gun on static mount. During 1940 a British force had occupied the Danish Faroe Islands to prevent the Germans using them as a base for attacks on the North Atlantic convoys. The first LAA detachments arrived in July 1941 and immediately came under attack from long-range Junkers Ju 88 bombers based in Norway. The defences were built up slowly: the Royal Engineers built an airfield at Vaago (the modern V√°gar Airport). On 1 July 1942, 290 HAA Bty arrived, with 3.7-inch guns. It deployed one 4-gun Troop at Vaago, and the other at the islands' capital at Thorshavn. The guns were on static mountings, for which sites had to be prepared with access roads, emplacements and hutting. These were constructed over two months by Faroese labor. The battery had two GL Mk II gun-laying radar sets and a semi-automatic plotter that gave the guns the ability to engage unseen targets in cloud or at night, there being no searchlights available.Routledge, pp. 209‚Äì10. On 22 July the battery absorbed two sections of 434 HAA Bty from 70th (West Lancs) HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 758. In December 1942, 178th HAA Rgt HQ arrived to take command of the AA units in the islands, and 290 HAA Bty was regimented with that unit. A Gun Operations Room (GOR) was established at Thorshavn.Frederick, p. 795.Joslen, p. 561. There were almost daily overflights by Ju 88 or Dornier Do 17 bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, but these were mixed with friendly aircraft on patrol or Search and rescue missions, and permission to engage was often denied by the Royal Air Force station commander at Vaago. On many occasions the target could be heard but not seen, or only glimpsed through a break in the clouds. Although the HAA guns fired three or four times in a typical month, often causing the targets to take evasive action, there were no confirmed 'kills'. By December 1943 the air threat to the Faroes had diminished, and the defences could be reduced. 290 HAA Bty handed over four 3.7-inch guns to a newly-formed composite 507 AA Bty, and returned to the UK on 19 March 1943 with 178th HAA Rgt. 178th HAA Regiment was disbanded in May 1944.Fardale, Annex M. Middle East 3.7-inch HAA gun in North Africa. 93rd HAA Regiment, with 267, 288 and 289 Btys under command, arrived by May 1943 and joined 2 AA Bde in Middle East Forces (MEF). The North African Campaign was just ending with the capture of Tunis and 2 AA Bde was responsible for AA Defence Area Tripolitania. However, it was withdrawn this month for its units to train for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky).Joslen, pp. 484‚Äì5.Routledge, Table XXV, p. 164. In the event, 93rd HAA Rgt did not accompany 2 AA Bde when it went to Sicily.Routledge, Table XLII, p. 267. but remained with MEF. The Middle East AA Group still had considerable commitments in the Levant, in Egypt, and along the North African Coast. It was also preparing to provide AA cover for Operation Hercules, a planned landing on Rhodes following the failure of the Dodecanese Campaign, and aimed at getting Turkey into the war. This was called off in February 1944.Routledge, Table XXVI, p. 165.Molony, p. 574. By now, the air threat to the Middle East bases was low and by July 1944 AA manpower was being diverted to other tasks.Routledge, pp. 160‚Äì1. 93rd HAA Rgtand its three batteries was placed in suspended animation and disappeared from the order of battle on 12 August 1944. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment was reformed at Birkenhead as 493rd (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment (the 'Mixed' now indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit). It formed part of 59 AA Bde (the prewar 33 (Western) AA Bde) at Liverpool.Frederick, p. 1018.Watson, TA 1947.474‚Äì519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.Litchfield, Appendix 5.30‚Äì67 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 onwards. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, and there were wholescale mergers among TA AA units. 493rd HAA Regiment amalgamated with 349 Field and 576 (5th North Staffords) LAA/SL Rgts as 441st Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery, with 493rd contributing Q (Wirral) Battery to the combined regiment.3 (M) HAA Rgt 1 January 1947414‚Äì443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.Frederick, p. 1014.Litchfield, p. 215. 441st LAA Regiment was broken up again in 1961: the North Staffs btys reverted to the infantry role and merged with 6th Bn North Staffordshire Regiment, while Q (Wirral) Bty joined 287th Medium Rgt as R (Wirral) Bty. The battery disappeared in 1967 when 287 Rgt was reduced to a single Bty in the West Lancashire Rgt RA as part of TAVR.Frederick, p. 1002.Litchfield, pp. 120‚Äì1.

Her debut novel, Everything Under, was shortlisted for the 2018 Man Booker Prize, and beside Eleanor Catton is the youngest nominee in the prize's history. For her short stories, she has won three awards since 2014.  Biography  Johnson was born in Paignton, Devon, in 1990 and grew up around Saffron Walden, Essex. She earned her bachelor's degree in English and Creative Writing from Lancaster University before earning a master's degree in Creative Writing at Somerville College, Oxford, where she also worked at Blackwell's bookshop. While at Oxford, she won the 2014 AM Heath Prize for fiction while working on her first short story collection, and had short stories published in The Warwick Review and the Boston Review. Shortly after, she won the 2016 Harper's Bazaar short story prize for \\"What The House Remembers\\". In 2015, she won a two-book deal with publisher Jonathan Cape for a collection of short stories and a novel. The short story collection titled Fen was published in 2017. Set in the fens of England, it draws upon the memories of the area where Johnson grew up. It comprises a set of linked short stories, focusing on the experiences of women and girls in a small town. Johnson describes the collection as liminal and mythic. The collection won the 2017 Edge Hill Short Story Prize. Johnson followed Fen with her debut novel, Everything Under, in 2018. The novel focuses on the relationship between Gretel, a lexicographer, and her mother and is set against a backdrop of the British countryside. Gretel grows up on a canal boat with her mother and they invent a language to use between them. Gretel's mother abandons her when Gretel is sixteen, and the novel starts sixteen years later with a phone call. Johnson worked on the novel for around four years, starting it at the same time as her short story collection to challenge herself to write something longer. She went through at least five drafts of the book (which she has said had seeds in her studies of the Greek myth of king Oedipus), made several changes to characters and setting, and for a period, it was titled Eggtooth. Everything Under was shortlisted for the 2018 Man Booker Prize. Johnson is the youngest author to be shortlisted for the prize. Johnson currently lives in Oxford. Her favourite writers include Stephen King, Evie Wyld, Helen Oyeyemi and John Burnside. Her favourite poets include Robin Robertson and Sharon Olds. Had she been unsuccessful as a writer, Johnson suggests that she would have been a shepherd.

Colonisation focused on Finnish archipelago and some of its coastal regions. The colonisation led to the beginning of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland. The settlers were from central Sweden. It has been estimated that there were thousands of settlers. History The reason behind the colonisation was the pursuit of the Roman Catholic Church to spread its faith to pagan lands around the Baltic Sea. The settlers were Christians and they arrived to lands that were still in major parts under Finnish paganism. Besides the Catholic Church, the colonisation was supported by the still primal Swedish Kingdom who granted four years of tax exemption to any Christian Swede who settled the areas of Southwest Finland, Uusimaa, √Öland, Tavastia or Satakunta. The colonisation was also affected by the favorable climate phase in Europe. The warm climate phase of 980‚Äì1250 had led to population growth, which led to the need for emigration. At the same time Swedes also emigrated to northern Sweden and western Estonia (see Estonian Swedes). In the 14th century Swedes also colonised Medelpad and √Öngermanland. Besides the violence of the crusades, the colonisation led to several conflicts between the settlers and Finns. The settlers needed support from Sweden in many areas against the Finns. The native inhabitants in many coastal areas also lost their fishing and farming rights, which led to conflicts.

N. Woolley is a neuroscientist and Professor of Psychology at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute. Her work centers on the neuroscience of communication, using songbirds to understand how the brain learns and understands vocal communication.  Academic career  Woolley received her Bachelors of Arts in 1991 from University of Colorado Boulder, studying biology and psychology. She then attended the University of Washington School of Medicine, where she received her PhD in 1999 in neurobiology and Behavior in the laboratory of Edwin Rubel. Her research centered on how Bengalese finches learn and maintain songs. She found that while male Bengalese finches do not typically change their song patterns in adulthood, their song patterns require auditory feedback. As a result, if a finch becomes deaf, his song will degrade in about one week. Woolley, however, found that not all sound frequencies are required to maintain a male finch's song. Finches that lost the ability to hear in high-frequency ranges maintained their ability to sustain a consistent song pattern. She also noted that these finches can regenerate auditory hair cells, which can restore hearing within eight weeks following damage to them. For her postdoctoral fellowship, she stayed at the University of Washington, where she performed work to understand the avian auditory midbrain (or the mesencephalicus lateralis, dorsalis, MLd) of zebra finches, which processes multiple parallel inputs and conveys that processed information to the forebrain. She noted that different tones were processed over time in the auditory midbrain and found that this brain region is well-suited to encoding complex sounds with a high degree of temporal accuracy, rather than just responding to specific sound cues. In 2001, Woolley began a second postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied the way zebra finches were able to distinguish vocalizations of specific individuals and also differentiate vocalizations from other sounds. She found that the finch's auditory neurons were better able to more accurately distinguish between different zebra finch songs than between synthetic sound segments, suggesting that their neurons are more finely tuned to understanding finch vocalizations. She looked at how single neurons and populations of neurons in the auditory midbrain encode song versus generic noise. She found that the majority of auditory midbrain neurons were able to consistently and precisely tune in to finch vocalizations, while they exhibited a high degree of variability in response to generic noise.  Research  In 2006, Woolley joined the faculty at Columbia University in the Department of Psychology. Between 2013 and 2016 she served as Chairperson for the department and in 2014 became an elected member of the Kavli Institute for Brain Science. Her lab studies the underlying neuroscience of the ways bengalese, zebra, and long-tailed finches learn, perform, and understand vocalizations as a model to better understand how humans communicate through sound in a variety of contexts. Her lab has studied the effects of song upon mating choice. All songbird brains are finely tuned to convert sound waves to social messages. Woolley's group found that male and female brains are tuned and wired in different ways. Her research is supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.

Known for her work in algebraic geometry, she also wrote noted histories of mathematicians, like Maria Gaetana Agnesi and Luca Pacioli. She was a member of the and won both the Bordoni Prize and Torelli Prize for her work. Early life Giuseppina Biggiogero was born on 8 August 1894 in Melegnano, Italy to Marta (n√©e Massironi) and Biagio Biggiogero. She completed her primary and secondary studies in Lodi, earning a degree as a teacher in 1912. While continuing her studies at the Carlo Cattaneo Technical Institute, she began teaching elementary school, first in Carpiano and later in Melegnano. At the time that she was studying, the only paths available to enter university were to obtain a high school diploma, which was not typically available to women, or to obtain a degree from a technical institute. In 1916, Biggiogero earned her certificate with a specialty in physics and mathematics. Receiving a scholarship to attend the Politecnico di Milano in 1917, she quit her teaching post. She initially began her studies in engineering, but in 1918 moved to the mathematics courses. Because the Politecnico did not offer a specific curriculum for math, she transferred in 1919 to the University of Pavia, where she studied under the instruction of . She graduated in 1921, obtaining her diploma for teaching in pure mathematics. Working as an assistant to the professors Luigi Berzolari and Francesco Gerbaldi, Biggiogero published two works on real algebraic curves, which were recognized with the Bordoni and Torelli prizes. Her 1922 book, was titled Sulle curve piane, algebriche, reali che presentano massimi d'inclusione and she published Gruppi di massimi d'inclusione per curve piane, algebriche, reali, d'ordine n in 1923. Career In 1924, eager to work with Oscar Chisini, Biggiogero returned to Milan and was appointed as his assistant and the professor for the descriptive and projective geometry courses at the Politecnico di Milano. From 1927, she also gave lectures at the Mathematical and Physical Seminary of Milan, which was founded in that year, and taught higher and projective geometry courses at the University of Milan. She was assigned as the editor of the mathematical entries in the Enciclopedia Italiana (Italian Encyclopedia, 1933) and reviewed the first sixteen volumes of the work, focusing on the compilations of Federigo Enriques. In 1939, Biggiogero married Arnaldo Masotti, a fellow academic, who at the time was the professor of Rational Mechanics in the Faculty of Architecture. She was made chair of Geometry at the Politecnico in 1948 and retained that post until her retirement in 1969. In addition to lecturing on descriptive geometry in the mathematics department, she taught projective geometry to the students in the architectural and engineering departments. Biggiogero's research produced a large body of work on algebraic geometry, including research on the shapes and bundles of algebraic curves, tensorial calculations, Hessian singularities of curves and the construction of the triple and quadruple planes. She and Chisini co-published several works together, including two textbooks Lezioni di geometria descrittiva (Lessons of Descriptive Geometry) published in 1941 and Esercizi di geometria descrittiva (Exercises of Descriptive Geometry), produced in 1946. As a secondary path, she researched algebraic differentials, studying transversals, including Liouville's and Reiss' theorems, as well as the invariant theory of Enrico Bompiani. She was also one of the first scholars in Italy to study integral geometry. She published works which summarized the results of Morgan Crofton, Henri Lebesgue, and Luis Santal√≥, presenting new formulas for determining ovals and ellipses. Also concerned with the history of mathematics, Biggiogero published studies on the geometry of the triangle and the tetrahedron, in conjunction with Virginio Retali for the Encyclopedia of Elementary Mathematics. She wrote a biography of Luca Pacioli and with her husband produced a study on Maria Gaetana Agnesi and her works. In 1949, she was made a member of the and was also a member of , the Italian Society of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. In 1974, Clifford Truesdell, editor-in-chief of the Archive for History of Exact Sciences, dedicated volume 14 to Biggiogero and her husband in recognition of their scholarship. Death and legacy Biggiogero died after a lengthy illness in Milan on 24 October 1977. Posthumously, a street in her home town of Melegnano was named in her honor.

In 2013, he became the first Korean to climb all of the world's 14 mountains over 8,000 metres without using supplementary oxygen; in doing so he also set the record for completing the feat in the shortest time. His new world record of seven years, 10 months and six days was over a month quicker than the previous one, held by Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland. Unusually, Kim used an \\"eco-friendly\\" approach, taking 60 days to reach the Mount Everest base camp using \\"kayak, bicycle and foot\\" rather than flying to Lukla. He was killed, along with several others including fellow South Korean climbers and local mountain guides, in Nepal in 11 October 2018, when a snowstorm destroyed the 3500m-altitude base camp beneath Mount Gurja in the Dhaulagiri.  Early life  Kim Chang-ho was born in a rural town of Yecheon- gun at around the center of South Korea, July 13, 1969. Kim was in no sense an outstanding personality during his juvenile years. He performed well in his intramural hand-ball team in his elementary school, playing at the province- level sports festival.  Mountaineering Experience   University Alpine Club  In 1988, he entered the University of Seoul with a major in international trade. It was only in the year of 2013, however, after 25 years since he entered the university, when he graduated. This was because he participated in three international expeditions during his undergraduate years. He said for the reason why he decided to complete his undergraduate degree that he needed to learn more in humanities for the sake of climbing. Due to the curriculum change his bachelor's degree was not international trade but business administration. In the first year he temporarily joined a student club that concerns philosophical and social issues and another associated to the campus newspaper publisher. Yet once he joined the university's alpine club, he fell deeply into the world of climbing and mountaineering. He appreciated his undergraduate education in international trade expanding his knowledge in geography. In the 1980s, university alpine clubs across South Korea offered a distinctive niche for those unable to find from elsewhere a solution for sociopolitical and existential crises. South Korea's collegiate culture in the late 1980s reached the culmination of two decades of civil conflict for democracy. Common among university students were lively debates and strong moral convictions for fellow citizens‚Äô rights and well-being. On the other hand, the drastic economic advancement and relative wealth combined with the nationalistic agenda had bolstered a firm ground for the explosive boom of Himalayan expeditions. Financially as well as ideologically supported by well-off graduates and outdoor corporations, most university alpine clubs were eager to send undergraduate members to the Alps, Yosemite, Denali, and most notably the Himalaya. In the 1990s, Kim, then a fine climber racking up 5.12 on rock, participated in two Karakoram expeditions organized by University of Seoul Alpine Club: Great Trango (6286m, 1993) and Gasherbrum IV (7925m, 1996). In both expeditions Kim climbed at the forefront. Meanwhile, his competent climbs often exhibited recklessness. An audacious penchant characterized Kim's as well as part of his club's approach to mountaineering, and it was seldom regarded anomalous or unwarranted within the grandiose alpine-club culture in his generation. In the impregnable east face of Gasherbrum IV, for example, Kim's pair climbed up to 7450m.According to Lee Gye-Nam, the leader of the University of Seoul Gasherbrum IV Expedition in 1996, 7,450 m is the best measure of the height Kim reached. While Kim stated in the interview with Monthly Magazine Mountain in 2013 that he climbed another 20 m from 7,450 m, Lee said \\"the pitch was short and they were unable to proceed far from the belay point.\\" The leader Kim faced an impasse: the rocky face was crystal solid, with no crack to secure protection. ‚ÄúLet the rope go if I got a fall!‚Äù shouted the gutty young Kim to his belayer. Years later Kim referred to this and other moments in the 90s as ‚Äúmy immature younger years when I pursued only great achievements on mountains.‚Äù  Pakistan Exploration  In no sense Kim garnered special attention until the summer of 2000 when he ventured a monumental, unprecedented project of exploration to Karakoram. Before this, he worked at a small outdoor company for two years, and then devoted one full year to study Karakoram geography and climbing history. And he left for Pakistan, alone. In total of about 1700 days from 2000 to 2004, Kim surveyed virtually every mountain range across Karakoram, Hindukush, and Pamir in northern Pakistan. He walked every mid- and large-sized glacier, crossed numerous passes across, thoroughly investigated and took photos of mountain formations and almost every known or unknown peak that seemed to him noteworthy for climbing. In several cases he was first to step in the deepest side of remote glaciers, or second to the first Western explorers in the nineteenth century. Also, he collected local names of the peaks, passes, and glaciers, and meticulously compared them with those in several different maps of the regions. He read books and reports on Karakoram exploration, in English and Japanese; collected about five thousand books mostly on the particular subject; and picked up words of nine local languages used around northern Pakistan enough to communicate with villagers and herders. While in villages, he labored for and stayed with the residents, enabling himself to converse long hours in order to collect geographic information and regional myths associated with the mountain landscape surrounding. Kim published some of his findings and experiences in the format of travel report series in Monthly Magazine Mountain, from 2002 to 2006‚Äîhe from then on published many other climbing reports in this magazine based in Seoul. Laconic and unassuming, however, he was known to have hardly boasted or exaggerated his own accomplishments on mountains, in both his writing and informal conversations, remaining for years a man unpopular in the mountaineering community. He had also apparently suffered economic hardship during this time. He further shared his findings with many Korean expeditioners, suggesting new peaks to climb, giving advice for climbing strategy, such as the first ascent of Amphu I (6740m) in Nepal by three Korean mountaineers. One of the vignettes that shows how meticulous he was to his exploratory climbs was when he had to name two peaks he made the first ascent in the Chiantar valley, Hindu Raj (a mountain range between Hindu Kush and Karakoram) in 2003. The two peaks are 6189m and 6105m high each. The first peak is labeled in Tsuneo Miyamori's map published in 2001 as ‚ÄúSuj Sar SW,‚Äù pairing with a 6177m-peak named ‚ÄúSuj Sar NE.‚Äù In Kim's view this naming was inappropriate. These two peaks are, in his view, completely separate and independent from each other, thus unnatural to classify them in the same group. Also, Kim observed, ‚ÄúSar‚Äù means peak in Wakhi language, which was no longer used in the villages where the peak is viewed. Instead, Shina is the vernacular language. In Shina, a distinct peak is called ‚ÄúKor.‚Äù The second peak Kim climbed was labeled in the map as ‚ÄúKoh-I Haiz.‚Äù Descending from the peaks to the village, Kim consulted a local expert on their naming. Since each peak is located closely to Atar Sar and Haiz Gah, Kim and the informed villager came up with new names: ‚ÄúAtar Kor‚Äù and ‚ÄúHaiz Kor,‚Äù respectively. His leavings included books, journals, rolls of films and the digital database of 2.4 terabyte. Kim's climbing mate and biographer, Young-Hoon Oh, argues, \\"As far as I know, in the mountain ranges in northern Pakistan no one has ever ventured a geographic exploration in such a massive scale and in such a meticulous manner, nor anyone or any institution has accumulated mountaineering geographic information of the area in such comprehensiveness and detail.\\" At the time of his death, Kim was known to have kept a detailed plan of climbing for the next five years.  Changing Attitude  The ordeal of Pakistan exploration fundamentally transformed his attitude toward mountaineering in a way that appreciates relationships with the other. The trips were beyond arduous: he fell into a crevasse numerously, his ankle sprained, the jeep overturned, starved many days, suffered from desolation and hallucination, bandit-attacked and murder-threatened. It was herders, farmers, housewives, village children who came first to give him a helping hand. Realizing how egocentric he was to mountains Kim learned a valuable lesson on the importance of relationship and appreciation and gradually began to consider obtaining and harmonizing with local knowledge and wisdom an integral part of mountaineering in remote places. Moreover, he realized how mountaineering can bring about a moment of purification and bliss beyond proclaiming the self. In 2005, after ninety days of exhaustive and dangerous climbing in siege tactics on the Nanga Parbat's sheer Rupal face, Kim stood on the top with late Lee Hyun-jo (who perished on Everest southwest face in 2007). Through the radio, Lee sobbingly chatted with one of his close friends at the basecamp, saying, ‚ÄúBro! It should‚Äôve been much better if you‚Äôre here together ‚Ä¶‚Äù This struck Kim. Trudging toward the basecamp after descent, Kim reflected upon his own egocentrism in the context of expedition, noting, ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve just climbed was an imaginary Nanga. This mountain is full of selfish desire. What could then be the true Nanga to me? ‚Ä¶ Standing on the summit gives no pleasure nor any meaning whatsoever when lacking this: the true Nanga begets only when I return alive with my teammate.‚Äù He began to climb the fourteen giants, not necessarily because he coveted the title. The still young and relatively unheard-of Kim shined to the eyes of Hong Bo-Sung, the leader of Busan Alpine Federation's fourteen-peak project. Under the leadership of Hong‚Äîa studious leader and a person of understanding‚Äîcombined with Kim's skills and experience on high mountains, Busan Dynamic Hope Expedition subsequently excelled on 8000m peaks in many regards. Highly pragmatic in the approach, the expedition continued to form a small team of three to four, barely relied on external supports such as Sherpas and oxygen tanks, traveled and climbed in extreme efficiency by virtue of encyclopedic research on each peak. The whole project completed in mere five years and four months (2006-2011).  Notable Climbing Achievements  Kim completed climbing all fourteen 8000m peaks in 2013, without breathing bottled oxygen and, though not specifically intended, in the shortest-ever period of seven years and ten months‚Äîuntil Nirmal Purja of Nepal broke the record in October 2018. Less known but more significant is that he climbed formidable new routes and gathered superb first ascents in Himalaya and Karakoram. Peaks and faces he opened a new route include: Shikari (5928m, 2001) in the Yasin valley, Khache Brangsa (5560m, 2001) in the Arandu valley, Nanga Parbat's Rupal face (8125m, 2005), all in Pakistan, Gangapurna's south face (7455m, 2016), Gangapurna West's south face (7140m, 2016), both in the Annapurna range in Nepal, and Papsura's south face (6451m, 2017) in India. With the Gangapurna ascent he and his two colleagues earned the Piolet D‚Äôor award in 2017, firstly ever as Korean. The list of his first ascents is even more impressive and includes: Batura II (7762m, 2008) in Pakistan, Himjung (7140m, 2012) in Nepal, both with partner(s), an unnamed peak (6006m, 2002) near the Lupgarsar pass, Delhi Sang- i-sar (6225m) in the Chapursan valley, Atar Kor (6189m), Haiz Kor (6105m) both in the Chiantar range, Bakma Brakk (6150m, or Bukma peak, 2003) in 2003, all alone and in Pakistan. It is noteworthy that he strove for and maintained excellency in all three subgenres of contemporary Himalayan mountaineering: the fourteen-peak bagging, the high-altitude wall climbing, and the lightweight approach.  Korean Way Project  In 2018, Kim planned to climb Gurja Himal's untouched 3800-meter-long south face in the alpine style. This climb was part of what he called ‚ÄúKorean Way Project,‚Äù an unconfined series of Himalayan climbs he embarked from 2016. The project aimed to climb a new route on a mountain, with no external assistance. Interestingly, Kim specified the following three criteria in the choice of climbing destination: the potential merit of exploration in the entire travel, the mountain's significance in the local culture, and the planned route's naturalness. This stylistic, innovative approach to mountaineering stems from his own mountaineering philosophy that distinctively concerns the ethics of relationship, or what he called ‚Äúmountaineering of coexistence.‚Äù  Mountaineering Philosophy  Before and after his death, Kim has been a mountaineer both most acclaimed and least understood within the community of Korean mountaineers as well as among the larger public. Although Kim apparently preferred a lightweight style of climbing in the Himalaya, he also appreciated virtues of climbing by forming a larger expedition. It may result in bringing about more meaningful climbing experiences. In contrast, the alpine style favors minimalism. In this concept, the autonomy of climbing, which allegedly constitutes the core value of the sport, is thought to be divided and reduced when accompanying someone else. Securing the man-versus-mountain frame, solo climbing could therefore become the ideal in the alpine-style approach. Most Korean mountaineers have rejected this simplistic individualism in climbing and mountaineering. All mountaineers are different, and an excellent combination can bring about wonderful joy and genuine glory. As a leader Kim's art of leadership and strategies for teamwork sought harmony, in the expectation to avoid undermining individual autonomy but amplify it instead. ‚ÄúWhat each member wishes to achieve makes up what the expedition wishes, and vice versa,‚Äù Kim used to say. In 2013, Kim organized an Everest expedition which marked his culmination of climbing all fourteen- eight-thousand-meter peaks. He and late Seo Seong-Ho aimed the highest mountain starting from the Bay of Bengal, solely on human power. The duo kayaked, cycled, hiked, and climbed to the top without oxygen. While both successfully reached the top of Mt. Everest without using bottled oxygen, Seo died while sleeping at the camp of South Col. Kim did not ignore Seo's wish to create an organization that helps younger generations climb Himalayan mountains by means of financial and other supports. Consequently, Korea Himalayan Fund was born in the year of Seo's death. The rest in the Everest expedition donated and began to serve as the committee members. Kim defined the fund as to aid those who attempt a climb that is ‚Äúcreative and progressive.‚Äù It accepts no donation from one who is not currently an active mountaineer, especially a corporation, because in Kim's view sponsorship may spoil the purity of mountaineering. When sponsored, said Kim, the outcome is generally favored over mountain experience and mountaineers could easily become imprudent out of fueled ambition. While, sponsored or not, no mountaineer will ever be free from the desire for achievement, they, Kim emphasized to me, must place priority on the desire to ‚Äútaste the mystique of mountain and mountaineering.‚Äù Unfortunately, however, most Korean mountaineers thus far did not, according to Kim. As one of Kim's few institutionalized legacies, Korea Himalaya Fund is based on his view of mountaineering that is fundamentally both personal and social. In his later years Kim appreciated thoughts of Norwegian philosopher and mountaineer Arne N√¶ss (1912-2009). N√¶ss began the movement of ecological philosophy by the name of \\"deep ecology,\\" a view that all things are nothing but the self and therefore must be pursued as the ultimate goals themselves. Kim's take on this thought is ‚Äúto follow nature‚Äôs right way,‚Äù that is, ‚Äúclimbing and exploring in coexistence‚Äù with other climbers, nonclimbers, and those in the past and in the future‚Äîall combined to form the ‚Äúnature.‚Äù Kim's use of \\"Korean\\" in his Korean Way Project defies the na√Øve dualism of individualism and nationalism. To this question whether the project sounded nationalistic by his mountaineering friend, Oh Young-Hoon, Kim said, ‚ÄúThe corrupted nationalism remained in me as well.‚Äù Being then perhaps the most eminent mountaineer in South Korea, Kim also carried an ethical responsibility of sharing the ‚Äúright way‚Äù with his fellowmen. And for this he must prove his approach successful, and successful internationally. ‚ÄúMakgeolli (Korean rice wine) is too an alcohol good enough, but why must (western) wine?‚Äù Kim asked himself. When he was awarded the Piolet d‚ÄôOr in 2017, he regarded the fame as the Korean mountaineering community's collective key taking off the decades-old shackles of craving for international recognition. It was an exorcism for all Korean mountaineers living and dead, at last opening for next generations a door for real freedom of thoughts on the mountains. Thus, he regarded himself as an apostle rather than the Messiah, for the new wave of mountaineering movement in South Korea. The truly ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù mountaineer, according to him, was not himself but Choi Seok-Mun. Five years junior to Kim, Choi had been Kim's most favored climbing partner, previously with on Khache Brangsa, Shikari, Bublimotin (‚ÄúLadyfinger‚Äù, 6000m), Batura II, Paine Central, Gangapurna, and Gangapurna West. Tackling 5.14s as well, Choi is arguably ‚Äúthe best Korean mountaineer‚Äù as referred to by Kim. Choi shares most of Kim's ethics and visions of coexistence, but also Choi has been actively sharing them with others by organizing climbing festivals, opening new trad routes, and writing on climbing ethics. While Kim is gone, his passion and visions on the mountains remain indelible to the minds of a few.  Death  Choi Hong-Gun, former president of Corean Alpine Club, grew worried that his trekking companion Jung Jun-Mo didn't return to the Gurja Khani village (2620m), east of the Dhaulagiri range, western Nepal. Both planned to visit the base camp of Korean Gurja Himal (7193m) south face expedition, and yet Choi, due to a headache from altitude, stopped in the village and waited for Jung's return. Early in the morning of the next day, October 12, 2018, he sent to the base camp (3576m) his guide, who delivered a breaking news: all nine individuals in the base camp including five Koreans and four Nepali staff were found to be dead. The bodies were found scattered around below the camp as far as about 500 m. Many have inferred the cause of the accident to be the blast of an avalanche occurred while everyone sleeping. The Google Earth image shows a massive serac at the edge of the upper plateau on 5900 m to the west of Gurja Himal's summit. It broke off, so does the hypothesis go, and minutes later blew away the base camp straightly down the wall. It is inferred that the accident occurred between the evening of October 10 and the morning of 11, based on the fact that the journal of meticulous Kim Chang-Ho ended on October 10.

Woolley (born July 30, 1965) is an American neuroendocrinologist. Woolley holds the William Deering Chair in Biological Sciences in the Department of Neurobiology, Weinberg College of Arts & Sciences, at Northwestern University. She is also a member of the Women's Health Research Institute in the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. Woolley studies cellular and molecular neuroscience in relation to the brain and behavior, particularly neuroendocrinology and the plasticity of neural circuits. She attempts to understand molecular mechanisms of estrogen and its interactions with the structure and function of synapses in the adult brain, and their behavioral consequences. She has been described as \\"a leading authority in a very exciting area of adult neuroplasticity\\". Her earliest work included a pioneering study demonstrating that estrogen caused structural changes to cells in the rat hippocampus. She has also shown that neuronal mechanisms in the rat brain differ in males and females. Her work has broad significance for drug development and women's health, and for the studies of epilepsy, anxiety and depression. Early life Catherine S. Woolley was born on July 30, 1965, in Nelsonville, Ohio. She graduated from Texas A&M; University in College Station, Texas, with a B.Sc. honors in zoology and was given a prize by the university for the best undergraduate honors thesis. Career Woolley studied with Bruce McEwen at Rockefeller University, receiving her Ph.D. from Rockefeller in 1993. She did postdoctoral work at the University of Washington with Philip Schwartzkroin in the Department of Neurological Surgery. In 1998, she became an assistant professor at Northwestern University in Evanston. In 2013, Woolley was appointed to the William Deering Chair in Biological Sciences in the Department of Neurobiology, Weinberg College of Arts & Sciences, Northwestern University. She is the founding Director of Northwestern University's undergraduate Neuroscience program, and was named a Charles Deering McCormick Professor of Teaching Excellence by Northwestern in 2018 for \\"transforming the landscape of undergraduate education in Weinberg.\\" She was elected to the Council of the Society for Neuroscience (2014‚Äì2018). She is a senior editor of The Journal of Neuroscience. Research Rockefeller University Bruce McEwen at Rockefeller University studies stress and its impact on the brain. With McEwen, Woolley initially studied neuroleptics and their effects on proenkephalin mRNA levels. Woolley went on to work with McEwen and Elizabeth Gould on a 1990 study that examined the brain using Golgi's method, a technique first described by Camillo Golgi in 1873. The study showed that estradiol increased the number and density of excitatory synapses of CA1 pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampus, as well as the density of dendritic spines. Both estradiol and spine density fluctuated dramatically during the estrous cycle. Woolley recognized that this suggested that the adult brain was subject to change, at least in rats; this was surprising because it was accepted at that time that the adult brain was structurally stable. Woolley's 1990 work is considered a pioneering study in hormones and synaptic plasticity. Further work established that the manipulation of female sex hormones affects hippocampal structure in adult rats. University of Washington  Between 1993-1998, Woolley worked as a postdoc at the University of Washington in Seattle, with Philip Schwartzkroin. There she applied electrophysiology techniques and ultrastructural analysis to the study of hormonal effects in the brain. She studied the effects of estrogen on the release of GABA in the hippocampus. In 2000, she received the Cortical Explorer Award in recognition of her work on neuroanatomy and brain activity. Northwestern University As a professor at Northwestern University, Woolley has done ongoing research into the sex-specific effects of estrogens, GABAA receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors, and endogenous cannabinoids and their roles as neuromodulators of brain development and function. In 2012, Woolley published research showing that estrogens had differential effects in the brains of female and male rats, decreasing inhibitory synaptic transmission in female rats but not in males. In 2015, her group reported that male and female rats differ in the molecular pathways affected by endocannabinoids. In female rats the drug URB-597 increased the inhibitory effect of the endocannabinoid anandamide, lessening the release of neurotransmitters. In male rats, the drug had no effect. The interaction did not reflect circulating reproductive hormones. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which rat neurology provides an accurate model for human neurology. While the significance of these results for humans are not yet demonstrated, rats are often used as a model for studying humans. An important implication of Woolley's research is that drug testing on males should not be assumed to yield results applicable to both males and females. To understand drug action, effects on both sexes should be studied. Awards and honors * 1998: Alfred P.

He quickly developed a love for hurling and was a member of the Threecastles team that won the Kilkenny Junior Championship in 1940. Around this time Egan took up employment with Kilkenny Woollen Mills and played with them in the Kilkenny Junior Championship. He played with the Kilkenny junior hurling team which won the All-Ireland Championship in 1946 before graduating to the senior team. On 7 September 1947, Egan won an All-Ireland Championship medal at senior level, as understudy to Jim Donegan, following a one-point defeat of Cork in the final. As there was no parish rule for club hurling at the time, Egan joined the Tullaroan club with whom he won a Kilkenny Senior Championship medal in 1948. Soon after that victory, he joined the √âire √ìg club and remained a member until the club disbanded in the early 1960s.

Originally a general surgeon, in the latter part of his career he devoted his practice increasingly to colo-rectal surgery. He was Surgeon to the Queen in Scotland and served as President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.  Early life and education  He was born in Edinburgh, the son of David MacMillan McNair, a mining engineer, and his wife Helen Jackson McNair, (n√©e Rae). After schooling at George Watson's College he entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1944, winning the John Aitken Carlyle Bursar in his first year and graduating MB ChB in 1949. He was house surgeon to Sir James Learmonth and then worked in West Africa as doctor to a mining company gaining his first experience of emergency surgery. His National Service was as a medical officer in the Royal Air Force. On return to Edinburgh he worked as a junior anaesthetist at the Western General Hospital before continuing surgical training as a surgical registrar at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1955 and of the Royal College of Surgeons of England the following year.  Surgical career  In 1958 he became senior registrar to the Regius Professor of Clinical Surgery, Sir John Bruce. He was invited at this stage to become editor of the popular textbook Emergency Surgery, previously written by Henry Hamilton Bailey. McNair edited the 8th and 9th editions. He was awarded the MD degree for his thesis \\"On observations on visceral pain, with special reference to the pain originating in the testis\\" in 1960. He then spent a year in Chicago, training with Dr Warren H Cole at the Surgery Department of the University of Illinois before being appointed consultant surgeon to the Eastern General Hospital, Edinburgh. His final consultant appointment was a joint appointment as surgeon in Chalmers Hospital and the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. where he became consultant in administrative charge of one of the general surgical units. In 1964 he was instrumental in establishing the Accident and Emergency Department in the Royal Infirmary. In the early part of his career he was a general surgeon but latterly he specialised increasingly in colo-rectal surgery. He became renowned for a surgical technique that was methodical, precise and painstakingly meticulous. His reputation was such that he came to be regarded as the local \\"surgeons' surgeon.\\" His surgical expertise and distinction was recognised in 1977 when he was appointed Surgeon to The Queen in Scotland. McNair was elected Vice-President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1980 and President of the College in 1985. He had long been an advocate of reform of the FRCS examinations and those reforms came to fruition during his presidency. For his contributions to examination reform he was awarded the silver medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Further recognition came with his appointment in 1988 as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).  Selected publications  Plastic bags for storing and transfusing blood.

It investigates former settlements and deserted areas, forms of housing and settlements, and the prehistoric settlement of entire regions. For this purpose, the forms, functions and developments of individual habitats and settlement systems are explored by means of archaeological surveys and excavation. Settlement archaeology has developed in close cooperation with settlement history and settlement geography. Settlement sequences of several centuries or millennia are explored in individual areas. Changes and consistent elements can be studied and compared with other researched settlements. Archaeological methods are used including archaeobotany and -zoology and spectroscopic phosphate analysis to resolve archaeological questions, mostly in the field of prehistory and early history. Settlement archaeology as the archaeology of peoples The term settlement archaeology initially referred to a research methodology whose most important exponent was Gustaf Kossinna, who developed his \\"settlement archaeology method\\" beginning in 1887. According to Kossinna and his disciples, cultures, cultural areas and, ultimately, settlement areas of ethnic groups can be deduced through types and their assemblages. This equation of \\"archaeological culture\\", ethnicity, and race led, especially during National Socialist rule, to a fateful and alarming combination of archaeological research with racial ideology. One of the core tenets of Kossinna's teaching was that sharply defined archaeological cultural areas coincide at all times with particular peoples (V√∂lkern) or tribes.\\"Scharf umgrenzte arch√§ologische Kulturprovinzen decken sich zu allen Zeiten mit ganz bestimmten V√∂lkern oder V√∂lkerst√§mmen\\" When asked about the \\"ethnic interpretation\\" of prehistoric finds, answers were sought by linking \\"archaeological\\" with \\"historical\\" methods. Kossinna said that the basis of his \\"settlement archaeological method\\" was that it uses an analogy that enlightens dimly-illuminated ancient times by inferences from the better-known present, or ages that, though still ancient, are marked by rich tradition. It illuminates prehistoric times by understanding more recent history.\\"sich des Analogieschlu√ües [bedient], insofern sie die Erhellung uralter, dunkler Zeiten durch R√ºckschl√ºsse aus der klaren Gegenwart oder aus zwar ebenfalls noch alten, jedoch durch reiche √úberlieferung ausgezeichneten Epochen vornimmt. Sie erhellt vorgeschichtliche Zeiten durch solche, die in geschichtlichem Lichte stehen.‚Äú In the Postwar Era the empirical collecting of facts and their chronological and spatial arrangement was declared the main goal of research, which set the final course for today's German archaeology. Theoretical approaches moved to the background. Modern settlement archeology Since the 1920s more and more works have emerged in which individual regions have been archaeologically researched. At the same time, more emphasis was placed on investigating the settlements themselves. Researchers such as Gerhard Bersu, Hermann Stoll, and Robert Rudolf Schmidt, who worked mainly in southern Germany, were among this pioneering phase of modern settlement archeology. The excavations at the Federsee, for example, involved the natural sciences at an early stage (pollen analysis (Palynology), moor geology and geomorphology, dendrochronology, radiocarbon dating, archaeozoology and archaeobotany, paleoclimatology, material research, etc.). However, especially during the Third Reich under the direction of Hans Reinerth, the ideological abuse of settlement archaeology was particularly evident. In the end, however, important impulses for the establishment and methodical definition came mainly from the north: the excavations in Haithabu (Hedeby as well as the investigations at Wurten on the North Sea coast such as Feddersen Wierde near Cuxhaven by Werner Haarnagel were seminal. The archaeologist Herbert Jankuhn is associated with the formulation of this redefinition of settlement archeology. Jankuhn was a proponent of Kossinna's methods of settlement archeology during the period of in National Socialism. New trends More recently the focus has increasingly been on the individual settlement and the analysis of landscapes and territories, mostly using geographic information systems (GIS). Today the term landscape archaeology is preferred. The long-standing role of natural sciences in settlement archeology has recently further increased, and geography, geology, zoology, botany, and anthropology have been increasingly used in the field of soil science, which is reflected, for example, in the field of geoarchaeology.

Miller. Biography Miller was the daughter of an economist at the Federal Land Bank in Minneapolis. She studied biochemistry at the University of Minnesota (Bachelor's degree 1941, Master's degree 1943). In 1945 she received her doctorate under Carl Baumann as a Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) Scholar. As a postgraduate, she worked at the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she and her husband (since 1942) James A. Miller studied chemical carcinogenesis. From 1973 to 1987, she was Deputy Director (Associate Director) of the McArdle Laboratory. She was also a professor of oncology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She died of kidney cancer. In 1947, the Millers discovered that an azo dye could cause cancer by binding to proteins in the livers of rats. [1]In 1949, they showed that the ability of one substance to affect cancer by the action of another chemical influences the processing in the metabolism, and in 1960 they showed the existence of metabolites that were stronger carcinogens than the starting material. These discoveries also had significance for other areas of toxicology. After the discovery of the exact genetic role of DNA around 1953, the Millers were able to detect the carcinogenic effects of many chemicals as a result of their interaction with DNA. After demonstrating in the 1960s that chemical carcinogens could be detected by increased mutation rates, they examined the carcinogenicity of a wide range of substances found in the environment, industrial chemicals, and food. Elizabeth Miller was editor of the Cancer Research journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) from 1954 to 1964 . In 1957, she became the first woman elected to the AACR Board of Directors. From 1976 to 1977 she was President of the AACR. From 1978 to 1980 she was on the Council (Cancer Panel) of the National Cancer Institute.

Her best-known work, The Washerwoman's Dream, described by one reviewer as \\"enthrallingly readable\\", has become an Australian classic.  Personal life  Hilarie Elizabeth Dyson was born in Sydney, New South Wales, on 18 April 1922. She attended a business college in Sydney in 1939, and in 1944 she married Philip Singleton Lindsay, with whom she had two daughters and a son.  Career   Toy making  Hilarie Lindsay's husband was the son of the founder of the toy company A.L. Lindsay & Co, which produced children's dress-up costumes, cubby houses and play tents in the Sydney suburb of Leichhardt. Hilarie Lindsay was active in the company for over 40 years, as marketing manager, and designing and making costumes, particularly for girls. She sought that the girls had as many costumes as the boys had as she created the outfits thus ensuring there was gender equality. She was one of the first women to serve on the committee of the Toys and Games Manufacturers' Association of Australia (TAGMA), and was instrumental in establishing the first toy fairs in Sydney and Melbourne. In 1969, she was elected as the first woman president of TAGMA, and the first woman president of any division of the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers. In these roles, she promoted the quality and durability of Australian-made toys, raised issues such as the impact of increasing litigation on toy manufacturers' insurance costs, and lobbied for quotas on imported toys to guarantee Australian toy manufacturers a greater share of the market. In 1984, the company, by then trading as Lindsay's Toy Factory, Leichhardt, opened a museum of toys and books, because, Hilarie Lindsay claimed, \\"today's children have little idea of what it was like to be a child 50 years ago.\\" She was inducted into the Australian Toy Association Hall of Fame in 1998.  Writing  Hilarie Lindsay began writing as a child, but was first published in 1966, after winning the Henry Lawson Festival of Arts Award for Short Story that year, as Lindsay Dyson, a pen name she also used in writing poems and newspaper articles. She was also awarded the same prize the following year. In the early 1970s, Lindsay's established an imprint called Ansay, and Hilarie Lindsay published a series of books for children on making toys and games. Among these were the comprehensive volume One hundred and one toys to make (1972), and smaller books focused around topics such as puppets, dolls, rainy days and sunny days, with step-by-step instructions clearly illustrated, which were \\"sensibly priced .... in easy-to-read big type\\". She also wrote a well- received guide for teenagers setting up home for the first time, You're On Your Own. She continued writing short stories, and also wrote a series of stories for children about Mr and Mrs Poppleberry, \\"an elderly couple who always tackle problems without using any sort of violence\\". Hilarie Lindsay was president of the Society of Women Writers (Australia) from 1971-1973 and again in 1975-1977. In that role, she drew attention to the difficulties faced by women who write, encouraged Aboriginal women to writeJones, Jennifer Anne (2001). Aboriginal women's autobiographical narratives and the politics of collaboration (Doctoral dissertation, Adelaide University). Page 54., and lobbied for the removal of questions about gender and marital status from literary grant applications. She wrote beginners' guides to writing, and the Handbook, the Society of Women Writers. In 1974, she was awarded an MBE for services to literature. The same year she organised a playwrights' workshop for the Society of Women Writers, and commenced work on her own play, The Withered Tree, which she received an Australia Council for the Arts Literature Board grant to develop. The play, in which adult brothers and sisters try to come to terms with death after a funeral, was first performed in 1978, and was published in 1980. She edited several anthologies of short stories, memoirs and poetry, and in 1977 received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. From 1982-1984, and again from 1992-1994, she was President of the Fellowship of Australian Writers.Lindsay, Hilarie (2014) 'Introduction', in In the early 1980s, Hilarie Lindsay commenced tertiary education externally through Deakin University, majoring in literature, and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in 1991. She began postgraduate studies at Sydney University in 1992, intending to explore the difficulties which Australian women had experienced in being published.Lindsay, Hilarie (2018) 'Introduction', in Her thesis narrowed to a study of one woman in particular, Winifred Steger, who had published weekly serials during the early 1930s, and had been unable to publish fourteen novels. After completing her PhD in 1997, Hilarie Lindsay went on to publish a biography of Winifred Steger for a general readership, as The Washerwoman's Dream (2002). A story of a struggle to overcome adversity, set in outback Australia, involving bigamous marriages to Afghan cameleers, conversion to the Muslim faith and travel to Mecca, The Washerwoman's Dream has been described as \\"a life story as enthrallingly readable as any novel\\", in which \\"the strength of the narrative .. rests on the firm foundation of Lindsay's thorough research\\". It has since become an Australian classic, and as of 2018, is in its third edition and has also appeared in braille and as an audiobook.

Career  Vilas earned her BA in Astronomy at Wellesley College and her MS in Astronomy at MIT. She completed her Doctoral degree at the University of Arizona. Vilas was a scientist at NASA Johnson Space Center from 1985 through 2005 where she worked on quantifying orbital debris from spacecraft in low Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit, or geotransfer orbit. Her observations helped to prove the existence of Neptune's rings five years before they were confirmed by a 1989 Voyager mission. She designed the coronagraph used to produce the first-ever image of a circumstellar disk around another star (Beta Pictoris) in 1984. Since her MS degree, Vilas has worked on the planet Mercury, serving an editor for a 1989 collection of reviews published by the University of Arizona Press. Vilas has been a pioneer in the identification of hydrated minerals through use of an absorption band near 700 nm. This absorption has been incorporated into the most recent asteroid taxonomies, and is one of the key measurements likely to be used for prospecting by future asteroid mining companies. While at JSC, she participated in the 1987-88 Antarctic Search for Meteorites field season in Antarctica, helping collect nearly 700 meteorites from the Beardmore/Walcott Neve and Allan Hills/Elephant Moraine icefields. She also served as the Program Scientist for the Discovery, Dawn, and NEAR data analysis programs at NASA Headquarters from 2001-2002, ensuring the integrity of the Discovery program selection process during a time of national duress following the chaos of the 9/11 attack. She returned to JSC as the Group Chief for Planetary Astronomy within the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Office from 2002-2005. Vilas then became the director of the Multiple Mirror Telescope Observatory from 2005 to 2010, where she managed telescope and instrumentation operations, conducted short-term and long-term observatory planning, and supervised the scientific and technical staff. She joined the staff of the Planetary Science Institute in 2011. At PSI, she was Participating Scientist on NASA's MESSENGER mission to Mercury and the Atsa Suborbital Observatory Project Scientist. She is a Participating Scientist on NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter LAMP team, and on the Joint Science Team for the Japanese Hayabusa-2 mission to asteroid 162173 Ryugu. She currently serves as a Program Director at the National Science Foundation. Vilas has been active in the leadership of the planetary science community, serving as Secretary- Treasurer of the Division of Planetary Sciences (DPS) of the American Astronomical Society from 1992-1995, after which she was elected Vice Chair (1995-1996) and succeeded to Chair (1996-1997). As Chair of the DPS, Vilas played a key role in establishing the Carl Sagan Medal, which was the first major statement in support of the importance of communicating our science with the public. Vilas served as the first chair of the Small Bodies Assessment Group (2007-2009), chartered by NASA to identify scientific priorities and opportunities for the exploration of asteroids, comets, interplanetary dust, small satellites, and Trans-Neptunian Objects.  Honors and Recognition  The AAS Division for Planetary Science awarded Vilas the Masursky Award in 2018 for meritorious service to planetary science. The American Geophysical Union awarded Vilas the Fred Whipple Award in 2019 for significant contributions to the field of planetary science. She was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020. Asteroid 3507 Vilas is named for her.  Personal life  Vilas is a trained pilot, from a family of pilots. Her grandfather was the first person to fly across Lake Michigan, and in celebration of that feat's 100th anniversary she recreated his flight. Vilas is married to Larry Smith, a retired reliability and safety engineer. She currently has six cats and two dogs.

Tito Zanib√≥ni  The former Socialist deputy Tito Zanib√≥ni was arrested for attempting to assassinate Mussolini on November 4, 1925. In a hotel with a view unto Palazzo Chigi, where Mussolini had planned to give a balcony speech, Zanib√≥ni set up a rifle with telescopic sights. Shortly before his target appeared, however, Zanib√≥ni was arrested. A friend and double agent had informed the police. Historians believe that the plot itself was engineered by the Mussolini administration as a pretext to consolidate power, which is what followed. Mussolini's laws enacted in late 1925 enabled the suppression of any oppositional political organization. The Italian army officer Luigi Capello was arrested in conjunction with the Zanib√≥ni plot and received a 30-year prison sentence. The author and labor organizer Carlo Tresca wrote a play and political satire in late 1925 based on the attempt, L'Attentato a Mussolini ovvero il segreto di Pulcinella (The Attempt on Mussolini or the Secret of Pulcinella). Zanib√≥ni received a 30-year prison sentence, but was released in 1943 and later named to government positions.  Violet Gibson  The next year, on April 7, 1926, Violet Gibson shot a pistol at Mussolini, which grazed his nose. He was bandaged and continued on to give his scheduled speech. Gibson, the daughter of the Irish Lord Chancellor, was nearly lynched, later jailed, and spent the remainder of her life in an asylum.  Gino Lucetti  Later in 1926, on September 11, anarchist marble worker Gino Lucetti threw a bomb at Mussolini's limousine in Porta Pia, Rome, which injured four others.  Anteo Zamboni  The next month, on October 11, 1926, a shot fired at Mussolini, who rode in an open car through Bologna, led to the lynching of a 15-year-old boy. Terrorism specialist J. Bowyer Bell wrote that the boy was likely innocent and the affair either a put-up job or plot between Fascists. The attempt resulted in laws creating Mussolini's secret police. The attempt has been adapted into two films: the 1977 film Gli ultimi tre giorni (The Last Three Days) and the fictionalized 1973 film Love and Anarchy. A street in Bologna is named after Zamboni.  1930s plots  As Italian Fascism became a stable institution, the potential murder of Mussolini became harder to attempt and offered less potential impact to destabilize his regime. In May 1931, American anarchist Michele Schirru was arrested and executed in Italy for plotting to kill Mussolini. The next month, Angelo Sbardellotto was arrested and executed for a similar plot.

In a short racing career lasting less than a year he ran nine times and won six of his races, including three at the highest Group 1 level. As a two-year-old in 2018 he was rated the best of his generation in Europe, winning the Solario Stakes, Champagne Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. He was beaten when favourite or joint-favourite in his first three races in 2019 but returned to form when winning the Prix Jean Prat and Sussex Stakes in the summer. His career was ended by an injury sustained during his final race. Background Too Darn Hot was bred in England by his owner, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Watership Down Stud. Lloyd Webber later explained that although the stud usually puts its colts up for auction, Too Darn Hot had suffered an injury as a foal and was thought unlikely to find a buyer. The colt was sent into training with John Gosden in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by Dubawi a top-class son of Dubai Millennium, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Too Darn Hot's dam Dar Re Mi was an outstanding racemare whose wins included the Pretty Polly Stakes, Yorkshire Oaks and Sheema Classic. Her other foals have included So Mi Dar (Musidora Stakes) and La Ti Dar (runner-up in the St Leger). Dar Re Mi was a daughter of Darara who won the Prix Vermeille and was a half sister to Darshaan. Racing career 2018: two-year-old season In all of his starts as a juvenile in 2018 Too Darn Hot was ridden by Frankie Dettori. The colt made his debut in a maiden race over one mile at Sandown Park on 9 August and was made the 8/11 favourite against four opponents. After disputing the lead from the start he drew away from his rivals in the last quarter mile and won by seven lengths from Rowland Ward. On 1 September the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Solario Stakes over seven furlongs at the same track. He was made the even money favourite in a six-runner field which included Arthur Kitt (winner of the Chesham Stakes), Dunkerron (runner-up in the Vintage Stakes) and Watan (runner-up in the Acomb Stakes). After racing in third place, Too Darn Hot took the lead approaching the final furlong and \\"powered clear\\" to win by four lengths from Arthur Kitt. After the race Dettori said \\"I gave him as much experience as I could. I gave him a couple of flicks and he has put a very good field to bed in impressive fashion. He's got options. We know he can stay a mile but he also showed speed over seven today, he had the race won by the furlong-and-a-half. He's pretty special\\". Two weeks after his win in the Solario, Too Darn Hot moved up to Group 2 class for the Champagne Stakes over seven furlong at Doncaster Racecourse and was made the 4/11 favourite. The best of his five opponents appeared to be Dark Vision (Vintage Stakes), Phoenix of Spain (Acomb Stakes) and Van Beethoven (Railway Stakes). After tracking the leaders Too Darn Hot took the lead a furlong out and won by one and three quarter lengths from Phoenix of Spain. Dettori commented \\"What he did between the three-furlong pole and furlong pole was pretty amazing. He made six lengths in two furlongs ‚Äì pretty special. Today is his first time on a flat track and he gave me a really good feel, he went through the gears\\". On his final run of the year Too Darn Hot started the even money favourite for the Group 1 Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. The other six runners were Anthony Van Dyck (Futurity Stakes), Advertise, Sangarius (Flying Scotsman Stakes), Mohawk (Royal Lodge Stakes), Christmas (Caravaggio Stakes) and Kuwait Currency (Stonehenge Stakes). After racing in mid-division as Christmas set the pace, Too Darn Hot was angled right to make his challenge in the last quarter mile. He took the inside the final furlong and won \\"very readily\\" by two and three quarter lengths from Advertise. Dettori, who was winning the race for the first time at the age of 47 said \\"He's an amazing horse and in the end I was struggling to ease him down. He's had three easy races and today he was getting knocked about and running in snatches. For a minute I thought I was in trouble and then the turbo kicked in. He's up with the best I've ridden ‚Äì he's got a good cruising speed and he moves his legs really fast\\". At the 2018 Cartier Awards, Too Darn Hot was named Champion Two-year-old Colt. In the official ratings for two-year-olds he was rated the best juvenile of the year, five pounds superior to his nearest rival Quorto. 2019: three-year-old season Throughout the winter and the spring of 2019 Too Darn Hot was the ante-post favourite for the 2000 Guineas. He was expected to begin his season in the Greenham Stakes but was withdrawn from the race after developing a splint in training. Although the condition improved Gosden decided that the lost time made it impossible to bring the horse to peak form for the Guineas and ruled him out of the race. The colt eventually returned to the track in the Dante Stakes (a trial race for the Epsom Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse on 16 May in which started favourite but sustained his first defeat as he was beaten a length into second place by Telecaster. Nine days later he was dropped back in distance for the Irish 2,000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh and was made the 6/4 joint favourite alongside the 2000 Guineas winner Magna Grecia. After racing in mid-division he made good progress in the straight but was unable to trouble the front-running Phoenix of Spain and was beaten three lengths into second place. At Royal Ascot on 18 June Too Darn Hot started 2/1 favourite against ten opponents for the St James's Palace Stakes. He produced a strong late challenge, but, in a closely contested finish he was beaten a neck and three quarters of a length by Circus Maximus and King of Comedy. On 7 July Too Darn Hot was sent to France and dropped back in distance for the Group 1 Prix Jean Prat over 1400 metres at Deauville Racecourse. He started the odds on favourite with the best-fancied of his eleven opponents being Space Blues (Surrey Stakes), Graignes and Munitions (Prix Djebel). Dettori settled the colt just behind the leaders before going to the front 300 metres from the finish and Too Darn Hot pulled clear of his rivals to win \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths. After the race Gosden said \\"His proper distance is 1400 metres up to an easy mile and we'll play to his strengths rather than stupidly playing to his weaknesses. He's not a stamina horse, he's built like a sprinter. I probably should have been running him in the July Cup next week\\", while Dettori commented \\"he's blessed with so much speed. We tried to stretch him and every time he ran, he didn't finish his races off. Ireland was too soon, then Ascot is a really stiff mile, so today, he put everything to bed and he showed his old turn of foot\\". The Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 31 July saw Too Darn Hot matched again older horses for the first time and he started favourite in an eight-runner field. Circus Maximus and Phoenix of Spain were again in opposition while the senior contenders were Lord Glitters (Queen Anne Stakes), Zabeel Prince (Prix d'Ispahan), Accidental Agent and the filly I Can Fly. The favourite was settled in third place by Dettori as Phoenix of Spain set the pace from Circus Maximus. The St James's Palace Stakes winner took the lead in the straight but Too Darn Hot was switched left, gained the advantage a furlong out and won by half a length.

History  Ford station was built by the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway Company and came into use when the line from Lydford to Plymouth was opened on Monday 2 June 1890. Ford was joined by a number of new halts in 1906 such as Weston Mill Halt and Camels Head Halt that were constructed to allow a suburban service to be operated between Plymouth Friary and St Budeaux for Saltash station in response to competition from tram lines. William Brown, from Gosport, was the first station master and for 30 years served at the station, retiring in 1920. The station's name in the public timetables was changed to Ford (Devon) in July 1923 to prevent confusion with Ford station in Sussex, however the name board was never altered.

They argued that the recovered memories movement, in which people stated they had long-forgotten sexual abuse from their families and just recently recovered memories, was based on falsehoods, and that therapists had suggested untrue events had occurred. Background Loftus herself had conducted an experiment with university students on false memories. She had also co-authored a 1994 Psychology of Women Quarterly study, not mentioned in the book, which stated that of 105 women seeking treatment at a substance abuse center, about 20% had reported forgetting and re-remembering sexual abuse; more than 50% of the 105 women stated they had received sexual abuse in their childhoods. Loftus herself had been abused by a male babysitter at age six, and she stated in the book that she did not forget this instance; the lack of memory loss made her skeptical of the recovered memory movement. Coauthor Ketcham is a journalist. Contents The book chronicles multiple recovered memory cases, including that of Lynn Price Gondolf, as well as the Thurston County ritual abuse case involving Paul Ingram, in which Loftus was personally involved. Katy Butler of the Los Angeles Times stated that the book \\"makes only a glancing reference to Marilyn Van Derbur\\". Reception Barry Gordon of Johns Hopkins University wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that the two sides in the false memory debate should find common ground as that is the only way total justice will occur; he stated \\"It is unfortunate that the war over so-called repressed or recovered memories has forced the two sides into such unreconcilable positions.\\" Butler described the book as \\"not the dispassionate work of scientists\\", that it does not \\"discuss many other cases that might contradict these books' central article of faith\\" and that the authors were \\"remarkably uninterested in the vagaries of memory of those who have sexually abused children.\\" Butler concluded that while the book was a positive development for people who were falsely accused of sexual misconduct, she was afraid it would cause the formation of experts doubting sexual abuse victims and that it would \\"once again silence women and men from speaking--and being believed--about very real abuse\\".

When complete, it will have a capacity to process about 650,000 barrels per day of crude oil. History Nigerian businessman Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013, when he announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project. At the time, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016. However, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018. In July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. According to Reuters, citing sources familiar with the project, construction was likely to take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with partial refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2022. An associated project at the site of the refinery, a urea fertilizer factory, is scheduled to begin operation in late 2018 and produce about three million tons of urea annually. Facility The refinery is situated on a site at the Lekki Free Zone, Lekki, Lagos State. It will process about 650,000 barrels of crude oil daily, transported via pipelines from oil fields in the Niger Delta, where natural gas will also be sourced to supply the fertilizer factory and be used in electrical generation for the refinery complex. The project is expected to cost up to $15 billion in total, with $10 billion invested in the refinery, $2.5 billion in the fertilizer factory, and $2.5 billion in pipeline infrastructure. With a single crude oil distillation unit, the refinery will be the largest single-train refinery in the world. At full production, the facility will be able to produce of gasoline and of diesel daily, as well as aviation fuel and plastic products. With a greater capacity than the total output of Nigeria's existing refining infrastructure, the Dangote Refinery will be able to meet the country's entire domestic fuel demand, as well as export refined products.

The publication has received several editorial and advertising awards by the Association of Free Community Publications, Inc., based in Liverpool, New York. The newspaper also publishes a free, quarterly color magazine, Our State Vermont.  History  The paper was established in 1999 as the Addison Eagle. The paper immediately faced startup challenges, as one of its founding partners, Tom Lavoie, was found to have a criminal history. At least one of the investors in the paper, Bernard Rome, a former Republican gubernatorial candidate, asked to have his investment returned. The Eagle, which was framed as a conservative alternative to the other Addison County weekly, the liberal Addison County Independent, had numerous Republican and libertarian investors at the time. In 2001, the Vermont Eagle was embroiled in a conflict with its competitor newspaper, the Addison County Independent. The editor of the Eagle, Lou Varricchio, took offense at an Addison Independent ad touting its quality and performance as a vehicle for advertising. Varricchio posted an editorial in the Eagle, calling the ad ‚Äúslick, un-Vermont attack advertising.\\" The Addison Independent's editor, Angelo Lynn, fired back with an editorial criticizing the Eagle for \\"un-American journalistic practices.\\" Antagonistic editorials continued back-and-forth into the beginning of 2002. Around that time, facing financial troubles, the Eagle announced that it would begin charging readers .50 per copy. But with increased local business advertising support under new management, the Eagle returned to offering the publication without charge. The paper's name was also changed to reflect a wider regional distribution area as readership grew. In 2003, because of ongoing financial struggles, the Vermont Eagle was purchased by New Market Press. New Market Press was co-founded by Ed Coats and Dan Alexander, who own Denton Publications, which now owns the Vermont Eagle. Denton Publication is considered a sister publication group to the New Market Press. In 2009, the Vermont Times was absorbed into the Vermont Eagle.

It ran from 1990-2007 until it merged with the Addison Eagle in March 2009. It was owned by New Market Press, Inc. The paper covered the town of Shelburne in Chittenden County, Vermont. It also went by the name of Burlington Vermont Times. The paper merged with South County Sentinel to form Vermont Times Sentinel. Vermont Times merged with Addison Eagle in 2009.  History  Vermont Times published the first of its weekly paper in late September 1990. It was started by Suzanne Gillis, who began Vermont Times's free distribution along with co-publisher Nat Winthrop after Gillis's Vermont Women monthly was discontinued in July. While Gillis assumed the position of publisher, Winthrop‚Äîalso then publisher of The Vanguard‚Äîserved as chief operating officer. Additionally, Neil Arthur‚Äîadvertising sales manager of 18 weekly Ohio publications‚Äîbecame the businesses executive vice president. The business was named NSN Enterprises. A prospectus released in March 1990 predicted that Vermont Times would be distributed free to 47,000 households in Chittenden County. The weekly publication immediately felt the impact of recession, responding by cutting its initial operating costs by 20 percent and laying off two part-time employees. The Burlington Free Press covered the story in February 1991, explaining that Gillis and Winthrop were expecting a difficult economy when making plans for their publication, but not to the extent that presented itself. In July 1995, shortly after making an unsuccessful attempt to sell the paper at 50 cents a piece, Vermont Times was sold to a New York firm. Edward Coats became the new owner of the paper along with another Vermont paper, Vox. Coats stated that he planned to continue the paper and that he was not intending on laying anyone working for the paper off. Out of the 15 people that were working for the paper, about half left right as Coats took over. \\"There were some good people who left, I'll be the first to admit it, and some who could have certainly helped us in the short term but for whatever reason didn't want to work for us,\\" Coats recalled, stating \\"they thought we were the bad guys.\\" Once he bought the paper, Coats focused on decreasing expenses. According to him, the former owners were spending more than they were making. Coats trimmed circulation. He also worked to switch it over from being a columnist paper to a community paper. He assigned the position of editor to Rosalyn Graham and general manager to Tom Schmidt. In March 2000, Coats was still discussing his desire to shift the image of Vermont Times to that of a community paper. In The Burlington Free Press, he is quoted saying \\"Somehow we've always been pigeonholed into people telling us we're an alternative paper, and we're not; we're a community paper.\\" Shay Totten, who was fired from the Times in February 2000, is quoted in the same article saying that Vermont Times is nowhere near alternative, and that its issues and stories are important and relevant to the community.

A free weekly paper, it is published each Tuesday. The paper's circulation fluctuates throughout the year, peaking during the summer tourism season on the islands. The editor and owner is Tonya Poutry. In its current iteration, the paper primarily offers readers a look into the minutiae of small-town life in the Champlain Valley. Stories promote local events, such as giant pumpkin contests and spaghetti dinners, honors acts of local philanthropy, raise awareness for community fundraisers and report on town hearings.  History  The paper was founded in 1974 by Phil Gimli-Mead as the first newspaper of the Champlain Islands. Gimli-Mead, a 22-year old college dropout at the time, said that he wished to fill a gap, as there was a \\"lack of recognition\\" of Grand Isle as a county. While Gimli-Mead had run for office unsuccessfully as a Democrat, he billed the new paper as strictly non-partisan: \\"[W]e're not a liberal, radical, or conservative paper. Those who read it can either do something about it or nothing about it.\\" George D. Fowler and his wife Elaine Sinclair-Fowler bought the paper in 1982. The paper was sold in 2016 by owner George D. Fowler to Tonya Poutry, who had worked for the paper for 15 years. As part of that change in ownership, the paper's headquarters moved to the second floor of a historic North Hero building, a general store called Hero's Welcome.  National coverage  The Islander made national news when it was the first to report Bernie Sanders's purchase of a third home, a lakeside weekend home in North Hero, which he purchased for $575K. The story, which was lifted to national prominence by Vermont daily Seven Days, was picked up widely in the national media. The Islander again made national news in 2018 when it reported on a Vermont farmer who sprayed manure on a U.S. Customs and Border Protection cruiser during the summer of 2017. The farmer told the Islander that he was unhappy with immigration enforcement efforts to curb illegal immigration, saying that the agency had not done enough to prevent undocumented immigrants from working on Vermont farms.

The paper stopped publishing in 2009  History  The Black River Tribune was co-founded and first edited by William Hunter and Leigh Tofferi. Hunter was a student at Yale who was also serving his second term in the Vermont Legislature. Hunter learned that year that he received a Rhodes Scholarship. Future Governor of Connecticut Ned Lamont, a friend of Hunter's, became editor of the paper in 1977, soon after the paper began and ran the paper when Hunter left on his Rhodes Scholarship. Lamont was grandson of Thomas W. Lamont, who was the partner of financier J.P. Morgan. Lamont later ran for governor of Connecticut in 2010. The early-days Black River Tribune staff included a number of budding journalists such as Jane Mayer, Alex Beam, and Carter Eskew. Hunter and Tofferi put the paper up for sale in 1981 so that Hunter could attend Harvard Law School and Tofferi could focus on being a Vermont legislator. Hunter, serving in the Vermont Legislature in 1986 helped pen a libel law that would allow someone sued for libel to recoup legal expenses if the suit is deemed as frivolous. The goal, Hunter noted, was to reduce the number of harmful libel suits aimed at small local newspapers. D.J. Ashworth was editor of the paper in the 1980s. Will Hunter was later embroiled in several legal and criminal cases. John Royston Coleman ran the paper for a decade. During that time, he presided some of the first gay marriages in the country.  Notable coverage  Early in the paper's history, it received national attention for its reporting on a resident in nearby Cavendish, Vermont Alexander Solzhenitsyn.

Representing the Parents' Information Bureau, and based in Kamloops, Dowding started travelling around the British Columbia's Southern Interior in 1937 to educate doctors about contraception and to help low-income women avoid unplanned pregnancy. Dowding operated in defiance of Canadian laws criminalizing birth control; birth control was not removed from the Canadian Criminal Code until 1969. Dowding was influenced by the work of Margaret Sanger and saw birth control access as a necessary step to women's liberation and to lifting low-income women out of poverty. She was an active member of Canada's Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and then Canada's New Democratic Party until her death in 1987. Despite facing obstacles, such as being thrown out of doctor's offices and having her birth control supplies being held by disapproving postmasters, Dowding persisted in her feminist mission.

He was born into a wealthy, eccentric family and indulged in travel throughout his life, although his base for the last 30 years was on the Greek island of Patmos.  Early life  Teddy Millington-Drake was born in London, England, on 5 July 1932. His wealthy parents, both of whom were noted eccentrics, were the diplomat Sir Eugen Millington-Drake and his wife Lady Effie Mackay, a daughter of James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape, Chairman of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and founder of Inchcape plc. His father's career meant that Teddy, his fourth child, was an early traveller. He had visited Buenos Aires and Paris before the age of one, and he spent his early years in Uruguay, where his father worked in the British Embassy between 1934 -1940. There were numerous voyages between Uruguay and the United Kingdom during those years, and the family settled permanently in London in 1940 after the outbreak of World War II. Whilst Millington-Drake's early childhood abroad had been happy and luxurious, he disliked the experience of the British preparatory school system. He had already acquired an interest in sketching and painting, inspired by the fashion sketches supplied to his mother so that she could order her clothes from Worth in Paris, and found his time at Eton College to be much more to his liking. There he indulged in art and was supervised by Wilfred Blunt, the art historian.  Adulthood  Following his time at Eton, Millington-Drake progressed to Oxford University before joining the Rifle Brigade to serve out his National Service. He spent some time posted in Egypt during the Suez Crisis, where he became a close friend of James Mossman. His facility for making friends was considerable, the number was always rising and they formed an important part of his life, despite which he could be a generous but distant and tetchy host. Nicky Haslam describes Millington-Drake at this time as \\"the prettiest dark-eyed and curl-haired faun, with an enchanting lisp\\". Discharged from service and in part inspired by his sister's anecdotes of her travels abroad, Millington-Drake embarked on a painting tour that took him to Lebanon, Iran, Iraq and Syria. He was aided by his father's connections, which meant that diplomats abroad would often be pleased to see him, but he also spent much time alone in hotels or outside painting. Jonathan Hope, who wrote an obituary for Millington-Drake, notes that \\"He loved this part of the world: the soukhs, the street life, the sounds and colours, and was dazzled by the power and simplicity of Islamic architecture\\". Millington- Drake then rented a house, the Villa Albrizzi, at Este, Veneto in Italy, and became a more frequent painter, particularly now of abstract murals. He befriended Freya Stark, a writer and traveller who lived nearby, and in Venice he became friends with Daisy Fellowes, Peggy Guggenheim, Barbara Hutton and Elsa Maxwell. He was also influenced by, and in turn himself influenced, Bruce Chatwin, who was another writer and traveller. The bisexual Chatwin often stayed with him at Este and elsewhere outside the United Kingdom; the pair had first met when they were in their twenties and they became lovers for some time. A journey to the various islands of Greece resulted in Millington-Drake discovering Patmos, which he much liked. He bought two 17th-century houses there in 1963, in the village of Chora, and set about building works that converted them into an enviable, relaxing environment, complete with a studio, that was much admired by the many people who visited him thereafter. The house, remodelled under the direction of John Stefanidis, was run with the assistance of staff, who included a cook, boatman and gardener. It featured often in magazines and caught the eye of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, whom Millington-Drake then invited to lunch there. Millington-Drake continued to enjoy travel, including a visit to paint on Easter Island in 1987, but the home at Patmos was thereafter his base until he died on 5 September 1994, even though he later also bought and converted an old farmhouse at Poggio al Pozzo near Siena, Tuscany. The cause of death was AIDS, from which Chatwin had also died four years earlier. Millington-Drake had undergone treatment for HIV in London but, despite being extremely ill, managed to fulfill his wish to die at home on Patmos, arriving there around 24 hours before his death. He was buried after a service at the Convent of Zoodochou Pigi, which he had supported for many years.  Art  Some of Millington-Drake's art is in public collections, such as the Victoria and Albert Museum. His range of subject matter was as eclectic as his choice of materials. Although he worked in various paint mediums, including acrylics, his watercolours are particularly notable and were exhibited in Bombay and New York, as well as London. There was a particularly successful London exhibition comprising watercolours of India and Ladakh held in 1982. Hope notes that \\"Viewed retrospectively his pictures form a seductive narrative of travels spanning more than 30 years, in search of some romantic and melancholy ideal\\". London's Lefevre Gallery mounted a tribute titled \\"The Travels with Teddy Millington-Drake : a memorial exhibition\\" that ran between 7-27 November 1996. A limited subscription edition of a memorial book was also published in that year, titled Shapes on the Horizon; it included tributes from friends such as Chatwin, Diana Melly and Felicity Sutherland.

She is well known for her role as the writer and libertine Sarah Asproon in the commercially successful films Eleven Days, Eleven Nights (1987) and Top Model (1988), both produced and directed by Joe D'Amato. In Italian productions, she is sometimes credited as Gilda Germano.  Early life  Jessica Moore was born on August 8, 1967 as Luciana Ottaviani in Urbino. She moved to Pesaro.Interview in Nocturno 95 (July 2010), pp. 100-105  Career  From 1986 to 1989, she appeared in about 10 films. She entered film by chance, introduced by Pamela Prati and her model agency to Joe D'Amato, for whom she debuted in Convent of Sinners (1986) under her birthname, acting in a supporting role as Sister Ursula. She became known for her second collaboration with D'Amato, the erotic drama Eleven Days, Eleven Nights (1987), in which she acted as protagonist in the role of Sarah Asproon, writer and libertine. The film turned its model, Adrian Lyne's 9 1/2 Weeks, on its head by swapping the gender roles and was successful internationally. The following year, Moore returned as Sarah Asproon in the sequel Top model (1988). Moore remembers that she was jestingly dubbed \\"la campagnola\\" (literally: \\"the country girl\\") on set since she was ashamed and hesitant before becoming jaunty in the end. She also remembers trusting D'Amato and feeling very much at her ease but also that he made certain \\"jokes\\" and \\"editing tricks\\" and a number of shots that she did not like. From the end of 1987 to the beginning of 1988, she appeared on TV as one of the dancing \\"ragazze coccod√©\\" (literally: \\"cluck cluck girls\\") for Renzo Arbore in Indietro tutta! and in 1989 in the second episode of the TV series Classe di ferro. She continued acting in supporting roles in theatrically released horror and other genre films until 1989. As a model she appeared in Playboy, Playmen and Gin Fizz / Gin Film. After her last role in 1989, Moore retired from the film business.

The battle was fought on the banks of the river Sucro near a town bearing the same name (present day Albalat de la Ribera). It ended indecisively: with Sertorius winning a tactical victory but having to withdraw because Pompey's colleague Metellus and his army were approaching. Background In 88 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla marched his legions on Rome starting a civil war. Quintus Sertorius, a client of Gaius Marius, joined his patron's faction and took up the sword against the Sullan faction (mainly optimates). After the death of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gaius Marius, Sertorius lost faith with his factions leadership. In 82 BC, during the second war against Sulla, he left Italy for his assigned propraetorian province in Hispania.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius , 6. Unfortunately his faction lost the war in Italy right after his departure and in 81 BC Sulla sent Gaius Annius Luscus with several legions to take the Spanish provinces from Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 7. After a brief resistance Sertorius and his men are expelled form Hispania. They ended up in Mauretania in north-western Africa where they conquer the city of Tingis. Here the Lusitanians, a fierce Iberian tribe who were about to be invaded by a Sullan governor, approached him. They asked him to become their war leader in the fight against the Sullans. In 80 BC, Sertorius landed at the little fishing town of Baelo near the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar) and returned to Hispania. Soon after his landing he fought and defeated the Sullan general Fufidius (the aforementioned Sullan governor) at the Baetis river. After this he defeated several Sullan armies and drove his opponents from Spain. Threatened by Sertorius' success the Senate in Rome upgraded Hispania Ulterior to a proconsular province and sent the proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius with a large army to fight him.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.68. Sertorius used guerrilla tactics so effectively he wore down Metellus while Sertorius' legate Lucius Hirtuleius defeated the governor of Hispania Citerior Marcus Domitius Calvinus. In 76 BC, the government in Rome decided to send Pompey and an even larger army to help Metellus.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 17. In the same year (76), Sertorius is joined by Marcus Perpenna, who brought him the remnants of the army of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the rebel consul of 78 BC.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15; Perpenna's men forced him to take them to Hispania and join Sertorius. Thus reinforced Sertorius decided to try and take the Spanish east coast (because the cities there support his enemies). His first target was the city of Lauron where he outgeneraled Pompey and massacred a large part of his army (see: the battle of Lauron).Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.96-101. In 75 BC Sertorius decided to take on Metellus and leave the battered Pompey to his legates Perpenna and Herennius. Pompey defeated his opponents in a battle near ValentiaPlutarch, Life of Pompey, 18. and forced Sertorius to come and take charge of the situation. Metellus used the change in command to defeat Hirtuleius whom Sertorius had left in charge at the Battle of Italica and marched after Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 19. Pompey and Sertorius, not wanting to wait for Metellus, met at the river Sucro and drew up for battle. Prelude The evening before the battle there was a thunderstorm, the entire horizon was lit by lightning flashes.Appian, Civil Wars, 1.110. The veteran soldiers of both armies ignored the ominous event and the next day the armies drew up for battle. Each general took station on his right flank, which meant that Sertorius was facing the capable Lucius Afranius, Pompey's second- in-command, while Pompey was facing an unknown subordinate of Sertorius.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.120. The Battle As both sides engaged there was hard fighting all over the line. Halfway through the battle Pompey's wing began to push hard and the enemy's left began to fall back. Sertorius, realizing the danger his army was in, turned over command of fighting Afranius to one of his subordinates and rode over to save his left wing. The presence of Sertorius in their ranks inspired his men. After stabilizing his left Sertorius launched a fierce counter-attack which shattered the Pompeian right. Pompey did his best to stem the tide of his men's retreat and was almost captured by his enemy. He was saved by his horse, not because it carried him to safety but because Sertorius' troops stopped to capture the prized abandoned equine apparition instead of going after its owner.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.121-122; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18. Meanwhile, Afranius had overwhelmed his opponents and had pushed into the Sertorian camp. Now Afranius' men, sure of victory, started pillaging the place. Unfortunately for them Sertorius and the other half of his army now descended on them with a vengeance. Catching them off guard the Sertorians killed many of them. In the meantime Pompey had regrouped most of his army and retreated to his own camp. Meanwhile, a second Roman army under the command of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, Pompey's colleague, had fought its way through Sertorius' rearguard and was only a good days march away. This meant that, if Sertorius chose to fight Pompey the next day, he would probably end up fighting Metellus as well. Fighting two enemies at once was something Sertorius did not relish. He had lost his chance to take Pompey out of the campaign. His bitter comment has been preserved by Plutarch: Despite knocking Pompey out of the battle, Sertorius army had suffered a great number of casualties and when Metellus arrived he would be outnumbered. Sertorius decided to retreat toward Clunia in the highlands of Celtiberia.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.123 Here he would be among his allies and Pompey and Metellus would have to follow him at their own peril. Aftermath Sertorius had fought long and hard for the Spanish east coast but now had no other choice other than concede his conquests. But the war was long from over, Sertorius still had allies, his reputation and an army. He marched into the Celtiberian uplands and reverted to guerrilla warfare again. The war would drag on for another three years and only end because a few of his own men plotted against Sertorius and assassinated him.

The show was held in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico, which is IWRG's primary venue. For the 2017 event Bombero Infernal, Black Warrior, Cerebro Negro, Demonio Infernal, El Hijo del Diablo, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr., Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47, Oficial Fierro, Veneno, and Villano IV all wore their masks again after having lost Luchas de Apuestas, or \\"bet matches\\", in the past and thus lost the rights to wear their mask. Others worked under a previous ring name, wearing the mask of their former alter ego such as Freelance (working as \\"Panterita\\"), Black Terry (as \\"Guerrero Maya Sr.\\"), Oficial Factor and Oficial Spartan (as \\"Mega\\" and \\"S√∫per Mega\\") and Mike Segura (as \\"Orito\\") Lucha libre legends Villano III and Villano V were honored prior to the main event, where Villano V Jr. was officially introduced. The son of Villano V had previously worked under the ring name \\"Kortiz\\" but was officially given the \\"Villano\\" name at this event. Afterwards Villano V Jr. teamed up with his cousin Villano III Jr. and his uncle Villano IV to defeat the trio of Negro Navarro, El Texano Jr., and Trauma II by disqualification. On the undercard Black Warrior defeated Car√≠stico, the very man who had won Warrior's mask years prior. The show featured five additional matches. Production Background The wrestling mask has always held a sacred place in lucha libre, carrying with it a mystique and anonymity beyond what it means to wrestlers elsewhere in the world. The ultimate humiliation a luchador can suffer is to lose a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match. Following a loss in a Lucha de Apuesta match the masked wrestler would be forced to unmask, state their real name and then would be unable to wear that mask while wrestling anywhere in Mexico. Since 2007 the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held a special annual show where they received a waiver to the rule from the State of Mexico Wrestling Commission and wrestlers would be allowed to wear the mask they previously lost in a Lucha de Apuestas. The annual IWRG Festival de las M√°scaras (\\"Festival of the Masks\\") event is also partly a celebration or homage of lucha libre history with IWRG honoring wrestlers of the past at the events similar to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's (CMLL) Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to Two Legends\\") annual shows. The IWRG's Festival de las M√°scaras shows, as well as the majority of their major IWRG shows in general, are held in Arena Naucalpan, owned by the promoters of IWRG and is their main venue. The 2018 Festival de las M√°scaras show was the eleventh year in a row IWRG held the show. Storylines The Festival de las M√°scaras event featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The semi-main event of the show was built off a decade old rivalry, dating back to 2006 where Black Warrior and Car√≠stico (then known as M√≠stico) were embroiled in a major storyline feud for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). As part of the feud Black Warrior defeated Car√≠stico to win the NWA World Middleweight Championship on May 12, 2006. The feud culminated in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", between the two. Both wrestlers put their mask on the line on in the main event of the CMLL 73rd Anniversary Show. Car√≠stico defeated Black Warrior, forcing Black Warrior to unmask as a result and, according to lucha libre tradition, never wrestle wearing the Black Warrior mask again. On April 29, 2007 Car√≠stico regained the NWA World Middleweight Championship to put an end to their storyline feud at the time. IWRG promoted the match between the two as a feature match, placing it in the semi-main event sport for the Festival de las M√°scaras, pushing the angle that this would be Black Warrior's chance for revenge, while wearing the mask he had lost in 2006. The \\"Trios\\" match type (three versus three men tag team matches) became incredibly popular in Mexico in the early 1980s, to the point where the trios match is the most common match on wrestling shows. Two of the teams that helped popularize the Trios matches was Los Misioneros de la Muerte (El Texano, Negro Navarro and El Signo) and Los Villanos (Villano III, Villano IV and Villano V). IWRG's \\"Festival de las M√°scaras\\" shows is normally their way of paying homage to lucha libre history, which for 2017 meant that they booked versions of those two factions in the main event. El Texano died in 2006, and El Signo retired in 2010, leaving only Negro Navarro as an active competitor. For the Festival de las M√°scaras show IWRG brought in El Texano's son, El Texano Jr. and Negro Navarro's son Trauma II to represent the Los Misionero side of the match. Both Villano III and V had retired by 2017, but IWRG had Villano III Jr. represent his father, while Villano V's son Kortiz would fill out the other side for the match. Main Event Prior to the main event of the show, Villano V introduced Villano V Jr., marking the first time that Kortiz had officially wrestled under that name. During the main event, Los Misioneros would isolate Villano III Jr. for long periods of time. tearing up his mask and making him bleed profusely. The Villanos won the match when El Texano Jr. was caught breaking the rules, causing a disqualification after a low blow to Villano III Jr. After the match, Los Villanos gained a measure of revenge by chasing off their opponents when they brought folding chairs into the ring. Aftermath Following his loss to long-time rival Black Warrior in the semi-main event, Car√≠stico to another Lucha de Apuestas match, putting his mask on the line against the hair of Black Warrior. The storyline between the two was one of the focal points for the build to IWRG's next major event, the 2017 Prisi√≥n Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") show. That feud, and an ongoing feud between IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Mr. Electro and Trauma II was combined for the eponymous Prisi√≥n Fatal steel cage match main event. The match ended with Car√≠stico once againd defeating his rival Black Warrior, this time forcing Black Warrior to have all his hair shaved off as a result of the loss.

He came from Cyrene and was the son of either a man called Apollonius or of Apollodorus the epistrategos of Thebais. Helenus joined the service of Ptolemy VIII while he was ruling as King in Cyrene between 163 and 145 BC and then followed him to Alexandria when he became king of Egypt. During Ptolemy's civil war with Cleopatra II, Helenus must have followed the king when he withdrew to Cyprus. There he worked with the governor (strategos) Theodorus, serving in his staff as a kind of deputy governor of Cyprus. Among other things, he dedicated a statue to the governor and another one for an unnamed son of the governor.Mitford (1959), pp. 96‚Äì97, no. 1 & 2; (1961), p. 32, no. 85 and 86. In 118 BC, Theodorus was summoned to Alexandria and Helenus himself assumed the position of governor and high priest of Cyprus. At this time, the king's eldest son Ptolemy (later Ptolemy IX) resided on the island and Helenus also erected a statue in honour of him.Mitford (1959), pp. 98‚Äì99, no. 4; (1961), p. 33, no. 88. Helenus himself received a statue from the priests of Aphrodite of Paphos.Mitford (1959), pp. 97‚Äì98, no. 3; (1961), pp. 32‚Äì33, no. 87. In 116 BC, prince Ptolemy took over the governorship for himself, but when his father died later that year he departed for Alexandria in order to seize the kingship by force. Ptolemy IX sent his younger brother, who would later rule as Ptolemy X, to Cyprus, where he formally assumed the position of Governor. Helenus was appointed as the prince's tutor (tropheus) and in practice he governed the island on Ptolemy's behalf. There are five inscriptions from statues dedicated to him while he was in this role.Mitford (1959), pp. 99‚Äì100, no. 5 = SEG 18.575 = Jean Pouilloux, Paul Roesch, Jean Marcillet-Jaubert: Salamine de Chypre XIII.

When Ptolemy X proclaimed himself king on Cyprus in 114 BC, Helenus was officially appointed governor once more. When Ptolemy X went to Alexandria in 107 BC to replace his brother as the co-ruler of his mother Cleopatra III, Helenus accompanied him and was appointed admiral (nauarchos) of the fleet. As a reward for his services, Cleopatra III appointed him as the first priest of the newly established cult of herself as the 'Beneficent and Mother-loving Goddess' (Euergetis kai Philometor Thea). But in the next year (106 BC), he had been replaced in this role by Theodorus, his predecessor as governor of Cyprus.For the priests of the cult of Cleopatra III, see Koenen. It is unlikely that Helenus was dead in 106 BC. In that year, Cleopatra III and Ptolemy X had clashed and Cleopatra assumed sole rule in Alexandria. As a close associate of her son, Helenus would not have been suitable in the role of the queen's priest, so she probably had him replaced.

Michael's formative years were spent in North West London where the family moved to soon after the birth of his younger brother Nicholas Uchenna Ugwu. Michael received his primary and secondary education from Lockers Park Boarding School in Hertfordshire and Woodside Park International School, London. He obtained his Bachelor's Degree in Politics and History from Brunel University London in 2002 and went on to pursue in a Master's Degree in Economic Development at University College London (UCL), graduating in 2007. Michael also received Executive Education at Lagos Business School, Pan Atlantic University, and Harvard Business School in 2016 and 2017 respectively.  Career  While working as a business analyst at the Royal Bank of Scotland Michael began actively planning to return to Nigeria in 2007. That year, he attended multiple careers fairs in London where African business were exhibiting and received a number of job offers from leading Nigerian financial services institutions including Diamond Bank, and Access Bank. Michael accepted an offer from Futureview Capital, a leading Investment Bank firm, and relocated to Lagos to complete his mandatory National Youth Service prior to his full engagement with the Bank. At Futureview Capital Michael worked as a core member of the Research & Strategy team, providing timely financial market research reports as well as working directly with the MD on strategies to effectively guide the firm through the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.

By 2011, the business had grown to a 100,000-capacity fish farm and Michael became a dry/smoked fish supplier to early supermarkets such as Ebeano. It was also around this time Michael began to feel pressure from his family to get involved in Nigerian politics, prompting him to run for a seat representing Enugu at the National Assembly. Despite losing the election, Michael developed a powerful grassroots network in his Udi, Enugu constituency that would eventually form a large part of his youth activism and empowerment projects in Enugu State. From 2010 to 2013, Michael was the CEO at iROKING, an online digital music platform focused on the Nigerian Entertainment Industry.

Associated with the Hudson River School of landscape artists, his southern US heritage and the influence of his time spent in Europe gave him a distinct style within that group, in painting vegetation and atmospheric effects. Mignot's parents came to the US from France after the Bourbon Restoration in 1815. Mignot pursued his interest in art in Europe beginning in 1848, and spent much of his life outside the US. Starting in 1850 he worked for four years in Andreas Schelfhout's studio in The Hague, Netherlands, then travelled in Europe. Returning to New York City, he soon travelled with artist Frederic Edwin Church to Ecuador in 1857, gathering material for his paintings of the tropics, the subject of a large portion of his subsequent work. In 1858 he had a studio at the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City. The next year the National Academy of Design, where he had first exhibited in 1853, elected him as an associate, and in 1860 he became an academician. He collaborated with painters Eastman Johnson and John W. Ehninger, who provided figures for his landscapes, and Thomas Rossiter, whose history paintings of Mount Vernon benefitted from Mignot's landscapes. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, he raised money with a sale of his paintings, then sailed to England in June 1862, where he lived in London. His exhibitions at the Royal Academy between 1863 and 1871 were warmly received. His work was shown at the 1870 Paris Salon. He died in England of smallpox in 1870, shortly after fleeing France due to the Franco- Prussian War. In 1996, the North Carolina Museum of Art held an exhibition of Mignot's work, the result of five years of research by John W. Coffey, a curator at the museum, which led to the discovery of dozens of Mignot's paintings. He co-authored an exhibition catalogue with Katherine E. Manthorne, and the exhibition, \\"Louis Remy Mignot: A Southern Painter Abroad\\", toured to the National Academy of Design in 1997. This led to a reassessment of Mignot's work, with one academic specializing in American painting of the era rating him as highly as Church in the pantheon of nineteenth-century American artists.

Biography Ullmann received her doctorate in microbiology from the University of Budapest. After a research visit to Institut Pasteur in 1958/59 working with Jacques Monod, she moved to France in 1960 with the support of Monod, who smuggled her and her husband over the Austria/Hungary border in a Hungarian caravan. A blog post by Sean B. Carroll about his book on Monod, Brave Genius, with photo from Ullmann With a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation she went to the laboratory of Monod at the Institut Pasteur, where she remained for the rest of her career. There she became a professor, laboratory director and in 1982 a member of the Board of Directors. Ullmann initially dealt with the effects of antibiotics at the Institut Pasteur and was able to elucidate, among other things, the mode of action of streptomycin (as an inhibitor of protein synthesis in bacteria). She also studied the effect of Second Messenger cAMP in the bacterial cell. In 1967 she showed that cAMP reverses catabolite repression in the bacterium E. coli. Later, she discovered another factor that boosts catabolite repression (catabolite modulator factor, or CMF). Ullmann subsequently dealt with the mode of action of the whooping cough pathogen and its toxin. She showed that the toxin increases the cAMP production in the host cell and thus disturbs their metabolism. The ability of the toxin to provide other molecules with access to the attacked host cell also helped her to develop vaccines by coupling the genetically engineered whooping cough toxin with antigenic fragments that were to be immunized against. In 2002 she received the Robert Koch Medal. She was an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and of the European Academy of Microbiology (EAM). EAM President Philippe Sansonetti recalled all her contributions to microbiology in the \\"I n memoriam Agnes Ullmann\\" In 1978, with Andr√© Lwoff, she published a collection of essays by Jacques Monod and she published two anthologies in memory of him.

United States, 583 U.S. ___ (2018), is a Supreme court decision related to the ability to challenge the constitutionality of a federal law if the defendant has already pleaded guilty. Background A federal grand jury indicted petitioner, Rodney Class, for possessing firearms in his locked jeep, which was parked on the grounds of the United States Capitol in Washington, D. C. See 40 U.S.C. ¬ß 5104(e)(1) (‚ÄúAn individual . . . may not carry . . . on the Grounds or in any of the Capitol Buildings a firearm‚Äù).. Appearing pro se, Class asked the District Court to dismiss the indictment. He alleged that the statute, ¬ß 5104(e), violates the Second Amendment and the Due Process Clause. After the District Court dismissed both claims, Class pleaded guilty to ‚ÄúPossession of a Firearm on U. S. Capitol Grounds, in violation of 40 U.S.C. ¬ß 5104(e).‚Äù App. 30. A written plea agreement set forth the terms of Class‚Äô guilty plea, including several categories of rights that he agreed to waive. The agreement said nothing about the right to challenge on direct appeal the constitutionality of the statute of conviction. After conducting a hearing pursuant to Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the District Court accepted Class‚Äô guilty plea and sentenced him. Soon thereafter, Class sought to raise his constitutional claims on direct appeal. The Court of Appeals held that Class could not do so because, by pleading guilty, he had waived his constitutional claims.

From 217 BC, he served Ptolemy IV as governor (strategos) of Cyprus, as we know from three inscriptions found on the island. He is the earliest Ptolemaic governor to be attested epigraphically.

Pelops had been openly opposed to Sosibius and Agathocles, so he was appointed ambassador to the Seleucid King Antiochus III by Agathocles in order to keep him away from the Ptolemaic court in Alexandria.Polybius, Histories 15.25.13. He is not attested again after this. Polycrates of Argos replaced him as governor of Cyprus.

Built in 1926 during a period of rapid population growth, it served the city as a high school and then junior high school until 1983. It was designed by New Haven architect Roy Foote, and is a prominent local example of Classical Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It now houses residences. Description and history The Old West Haven High School is located in a mainly residential area two blocks east of the West Haven town green, on the south side of Main Street east of Washington Avenue. It is a large two-story H-shaped structure, built with load-bearing masonry walls of brick and terra cotta. Its long main facade is broken up by projecting sections at the ends and in the center. The end pavilions have brick pilasters at the corners, and terra cotta pilasters flanking bands of sash windows. The center pavilion houses the main entrance, which is framed by two-story columns with Egyptian Revival capitals and a fully pedimented gable. The front portion of the H originally housed classrooms and offices, while the rear of the building housed the gymnasium and auditorium. With West Haven experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century, with people moving to the city in pursuit of industrial employment. This rapid growth overwhelmed the local schools, and the city embarked on a major school construction program in the 1910s. Land for this building was purchased in 1916, but construction did not begin until 1925, and the building opened in 1927. It was designed by New Haven architect Roy Foote, who had already designed one school for the city, built in 1905. Population growth continued through the mid-20th century, and the city built a new high school in 1964, converting this one into a junior high school. It was closed in 1983, and was sold for redevelopment.

The pump was extremely compact, leaving room for considerable first-aid plant including a 50-ft. sliding-carriage escape, a 30-gallon chemical tank complete with reel and hose, and stowage capacity for 2,000 ft. of hose and all the other standard equipment suitable for such a turnout.

Born enslaved from birth in New Orleans in the mid-1820s, he was legally manumitted by his father, who was also his owner, at four years old. Warburg initially apprenticed as a marble cutter and later worked as a sculptor in New Orleans in the 1840s and early 1850s. He moved to Europe in 1853, where he worked as a successful sculptor until his death in 1859. Early life Joseph Eugene Warburg, was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in late 1825 or possibly early 1926. His father, Daniel Warburg, was a Jewish emigrant from a prominent family in Hamburg, Germany. Warburg's mother was Daniel's mistress, Marie Rose Blondeau, a mixed-race enslaved woman from of Santiago, Cuba. Blondeau's mother was also enslaved by Daniel Warburg. . Marie Rose was given her freedom after Warburg's birth. Warburg was the oldest of his parents five children was manumitted by his father when he was four years old. She died in 1837 at the age of 33, bequeathing three enslaved people to her five children. Career Warburg was apprenticed to French artist, Phillippe Garbeille, as a marble cutter when he was a young man. While in his early twenties, Warburg established his own studio-workshop in the French Quarter. In the 1840s and early 1850s, Warburg received commissions to create portrait busts, religious statuary and gravestones. In 1850, Warburg's bas-relief, Ganymede Offering a Cup of Nectar to Jupiter was exhibited for viewing and purchase in New Orleans for $500. The local newspaper, The New Orleans Bee, lavished praise on the young artist's work: \\"This exquisite specimen of sculpture\\", the work \\"by a young Creole of our city\\". the critic stated, \\"reflects infinite credit upon the taste and talent of our townsmen\\". Increasing racial tensions, due possibly to jealousy from white artists in the community, caused Warburg to move to Paris. Before he left, Warburg filed a friendly lawsuit against his father to seek his share of the distribution of his mother's estate. His father, in turn, hosted a meeting with a notary public and six free men of color to speak on behalf of Warburg's siblings who were still minors. The participants voted unanimously to order the sale of the three slaves bequeathed to the children. Warburg's portion of his mother's estate was valued at $252.00. Not willing to wait for the distribution of the sale proceeds, Warburg selected his father to represent his interests, and sailed for Europe in November, 1852. While studying and working in Paris from 1852 to 1856, Warburg was given letters of introduction to potential patrons by prominent Americans, including pro-slavery diplomat, John Young Mason who was the United States Ambassador to France. Warburg traveled to Belgium and England in 1856. He was encouraged and supported in his work by prominent American and British abolitionists, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland. In 1856, the Duchess of Sutherland commissioned a series of bas-reliefs from Warburg, based on the story of Uncle Tom's Cabin. In 1857, with letters of introduction from Harriet Beecher Stowe and The Duchess of Suthereland, Warburg traveled to Italy, eventually settling permanently in Rome with his wife, Louise Ernestine. Warburg worked successfully as a sculptor in Rome for two years. His life was cut short, when he contracted an illness and died days later, on January 12, 1859.

It is also known as the North Street Group. The cottages were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. They are often grouped with the adjacent former Court House Hotel building. The residence, along with the hotel, had previously been listed both jointly and individually on the former Register of the National Estate on 21 March 1978. History The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. The first alienation of the land encompassed by the study area for European purposes was made on 19 November 1794. This was a grant of 30 acres made to Samuel Wilcox. The boundaries of the grant were from the banks of the Hawkesbury River half way to South Creek with one corner of the land touching on the creek. He named his property Wilcox Farm; this name was specified on the deed of grant made by Francis Grose. Wilcox was given the property free of all taxes, fees and other charges for 10 years so long as he resided there and commenced to improve and cultivate the land. If he failed to do so within 5 years the land would revert to the Crown. As he was able to sell his property it infers that improvements were carried out on it although the nature, extent and location of these works are unknown. At some time between 1794 and 1841 Wilcox sold his property to George Thomas Palmer, a gentleman of Parramatta. Palmer had arrived in NSW as a Lieutenant of the 61st Regiment but with permission to settle as a free immigrant. He served for a short time as Provost-Marshall and was appointed Superintendent of Government Stock in 1813. He resigned his position within a year and set up his home near Parramatta. He began to acquire extensive tracts of land around the settlement including 700 acres at Bringelly granted in 1812. He became a prominent member of the community serving on a number of public boards. He died in England in 1854. Palmer Street in the town of Windsor is named after him. Most likely, therefore, Palmer purchased Wilcox Farm after 1813 as well as substantial tracts surrounding it, over 1000 acres. Although Palmer did not live at the Hawkesbury property it is clear from primary sources that this fertile tract was put to good use for cultivation. The plan prepared for the auction of the estate in the 1840s shows that the study area adjoined a large holding of fenced and cultivated paddocks, with ricks of hay then standing on them. There appear to have been several buildings associated with these paddocks. One of these structures, a small square building labelled \\"new hut\\", stood at the back of the later allotment 18, behind 37-39 North Street. This was labelled the \\"rick yard\\", that is, a storage yard associated with the fields nearby. In 1841 Palmer sold a total of 1500 acres including the 30 acres of Wilcox Farm to Charles Campbell, a gentleman of Sydney. Campbell offered what was called the Peninsula Farm for sale as a subdivided estate in 1842.Cultural Resources Management, 2004, p.10 Lots along North Street being developed throughout the nineteenth century, likely primarily residential in nature. North Street was named for Lieutenant Samuel North. 25 North Street The allotments at 25 North Street (Lot 20 and 21) were purchased by Charles Campbell, who also owned the allotment at 23 North Street. In 1844, Lot 21 was sold to James Bell of North Richmond and Robert Stewart, a watchmaker of Windsor. At some stage between 1844 and 1865, Stewart came into sole possession of the property. A house largely built over Lot 21 was probably constructed during this period. In 1884, the site was sold to James Ewing, whose wife was the daughter of Aquila Hagger, the owner of the adjoining property, and remained in the extended Ewing family's ownership until 1922. A survey plan in the 1930s shows only the house with no outbuildings elsewhere on the property. The property was sold to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). The National Trust undertook renovations before selling the property back to private ownership. 28 North Street The early archival evidence for this property is very limited. The present house was built 1875 for the Tebbutt family, of Peninsula House and Tebbutt's Observatory. It later became the family home of the Mullinger family, and in 1987 was still held by a descendant. Modern additions include a new two-storey sandstock brick garage (1988), in-ground swimming pool at rear (1993), and additions and the erection of a Victorian-style summer house near the pool (1997). 29 North Street In 1842, the site of 29 North Street was sold to Joseph Windred, who was responsible for the construction of the free-standing cottage on this allotment, probably in the early 1840s. The property was kept in the Windred family until 1872. In 1873, the property was sold to Aquila Hagger, a farmer in Windsor. The property was kept in the Hagger family until 1960, and has had several changes of ownership since that time. A 1930s survey plan shows no outbuildings on the property at that time. It was sold to the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in 1976. A 1977 survey plan shows some galvanised iron and wooden sheds behind the buildings including a garage added to the eastern boundary of the property. The National Trust subsequently undertook renovations and sold the property back into private ownership. 31-33 North Street In 1843, the site of 31-33 North Street was purchased by John Shearing, who had already purchased both 35 North Street and the Court House Hotel site at 37-39 North Street in 1842. The present building was constructed in the 1840s, possibly as an inn, but more likely as an adjunct to the Court House Inn, given that the inn was in operation one door away. The property remained in the Shearing family until 1862. 31-33 North Street was sold to Richard Seymour, a saddle and harness maker/tanner of Windsor, in 1862. At the same time Seymour purchased 35 North Street. Both properties at 31-33 North Street and 35 North Street were sold to John Dunstan, a farmer in Wilberforce, in 1870. 31-33 North Street remained in the Dunstan extended family until 1900. It was sold to Thomas Barter in 1900. The property remained in the extended Barter family until 1964, when it was sold to John Molloy. It was sold again in 1981. The National Trust of Australia (NSW) classified the property in 1976. 35 North Street The land adjoining the former Court House Hotel was part of that property (37-39 North Street) until 1863, owned by John Shearing, then shopkeeper Uriah Moses, and then again by the Shearing family. The cottage was constructed probably 1860s, although it is possible it pre-dates this time, by Richard Seymour, who purchased the land from the Shearing family.) In 1870, the property was sold to John Dunstan, a farmer in Wilberforce. Dunstan also purchased the adjoining property at 31-33 North Street at this time. 35 North Street remained in the Dunstan extended family until 1952, continuously being used as a residential property. A survey plan 1930s shows no outbuildings on the property at that time. Another survey plan 1977 shows some galvanised iron and wooden sheds behind the buildings including a garage added to the eastern boundary of the property. In 1976, the property was sold to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). An old timber building was relocated and rebuilt in the yard of this property on its eastern boundary sometime after 1978. The National Trust undertook repairs and renovations, before selling the property back into private ownership. Description The residences are located on the northern side of North Street between the intersection of this street with Arndell and Palmer Streets. The buildings follow the topography of North Street, which drops from the highest point at the western end (37-39 North Street) to the lowest level in the study area at the east (23 North Street). There is also a slope from north to south. The facades of the nineteenth century buildings are in a similar alignment along North Street and are sited close to the present street separated from it only by a narrow grassed footpath. All of the properties have substantial trees behind them and all have landscaped gardens in the immediate environs of the houses. 25 North Street comprises semi- detached cottages with two front doors now used as a single occupancy house. It is built from sandstock brick above a sandstone cellar and foundations. The verandah paving and sills are also formed from sandstone. There are twelve- pane window sashes and six-panel doors. There is a jerkin head roof with dormer windows. It is hipped to the verandah. The centrally placed chimney reflects the two former occupancies. There are out-buildings behind. 28 North Street is a formal single-storey brick house set back from the street. It has a wide returning verandah with cast iron open columns and valance, and French windows opening from inside with long louvered shutters. The high central chimney crowning the roof emphasises the formality of the design. 29 North Street is a free-standing sandstock brick cottage. It has sandstone foundations, lintels and sills. Windows are twelve-pane and doors are four- panel. The roof is covered in iron and is hipped to house and bellcast to the timber verandah. This has a timber picket fence. 31-33 North Street is built from sandstock brick. The walls rest on stone foundations. There is also a stone-paved verandah that is edged with a picket fence. The house has a hipped iron roof. There are twelve-pane windows and glazed French doors. 35 North Street is a single storey timber house that has as its western wall the brick wall of the adjoining 37-39 North Street. It has a rusticated boarded front, four-pane windows and four-panel doors. It has a simple pitched roof with curved iron sheets covering the verandah. The latter is edged with a picket fence. A weatherboard extension has been made to the back of the building. There is a large timber outbuilding that has been imported to the site.

Strabo relates that the Cephissus emerged from its subterranean channel at Upper Larymna, and joined the sea at the Lower Larymna; and that Upper Larymna had belonged to ancient Phocis until it was annexed to the Lower or Boeotian Larymna by the Romans. Upper Larymna belonged originally to the Opuntian Locris, and Lycophron mentions it as one of the towns of Ajax O√Øleus.Lycophr. 1146. Pausanias also states that it was originally Locrian; and he adds, that it voluntarily joined the Boeotian League on the increase of the power of the Thebans. This, however, probably did not take place in the time of Epaminondas, as the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, written subsequently, still calls it a Locrian town.Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax p. 23. It may have joined the Boeotian league after Thebes had been rebuilt by Cassander. In 230 BCE, Larymna is described as a Boeotian town;, where ŒõŒ¨œÅœÖŒºŒΩŒ±ŒΩ should be read instead of ŒõŒ±Œ≤œÅœçŒΩŒ±ŒΩ. and in the time of Sulla it is again spoken of as a Boeotian town. We may conclude from the preceding statements that the more ancient town was the Locrian (Upper) Larymna, situated at a spot, called Anchoe by Strabo, where the Cephissus emerged from its subterranean channel. At the distance of a mile and a half (2.5 km) Larymna had a port upon the coast, which gradually rose into importance, especially from the time when Larymna joined the Boeotian League, as its port then became the most convenient communication with the eastern sea for Lebadeia, Chaeroneia, Orchomenus, Copae, and other Boeotian towns. The port-town was called, from its position, Lower Larymna, to distinguish it from the Upper city. The former may also have been called more especially the Boeotian Larymna, as it became the seaport of so many Boeotian towns. Upper Larymna, though it had joined the Boeotian League, continued to be frequently called the Locrian, on account of its ancient connection with Locris. When the Romans united Upper Larymna to Lower Larymna, the inhabitants of the former place were probably transferred to the latter; and Upper Larymna was henceforth abandoned. This accounts for Pausanias mentioning only one Larymna, which must have been the Lower city; for if he had visited Upper Larymna, he could hardly have failed to mention the emission of the Cephissus at this spot. Moreover, the ruins at Lower Larymna show that it became a place of much more importance than Upper Larymna. These ruins, which are called Kastri, like those of Delphi, are situated on the shore of the Bay of Larmes, on a level covered with bushes, ten minutes to the left of the mouth of the Cephissus. William Martin Leake visited the place in the mid-19th century, and notes that the circuit of the walls is less than a mile (1.6 km). Leake adds, that the walls, which in one place are extant to nearly half their height, are of a red soft stone, very much corroded by the sea air, and in some places are constructed of rough masses. The sorus is high, with comparison to its length and breadth, and stands in its original place upon the rocks: there was an inscription upon it, and some ornaments of sculpture, which are now quite defaced. The Glyfonero is a small deep pool of water, impregnated with salt, and was considered by the current inhabitants as cathartic.

It lies west of Cape D'Estaing and is accessible from land in the locality of Wisanger via the North Coast Road. Smith Creek empties into the western end of the bay. It is the site of a proposed port for the export of timber and receipt of passenger and cargo vessels. Yumbah Aquaculture has been commercially producing abalone by drawing water and returning it to the bay since 1995.  Port Proposal  Feasibility studies into the prospect of constructing a port at Smith Bay were commissioned and published by Kangaroo Island Plantation Timber in 2014. In 2017 it was declared a Major Development by the Government of South Australia. The port is designed to accommodate timber loading, passenger vessels and general cargo vessels at a floating pontoon in water 10 metres deep. The pontoon would be connected to the shore via a 250 metre long causeway which would support vehicle traffic for the conveyance of tourists. The company's Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be lodged in the last quarter of 2018. Mitsui is expecting to construct and operate woodchip loading facilities at the port site if the development proceeds.  Response  Critics of the proposal have expressed concern about the potential impacts of basin dredging, and have claimed that work conducted in preparation of the EIS may have impacted fishing grounds, scarred the seabed and resulted in seagrass loss. Conservationists have claimed that drilling operations in the bay related to the port project \\"chased\\" a Southern right whale and her calf out of the bay. The claim was refuted by Kangaroo Island Plantation Timber, who said that the whales left the area before drilling commenced. Yumbah Aquaculture is also concerned about the potential impact port construction and operation could have on their onshore abalone business, which circulates water to and from the bay for its operational use. Concerns include the mobilisation of sediment \\"choking\\" their stock, the importation of invasive species to the area and the impact of a built causeway on local water temperature to which abalone are sensitive.

In Defenders of Fortress Europe, Mitcham utilized over 200 previously unreleased personnel files to build a picture of the German command class facing the Allied invasion. He focuses on personal and political differences among the officer class, which ultimately contributed to the defeat of the German forces in Normandy. Mitcham also explores their motivations, often highly self-serving. He shows that the in- fighting took on political as well as class dimensions, as illustrated by the power struggle between Gerd von Rundstedt, the nominal commander in the West, and Erwin Rommel, the de facto leader in Normandy.Bradley Nichols (February 2011): Nichols on Mitcham, 'Defenders of Fortress Europe: The Untold Story of the German Officers during the Allied Invasion', H-Net Mitcham's work on the Eastern Front, the 2001 The German Defeat in the East, 1944-1945 utilises outdated secondary sources and provides a single-sided German perspective.

As Locri in Bruttium in Italy was, according to some of the ancients, a colony of Narycus, the epithet of Narycian is frequently given to the Bruttian pitch.Virgil G. 2.438; Col. 10.386; Its location is near the modern Rengini.

Throughout its history the railway system shaped the cultural institutions of Mount Tom, being operator of the mountain's famous summit houses, one of which hosted President McKinley, the Mount Tom Railroad, and the trolley park at the opposite end of this funicular line, Mountain Park. In the history of American railroad engineering, the system was the first in the United States to make use of exothermic welding, better known as thermite welding, to lay track for regular use. Railway engineer George E. Pellissier would not only be the first in the country to implement this now-standard operating procedure, but would further develop Hans Goldschmidt's welding process for the street railway, subsequently serving as an engineer and superintendent for the inventor's Goldschmidt Thermite Company before returning to Holyoke as an assistant general manager.For examples of role in Goldschmidt Thermit Company see * Operated by the Holyoke Street Railway Company, abbreviated on livery as the Hly. St. Ry. Co., the streetcar system began operation on September 24, 1884, consolidated with the Amherst and Sunderland Street Railway in 1907, and ceased operations as a streetcar operator in 1937. Regular bus operations began in 1921, and soon after the incorporation of the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority in 1977, the company began serving as a contract operator. This service continued until 1987, when a dispute between labor and management led regular bus service to an abrupt end, with would-be passengers still waiting at stops, on July 1, 1987. After four years of inactivity and with a municipal school bus contract failing to pass negotiations, the company liquidated its assets and had dissolved by 1991. Today their former headquarters serves as the main facilities of the Holyoke Department of Public Works, now known as the Pellisier Building, for the family which owned and managed the system in its final decades. A second car barn of the Amherst and Sunderland Street Railway division functions as facilities for the town of Amherst's own Department of Public Works. Rail Founding and early years A horsecar on the South Hadley Falls line, ; horsecars would be used by the company from 1884 to 1891, when they were supplanted by electric streetcars The Holyoke Street Railway Company held its first meeting on February 12, 1884, with a charter granted by the Office of Secretary of the Commonwealth Henry B. Pierce on June 11, 1884. According to the company's articles of association, it began with capital of $25,000 (‚âà$692,000 in 2017 USD) with 250 shares of $100 each issued, and was authorized to operate as a horsecar rail system in South Hadley and Holyoke. The company's first president was William A. Chase, and its first board of directors included two members who would later become mayors of Holyoke, Franklin P. Goodall and George H. Smith. William S. Loomis, a key figure in system adoption and expansion, board member, eventual president and general manager of the company from 1887 until 1912 The system rapidly expanded its service capacity; in 1884, the system had 2 cars and 5 horses operating a line between Main Street in Holyoke and South Hadley Falls, by 1886 this had expanded to 3 other routes in Holyoke and the livery totaled at 15 cars and 56 horses. At the time it was commonplace for patrons to keep lumps or cubes of sugar in their pockets for often ornery horses. In its earliest years it met some resistance from Hampshire County commissioners and South Hadley selectmen, threatening to withdraw from South Hadley Falls in 1886 due to policies related to taxation and maintenance of roads and a former bridge connecting Holyoke across the Connecticut River. The following year, it was proposed the company stop every other car on the South Hadley route on the Holyoke side of where the Vietnam Memorial Bridge stands today, to halve taxes paid for use of the bridge there at that time. Public opinion on the South Hadley side of the river remained largely in favor of the company, however one writer for The Republican compared the ordeal to \\"child's play\\" due to lack of compromise by either. Some consensus was eventually reached during the construction of the bridge's successor, the Hadley-Holyoke Bridge by engineer Edward S. Shaw, as the railway company's lawyer would work with Hampshire and Hampden county commissioners to negotiate the bridge's width and location of the railway tracks. In 1887, William S. Loomis, a former partner in the Holyoke Transcript-Telegram, approached the railway's board of directors proposing that their line from City Hall and Maple Street be extended further into Elmwood. Loomis had previously purchased a large tract of land there which he planned to develop into a streetcar suburb. His calls for expansion were rejected however by the railway company, but ultimately working with connections from his time as a newspaper magnate, he would buy a controlling share in the company. Upon purchasing this stock, Loomis began working on the laying out of additional tracks along with roads on his own land, the former Horace Brown Farm which would become the blocks around modern-day Elmwood Avenue, as well as Laurel Street/Brown Avenue across Northampton Street. During his time with the railway Loomis would serve as treasurer as well as general manager of the company, and is generally credited as a key figure in the expansion of the railway system to the two other neighborhoods, Oakdale and Springdale. Electrification and expansion The railway's first electric car ran on the South Hadley Falls line at about 2pm on August 8, 1891, and by the end of that year all routes had been electrified. The very first run however proved to not be a resounding success as aside from Loomis and the board of directors, no passengers climbed aboard on the maiden run of an electric car; it was not until the return trip back over the bridge from South Hadley that one Jesse L. Bliss became the new system's first passenger. Bliss himself would go on to try to become a driver of the cars, however reportedly jumped one of the trolleys off the tracks on his own first run. The electrification of old horse trams came within less than a decade for the Holyoke Street Railway and in Massachusetts as a whole. When the railway's first electric cars appeared in 1891, at the time about a third of all street railway lines in Massachusetts had electric overhead systems. However by the turn of the century not only were these cars commonplace in the Holyoke system, they comprised more than 99% of such streetcar lines in the Commonwealth. Another feature that typified railways in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was trolley parks; in the years immediately after the electrification of the system, Loomis purchased a large lot on the southeastern side of Mount Tom and in 1894 purchased a post-and-beam stage for performers there. In 1895 the railway was extended to this site, and by 1897 the area was officially chartered at Mountain Park. In his 1908 report to Mayor Nathan P. Avery, landscape architect and planner Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. urged the city to work to more closely align its planning with the development of the street railway in a working relationship, saying a liaison or authority ought to be established in determining future extensions and improvements in the electric railway lines operating in the city, stressing it would yield some of the most economical growth of housing capacity in tandem with the grid system. Pioneering thermite rail welding George E. Pellissier, engineer and manager for the Holyoke Street Railway as well as the Goldschmidt Thermit Company As a transportation system, the railway also held at least one unprecedented piece of technology prior to its numerous competitors in the early 20th century- thermite welding. During the 1890s in Germany, Hans Goldschmidt developed the modern process for exothermic welding for railways. This process, now an international standard in railway construction, was first used commercially in tram lines in Essen, Germany in 1899. Over the next several years other cities including Leeds and Singapore would adopt this construction method, and in 1904 its inventor would open the Goldschmidt Thermit Company offices in New York City. While development of this process continued, an engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, George E. Pellissier (1878-1961)Stephan Kallee: George E. Pellissier. The first American to use Thermite welding commercially. Published on 1 December 2018. Retrieved on 1 December 2018.George Edward Pellissier. On: Find a Grave. Retrieved on 1 December 2018., followed Goldschmidt's work closely and approached the Holyoke Street Railway proposing that they use the new thermite process for their own lines. Soon after the railway ordered 160 joints to be placed on an approximately mile-long tract of rail on Main Street, and on August 8, 1904 Holyoke became the first rail line in the United States to lay track with the process. That same year Hartford would join the ranks as the second in country. Railway workers and George Pellissier (center left) stand next to a thermite crucible prior to ignition during the laying of the first tracks in the United States using the thermite weld technique, August 1904 While Hartford would be met with some issues due to what was later described as a rushed installation, the Holyoke installation served as a proof-of-concept for the advantages of the method. With thermite welding, a small crew of unskilled laborers with no prior knowledge of welding or specialty metalwork could be sent out with a crucible, pre-made molds, and a set amount of thermite. For railway companies the new technique would lead to a more reliable and inexpensive method of laying down new tracks that would make future system expansion more practical than bolted or welded separate joint techniques used up to that time. This represented the beginning of Pellissier's career with the railway company, as he would obtain a full-time engineer position upon graduation and went on to present his work to the American Street and Interurban Railway Association in 1905. The Holyoke engineer would not only serve as merely Goldschmidt's first American customer, but rather Pellissier would go on to work for the inventor's American company in New York, designing their Jersey City welding plant and also contributing improvements to the thermite installation process. In 1910 the Holyoke Street Railway, which had since used thermite for regular work, served as an urban laboratory for Pellissier's refinements on the process for the Goldschmidt Company, during which he tested a new technique for whole-rail welds, an improvement contributing to the development of continuous welded rail. Extended system Amherst and Sunderland Street Railway An Amherst & Sunderland car passes through The Notch of the Holyoke Range, 1903 The Amherst and Sunderland Street Railway was an interurban streetcar system that operated in Amherst, Sunderland, Pelham, Granby, and South Hadley, Massachusetts. From 1897 until 1932, trolleys operated between Sunderland, the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now UMass Amherst), and connected with the Holyoke Street Railway's system at \\"The Notch\\" after 1902. This rail line, providing freight and passenger service, was built by the short-lived Hampshire Street Railway specifically to connect the other two systems; the Hampshire Street Railway would lease the line to the Holyoke railway in 1905, which ultimately consolidated with it, along with Amherst & Sunderland, in 1907. After the merger the name was kept as a legacy and lines to the north of the Holyoke Range were referred to as the Amherst and Sunderland Division of the Holyoke Street Railway. While the HSR would continue operations in Amherst as a bus carrier, after trolley service ceased in 1932 the A&S; name was dropped altogether. The company was initially chartered on February 27, 1896, but was beset by legal troubles in its initial formation. Among these setbacks was the sale of shares under the name the \\"Amherst Street Railway Company\\", which legally did not exist, prompting the board to have to take up entirely new shares from the same parties that they had first sold them to. This issue had apparently arisen from an early board meeting during which a stockholder from Sunderland moved to append the town name to the railway company's, however none of the members had new paperwork printed to reflect this. This problem was further complicated when then-president of the board, Levi Stockbridge, revealed the state railroad commissioners refused to recognize the company, as its charter had been accepted in the minutes of a meeting called by a single board member, rather than the entirety of the charter members. Despite predictions by some that this was the end of the enterprise, Stockbridge urged that if the group did not organize to build the street railway, there were several other syndicates which would; by the end of their next meeting the group was able to recollect all necessary shares. The former Amherst car barn, the town's present Dept. of Public Works, until its subsequent demolition in the near future Following an extended period of discussion over the specific location of the tracks, work commenced in the laying of line in April of 1897, and by June of that year the first trolleys were operational. While Stockbridge remains notable among founding figures of the street railway, his role as president of the company was limited to its first year, a greater credit was due to Walter D. Cowles, a member of the board and subsequent president of the company, whose family stored the streetcars in car barn facilities on the grounds of their lumber business in the railways earliest years. In 1897 the railway began to see competition from the Northampton and Amherst Railway, later known as the Connecticut Valley Street Railway,, as it connected Northampton to Amherst, through Hadley. Despite outcry from the Amherst & Sunderland Street Railway and its interests, by the end of 1897 the competitor had been given access and some consideration was given to franchise. In response to this, the railway would attempt to expand its own holdings in Hadley, building a new line through Mill Valley to the Hadley border in the following year. The railway's ties with the Holyoke Street Railway began in 1902 when the stockholders and directors voted to increase the capital stock of the company to construct a line across the Notch in the Holyoke Range and connect with the Hampshire Street Railway system at the Granby town line. The Hampshire Street Railway, organized that same year, served as a collaboration of the interests of the Amherst and Holyoke railways, with Walter Cowls and William Loomis elected as sitting directors in the following year at an annual meeting at the Holyoke company's offices. In the following year the railway began advertising jointly with the Holyoke Street Railway as the best way to reach \\"The Famous Amherst 'Notch'\\", and by 1905 the entirety of the system was leased to Holyoke. The loose association between the Amherst and Sunderland system and Holyoke's became official when in 1907 the company moved to buy all stock of the Amherst company, consolidating it with the acquired Hampshire system to create the Amherst and Sunderland Division of the Holyoke Street Railway. In the next several years the HSR would further develop the Orient Springs stop in West Pelham as a picnic ground, as well as construct new infrastructure such as permanent stops, the last of which stood at UMass Amherst from 1911 until 2012 when it was razed by a contractor. The car barn on the Cowls property was maintained until the North Amherst route switched to bus service in 1928. The only extant structure related to the Amherst division today is the former South Amherst Car Barn which first entered service in 1917. Increasing competition from buses and cars would lead this structure to serve for less than 15 years, with all Amherst & Sunderland rail service ceasing in 1932. The facility was sold to the town government in 1934, and has been used as the Amherst Department of Public Works offices and garage since that time. In July 2019 it was announced that the trolley barn would be razed for a modern fire department headquarters. Mount Tom Railroad The Mount Tom Railroad, also known as the Mount Tom Railway, was a funicular mountain railway on the northeast slope of Mount Tom in Holyoke, Massachusetts which was operated by the Holyoke Street Railway from 1897 until 1938. Built in 1897, the railway quickly gained national fame when it was visited by President William McKinley who remarked upon the beauty of the mountainside. It was closely identified with the Summit Houses which adorned the mountaintop with the most ornate first two designed by local architect James A. Clough.The History of the Summit Houses Atop Mount Tom, WGBY, PBS. At the foot of the railway sat Mountain Park, which connected the cable railway with the Holyoke Street Railway system. For several years William Loomis and the rest of the board had pursued the idea of a mountain railway to connect the summit to their system, with notices published as far back as 1893, soon after the lines had been electrified. By June 6, 1896, the Mount Tom Railroad Company had been incorporated, with Loomis serving as president of both it as a separate entity and the HSR as a whole. The location of the railway, now a service road and paved trail, was determined early in planning as ideally running up the side of the mountain diagonally to follow the contours of a ravine, thus minimizing needed blasting and grading work. The rails construction and design was said to be based on the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway's, having a single track with one passing loop between the funicular's alternating cars. The second Summit House, built shortly after the first burned in 1900 Construction began in early 1897 under the Charles F. Parker Company of New York City, and by June, the Mount Tom Railroad Company had officiated a 25 year operating lease with the Holyoke Street Railway. The inaugural ride took place on June 17, 1897, with a number of city officials, railway employees, and officials of the Wason Manufacturing Company being the first passengers. The railway briefly rose to national fame when President McKinley and First Lady Ida Saxton rode to the summit house on June 20, 1899. At one point toward the end of the railroad's existence, there was some discussion of using it to pull skiers up the mountainside. This planned ski resort would not ultimately materialize however and it would not be until 1962 that the Mount Tom Ski Area would open. Following a period of decline and financial difficulties by its parent company, the Mount Tom Railroad cable railway was sold and dismantled in 1938. Legacy President McKinley and first lady Ida McKinley leave the railway's Mount Tom Summit House, June 20, 1899 Today few vestiges remain of the former streetcar or bus systems, and the railway is best remembered for its Mount Tom Summit House and inclined railway, which was visited by President William McKinley in 1899. Following a series of fires and the Great Depression, the third and final summit house was disassembled after a vandalism incident in 1938. While routes have changed in the decades since the railway's closure, the PVTA continues to provide bus service in Holyoke as well as all other municipalities previously covered by the former carrier's services. Due to several recessions in the 1980s, the railway's former amusement park Mountain Park shuttered the same year as buses ceased, in 1987. This year coincides with the Railway Company's closure however the two were unaffiliated by that time; Louis Pellissier Sr. had sold the amusement park to the Collins family of Lincoln Park in 1952, they assumed operations the following year until its closure. The last trolley station at UMass in 2011; the simple structure done in the American Craftsman style was demolished during construction of an academic building the following year. Of the original trolley stops, virtually all had been replaced by modern plexiglass bus stops by the time of the company's demise; the one exception had been a simple brick and glass structure built by the company for its Amherst and Sunderland line in 1911. This stop remained entirely intact and was used by the PVTA until it was destroyed by a contractor without university authorization in 2012; the university did not rebuild the 8-column waiting station, citing costs and the area's \\"modern use for today‚Äôs students\\". During the motorization period replacing the interurban system with bus lines, the company sold its Amherst and Sunderland Branch car barn in 1934, only 17 years after its construction, to the Town of Amherst's Dept. of Public Works. While several additions have been added over the years, the municipality has kept certain attention to detail, including keeping remaining tracks in place within the building. In recent years consideration has been given to a more modern facility but as of 2018, the car barn was still used by the town government. In 2019 it was announced that the town intends to raze the car barn and replace it with a new fire department headquarters. An homage to the Amherst & Sunderland lines history can also be found in the \\"Trolley Barn\\" development in North Amherst; while redeveloped in proximity to the line the building, done in the style of a car barn, was built in 2014. The former headquarters of the railway company, presently serving as the offices, garage, and trash transfer facilities of the Holyoke Dept. of Public Works. Borrowing from the precedent set by Amherst for its car barn, the City of Holyoke placed a request for proposal for a feasibility study in July 1988 for re-purposing the company's offices and central garage on Canal St, and assumed ownership of the building on December 21, 1988.Parcel 037-02-001, Holyoke Assessor's Database The car barn and offices, designed by the Samuel M. Green Company and built in 1914 by Casper Ranger Construction, has since been rechristened the Pellisier Building for its previous owners, and converted into Holyoke's Department of Public Works headquarters, maintenance shop, and waste transfer station. No complete Holyoke Street Railway tram is known to exist today, however the Shore Line Trolley Museum's \\"Preserved North American Electric Cars Roster\\" (PNAECR) survey states the wooden cabin for one such car remains in Holyoke in the private collection of James Curran at The Wherehouse banquet hall. * Images of the car can be found at Archive.org.

It is located on a man-made peninsula on the Jamaica Bay shoreline, at the eastern end of the Rockaway peninsula. A portion of the site is currently open to the public as Rockaway Community Park (formerly Edgemere Park). The entire site is owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The landfill began operations in June 1938, merging several islands in the Jamaica Bay marshland and connecting them to the main Rockaway Peninsula. Shortly afterward, a portion of the site was used as the Rockaway Airport. Edgemere Park was conceived for the landfill site in the 1950s by New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, as part of the infrastructure for the adjacent Edgemere Houses housing project. The site, along with several other planned parks in the city, continued operations as a landfill in order to fill the marshland for park development. The small portion of Rockaway Community Park adjacent to the Edgemere Houses was developed in the 1960s. During its operation, the landfill was a dumping site for toxic chemicals and waste oil, and served as a hazard to nearby John F. Kennedy International Airport by attracting birds. Following the discovery of toxic waste drums in the landfill in 1983, the landfill was declared a Superfund site. It was closed in 1991 and capped afterwards. The peak of the landfill is the tallest point in the Rockaways, measuring high. The landfill is claimed to be \\"the longest continuously operating dump in the United States\\", accepting waste from 1938 to 1991. It is also one of the oldest landfills in New York City, and was the second-to-last city landfill to remain in operation. The final landfill, Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island, closed in 2001. Description An aerial view of Arverne and Edgemere, Queens. The Edgemere Landfill is the small peninsula in the lower center, with John F. Kennedy Airport just to the north. Former landfill The Edgemere Landfill is located on the north side of the Rockaway Peninsula in the Edgemere neighborhood near Arverne at the east end of the Rockaways. The landfill site consists of a smaller peninsula, which extends northward into Jamaica Bay at the east end of the bay. Smaller bodies of water within the bay form the peninsula's western and eastern sides. To the west is Somerville Basin which runs between the peninsula and Dubos Point in Arverne to the west. To the east is the Norton Basin which runs between the landfill and Bayswater to the east. At the south end of Norton Basin are two smaller water bodies, Conch Basin (formerly Little Bay) to the west at the base of the landfill site, and a smaller Norton Basin to the east next to Bayswater Park. All three water bodies end at about Beach Channel Drive. The landfill site can be described as a large \\"head\\" section, which contains the main landfill mound and extends into Jamaica Bay, and a \\"neck\\" section which connects the peninsula to the Rockaways. According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, the combined park and landfill site is in size. The size of the landfill is often stated as . Its shoreline extends . The landfill is covered by grassland, with several roads circumscribing the site, and running across the landfill. The grass is mowed once a year, allowing for the inspection of the landfill to search for gas leaks. The peak of the landfill measures high, the highest point on the Rockaway Peninsula. Because of this, it is one of the only sites in the area not in a flood-prone zone. The peak is still lower than the highest point of the former Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island, which is . During its operation, the Edgemere Landfill received a total of of waste. The landfill is one of the three major landfills located along Jamaica Bay. The other two are the Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue Landfills located in Brooklyn. Located directly across the landfill to the north are the ends of Runways 4L and 4R of John F. Kennedy International Airport. During the landfill's operation, the presence of gulls feeding off the garbage at the site posed a hazard to planes operating to and from the airport. Bird species found at the landfill include the American herring gull and the laughing gull, and the short-eared owl. Parkland One of the mosquito magnets present in Rockaway Community Park. At the base of the main landfill is the only open portion of Rockaway Community Park, located on the north side of Almeda Avenue across from the Ocean Bay Apartments housing project, formerly known as the Edgemere Houses. The developed park occupies approximately of land. An additional of land were released by the Department of Sanitation for recreational use in 2010. A \\"natural area\\" is situated to the north of the developed park, located in the \\"neck\\" area between the park and the former landfill. Two smaller parcels of undeveloped parkland extend south on the west and east sides of the park towards Beach Channel Drive. The westernmost parcel is a rectangular plot between Beach 58th Street and Somerville Basin. The easternmost parcel is triangular in shape, on the Conch Basin coastline between Beach 51st Street and Elizabeth Avenue. These two plots are also considered the \\"West\\" and \\"East\\" natural areas of the park. The southernmost portion of the western plot is used as the Rockaway Youth Task Force Community Garden. Just south of the eastern parcel is Conch Playground, located adjacent to Public School 105 between Beach Channel Drive and Elizabeth Avenue. The developed portion of the park near the housing complex features a grass sports field with a baseball diamond and cricket pitch. The cricket pitch is the only one on the Rockaway Peninsula. A second baseball diamond previously existed. The park also contains basketball, handball, and tennis courts and a playground. Two fishing piers are located on the Sommerville Basin coast at the west end of the northern natural area. A walking trail runs through the northern natural area. The main landfill itself is used as a birdwatching site, due to its proximity to the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. One of the major issues afflicting the park is the large presence of mosquitoes, leading the park to be underutilized. The presence of the mosquitoes in the park and at nearby Dubos Point has been attributed to their location along Jamaica Bay, and their significant vegetation. The park and other known mosquito breeding grounds in the city periodically undergo larvicide treatment and spraying to combat mosquitoes, although pesticide spraying only occurs when a virus such as West Nile is detected in the local mosquito population. Mosquito magnets are also present in the park to help control the population. The park is also afflicted by the presence of invasive plant species such as phragmites. In addition many of the park facilities are in disrepair, including the playing fields and courts which have overgrown with vegetation. Meanwhile, the north side of Almeda Avenue adjacent to the park lacks a sidewalk, making it difficult to access the park. There are also noise disturbances from nearby JFK Airport. The issues with mosquitoes and phragmites have affected the park since the 1960s when the park was created. The original park plans for the main landfill were to create a marina and a golf course on the site. Contemporary plans for Rockaway Community Park seek to eventually develop the main landfill as part of the park. The landfill cannot be developed as parkland or for permanent structures until 2021. Department of Sanitation facility The DSNY District 14 Garage at the Edgemere Landfill. A portion of the site on the Conch Basin continues to be operated by the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY). Part of the site is used as a gas extraction facility to collect gases emitted from the landfill. The site also contains the DSNY Queens East District 14 Garage. The garage opened in 2009. On December 14, 2010, the DSNY renamed the garage the \\"Stephen Dixon Garage\\" after Stephen Dixon, a worker from the garage who died on duty in March 2009. The previous garage was located at Beach 72nd Street and Amstel Boulevard in Arverne, now used as an Access-A-Ride depot. Transportation The park and landfill are served by the and bus routes, which operate on Beach Channel Drive at the south end of the Edgmere Houses. The Q22 operates across the Rockaway Peninsula between Far Rockaway to the east and Roxbury to the west. The Q52, which terminates at Beach 54th Street, travels north via Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards through Broad Channel to \\"mainland\\" Queens. The closest New York City Subway station is the Beach 60th Street station on the IND Rockaway Line (), located to the southwest of the park at Beach 59th Street near Rockaway Beach Boulevard. Etymology The name Edgemere is derived from an Anglo-Saxon term, meaning \\"edge of the sea\\". The term Rockaway is derived from a word in the Algonquin Native American languages. Several meanings have been given, including \\"sandy place\\", \\"the place of laughing waters\\", \\"the place of our own people\\", or \\"neck of the land\\". This was the name of the Lenape tribe, who were a subset of the Canarsee (Canarsie) tribe, that occupied much of the area around Jamaica Bay. History Early history A 1907 map of Edgemere. At the north end of the site is Little Bay, with various islands within it; this is now the site of the Edgemere Landfill. Prior to the creation of the landfill, the site of Edgemere Park consisted of numerous separate islands within a much larger Little Bay between Dubos Point to the west and Bayswater Point to the east. It was originally known as \\"Little Bay Marsh\\". Norton Basin (also called Norton's Creek) originally was connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a creek called the Wave Crest Inlet, which separated the western peninsula from the mainland. The area around Jamaica Bay including the Rockaways was characterized by marshland. As late as 1872, the neighborhoods of Edgemere and Arverne were populated by cedar trees. The area around Jamaica Bay including the Rockaway Peninsula was initially inhabited by the Canarsie and Rockaway Native American groups, who were often referred to erroneously as the \\"Metoac\\" or \\"Mantinecocks\\". The Rockaway primarily controlled the eastern and southern shores of Jamaica Bay in present-day Queens and Nassau County, while the Canarsie controlled the northern and western shores in modern-day Brooklyn. In 1685, the Rockaway Peninsula was sold to English Captain John Palmer by two tribal chiefs, Tackapausha and Paman. Palmer was said to have purchased the land for \\"31 pounds, 2 shillings\\". The land was considered to be \\"barren\\", consisting of meadow and marsh used for grazing. At the time, the peninsula stretched from the modern Rockaway Turnpike west to the modern Wavecrest neighborhood, making up the greater Far Rockaway area of Queens and what is now Five Towns, Nassau County (then called \\"Rockaway Neck\\"). The peninsula would later be extended west to Rockaway Point by the natural accretion of sand from tidal action. In 1687 Palmer sold the land to English settler Richard Cornell, whose family would later found Cornell University. In return, Palmer received land in \\"Madnan's Neck\\", now Little Neck, Queens and Great Neck, Nassau County. Cornell had previously purchased what would become Flushing, Queens. Cornell constructed a house overlooking the Atlantic Ocean known as the \\"Cornell house\\" or \\"Cornell homestead\\", said to be the first permanent structure in the area. The house was located in the vicinity of Central Avenue (Beach 20th Street), Beach 19th Street, and Empire Avenue in modern Far Rockaway. This is the location of the contemporary Hebrew Institute of Long Island at Beach 17th Street and Seagirt Boulevard. The family also created a nearby burial ground on Caffrey Avenue and New Haven Avenue. After the partition of the Cornell property in 1809, in 1830 John Leake Norton purchased land from the Cornell family, consisting of Edgemere and Far Rockaway. Norton formed the Rockaway Association with several prominent New Yorkers, and the association constructed a hotel on the former site of the Cornell house called the Marine Pavilion. The pavilion was opened on June 1, 1833. Although it burned down on June 25, 1864, the hotel catalyzed the development of the Rockaways into a resort town. The Far Rockaway Branch Railroad of the South Side Railroad of Long Island was opened in 1869 between Valley Stream and Far Rockaway, and was extended to the Seaside House in Rockaway Park in 1872. The New York, Woodhaven & Rockaway Railroad opened their line from Brooklyn and \\"mainland\\" Queens to Rockaway Park in 1880. The Ocean Electric Railway opened a streetcar line via the Far Rockaway Branch tracks in 1897. Up until the 1880s, the Edgemere and Arverne areas were largely undeveloped and were among the last to be developed on the peninsula. Edgemere, originally called \\"New Venice\\", was developed by Frederick J. Lancaster beginning in 1892, with the Hotel Edgemere opening in 1894. The Arverne neighborhood was developed by Remington Vernam. The Arverne Hotel was erected in 1888. A rail station in the neighborhood at Gaston Avenue was opened in 1888, and a second at Straiton Avenue in 1892. The Wave Crest Inlet, also called Wave Crest Lake, was filled in in 1911 in order to further develop the Edgemere neighborhood. Creation of the landfill In 1916, the New York City Waterfront Company acquired of land on the north shore of the Rockaway Peninsula in Arverne and Edgemere, including the area around Little Bay. The land was located north of the former Amstel Canal, now Amstel Boulevard and Beach Channel Drive. The property was previously owned by Remington Vernam. The land, which consisted of salt marshes and beach, was to be filled in order to construct bungalows; part of the site was already filled by dirt dredged from Jamaica Bay. In 1920, the New York City Board of Estimate planned to create Amstel Boulevard on the former canal right-of-way between Beach 35th Street and Beach 71st Street, where it would connect with Hammels Avenue and eventually feed in Beach Channel Drive. The route would cut across the New York City Waterfront property. All three roads now make up modern Beach Channel Drive. Garbage landfilling at Edgemere by the New York City Department of Sanitation began on July 15, 1938. The landfill replaced an incinerator in nearby Arverne. By this time, garbage incineration was considered \\"obsolete\\". The property continued to be owned by the New York City Waterfront Company. Borrow pits with depths of and were dug into the Norton Basin and Little Bay respectively, with the dirt extracted used to create a base for the landfill. Around of dirt were dredged from underwater for the landfill. The alterations to the basins and landfilling activity changed their biodiversity compared to other water bodies in the area. The Edgemere Landfill was one of several landfills created under then-Sanitation Commissioner William F. Carey. In addition to replacing incinerators, the landfill replaced the practice of dumping city garbage in the ocean. This practice was banned by a United States Supreme Court ruling in 1933. Following complaints from the local community, on July 14, 1938 Andrew J. Kenny threatened to seek an injunction to stop the dumping at Edgemere. Kenny was the president of the Rockaway Chamber of Commerce and the Queens sewer superintendent. That same day, Sanitation Commissioner Carey was confronted by local residents while inspecting the landfill site. One of the complaints was that paint on the side of houses had either peeled or became discolored due to the fumes emitted from the landfill. The fumes were thought to either come from the mud from the bay used to cover the garbage, or the disinfectants used on the waste. The next day on July 15, dumping was halted at the landfill. According to Commissioner Carey, the odors at the site were caused by the use of mud to cover the garbage, and clean sand would be used in the future. Operations resumed on October 10, 1938. Meanwhile, residents continued to oppose dumping at Edgemere, citing fires and rat infestations. During a tour of the Edgemere Dump on February 11, 1939, Commissioner Carey claimed that it was \\"four and a half times more expensive\\" to dispose of waste through incinerators than to bury it in landfills. He also spoke of the benefits of landfilling, including reclaiming marshland and eliminating mosquitoes. On March 28, 1939, Sanitation Commissioner William F. Carey and Health Commissioner Dr. John L. Rice were indicted on charges of violating the New York City Penal and Sanitary Codes, specifically of \\"unlawfully dumping raw garbage and maintaining a public nuisance\\" and of \\"dumping under or on top of water, or on land, any refuse in which...offensive and unwholesome material is included.\\" The charges were based on the operation of city-run \\"garbage graveyards\\" in Queens. The five dumps in question were the Edgemere Dump; the Lefferts Dump at Lefferts Boulevard and Sunrise Highway (Conduit Avenue) in South Ozone Park, near the future site of JFK Airport; Bergen Landing; and the future sites of Juniper Valley Park and Baisley Pond Park, respectively located in Middle Village and South Jamaica. The owners of the Edgemere and Lefferts landfills were also named in the indictment. Carey and Rice, both cabinet members under Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, surrendered to the Long Island City Courthouse and were released without bail. A change of venue was granted on May 18, 1939 and the trial was moved to the Bronx. On May 31, the trial was postponed until October of that year. Around this time, dumping was resumed at the Edgemere Landfill. On June 19, 1939, the indictments were dismissed by Justice Isidor Wasservogel. As a consolation, a board of four health experts and a sanitary engineer was appointed by U.S. Surgeon General Thomas Parran Jr. to arbitrate the conflict and to investigate the operations of the five landfills. The board included Eugene Lindsay Bishop and Kenneth F. Maxcy. In addition, Carey announced that dumping at Edgemere would end on June 25 and cease until the fall. The charges were dropped by District Attorney Charles P. Sullivan due to a lack of individuals to testify in the trial. On September 21, 1939, the arbitration board conducted a \\"secret tour\\" of the five landfills. At this time, the Department of Sanitation anticipated resuming landfilling at Edgemere that fall, which was opposed by local residents. In March 1940, the board released its report, which supported continued landfilling at the five Queens landfills including Edgemere as long as \\"sound sanitary practice is continued\\", as the landfilling process helped control rat and mosquito populations in marshland. On June 22, 1940, the New York City Council passed a bill mandating the Department of Sanitation to begin using the available incinerators in the city. The bill was introduced by Councilman James A. Burke representing Hollis, Queens. Burke then proceeded to submit the bill to Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia in an attempt to bypass the Board of Estimate. Many of the city's incinerators, including the Arverne incinerator, had been closed under Carey's watch. Rockaway Airport On July 16, 1939, the Edgemere Airport (also called Rockaway Airport) was opened on the New York City Waterfront Company land between Beach 46th Street and Beach 54th Street. The airport was operated by Lawrence resident and commercial pilot Harry Gordon, and was said to be the first privately owned airfield in the Rockaways. Prior to the construction of a hangar, planes for the airport were kept at Roosevelt Field in Nassau County. The airport was created for civilian training and leisure flying. Following a lawsuit by Gordon, on December 26, 1939 city Commissioner of Docks John McKenzie was ordered by the Manhattan Supreme Court to award a permit to the airport. On July 8, 1940 after 15 months of operation, McKenzie issued a letter informing Gordon that the airport would be closed in 30 days due to not meeting facility requirements for airports in the city. Specifically, the airport failed to meet the requirements for -long and -wide runways, and for an \\"unobstructed approach\\" to the airport. At this time, work commenced on expanding and developing the airport. The pilots training at the airport included members of the Women Flyers Of America. The airport would later become the headquarters of Women's Flyers Association of America. In October 1940, the Rockaway Chamber of Commerce petitioned the federal Civil Aeronautics Administration to create a civilian pilot school at Rockaway Airport. In January 1941, Bayside resident Charles G. Meyer proposed converting his farm along Little Neck Bay into a city-operated airfield to train civilian pilots. Several wealthy residents of Bayside protested his plan, including actor and movie producer John Golden. As an alternative, Golden suggested to Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia that the Edgemere Dump be used for the airfield. On January 15, 1941, Mayor LaGuardia publicly rejected both the Bayside and Edgemere proposals, due to costs and potential hazards to Bayside residents. Meyer's farm would later become the Bay Terrace neighborhood, while John Golden's estate would become John Golden Park. On July 26, 1941 the Civil Aeronautics Administration approved Rockaway Airport along with Nassau Airport in Hicksville, Long Island as civilian pilot training facilities. Meanwhile, Idlewild Airport (today's JFK Airport) was ordered to cease training of pilots. Upon the onset of World War II, in 1941 Gordon offered use of the airport and a supply of planes and pilots to the United States military in order to monitor and patrol the coast of Long Island during the war. In October 1941, soldiers from Fort Tilden in the western Rockaways began using the airport for ten days to conduct air raid drills. The offer to use the airport was officially accepted by Civil Air Patrol Major General John F. Curry in February 1942. Civilian flying, however, was banned by the federal government during World War II and Gordon abandoned the airport at this time. In early 1944, the airport was leased by the United States Coast Guard as a helicopter training base. Following the war, in February 1946 Rockaway Airport was reopened by war veterans Joseph Alta and Perry Fuhr. Alta was an Army Air Force pilot in the China Burma India Theater of the war. Fuhr was a Navy test pilot. Alta had previously operated a flight school at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. Beginning on January 6, 1947, the airport was used as the receiving point for a helicopter mail service originating at LaGuardia Airport or Newark Airport, and serving both the Rockaways and Five Towns in Nassau County. Park plans and purchase of the property Rockaway Community Park was planned along with the Edgemere Houses (pictured), which opened in 1960. On January 11, 1946, new Sanitation Commissioner William J. Powell announced that the city would abandon the landfill system favored by his predecessor Carey and instead utilize incinerators, with half of the Borough of Queens' waste to be disposed of via incinerator immediately. On January 17, 1949, the Department of Sanitation opened a \\"Super Dump\\" in Howard Beach, located along Jamaica Bay stretching west of Cross Bay Boulevard. The new dump, proposed by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, was intended to receive most of the garbage from southern Queens and replace smaller landfills in other areas of the borough. The new Super Dump would either reduce the load on or entirely replace the Edgemere Landfill. The Howard Beach dump would operate until the completion of the South Shore Incinerator in Spring Creek, Brooklyn. Afterwards, the reclaimed land would become part of the planned Spring Creek Park. In November 1952 and again in January 1953, Parks Commissioner Moses proposed to the New York City Board of Estimate that the city purchase the Edgemere Landfill, keep it in operation for 15 years, and eventually develop it into a park. At the time, it was estimated that keeping the site in operation would save the city $1 million annually in waste disposal costs. In 1955, the city began plans for a housing project in Edgemere. The plans included an adjoining park on the site of the Edgemere Landfill, which had been in operation for nearly twenty years at this time. The New York City Board of Estimate approved the park project on April 29, 1955. On October 4, 1955 the City of New York began condemnation proceedings in order to acquire the Edgmere Landfill site adjacent to the future Edgemere Houses site. The park was to be named \\"Edgemere Park\\". At the time, the property was still owned by the New York City Waterfront Corporation. Plans for the park included eight tennis courts, along with a boat basin and ice skating rink. By this time, the site occupied . Many of the small islands that once existed in Little Bay were now joined together and connected to the main Rockaway peninsula by landfilling. However, much of the future park site was still underwater. It was referred to as \\"the largest remaining undeveloped area in the Rockaways\\". Moses developed several public housing projects on the Rockaway peninsula during this time, all of which included an adjoining park. Construction on the other adjoining infrastructure for the Edgemere Housing Project, Public School 105 and Rockaway Beach Hospital (the future Peninsula Hospital), began in 1957. The landfill site was purchased by the city via condemnation on December 12, 1957, costing $1,496,564. The purchase of the property by the city was criticized in 1958 by Queens Borough President James J. Crisona, with Crisona believing that the city paid too much for the property. The city paid $1.5 million for the site following an evaluation by city real estate appraiser James C. Sheridan. However, the city tax rolls assessed the site at $150,000, approximately one tenth of its purchase price. Crisona noted that Sheridan's appraisal was based on the land's potential for industrial development, but claimed that it could not be developed for 20 to 30 years due to its status as a landfill. He also compared the price of Edgemere Park to that of other properties in the area, which were appraised at much lower prices. Crisona criticized Sheridan, Corporation Council Peter Campbell Brown, and Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. for their roles in the purchase. Sheridan proceeded to file a $1 million defamation suit against Crisona, while Sheridan's $22,000 commission for the job was withheld by City Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa Shortly afterwards, in July 1958 Brown resigned from his post. Initial park development By July 1958, the Rockaway Airport was closed and demolished to make way for the housing project. On October 16, 1958, ground was broken on the Edgemere Houses project, with Robert Moses, Borough President James Crisona, and Governor W. Averell Harriman in attendance. During the ceremony, Moses spoke about his plans for the adjoining Edgemere Park. The first portion of the park would be a -wide \\"buffer between the Edgemere State Housing Project and the operations of the Department of Sanitation\\". The plans for the remainder of the park, which would be the \\"largest park on the Rockaway peninsula,\\" included an 18-hole golf course and a marina. Moses planned to create several parks on wetlands by filling the land with municipal waste before developing the land into parkland. These included the future Edgemere Park and Spring Creek Park, as well as sites in Marine Park, Brooklyn; Ferry Point, Bronx; Fresh Kills, Staten Island; and Kissena Corridor Park in Queens. In December 1959, the Board of Estimate allocated $144,650 to add an additional 160,000 cubic yards of sand to the Edgemere Landfill, which would extend the site up to north into Jamaica Bay. The Board also planned to lay out Almeda Avenue between Conch Place (Conch Basin) and Beach 58th Street (Sommerville Basin), and to lay out Beach 51st Street, Beach 54th Street and Beach 58th Street in the area north of Beach Channel Drive. These streets would eventually serve the new housing project and park. In July 1960, the Board of Estimate approved of plans to begin developing of Edgemere Park on the north side of Almeda Avenue across from the Edgemere Houses. The park would include baseball fields and eight clay tennis courts along with landscaping and paths. Conch Playground, then known as P.S. 105 Playground, was opened in August 1960. On October 17, 1960, Parks Commissioner Newbold Morris (successor to Robert Moses) announced plans for improvements to Edgemere Park, including baseball fields, tennis courts, and a park trail. The first building of the Edgemere Houses was opened on November 27, 1960. By 1962, plans remained to develop a marina at Edgemere Park. The next year, tennis courts were completed at Edgemere Park, with a playground planned. In 1965, it was claimed that the Edgemere Landfill contained more American herring gulls feeding and residing at the landfill than Cape Ann, Massachusetts, a known nesting region for the herring gulls, along with \\"all of Nova Scotia and Maine\\". At the time, it was estimated that 20 to 30 thousand herring gulls resided in the area around Jamaica Bay, attracted by the Edgemere Landfill and the Pennsylvania and Fountain Avenue Landfills in Brooklyn. That year, the Department of Sanitation opened the landfill for public use on a trial basis, accepting large items such as appliances, furniture, plumbing, and automobiles. In July 1966 in response to complaints from residents, the Parks Department began pesticide spraying at Edgemere Park in order to combat mosquitoes, rats, and phragmites. To eliminate the phragmites, the chemical Dalapon was used. It was suggested that physically uprooting the phragmites would be a better solution, but the equipment necessary to harvest the plants could not be used in the park as much of it still consisted of marshland. The rats, meanwhile, were said to have been brought by the dumping of trash at the landfill. That month, $29,250 was allocated for additional landfilling on the Edgemere Park land in order to create a playground and sports fields. During the fall of 1966, Edgemere Park was used as a practice field for the Far Rockaway High School football team, as their own home field was not usable during the season. On July 1, 1967, the Department of Sanitation again allowed local residents to drop off bulk refuse such as furniture or appliances at the landfill. By July 17, 1,000 tons of waste were deposited through this program at Edgemere, and at 20th Avenue in College Point. On March 24, 1968, the playground at Edgemere Park was opened, with a basketball tournament taking place. In May 1970, the Rockaway Cultural, Educational, Recreational, and Historical Society proposed to rename Edgemere Park to Rockaway Community Park. Other potential names included Brotherhood Memorial Park, Jeanne Dale Katz Park, Martin Luther King Jr. Park, Tackapouscha Indian Historical Park, and William F. Brunner Sr. Park. On October 9, 1970, a fire broke out at the Edgemere Landfill, lasting six days before it was brought under control. The bill renaming the park was signed into law in 1971. The park was dedicated as Rockaway Community Park on June 17, 1973. While portions of the park including basketball courts and beach land were available for use at the time, most of the site had yet to be developed. Jamaica Bay Council president Jerome Hipscher desired for the park to be developed into \\"a miniature Central Park\\". It was also proposed to integrate the park with the new Gateway National Recreation Area created by the National Park Service. Toxic waste dumping and calls to close the landfill The south end of Runway 4L at JFK Airport extending into Jamaica Bay, with the Rockaways in the distance. In September 1973, the Edgemere Landfill was described as \\"the highest land area on the entire Rockaway Peninsula. It is a hugh mound of sand-covered garbage and waste material which has completely obliterated the marshy shoreline where marine life thrived for many years.\\" On August 29, 1974 the bodies of three boys from the Edgemere Houses were found on the beach surrounding the Edgemere Landfill. Their deaths were suspected to have been caused by drowning or a lightning strike. In late 1975, the city began experimenting with methods to discourage birds from feeding off the Edgemere Landfill, in order to prevent them from interfering with planes at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The experiments included poisoning the supply of food waste at the site, shredding food waste accepted by the landfill into small pieces, narrowing the area in which garbage was dumped, and installing a horizontal-wire grid over the landfill to discourage birds from landing on it. This was in addition to the existing shotgun patrols at the airport who would discharge firearms or set off fireworks to scare the birds away. The shredding method had already been tested on landfills in the Midwest and in Charleston, South Carolina. The initiatives were motivated by an incident in November 1975, when an ONA DC-10 aircraft crashed upon takeoff after colliding with seagulls, which were sucked into the right-wing engine destroying it. Following the crash, on March 8, 1976, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended closing the landfill due to potential dangers for aircraft from the airport. On May 18, 1976 the Sanitation Department informed officials from Queens Community Board 14 and the Gateway National Recreation Area that the Edgemere Landfill would remain in operation until 1985. At the time, the DSNY refuted the assertion that the dump contributed to the bird hazard of JFK Airport. Mosquitoes and foul odors were also blamed on the landfill. In 1977 the Parks Department and Department of Sanitation garnered controversy over the closure of the Edgemere Landfill on weekends between Saturday afternoon and Monday morning. As opposed to traveling to the Fountain Avenue Landfill in Brooklyn, Parks Department garbage trucks collecting waste from Rockaway Beach would deposit their loads onto a parking lot at Beach 64th Street and Larkin Avenue in Arverne (now part of the Arverne by the Sea development) and wait until Monday to deposit the trash in Edgemere. In November 1979 following 11 bird strike incidents at JFK Airport in a period of six weeks, the Federal Aviation Administration began collecting evidence in preparation to sue the city in order to close the Edgemere, Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue Landfills. FAA Regional Director Murray Smith had previously met with Mayor Ed Koch on October 5 of that year to discuss the correlation of the bird hazard with the presence of the landfills. During the 1970s, the landfill was said to have received hazardous waste on a daily basis. Meanwhile, waste oil was added to the garbage at Edgemere and other landfills in order to control dust. Between March and October 1979, 5,000 to 6,000 gallons of oil and petroleum byproducts were deposited in the Edgemere, Pennsylvania and Fountain Avenue Landfills, with most of the waste going to Fountain Avenue. In 1981 it was discovered that, beginning 1972‚Äì1974, DSNY supervisors were paid $100 per truck to allow the dumping of liquid toxic waste at five of the city's landfills including the Edgemere Landfill, and into the sewer system. The other sites were the Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue Landfills in Brooklyn; the Tallapoosa Point Landfill at Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx; and the Brookfield Avenue Landfill across from Fresh Kills in Staten Island. The waste was dumped into trenches dug into the landfills. The waste had originated from plants owned by Ford Motor Company, Exxon, Chrysler, Ingersoll Rand, Alcan Aluminum, and others, including the Ford stamping plant in Buffalo, New York. In March 1982 Kenneth Mansfield, a plant manager and truck driver for an oil refining and disposal company operating in the metropolitan area, pled guilty to federal charges of conspiracy concerning the dumping. Mansfield and company owner Russell W. Mahler later pleaded guilty in New Jersey District Court for dumping oil and chemical wastes into the Hudson River. Mahler also pled guilty to disposing of waste oil in the abandoned Butler Mine Tunnel in Butler Township, Pennsylvania, which in 1979 overflowed into the Susquehanna River. He was sentenced to one year in prison for the crime. The mine would later become a Superfund site. Mahler's firm had also received contracts to clean up some of the sites that it had previously contaminated with oil, including one in College Point. In 1982, New York City spent $2.5 million to clean up the company's Long Island City plant, located near the Greenpoint Avenue Bridge just north of Newtown Creek. In 1985, the city filed suit under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (a.k.a. the Federal Superfund Act) against the 14 companies who originally generated the toxic waste later dumped in the city landfills. In February 1983, nearly 3,000 55-gallon metal drums of waste were discovered inside the Edgemere Landfill. The drums were discovered in the \\"neck\\" area of the peninsula just south of the main landfill, when a tractor spreading dirt struck the drums by accident. While most of the drums were empty, many contained lead-based paint and resin. The drums were said to have been buried beginning in 1968, around 15 years prior, when there were fewer regulations concerning the disposal of chemicals. Following the discovery, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection began testing the air, soil, and ground water of the local area for runoff from the drums. That month, the landfill was designated a Superfund site. On May 18, 1983, the Toxics Project of the New York Public Interest Research Group released a report documenting the dumping of chemical toxic waste at city landfills from 1964 to 1979. The year-long study covered the Edgemere Landfill in Queens, the Pennsylvania and Fountain Landfills in Brooklyn, the Tallapoosa/Pelham Bay Landfill in the Bronx, and the Fresh Kills and Brookfield Avenue Landfills in Staten Island, based on unreleased DSNY internal records. It concluded that \\"hundreds of tons\\" of chemical wastes had been deposited at the landfills with the permission of the Sanitation Department, which had been legal until 1979, along with the illegal dumping of \\"millions of pounds\\" of toxic wastes such as waste oil. It also confirmed the use of oil at the landfills to control dust, which occurred weekly for six months in each year. This oil was contaminated waste product. The study further concluded that the landfills were not designed to contain chemical wastes, and violated state and federal regulations. In 1984, the Edgemere Landfill was listed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) among 895 hazardous-waste sites in the state and among 144 that required top priority to be cleaned up. That year, the city began negotiations with the state to close the Edgemere and Fountain Avenue Landfills. In 1985, it was anticipated that the Edgemere Landfill would close the next year. By December, however, the Department of Sanitation began negotiating with the NYSDEC to obtain a permit in order to keep the landfill open. In February 1986, the Department of Sanitation announced that the Edgemere Landfill would operate for an additional 21 years until 2007, pending the approval of the NYSDEC. The DSNY argued that the landfill only took in 550 tons of garbage daily, compared to the 22,000 tons accepted by Fresh Kills. They stated that only waste from the Rockaways would be dumped at the landfill. The move to keep the landfill open was opposed by Queens Borough President Claire Shulman. Closing and capping of the landfill In July 1987, the city reached an agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to close the landfill by 1991, unless a permit could be awarded to the landfill. Under the agreement, landfill operations could continue until July 1991 while the state conducted an investigation of the site. Dumping in the area where the waste drums were discovered, however, was banned. By this time, the landfill's daily intake of garbage was increased to around 1,000 tons of garbage. By comparison, Fresh Kills Landfill received 23,500 tons daily. With the eventual closure of Edgemere and Fresh Kills imminent, the city planned to replace the landfills with several \\"resource recovery facilities\\" in the future. This included waste-to-energy incinerators, one of which would be located at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which would generate electricity from burning garbage. In addition, gas recovery plants to extract methane would be created at several inactive landfills including Fresh Kills and Pelham Bay. In December 1987, local community groups and politicians filed suit to have the landfill shut down, citing the fact that the landfill was operating without a permit. At the time, it was referred to as the \\"most toxic landfill in the world\\" due to the historical dumping of oil and chemicals. It was also stated that 167,000 gallons of toxic liquid seeped from the landfill on a daily basis. It was compared to the Love Canal landfill, another Superfund site located in Niagara Falls. In 1989, Edgemere handled over 1,500 tons of city garbage on a daily basis, making up 7.6 percent of the city's waste. In comparison, 4.4 percent of the city's waste was burned in city-owned incinerators, 8.1 percent was disposed of in apartment incinerators, and 73.4 percent (14,000 tons per day) was taken to Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. In March 1990, the city and state began removing 7,000 drums of toxic waste from the Edgemere Landfill. That year, the Department of Sanitation's Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling (BWPRR) began a pilot composting program at the Edgemere Landfill, handling 1,000 tons of leaves. Another composting facility would be opened that year at Fresh Kills. The Edgemere Landfill was closed on schedule in July 1991. This left Fresh Kills Landfill as the city's only landfill, joined by six municipal incinerators and the city's growing recycling program. By this time, the president of the Bayswater Civic Association had nicknamed the landfill \\"Mount Edgemere\\". This was similar to the \\"Mount Corona\\" nickname given to a mound of ash in the former Corona Ash Dumps, now the site of Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park. Following its closure, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection assumed responsibility for the cleanup of the site and other former landfills. 75 percent of cleanup costs would be covered by the New York State Superfund program. The closure of the Edgemere Landfill, and the previous decommissioning of the Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue Landfills, helped to reduce the bird strike hazard at JFK Airport. In summer 1992 the New York City Department of City Planning released the New York City Comprehensive Waterfront Plan, which sought to improve and expand the waterfront parkland within the city including the area around Jamaica Bay. The plan urged the DSNY and Department of Environmental Protection to develop a containment plan for the Edgemere Landfill, which should include \\"innovative bio-technology approaches\\". It also sought to create additional parkland in Edgemere, and preserve the wetlands along the Sommerville and Conch Basins. In July 1992, a $30.4 million settlement with over 100 corporations and public entities was reached in the 1985 Superfund lawsuit over dumping at Edgemere Landfill and four other city landfills. It was the fourth settlement reached under that suit. Capping of the Edgemere Landfill began in September 1995, which would permanently seal the site. The landfill was covered with a 6-inch base of topsoil, an impermeable geomembrane used to contain gasses emitted from the landfill, a layer of clay, and a second layer of topsoil. The uppermost layer of soil contained Spartina grass. The landfill was graded with a 4 percent slope to allow optimal storm runoff. of topsoil for the capping project were brought to the site by barges, as officials from Queens Community Board 14 requested the use of the barges instead of trucks. A pier was constructed in the Sommerville Basin to accept the topsoil; this was later converted into the fishing piers. Rock-covered channels were created circumscribing the landfill to prevent erosion. A gas extraction and flaring system was constructed in order to collect the gas emitted from the landfill, which would then be used as fuel or sold. The flaring system was used to control odor, the first such system for a landfill in the city. It had been estimated in 1991 that the methane produced by the landfill could provide heat for over 100,000 homes. In the neck area of the site where the drums were discovered, a groundwater \\"pump and treat\\" well system was installed to decontaminate the area. The capping project was completed in 1997 at the cost of $40 million. Afterwards, a 15-year monitoring period began to regulate the gasses emitted by the landfill. 2000s By March 2000, the NYSDEC declassified the landfill as a Class 2 Site (\\"significant threat to the public health or environment\\") and reclassified it as a Class 4 site (\\"site properly closed-requires continued management\\"). It was expected at this time that the site would need 10 to 15 years of monitoring and management to fully close the site. The landfill was declared \\"cleaned of all toxins\\" by the DEC in 2003. At the time it was one of two Superfund Sites in the Rockaways, along with a former Long Island Lighting Company coal gasification plant at Beach 108th Street in Rockaway Park. In May 2007, the Parks Department designated Rockaway Community Park, Bayswater Park, and Beach Channel West park in Belle Harbor as parks with off-leash areas for dogs. In 2009, Queens Community Board 14 district manager Jonathan Gaska proposed using the Edgemere Landfill as a solar panel field. The proposal was suggested to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), which provides electricity to the Rockaways. It was supported by New York State Assemblywoman Audrey Pheffer. On October 19, 2013, twenty thousand trees and five thousand shrubs were planted at Rockaway Community Park by volunteers as part of the Park's Department's MillionTreesNYC program, the largest planting event in the program's history. The trees would act as a buffer for a future storm, and were planted in response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The project was supported by the NY/NJ Super Bowl Host Committee for Super Bowl XLVIII, which was to be played in February 2014, along with the National Football League themselves and Verizon. The project replaced invasive species with trees native to coastal environments. In 2016, interns with the Rockaway Waterfront Alliance discovered a population of diamondback terrapin turtles in the former landfill. Rockaway Parks Conceptual Plan In May 2014, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation released the Rockaway Parks Conceptual Plan, which proposed several upgrades to parks on and around the peninsula following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The plan included a major renovation of Rockaway Community Park. The existing recreational facilities along Almeda Avenue would be upgraded, with a \\"Gaming Area\\" featuring ping pong and shuffleboard to be added. The Gaming Area would replace the existing handball courts in the center of the park, while new handball courts would be erected on the adjacent small playground. Additional handball courts would be erected on a portion of the current tennis courts at the far east end of the park. The open grass areas at the far south end of the park would be converted into picnic and barbecuing areas. The three natural areas on the outskirts of the park would be developed, with a continuous pathway to be established circumscribing the park. The portion of the pathway on the Sommerville Basin in the west natural area would be paved, and extend south to Beach Channel Drive to improve access to the park. North of Almeda Avenue, a wetland boardwalk would be created on the Sommerville Basin. An additional fishing pier would be built on the Sommerville Basin near Almeda Avenue, while a kayak launch point would be installed on the Conch Basin at the east end of the park. The wetlands and upland forest in this area would be restored. The triangular east natural area would be developed into a skatepark, with an additional picnic area to be established. In addition, the Conch Playground would be developed as part of Rockaway Community Park. An artificial turf field would be constructed, while the existing playground would be renovated. Numerous additional mosquito magnets would be installed around the park. As part of the Conceptual Plan, a Bayside Nature Trail would be established through the Rockaway Peninsula, running east along the Jamaica Bay Shore from the Rockaway Freeway Dog Run underneath Hammels Wye at Beach 84th Street, to the Jamaica Bay Park in Far Rockaway at the Queens-Nassau County border. The trail would cross Rockaway Community Park via the new pathways on the west and east ends of the park, and the existing pathway in the northern natural area, with a second pathway to be established parallel to Almeda Avenue. In December 2014, the Regional Plan Association proposed a Jamaica Bay Water Trail around Jamaica Bay, expanding the existing water trail network within the city. Rockaway Community Park would be part of the Rockaway Bayside Trail, running along the northern Jamaica Bay shore of the Rockaway Peninsula from Breezy Point east to North Woodmere Park and Idlewild Park across from JFK Airport. A primary launch point and kayak rental site for the trail would be located at the base of the park in the Conch Basin, with additional access points at Marina 59 in the Sommerville Basin to the west, and at Bayswater Park in the Norton Basin to the east. Both Marina 59 and Bayswater Park are preexisting access points. On April 25, 2016 during a meeting of Queens Community Board 14, Anbaric Development Partners proposed to create a microgrid and cable electrical system, with an underwater high-voltage direct current cable running from New Jersey to Long Island. The microgrid system would involve installing solar panels on the Edgemere Landfill, at the parking lot of Jacob Riis Park in western Rockaway, and at Green Acres Mall in South Valley Stream, Nassau County. The solar panels would then feed into the cable system. On October 29, 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced $145 million in resiliency projects in the Rockaways following Hurricane Sandy, building upon the Rockaway Parks Conceptual Plan and the Resilient Edgemere Community Plan. The plan proposes to raise the shoreline or berm around the Edgemere Landfill and restore the native wetland plants around the landfill to act as a barrier against storm surge. The funding for the various projects would come from surplus FEMA funds from previous resiliency projects.

They are subject of Effective medium theory T.C. Choy, \\"Effective Medium Theory\\", Oxford University Press, (2016) 241 p.. There are two widely used formulae M. Scheller, C. Jansen, M. Koch, \\"Applications of Effective Medium Theories in the Terahertz Regime\\" in Recent Optical and Photonic Technologies, ed. by K.Y. Kim, Intech, Croatia, Vukovar (2010), p. 231.. They both were derived in quasi-static approximation when electric field inside a mixture particle may be considered as homogeneous. So, these formulae can not describe the particle size effect. Many attempts were undertaken to improve these formulae.  Maxwell Garnett's formula  The first formula was proposed by J.C. Maxwell Garnett . Maxwell Garnett was the son of physicist William Garnett, and was named after Garnett's friend, James Clerk Maxwell. He proposed his formula to explain colored pictures that are observed in glasses doped with metal nanoparticles. His formula has a form \\\\epsilon_{eff}=\\\\epsilon_d\\\\left[1+3c_m\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_m-\\\\epsilon_d}{\\\\epsilon_m+2\\\\epsilon_d- c_m(\\\\epsilon_m-\\\\epsilon_d)}\\\\right], (1) where \\\\epsilon_{eff} is effective relative complex permittivity of the mixture, \\\\epsilon_d is relative complex permittivity of the background medium containing small spherical inclusions of relative permittivity \\\\epsilon_m with volume fraction of c_m<<1. This formula is based on the equality \\\\epsilon_{eff}=\\\\epsilon_d+c_m \\\\frac{p_m}{\\\\epsilon_0 E}, (2) where \\\\epsilon_0 is the absolute permittivity of free space and p_m is electric dipole moment of a single inclusion induced by the external electric field . However this equality is good only for homogeneous medium and \\\\epsilon_d=1. Moreover the formula (1) ignores the interaction between single inclusions. Because of these circumstances, formula (1) gives too narrow and too high resonant curve for plasmon excitations in metal nanoparticles of the mixture .  Bruggeman's formula  The second popular formula was proposed by D.A.G. Bruggeman . His formula has a form \\\\epsilon_{eff}=\\\\frac{H_b+\\\\sqrt{H_b^2+8\\\\epsilon_m \\\\epsilon_d}}{4}, H_b=(2-3c_m)\\\\epsilon_d-(1-3c_m) \\\\epsilon_m. (3) Here positive sign before the square root must be altered to negative sign in some cases in order to get correct imaginary part of effective complex permittivity which is related with electromagnetic wave attenuation. This formula is based on the equality \\\\Delta\\\\Phi=\\\\int \\\\int \\\\epsilon_r(\\\\mathbf r)E_n (\\\\mathbf r)ds-\\\\epsilon_{eff} \\\\int \\\\int E_0,ds=0, (4) where \\\\Delta \\\\Phi is the jump of electric displacement flux all over the integration surface, E_n(\\\\mathbf r) is the component of microscopic electric field normal to the integration surface, \\\\epsilon_r (\\\\mathbf r) is the local relative complex permittivity which takes the value \\\\epsilon_m inside the picked metal particle, the value \\\\epsilon_d inside the picked dielectric particle and the value \\\\epsilon_{eff} outside the picked particle, E_0 is the normal component of the macroscopic electric field. Formula (4) comes out of Maxwell's equality \\\\mathrm{div}(\\\\epsilon_r\\\\mathbf E)=0. Thus only one picked particle is considered in Bruggeman's approach. The interaction with all the other particles is taken into account only in mean field approximation described by \\\\epsilon_{eff}. Formula (3) gives a reasonable resonant curve for plasmon excitations in metal nanoparticles if their size is 10 nm or smaller. But it is unable to describe the size dependence for the resonant frequency of plasmon excitations that are observed in experiment  Formula describing size effect  A new formula describing size effect was proposed . This formula has a form \\\\epsilon_{eff}=\\\\frac{H_{\\\\epsilon}+i\\\\sqrt{-H_{\\\\epsilon}^2-8\\\\epsilon_m \\\\epsilon_dJ(k_ma)}}{4}, H_{\\\\epsilon}=(2-3c_m) \\\\epsilon_d-(1-3c_m) \\\\epsilon_m J(k_m a), (5) J(x)=2\\\\frac{1-x\\\\mathrm{cot}(x)}{x^2+x\\\\mathrm{cot}(x)-1}, where is the nanoparticle radius and k_m=\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_m\\\\mu_m}\\\\omega/c is wave number. It is supposed here that the time dependence of the electromagnetic field is given by the factor \\\\mathrm{exp}(-i \\\\omega t). In this paper Bruggeman's approach was used, but electromagnetic field for electric-dipole oscillation mode inside the picked particle was computed without applying quasi-static approximation. Thus the function J(k_m a) is due to the field nonuniformity inside the picked particle. In quasi-static region (k_m a<<1, i.e. a ‚â§ 10 nm for Ag) this function becomes constant J(k_m a)=1 and formula (5) becomes identical with Bruggeman's formula (3).  Effective permeability formula  Formula for effective permeability of mixtures has a form \\\\mu_{eff}=\\\\frac{H_{\\\\mu}+i\\\\sqrt{-H_{\\\\mu}^2-8\\\\mu_m \\\\mu_d J(k_m a)}}{4}, (6) H_{\\\\mu}=(2-3c_m)\\\\mu_d-(1-3c_m)\\\\mu_m J(k_m a). Here \\\\mu_{eff} is effective relative complex permeability of the mixture, \\\\mu_d is relative complex permeability of the background medium containing small spherical inclusions of relative permeability \\\\mu_m with volume fraction of c_m<<1. This formula was derived in dipole approximation. Magnetic octupole mode and all other magnetic oscillation modes of odd orders were neglected here. When \\\\mu_m=\\\\mu_d and k_m a<<1 this formula has a simple form \\\\mu_{eff}=\\\\mu_d \\\\left( 1+\\\\frac{c_m}{10} \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c^2}a^2 \\\\epsilon_m \\\\right).

He was made archbishop of Caesarea before September 1129.  Life  Born in a Norman family in southern Italy, Pagan most probably started his career as a lay notary in his homeland. He and his kinsman, Bardo, came to Jerusalem in the entourage of Adelaide del Vasto in 1113. Adelaide had administered the realm of her minor son, Roger II of Sicily, from 1101 to 1111. Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who had always been short of money, married the wealthy widow in 1113, promising to name her son as his successor. Pagan was made the first chancellor of the kingdom in 1115. He appointed Bardo as a lay notary in the chancery. Pagan were among the prelates and barons who adopted laws against adultery, sodomy, bigamy, procuring and prohibit sexual relations between Christians and Saracens at the Council of Nablus on 15 January 1120. Other laws secured the Church right to collect the tithe and authorize clergymen to bear arms in their defense. He accompanied Baldwin II of Jerusalem to Antioch in August 1122, consequently those who needed a royal charter were to travel to north Syria to meet with him. He returned to the kingdom only in December 1122. He played a more active role in the politics from the 1120s, leaving the actual administrative work to Hemelin, who was made vice-chancellor around 1124. Along with Warmund of Picquigny, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, and William I of Bures, Pagan conducted negotiations with the Doge of Venice, Domenico Michiel, about the joint conquest of Tyre at Christmas 1123. Pagan was made archbishop of Caesarea before September 1129. His successor as archbishop, Gaudentius, was first mentioned in a charter on 19 October 1129, showing that Pagan had died.

He led Umm Al Quwain through a turbulent period in the Trucial Coast's history, with conflicts against neighbouring emirates and almost constantly shifting alliances. On two occasions these conflicts led to him being found to breach the terms of the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce with the British. This notwithstanding, he was a signatory to the 1892 Exclusive Agreement, which bound the Trucial Sheikhs and the British together in a protectorate.  Accession  Ahmad bin Abdullah succeeded his elder brother, Ali. Ruling at a time when the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf were almost constantly in conflict, he was immediately involved in a fight with Sharjah over the island of Abu Musa. A force from Umm Al Quwain attempted to raid the island and remove the Ruler of Sharjah's horses from there, but was met by boats from Sharjah which had arrived first. The conflict eventually drew in Umm Al Quwain's neighbours, Ajman weighing in on Sharjah's side and Hamriyah on Umm Al Quwain's. The following year, Abu Dhabi joined the fray in opposition to Sharjah and inflicted a sharp defeat on Sharjah's forces under Sheikh Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi, killing 50 men. Ras Al Khaimah now joined Sharjah and Dubai joined Umm Al Quwain and a general state of war engulfed the coast, despite attempts by the British Residency Agent to broker a peace. The conflict came to a head in 1875, with a force from Dubai attacking Ras Al Khaimah and killing seven men. The headman of Hamriyah brokered a truce between Ahmad bin Abdullah of Umm Al Qawain and Salim bin Sultan of Sharjah in February 1875, but Dubai and Sharjah remained at war until September of that year.  Breach of maritime truce  Ahmad bin Abdullah conducted two dynastic marriages, the first to the daughter of the Ruler of Ajman, Sheikh Abdulaziz (to whom was born a son in 1876) and the second to the sister of the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, Sheikh Humaid bin Abdulla Al Qasimi. However, they divorced in 1882. In 1879, Ahmad bin Abdullah allied himself to Ajman and Ras Al Khaimah against Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, and open conflict was avoided, but his divorce from the sister of Humaid bin Abdullah was acrimonious and resulted in disputes over property, which led Ahmad bin Abdullah to send seven boats to attack the Ras Al Khaimah dependency of Rams, which they did. This action constituted a breach of the 1853 Maritime treaty and Ahmad was consequently reprimanded by the British Resident Agent and compelled to pay a fine. However, the conflict continued to rage on land with Umm Al Quwain and Ajman pitted against Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah. In January 1883 a peace was brokered by Abu Dhabi. In May 1885, Ahmad bin Abdullah had a disagreement with his son, leading to the young man taking refuge in Ajman. When the Ruler of Ajman, Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi, refused to give the boy up, Ahmad bin Abdullah, supported by Sharjah, sent a force against Ajman, which landed at Al Heera. Once again found to be in breach of the 1853 Treaty, Ahmad bin Abdullah was visited by a representative of the Resident Agent aboard HMS Reindeer. Raiding continued between the towns of the coast, however, and Hamriyah attacked Umm Al Quwain, only to have Ahmad bin Abdulla retaliate and sack Hamriyah, whose headman was only spared after he barricaded himself in his fort. In the following conflicts, a northern alliance was founded, with Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain and Ras Al Khaimah generally pitted against their southern neighbours, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In 1879, Ahmad bin Abdulla signed the 'Mutual Agreement on Absconding Debtors' with the British, which aimed to curb the problem of debtors fleeing from one emirate to another and thereby evading their obligations.Mutual Agreement Entered Into By the Trucial Coast Rulers About Absconding Debtors Dated June 24, 1879.  1892 exclusive agreement  Although both German and Turkish interests had attempted to maintain links to the Trucial Coast, it was the intrigues of two French figures (named Tramier and Chapay) who appear to have provoked the need for the British to embark on having the Trucial Sheikhs sign up to the 1892 'Exclusive Agreement'. The two Frenchmen had found a receptive audience in Ahmad bin Abdullah, having supplied him with French flags for Umm Al Quwain's ships to fly, allowing them to act independently of British interests and rulings. When reports reached the British Political Resident that the French had been granted a site at Umm Al Quwain, the British government in Bombay approved the signing of an 'Exclusive agreement' which bound the Trucial Sheikhs not to enter into 'any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government' and that without British assent, they would not 'consent to the residence within my territory of the agent of any other government' and that they would not 'cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory, save to the British Government'.Exclusive Agreement, signed between March 5 and March 8, 1892  Death  Sheikh Ahmad bin Abdulla suffered from paralysis and was too infirm to travel to Sharjah for Curzon's Viceregal Durbar, held off Sharjah in November 1903. He died in June 1904 and was succeeded by his son, Rashid.

Early life Theophilus Albert Maricheau, was born in Grenada on 7 November 1887, the son of a small- scale cocoa farmer who reportedly disappeared the day his son was baptised. His mother died in 1890, and the then Maricheau was brought up by his godmother. He initially attended a Roman Catholic primary school and, subsequently, a Methodist School. In 1903, he took a job with William Galwey Donovan, who was a newspaper publisher and printer. His company produced radical newspapers, advocating representative government and a West Indian federation. Marryshow, who at an early stage Anglicized his surname, advanced rapidly from delivering newspapers to being a competent journalist. Donovan, who was half Grenadian and half Irish, was known as the 'lion' due to his red hair. Marryshow took on many of his ideas. Donovan also taught him about journalism and Marryshow became sub-editor of the St. George's Chronicle and Grenada Gazette in 1908. At the same time, he became active in local politics. Early career Together with C.F.P. Renwick, Marryshow established a new paper, The West Indian, which advocated a Federation of the West Indies. The first issue (1 January 1915) promised that the it would be \\"an immediate and accurate chronicler of current events, an untrammelled advocate of popular rights, unhampered by chains of party prejudice, an unswerving educator of the people in their duties as subjects of the state and citizens of the world\\". Marryshow was an outspoken opponent of the apartheid regime in South Africa and confidently predicted Independence for British African colonies. At the same time, he also campaigned for West Indians to fight in World War One and for the establishment of the British West Indies Regiment. He was presented to the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII, during his 1920 visit to Grenada as \\"Grenada‚Äôs leading journalist\\". However, according to Grenada‚Äôs second prime minister, Maurice Bishop, it was more usual for the British to refer to him as ‚Äúthis dangerous radical‚Äù. In 1918 he set up the Representative Government Association (RGA) in Grenada, which petitioned the British Government to introduce elected members to the Legislative Council. In 1921 he went to London at his own expense to argue his case and this led directly to the establishment of the Woods Commission, which visited the Caribbean in 1922 and recommended five elected members out of a total of 16 in the Legislative Council, to apply both in Grenada as well as in the other Windward Islands, the British Leeward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago. Marryshow himself was elected representative for the St George's constituency, a position he retained for 33 years. He continued to participate in various activities designed to promote a regional Federation, including the first regional conference on integration, held in Barbados in 1929. In the 1920s the ideas of Marcus Garvey, who preached the eventual return of black Caribbean people to Africa, took hold in the Caribbean. To restrict their circulation the British passed a Seditious Publications Bill, which was opposed by Marryshow who believed strongly in the freedom of the press. He visited London again to lobby the British Colonial Office in favour of a Federation in 1931. A new constitution for Grenada was approved in 1935, adding additional elected representatives to the Legislative Council. Later career Marryshow co- founded the Grenada Workingmen‚Äôs Association in 1931 and in 1945 was appointed as the first president of the Caribbean Labour Congress, the first attempt to bring together regional labour unions. For reasons of ill-health he sold The West Indian newspaper in 1934. His financial situation was also poor and would remain so until his death. Towards the end of his political career, the status quo in Grenada was challenged by the more populist politics of Eric Gairy, who would go on to become the country‚Äôs first prime minister. In the first election under full adult suffrage in 1951, Marryshow retained his seat, but Gairy's party took six of the eight available. However, Marryshow was made Deputy President of the Legislative Council. In June 1953 he was invited to the Coronation of Elizabeth II in London. Having thus made the transformation from being a rebel to almost an establishment figure, Marryshow continued to work towards the establishment of a West Indies Federation, which eventually started in 1958 and which he described as his dream come true. He was nominated to represent Grenada as a Senator in the Upper House of the Federation's Parliament. He died in the same year and thus did not live to see the collapse of his dreams; the Federation was dissolved after just four years, in 1962. Death and Heritage Marryshow died on 19 October 1958. He had never married but fathered 17 children, including six with Edna Gittens. His large house in St George's, Grenada, now known as ‚ÄúMarryshow House‚Äù, hosts the Grenada Centre of the School of Continuing Studies of the University of the West Indies. Although far from wealthy he managed, when he was 30, to build a substantial house, which overlooks St George‚Äôs Harbour. He named it the \\"Rosery\\" as there was a popular song by that name when it was being built, and he went on to develop an impressive rose garden. The house, which was reputedly the first built in Grenada using cast concrete, was in a colonial style and was idiosyncratically and eclectically furnished, with people remembering best a life-sized ceramic bulldog, which became his political mascot. He would take it to political meetings, and encourage people to use the name of \\"The Bulldog\\" for him. The dining room was frequently used to host the many people Marryshow had become friendly with through his work, including the Trinidadian writer C. L. R. James and the singer Paul Robeson. Marryshow was himself a good singer and enjoyed singing Spirituals. Since being sold by Marryshow‚Äôs family the building has hosted many important events and has also been twice featured on postage stamps of Grenada. In the Caribbean he became known as the \\"Father of the Federation\\" while in Britain he was known as \\"The Elder Statesman of the Caribbean\\". In 1974 he was remembered at a \\"Marryshow Festival\\", with an exhibition of his achievements held in his former house. At the beginning of the 1980s schoolchildren in Guyana were still using Colonial- era textbooks showing illustrations of white children in English homes. A new series of primary-school textbooks was developed and these were called \\"Marryshow Readers\\". In 2010, the Government of Grenada officially recognised 7 November as Marryshow Day, in recognition of his contribution to Grenada and the region. It had been unofficially celebrated for many years before that. He also gave his name to the T.A. Marryshow Community College, which provides tertiary education in Grenada. Honours and awards Marryshow was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1943.

He was selected for the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in science and healthcare for his contribution to solving healthcare problems in the developing world. He also featured twice in the Forbes Middle East 30 Under 30, and was selected as one of the top 10 young scientists in the world by Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. In 2019, Fares was elected as a Fellow of The World Academy of Medical Sciences.  Early life  Fares was born in Spain and raised in Beirut, the eldest of four siblings of neurosurgeon Youssef Fares and architect-psychologist Aida Hoteit. He credits his upbringing for his thirst for knowledge and medical discovery. Fares earned a B.S. degree in Biology from the American University of Beirut, where he also attended medical school to acquire his M.D. degree. He, concurrently, attained an M.S. degree in Neuropsychology from the Lebanese University Neuroscience Research Center. In 2018, Fares moved to the United States to pursue postdoctoral research in Neuro-oncology at Northwestern University. He further completed a postgraduate medical program in Cancer Biology and Therapeutics at Harvard Medical School.https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyfares/  Career  Fares served in several positions, as Senior Researcher at the Lebanese University Neuroscience Research Center, Research Fellow at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, and Visiting Researcher at the Montreal Neurological Institute/McGill University. , he is a postdoctoral fellow in neurological surgery at Northwestern University, where he conducts translational research on advanced brain tumors in the laboratory of Maciej Lesniak.https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyfares/  Research  Fares's research entails neuroscience, neurosurgery, conflict medicine and global health. In Lebanon, he explored injuries resulting from cluster munitions, which are bombs that release many smaller submunitions, to highlight the effects of these weapons on humanitarian and ecological levels. During the 2006 Lebanon War, it was estimated that 4.6 million submunitions were released over Lebanese soil, and almost one million of which remained unexploded. These unexploded bombs continued to injure and kill civilians after the war ended. Fares studied cases of amputations and injuries involving multiple regions of the body due to blast explosions. These injuries often led to disability, and significant social and mental health problems. His research led to the \\"Fares Scale of Injuries due to Cluster Munitions\\" that assesses injuries based on functional impairment. The scale helped better classify the wounds of victims and determine the best possible treatment. At the Montreal Neurological Institute/McGill University, Fares worked with Rolando Del Maestro on NeuroVR (previously NeuroTouch), a virtual reality neurosurgical simulator that provides a platform for training, planning and evaluating systems for patient- specific neurosurgical oncology and other advanced surgical procedures. Their work led to the validation of multiple neurosurgical scenarios on the NeuroVR.

He gained influence over the tribes of the interior at the expense of the pre-eminent Trucial Ruler of the time, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan.  Accession  He acceded on 13 June 1904 following the death of his father, Sheikh Ahmad bin Abdulla Al Mualla. He wrote to the British Political Resident in September of that year, affirming his accession and accepting the treaty obligations entered into by his forebears. Soon after acceding, he married a daughter of the Ruler of Ajman ‚Äì his Uncle (on his mother's side).  Warring tribes  Rashid bin Ahmed was an astute politician and embarked on a campaign to enhance his influence among the Bedouin tribes, particularly the powerful Bani Qitab. This led, in 1905, to his involvement in a dispute which had broken out in the Wadi Hatta between the Na'im tribe and the Bani Qitab. The town of Masfout in the Wadi Hatta was traditionally home to the Na'im, who were originally from Buraimi. They found themselves under threat when the Bani Qitab built a fort at Wadi Hatta and started to harass caravans passing through the pass to and from the Omani Batina coast. Appealing to Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, the most influential of the Trucial Rulers when it came to tribal affairs, and following a meeting of the Trucial Sheikhs in Dubai in April of that year, the Na'im gained Zayed's support. However, Rashid bin Ahmad supported the Bani Qitab and although the Na'im retained Masfout, Rashid gained a role in the affairs of the Bedouin at Zayed's expense. This ascendancy continued the following year, when the Bani Qitab were in dispute with the Balush of Dhahirah, a tribe loyal both to the Bani Yas of Abu Dhabi and the Al Bu Falasah of Dubai. The Bani Qitab attacked the Balush at Mazim with a number of lives lost. The Balush appealed to Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa who took up their cause, however finding himself opposed to Rashid bin Ahmad, who supported the Bani Qitab. A general war was averted by a meeting of the Trucial Sheikhs and those of the interior, held at Khawaneej outside Dubai, in April 1906. The meeting resulted in an agreement whereby responsibility for tribes was assigned to the Rulers, with Rashid bin Ahmad taking responsibility for the Bani Qitab. The Balush went on to accept the blandishments of Muscat when oil companies started prospecting in their dar or district and Dhahirah is today part of Oman.  British interventions  The dispute with Abu Dhabi smouldered on and, in February 1907, the Political Resident in Bushire, Percy Cox, was drawn into the conflict when the two threatened to clash at the inland dependency of Umm Al Quwain, Falaj Al Ali (today Falaj Al Mualla). HMS Lawrence was moored off Sharjah to reinforce Cox's mediation. Rashid bin Ahmad was delivered up to Cox after a week's negotiations, much the worse for wear after his time in captivity. As in so many cases in the Trucial States, a relatively small incident boiled into preparations for war when a Somali sailor was killed in Ras Al Khaimah in 1919. The culprits escaped to Umm Al Quwain, where Rashid bin Ahmad gave them refuge. Sheikh Sultan bin Salim Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah sent men to patrol Umm Al Qawain's border in case the men should try and move, and Rashid bin Ahmad sent them instead by sea to vandalise Jazirat Al Hamra, where a number of huts were burned by them. Other rulers aligned behind the two parties and the British Political Resident intervened to avert war. Under pressure from the friends of the murdered sailor and the British alike, Sultan bin Salim eventually paid the diya (blood money) to the sailor's family.  Death  Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mualla died of pneumonia in August 1922, leading to a period of disputed succession of seven years' duration.

Early life  Lucas was born in Croatia, in the village of Kozica near the Adriatic coast. While growing up there, she learned the traditional local skills of needlework and embroidery, and later moved to Zagreb to learn cutting and design at the Academy of Dress & Design. In 1951, aged 15, Lucas moved to New Zealand to live with her sister in Northland. Despite having limited English, she worked in her sister's general store in the small town of Maungatapere. In 1955 she moved to Auckland and started working in the fabric department of department store Price & Dempster. She became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1959.  Career  In 1959 Lucas and her husband David Lucas bought a fashion and dressmaking business in Hamilton; they renamed it Maree de Maru (meaning \\"Marriage of the Brides\\" in Croatian) and turned it into a bridalwear store. In 1962 the couple opened a store in Customs Street, Auckland, and in 1966 moved it to the city's busiest street, Queen Street. Over the next few years, Lucas opened four more fashion stores on Queen Street: Modern Bride, which sold a simpler range of bridalwear than Maree de Maru; Buttons Galore, for trimmings and accessories; Stanton Silks, which sold exclusively imported fabrics; and Vinka Lucas After 5, for cocktail and evening wear. In 1963, the couple published a booklet of bridal designs, which later grew into the magazine New Zealand Bride. David Lucas was managing editor and art director, while Vinka Lucas organised shoots and was fashion director. In the 1980s, Lucas branched out into the Middle Eastern market; in partnership with a local sheikh, Sheikh Abbas Filamban, she opened a salon in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and another in Kuwait. In the same decade, Lucas won two major achievements: showing a collection at the London Fashion Olympics in 1980; and winning the international fashion competition run by the Association of Voralberger Embroiderers of Austria. Later life, death and legacy In 2009, Lucas suffered a stroke and retired; her daughter Anita Turner-Williams took over and continued running the business, under the names Vinka Design and Vinka Brides. In 2017, a Vinka Lucas-designed dress was discovered in a bag of clothes donated to a hospice charity shop in Auckland. The shop gave the dress to the Auckland Museum, which placed it on display. A number of Lucas' sewing patterns are in the collection of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. In the 2019 New Year Honours, Lucas was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the fashion industry and design. She died in Auckland on 10 August 2020, aged 88 years; her funeral notice advised mourners, \\"Vinka's standard of dress mandatory\\".

Life Ada ≈†kerl was born on 3 April 1924, in Ljubljana. During the Second World War, she was a member the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation. After the war, she enrolled for Slavic studies at the Ljubljana Faculty of Philosophy, as well as for dramatics at the Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television (Ljubljana). ≈†kerl worked at the publisher Mladinska knjiga for a period. She worked as a teacher in ≈†kofja Loka for three years, then returned to Ljubljana. Between 1958 and 1982, she worked for Radiotelevizija Slovenija. ≈†kerl would perform her poetic works on stage, earning her popularity and publication in literary journals. But after the Second World War, it was considered necessary to strengthen the national spirit towards the reconstruction of the homeland. Her poetry was rejected by the establishment. She was accused of petty sentimentalism and threatened with censorship. She withdrew from literary life for years after this attack. ≈†kerl spent the last years of her life in Maribor. She died on 29 May 2009. Work ≈†kerl is primarily known for her poetry. Her first book of poems Senca v srcu (Shadow in the Heart) was published in 1949, while Obledeli pasteli (Faded Pastels) came out in 1965, and Temna ti≈°ina (Dark Silence) in 1992. Facing censorship and critical rejection for Senca v srcu, ≈†kerl withdrew from literary life for years. Because of the propaganda against her book, it had sold out, but by the time her next collection was published, Slovene poetry was leaning towards modernism, and her observations of intimacy remained on the periphery of the literary scene. ≈†kerl's first book was considered a break from objectivist poetry. Written in metaphorical language, the poems depicted the pain of unfulfilled erotic expectations, which leads to a feeling of isolation, doubt, weariness and fear. The next, Faded Pastels, remained true to her attitude to life, and was sympathetic and self-denying. Her final collection, Dark Silence, was the final fulfillment of a poet who had remained vivid in the literary scene, even if marginalised. She also wrote books for children. Zgodba o morskem konjiƒçku was published in 1953, Vo≈°ƒçila in 1962, and Nevsakdanje potovanje in 1973. Her translations of children's literature from French were also well-received. Among others, she translated Claude Aveline's Baba Di√®ne et Morceau-de-Sucre in 1953, and Victor Hugo's Les travailleurs de la mer in 1956. In her last years, she was considered the lone woman aspect of the poetic collective Pesmi ≈°tirih, along with Janez Menart, Ciril Zlobec, Kajetan Koviƒç and Tone Pavƒçek. ≈†kerl's works began to receive appreciation towards the end of her life. Her poems from Senca v srcu were set as libretto by Ivo Svetina for an opera on her life performed by the Ljubljana Slovene National Theatre Opera and Ballet in 2017.

Characteristics The species in the subfamily Congrogadidae have elongated rather eel-like bodies which are covered in with small cycloid scales. Their dorsal fin normally has a single robust spine and 32‚Äì79 rays while the anal fin lacks any spines and has 26‚Äì66 rays. The dorsal and anal fins are long and the pelvic fin is sometimes present but in more than half the species it is absent. The caudal fin is joined to the long dorsal and anal fins in a small number of species but is separated in all the others. They have a protractable mouth and there is a rear facing spine on the opercle. They have between one and three complete or partial lateral lines. There are no teeth on the palatine and they may or may not be present on the vomerine bone. They grow to a maximum length of . They lay eggs which are covered in hooks, some of which may develop into filaments. The eggs are clumped together in an egg mass the hooks on the eggs' surfaces interlocking with each other, which is most likely guarded by the male. Distribution and habitat The species in the Congrogadinae inhabit coral reefs as well as sand and mud substrates from the intertidal zone down to . They are found in the Indo-Pacific region. There is one species which lives within sponges which is found in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The subfamily is thought to have arisen in the proto Indian Ocean before Gondwanaland broke up and dispersed into the western Pacific Ocean. Genera The following genera are included within the Congrogadinae: * Blennodesmus G√ºnther, 1872 * Congrogadus G√ºnther, 1862 * Halidesmus G√ºnther, 1872 * Halimuraena J.L.B.

Accession  He was a mamluk of the Bursuqid dynasty founded by Bursuq. A Turkish officer in the Seljuk army, al-Bursuqi was appointed as the representative of Mawdud, the atabeg of Mosul, to the court of the Seljuk sultan Muhammad I Tapar. An unidentified Assassin murdered Mawdud at a mosque in Damascus on 2 October 1113 and shortly thereafter the sultan appointed al- Bursuqi as Mawdud's successor at Mosul. The sultan also ordered his emirs to continue jihad (or holy war) against the Crusader states. Al-Bursuqi launched a devastating raid against the County of Edessa in April and May 1115. As the Artuqid ruler of Mardin, Ilghazi, had declined to participate in the campaign, al-Bursuqi invaded his territory, but Ilghazi defeated his troops. Because of the failure of his campaign, al-Bursuqi stayed in al-Rahba, and Juy√ªsh-beg was appointed atabeg of Mosul by the sultan.  Muslim leader  Al-Bursuqi was reappointed as atabeg of Mosul in 1124 due to insubordination of Juy√ªsh-beg. Baldwin II of Jerusalem, Joscelin I of Edessa and a Bedouin leader, Dubais ibn Sadaqa laid siege to Aleppo in October 1124. The qadi of Aleppo, Ibn al- Khashshab, approached al-Bursuqi, seeking his assistance. In 1125, he reclaimed Aleppo for the Seljuk sultan Mahmud II. Al-Bursuqi invaded the Principality of Antioch and forced the allied enemy forces to abandon the siege in January 1125. He also supported Toghtekin in the battle of Azaz in 1125, but a Crusader force relieved it. Using the spoils he gained his victory at Azaz, Baldwin II was able to ransom his daughter Ioveta and Joscelin II of Edessa, then held at Aleppo by al-Bursuqi, that had been used to secure Baldwin's own release. On November 26, 1126, al-Bursuqi was assassinated by a team of 10 Nizaris attacking him with knives while he was at the Great Mosque of Mosul. The assassin's fate is unknown, but he wounded three. The attack was presumably ordered by Mahmud II. His son Mas‚Äô√ªd ibn Bursuq√Æ replaced him in Mosul, but his reign was short-lived because of the rise of the Zengid dynasty.

His short rule was dominated by fears of a coup by his uncles and was brought to an abrupt end by the machinations of his cousin.  Accession  Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad died of pneumonia in August 1922. At the time only his mother and the family slaves were present and they acted quickly to get word to Rashid's eldest son, Abdullah, that his father had passed away. Abdullah, who was only 20 years old and who was himself travelling in Falaj Al Ali (today Falaj Al Mualla), rushed home and secured the house and Sheikdom, aware that his male relatives ‚Äì particularly Rashid bin Ahmad's brothers, Ibrahim and Saeed, would likely contest the succession. Abdullah sent a messenger to Mohammed Ali bin Huwaidan, the headman of the powerful Bedouin tribe, the Bani Qitab, who owed their loyalty to the house of Al Mualla and Mohammed Ali travelled to Umm Al Quwain with a force of some 100 men to guard the town. The move was inspired: Ibrahim bin Ahmad stayed at Falaj Al Ali and Saeed bin Ahmad fled to Ras Al Khaimah. Another possible claimant, Abdullah bin Saeed ‚Äì who was married to Rashid bin Ahmad's daughter ‚Äì stayed in Umm Al Quwain but was placed under house arrest. Abdullah himself maintained a house in Ras Al Khaimah. Abdullah bin Rashid refused to allow his uncles to return to Umm Al Quwain, but Saeed bin Ahmad went to the British Residency Agent and complained. The agent, Isa bin Abdel Latif, travelled to Umm Al Quwain in October 1922 to try and mediate with Abdullah, but found the young man obstinate and fearful of his relatives. Abdel Latif also noted that Abdullah had alienated many members of the ruling family and that many people from Umm Al Qawain were travelling to meet Saeed, who had decamped to Ajman. The British Political Resident, Arthur Prescott Trevor, met with Saeed in March 1923 and was persuaded by his arguments that the Bani Qitab were stoking animosity and that he had been dispossessed by Abdullah bin Rashid. The British Agent visited Umm Al Qawain in September and, finding Abdullah well established as Ruler, proceeded to take Abdullah's promise to abide by the treaties with the British. Abdel Latif urged Abdullah to settle with his family but he refused. In October 1923, Abdullah's cousin, Hamad bin Ibrahim, set a slave from his household to murder Abdullah. Immediately following the funeral, Hamad bin Ibrahim Al Mualla outwitted the family and its guards and took over the government house, proclaiming himself Ruler.

Early life Volf Bronner was born in Buriat-Mongolia in 1876. He attended high school in Chita and then began to study medicine at the University of Tomsk but was expelled because of his revolutionary political activities. One of his classmates at Tomsk was A.

He edited the Journal Clinique d'Urologie. From 1915 he worked in Moscow and in 1922 he established the State Venereological Institute in Moscow, of which he became the director. Bronner helped to organise the 1928 Soviet-German Syphilis Expedition which aimed to tackle the endemic syphilis in Buriat-Mongolia, Bronner's place of birth, and to determine the method of transmission of the disease. Contrary to expectations, the expedition concluded that the syphilis in the area was spread principally by sexual activity.Bashkuev, Vsevolod (2013). \\"Silencing the Shame: Forgetting of the 1920s Syphilis Epidemic in Buryat-Mongolia as a Strategy of Post-Soviet Identity Construction\\".

Following the Russian Communist Party's 17th Congress in 1934, which emphasised service to the collective over individual needs, Bronner was one of a number of public figures who changed his public utterances to match the new ethos, moving away from a humanistic approach that saw syphilitic infection as the result of misfortune and nothing to be ashamed about, towards an approach that characterised it as impeding the efforts of the party and something that carried shameful connotations.

History The 5th Special Forces Group Detachment A-332B first established a base here in October 1966. The base was located on Highway 13 near the intersection with Highway 14 24 km north of Lai Kh√™ and approximately 25 km south of An L·ªôc. In August 1972 following the Battle of An L·ªôc, the camp, together with An L·ªôc itself were the only remaining ARVN bases in B√¨nh Long Province and were entirely dependent on aerial resupply. The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 271st Regiment, 9th Division was located northeast of Ch∆°n Th√†nh in southern B√¨nh Long Province in position to block the ARVN from using Highway 13 between Ch∆°n Th√†nh and An L·ªôc and to threaten ARVN posts at Ch√≠ Linh and ƒê·ªìng Xo√†i. In addition the PAVN 7th Division operated from a base east of Highway 13 between Ch∆°n Th√†nh and B√†u B√†ng District. The camp was defended by Vietnamese Rangers and Regional Forces (RF), supported by a rotation of Regiments of the 5th Division. From 3 to 15 June 1973 the ARVN launched an unsuccessful operation to reopen Highway 13 between Lai Kh√™ and Ch∆°n Th√†nh. The 7th Infantry Regiment, 5th Division set out from Ch∆°n Th√†nh to link up with the 8th Infantry Regiment advancing north from B√†u B√†ng. Despite firing 87,000 artillery rounds in support of this operation, the 7th Infantry's advance was stopped after 5-6km and they returned to Ch∆°n Th√†nh having suffered moderate casualties. In early January 1974 just west of Ch∆°n Th√†nh the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry, 5th Division, was struck hard by the PAVN 7th Battalion, 209th Infantry, losing 36 killed and 85 weapons captured. In February 1974 the ARVN 5th Division made another unsuccessful attempt to reopen Highway 13 between Lai Kh√™ and Ch∆°n Th√†nh. A similar effort was made in March with the same results. By mid-March 1975 with the PAVN's Spring Offensive underway, the ARVN enclaves at An L·ªôc and Ch∆°n Th√†nh were of no further military or political value and the 32nd Ranger Group defending An L·ªôc and the 31st Ranger Group defending Ch∆°n Th√†nh were needed to bolster the hard-pressed defenses throughout the region. Furthermore, the PAVN 273rd Infantry Regiment, 341st Division was discovered near Ch∆°n Th√†nh. To save the Rangers and RF in An L·ªôc and Ch∆°n Th√†nh, III Corps commander General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n ordered an evacuation of An L·ªôc on 18 March. Among the first to be moved were 12 105 mm howitzers, while 5 of the 155 mm howitzers had to be destroyed because the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) did not have heavy-lift helicopters to move them. One Ranger Battalion, the province headquarters and the III Corps Ranger Command were removed by helicopter, while the other 2 Ranger Battalions and RF were to move south along Highway 13 to Ch∆°n Th√†nh. The overland force left on the night of 19 March and despite a few minor skirmishes arrived at Ch∆°n Th√†nh on 20 March. The defenses at Ch∆°n Th√†nh comprised an earth ditch and then a wall dotted with fighting positions. With the arrival of the 32nd Rangers it was now defended by 6 Ranger battalions, one RF battalion, 11 M41 tanks and artillery, however one 32nd Ranger battalion was soon removed. Before the ARVN could begin their withdrawal from Ch∆°n Th√†nh at 09:30 on 24 March 2 Regiments of the 9th Division supported by T-54 tanks attacked the base. The defenders held their fire until the tanks were close and then hit them with antitank rockets and recoilless rifle fire destroying 7 and, together with RVNAF airstrikes, they killed more than 100 PAVN soldiers. On the 26th, the 9th Division attacked again, apparently trying to retrieve disabled tanks, but was repulsed again. By 27 March the 273rd Regiment which had been holding blocking positions on Highway 13 south of Ch∆°n Th√†nh was sent to reinforce the 9th Division for another assault on the camp. After 2 attacks the PAVN had been repulsed for the loss of 240 killed and 11 tanks destroyed, while ARVN losses were 50 killed and wounded. At dawn on 31 March following a 3,000 round bombardment by 105 mm and 155 mm howitzers and 120 mm mortars, the entire 9th Division, 273rd Regiment and the remaining tanks attacked Ch∆°n Th√†nh again. The PAVN penetrated the camp defenses three times and were repulsed each time. However resupply, reinforcement and medical evacuation from the camp was now impossible and the Ranger commander, Colonel Nguyen Thanh Chuan, received permission from General To√†n to abandon Ch∆°n Th√†nh. Accordingly, on 1 April the RVNAF saturated the PAVN assembly areas and bivouacs with 52 sorties; under the cover of this attack, the Ranger and RF battalions began withdrawing separately to B√†u B√†ng and Lai Kh√™, taking the remaining artillery and M41s with them. One Ranger battalion and the RF battalion were ambushed and suffered moderate losses, but the 31st Ranger Group was now available to support South Vietnamese defenses elsewhere. Current use The base is now farmland and housing.

Drizin is an American lawyer and academic. He is a Clinical Professor of Law at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in Chicago, where he has been on the faculty since 1991. At Northwestern, Drizin teaches courses on Wrongful Convictions and Juvenile Justice. He has written extensively on the topics of police interrogations and false confessions. Among the general public, Drizin is known for his ongoing representation of Brendan Dassey, one of the protagonists in the Netflix documentary series, Making a Murderer. Early life and career Drizin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Both his parents worked as teachers in the School District of Philadelphia. In 1983, he graduated from Haverford College with a B.A. in Political Science. In 1986, he earned a J.D. from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in Chicago. At Northwestern, Drizin served as Editor- in-Chief for the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology from 1985-1986. Upon completing his Juris Doctor, Drizin worked for a few years in commercial litigation at the Chicago-based law firm Sachnoff & Weaver. Sachnoff & Weaver later merged with the firm Reed Smith. In 1988, Drizin left Sachnoff to clerk for Judge Ilana Rovner, who at that point in her career was on the bench at the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Northwestern University Bluhm Legal Clinic In 1991, Drizin returned to his alma mater to become a supervising attorney at the Children and Family Justice Center at Northwestern Law's Bluhm Legal Clinic. From 2005-2013, he took over as Legal Director of the Clinic's Center on Wrongful Convictions. From 2013-2017, Drizin served as the Assistant Dean of the Bluhm Legal Clinic. In addition to teaching Northwestern law students how to represent wrongfully convicted clients in post-conviction proceedings, Drizin is a prominent criminal justice reform advocate. In 2004, Drizin co-authored an amicus brief that played a role in the United States Supreme Court‚Äôs landmark decision Roper v. Simmons, which abolished the juvenile death penalty. His policy work also involves working with state governments around the country to require law enforcement agencies to electronically record all custodial interrogations. As mentioned in Making a Murderer, in 2005, Drizin filed a non-party brief in the case of State vs Jerrell C.J, a Wisconsin Supreme Court case which mandated the electronic recording of all interrogations of minors in that state. Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth In 2008, Drizin co-founded the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth (CWCY), the nation's first innocence project dedicated to the representation and advocacy of wrongfully convicted children and adolescents. A joint enterprise between the Center on Wrongful Convictions and the Children and Family Justice Center, the Center currently represents Brendan Dassey and has successfully exonerated over 20 wrongfully convicted juveniles. The CWCY is active in the areas of appellate litigation, juvenile policy reform, interrogation processes, and the enforcement of juvenile constitutional protections. The Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth represents many juveniles who have falsely confessed to a crime they have not committed, and are prominent collaborators in the juvenile justice space. Drizin and Co-Director Laura Nirider have authored numerous amicus curiae briefs, and conducted professional training in the area of false confessions and interrogation practices for legal professionals including judges, attorneys, and the greater law enforcement community.

It was established in 1909 during the American colonial era by Governor General William Cameron Forbes as a venue for polo and leisure for the wealthy elite. It was originally located in Pasay prior to World War II, after which it transferred to its present location in Forbes Park, Makati. History William Cameron Forbes, the founder of the Manila Polo Club. Early years: American period The Manila Polo Club (MPC) was incorporated on August 18, 1909 by American William Cameron Forbes, who would start serving as Governor-General of the Philippines within the same year. Forbes was a polo enthusiast who owned two polo fields in his estate in Boston, envisioned the club as a venue for polo and leisure for \\"gentlemen of a certain class\\" assigned to work in the Philippines like himself. Forbes is credited for establishing the first polo field in the Philippines and served as delegate of the club until the outbreak of World War II.The clubhouse was inaugurated on November 27, 1909. The original location of the clubhouse was situated on land acquired by Forbes himself using his own money, along Calle Real (now F.B. Harrison Avenue) in Pasay. The club's membership was primarily American in its early years and also had foreigners with different nationalities as its members. Complying with Forbes' original intention for the club, less than 20 percent of the club at that time were native Filipinos. Aside from being a key figure in the club's establishment, Forbes also aided the growth of the club's reputation internationally due to his work as a writer and contributor for polo magazines published outside the Philippine islands. One of the high profile guests of the club in the pre-World War II era was then Prince of Wales Edward VIII who played a polo match with an American team at the MPC's clubhouse. In July 1922, the Manila Polo Club became a member of the United States Polo Association which led to the organization of the Far Eastern Circuit which saw the participation of several army camps. In the 1930s, a dispute regarding the application of an aspirant member caused a schism. The club voted against the membership application of Manuel Nieto, a colonel who served as an aide to then-Philippine President Manuel Quezon which caused the Elizalde brothers to resign their membership with the club to found the Los Tamaraos Polo Club in 1937. World War II and relocation When the Japanese occupied the Philippines during the World War II, the Manila Polo Club was taken over by the Japanese military and converted to become the Japanese Navy Recreation Club. The original clubhouse was later burned down during the Battle of Manila of 1945. After the war, the club was temporarily hosted in a property along Dewey Boulevard (now Roxas Boulevard) in Pasay. Businessmen Alfonso Z√≥bel de Ayala & Joseph McMicking of the Ayala Corporation convinced the club to move to Makati, particularly in an area which was being developed by their company. That area would later be known as Forbes Park, named after club founder Forbes. The main lounge of the new Manila Polo Club was designed by Pablo S. Antonio, Sr. By around the 1960s, there are more Filipinos and non-American foreigners had become members of the club. In 1964, the club elected Enrique J. Z√≥bel as its president, marking the first time the club would be led by a Filipino. Reforms The Manila Polo Club became a proprietary share club in 1979 and under the new set-up, the club's membership was required to consist of 60 percent Filipino and 40 percent foreign. In 1983, the club allowed the transfer of shares to widows of its male members, allowing women to become full members. Mar√≠a Paz Rufino Laurel-Tanjangco was the first female member of the club. In 1987, gender-related restrictions on membership was dropped. Maribel Ongpin became the club's first female board member in 1995 and Isabel Caro Wilson became the club's first female president. Membership Membership with the Manila Polo Club is reserved to very rich individuals due to the high cost of shares of stock in the club. However ownership of shares does not necessarily equate to membership. To become a member, an aspirant must secure a least two referrals from current members and endorsement from five other members. The name of the aspirant is posted on the club's bulletin board for 30 days and any member can write any feedback regarding the aspirant to the membership committee. By the end of the period the membership committee could schedule an interview with the aspirant and after which the members of the committee anonymously vote by casting a black or white ball, the former of which signifies rejection, to approve or deny an aspirant's application. If rejected an aspirant could apply for membership again after six months. Prior 1983, membership was restricted to males although wives of members were allowed to use the club's facilities. The club's facilities are also available for rental to non-members provided that there is sponsorship from a member. As per the organization's by-laws, the incumbent President of the Philippines and the incumbent Mayor of Makati are granted honorary membership and do not have to pay for shares in stock of the club and can use facilities of the club but they have to pay like the regular members.

It was designed by Marcel Breuer (with Harry Seidler as onsite supervisor) and built from 1975 to 1976. It is also known as the Former Torin Corporation Building and Breuer Building. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 May 2009.  History  Marcel Breuer was born in Hungary in 1902. He studied under Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus in Weimar where he also came into contact with a number of other significant figures in design and architecture such as Le Corbusier. These associations influenced Breuer in his professional life for many years. In 1924 Breuer became Director of the Bauhaus furniture workshop and also took on a teaching role there. It was while he was working at the Bauhaus that Breuer developed his ground breaking Wassily and Cesca tubular steel chair designs. In 1928 Breuer set up an architecture and interior design practise in Berlin. When Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Breuer moved to London where he continued to practise as an internationally noted architect and designer. In 1937 on the invitation of Walter Gropius, then Chairman of the Faculty of Architecture at Harvard, Breuer took up an Associate Professorship at that university. He also went into partnership with Gropius and began a distinguished career in America. During the 1940s Breuer's American work was primarily the design of domestic residences and he was thought to have revolutionised the design of American houses. Geller House was designed in 1945 and was the first of Breuer's binuclear houses where living and sleeping accommodation was separated in two wings rooved with one of his distinctive butterfly rooves that quickly became an icon of modernist design all over the world. In 1952 the design of the UNESCO building in Paris marked Breuer's first significant foray into the design of international public buildings. In this building Breuer began his use of concrete as a favoured construction material. It was also a turning point in his adoption of a distinctively sculptural approach to architectural form which was developed over the years to his retirement in 1976 and expressed in buildings such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York and St Francis de Sales Church, Muskegon, Michigan. Through works such as these Breuer built his reputation as the most significant \\"form giver\\" of the 20th century. As Seidler noted in an obituary published in the Architecture Bulletin in 1981 \\"There can be no doubt that Marcel Breuer was a great man, the last and one of the greatest of those few men who shaped modern architecture and modern design after World War I.\\" Breuer's long term association with the Torrington Corporation (later renamed Torin Corporation) began in 1952 when he designed the Technical Centre at the Corporation's factory in Canada. Between 1952 and 1976, Breuer designed nine factory and office buildings for the Torin Corporation. The last was constructed in 1976 in Penrith, NSW. This building's design was a result of the evolution and refinement of technical and visual experience of the Torin buildings preceding it. A tenth Torin building was designed and constructed by Breuer's practise after he retired in 1976. The Torin building in Penrith was designed by Breuer and his partner, Herbert Beckhard from their offices in New York. The administration of the project during construction was taken on by the office of Harry Seidler and Associates in Sydney. Seidler had worked for Breuer in 1946-1948. In 1973 there had been an agreement signed between Harry Seidler and Associates and the Commonwealth of Australia for an Australian Embassy in Paris, Seidler said that 'it was natural for me to ask Breuer's Paris office to be our 'architecte d'operation'. It meant re-establishing a working relationship with him after many years. The ground breaking ceremony took place on 6 January 1975.  Description  The Torin Corporation factory at Penrith was built within an industrial estate to the north of the town centre. It is located on the corner of Coombes Drive and Coombes Drive South. Car access was from Coombes Drive and trucking access to the large storage area behind the factory building was from Coombes Drive South. Buildings in the area are widely spaced and there are no special elements that would affect the outlook or disposition of the building on the site. The main elevation is bold in its architectural composition consisting of almost windowless cuboid forms of rough-textured concrete block and precast concrete. It is an exemplary late Twentieth Century International Modern Style industrial building, is a powerful work, a fully resolved in three dimensional architectural expression which is monumental in its bold geometry. The plan and mass of the building was the outcome of its integrated handling system consisting of storage, retrieval and reassembling. The Torin Corporation manufactured a wide range of blower units and axial and centrifugal impellers for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry. Many of the products were also manufactured in Torin's ten other factories throughout the world. In these locations it had been recognised that, as labor costs rose, the materials handling activity became an important candidate for automation. Therefore, an integrated handling system was developed that dictated the basic shape of the Penrith factory. The building consisted of three basic components; a high rise storage unit containing the integrated handling system; a basic two-floor structure which contains manufacturing, assembly and office areas, as well as a well equipped laboratory for airflow measurement and two service cores three storeys high, but of the same total height as the two manufacturing storeys. These cores project from the facade free of the manufacturing space. One module provided an entrance for plant employees and support facilities: toilets, locker rooms and stairs. The other contained an entrance for visitors and office personnel, and mechanical space, toilets and stairs. Access to the high rise storage unit was provided at both manufacturing levels. The multitude of components required in the manufacturing process were moved in and out of the 20-metre high storage system by a single rail-guided vehicle as the various manufacturing operations were performed. Because processing lines were adjacent to container racking on both floors, load distances were very short. Once positioned in a pick-up station, loads could be moved by a storage vehicle for weight check and storage in less than a quarter of the time expected of a conventional fork-lift truck. Storage was accessible only to a special vehicle. This ensured parts, quantity and location integrity and eliminated the shutdown usually required for the taking of inventory.  Materials and structural system  All walls of the complete steel framed structure, except the north/south walls are of concrete block, cavity wall construction, the outer skin consisting of split-face block. Office areas and the lower floor manufacturing areas included precast concrete window units similar to those first developed by the architects for the Torin Technical Centre in Torrington, Connecticut, US in 1971. These units in all cases faced north and were designed to provide adequate sun shade. North and south walls of the high rise storage unit were clad in corrugated metal panels, painted white to contrast with the rough textured, warm grey, split block used elsewhere. A further use of this corrugated metal was in combination with the window wall treatment of the two entrances to the building. The sloping form of the northern walls of the service cores were a departure from the horizontal/vertical lines of the building, giving dynamic lines to the composition of the building forms.  Condition  As at 21 October 2008, The condition of the fabric is excellent. The archaeological potential of the site is unknown. The Torin building is a highly intact example of a small scale industrial building designed by Marcel Breuer in the Late Twentieth Century International style. The architectural elements and sculptural aspects of the external facade are still in place and the internal and external fittings remain in situ. It is a rare and relatively intact example of a Late Twentieth-Century International style industrial building in Sydney.  Heritage listing  As at 7 July 2009, the former Torin building is of State heritage significance as a rare and intact example of a Late Twentieth Century Modernist style industrial building designed by internationally acclaimed master architect Marcel Breuer. It is the only Marcel Breuer building in NSW and Australia and is one of a suite of buildings specifically designed for the Torin Corporation located throughout Europe, Canada and the United States. The Torin building in Penrith was the last of 9 buildings designed for the Torin Corporation by Marcel Breuer and the form and design inclusions of this building had evolved from the visual and technical experience of the Torin Corporation buildings preceding it. The Torin building in Coombes Drive Penrith differs from the early Torin Corporation buildings which were more classically gridded modernist work. The Australian example is a strong expression of the powerful sculptural mode of Breuer's later career.letter from Barry Bergdoll, Curator in Chief, Architecture and Design, MOMA. Marcel Breuer gained a stellar international reputation early in his career while studying and teaching at the Bauhaus in Dessau in the 1920s. It was here that he designed the famous Wassily chair among other achievements. He later joined the also famous Walter Gropius in partnership and continued to develop his architecture which by the later years \\"illustrat[ed] the cubist sensibility of this sculptor architect \\" and gained him the reputation as \\"one of the most important form givers of our time\\".Pei, I. M., Marcel Breuer A Memoir. The Torin building in Penrith is a fine example of Breuer's Torin Corporation architecture and the principles of his modernist design work where form is primarily determined by function. Like other of the Torin Corporation's small scale industrial buildings, the Torin building in Penrith is a good example of the way in which Breuer's design raised his buildings to a new modernist aesthetic level which ensured there was economy in plan form, bold architonic expression and the repetition of industrial elements as either extruded sections or pre-cast elements. The architectural elements and sculptural aspects of the external facade are still in place and the internal and external fittings remain in situ. Torin Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 May 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Torin building, designed in 1975, is one of the later buildings in the distinctive career of internationally renowned architect Marcel Breuer whose work is critically acclaimed as part of the Twentieth Century International style of architecture. The Torin building in Penrith is one of a suite of buildings throughout Canada, Europe and US constructed for the Torin Corporation. It demonstrates a late stage in the evolution of the design requirements for such small scale industrial buildings in an economic context of cost saving through automation . The distinctive form of this building is influenced by the functional requirements of the factory to incorporate an automated, integrated handling system (contained in the tower component of the building), the two storey manufacture, assembly, office and laboratory component and the two service cores (one an entry one housing services) which project form the facade. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The former Torin Building is of State heritage significance as it is an important work by internationally renowned master architect Marcel Breuer with the association with Herbert Beckhard. Breuer and Beckhard were architects for the Torin Corporation of the US. Breuer and Beckhard designed nine buildings for the Torin Corporation located in the US, France, Canada, Belgium and England. Breuer built his reputation as a stellar international architect through his work at the Bauhause in the 1920s where he designed the famous Wasilli and Cesa chairs, through his working association with Walter Gropius in Europe and America and his acclaimed industrial, civic and residential architectural design including the UNESCO building in Paris and the Whittney Museum in New York. Breuer was noted as \\"one of the last true functionalist architects\\" whose designs raised small scale industrial architecture to a new modernist aesthetic level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Torin Building demonstrates a high level of creative and technical achievement. Its sculptural form, plan and massing is determined by an integrated and automated handling system of storage, retrieval and reassembly. It contains design elements, a concern with texture and geometry which are typical of the Breuer Torin buildings. These features include the use of structural steel frame clad in metal sheet split face concrete block, projecting blade walls and precast concrete window frames with integrated sun shading. The Torin building is an aesthetically distinctive as a fine example of Late Twentieth Century Modernist industrial architecture The design demonstrates an economy in plan form, bold architectonic expression and the repetition of industrial elements either as extruded sections or precast elements. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The former Torin building has heritage significance at a State level as a resource for understanding the design intent, detailing, the choice of construction materials and techniques of this important international architect in the Australian context. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The former Torin building is a rare and intact example of Late 20th Century International style industrial architecture designed by master architect Marcel Bruer who worked with Walter Gropius and the Bauerhaus and gave us lauded design items such as the Wassily and Cesca Chair and who later in his career designed buildings of critical acclaim such as the Whittney Museum, New York and the UNESCO building in Paris. It is the only building in Australia designed by Breuer and one of the few buildings in Australia designed by an internationally renowned master architect. It features exceptionally fine concrete block and precast concrete sun control detailing protecting windows at ground level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Torin building is a fine example of Marcel Breuer's Torin Corporation design work. Being the last of these buildings designed this building incorporates technical and visual elements that had evolved over the 14 years of Breuers design for the company. While it is the only Breuer designed building in Australia it is one of a group of 9 Breuer designed Torin Corporation buildings located throughout Europe, US and Canada. It incorporates ideas and media such as the use of split face concrete cladding and precast windows with integrated sun shading which are of concern to Breuer in his Torin buildings as well as other buildings in his portfolio.

History The Admiralty's production of and research and development into launching gear for torpedoes and mines was originally carried out within facilities at HMNB Portsmouth from 1914. During World War II, with the threat of German air raids, all research and production of launching gear was moved to new premises at West Howe in 1941. Although production was relocated again in 1947, the establishment at West Howe continued to undertake research and development work. That year it was given the name the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Launching Establishment. An outstation at Horsea Island was used to conduct trials. The establishment was closed in 1959 with the formation of the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment at the Isle of Portland. The new establishment was an amalgamation of a number of Admiralty research sites, including the Launching Establishment, the Underwater Countermeasures and Weapons Establishment at Havant and the Torpedo Experimental Establishment at Greenock. Following its closure, the West Howe site was purchased by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority as an additional facility in connection with the Winfrith Atomic Energy Establishment.

It was designed by William Wilkinson Wardell and built from 1882 to 1884 by Mr Willis and Mr James Buchanan. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Ewan family and the construction of 'Glenleigh' James Ewan was born in 1843 near Edinburgh. After the Grand Tour of Europe, his family immigrated to Sydney in 1849, where his father was appointed headmaster of the York Street Free Church of Scotland school. In 1854 James' sister Elizabeth married John Frazer, who owned a successful wholesale grocery business. Three years later the family ties resulted in James obtaining a position as a clerk in the warehouse. Soon after, Ewan's second sister married William Mason, who was invited to become a partner in Frazer and Co. In 1869, at the age of 26, Ewan became a partner in the firm, brought about by the death of Manson and Frazer's poor health. In the same year a friend of Frazer's, James Watson, bought a quarter share in the company. The family ties were further cemented when Watson married Ewan's last sister, Margaret in 1871. In the same year Ewan became engaged to Marion Reid, daughter of Reverend John Reid and sister of future Prime Minister of Australia George Houston Reid. With these three directors Frazer and Co. became the largest and most successful shipping merchants and importers. The Company assured Ewan's wealth, although he became director of the United Insurance Company and the Waratah Coal Company. He was also director and then chairman of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company In addition he was a magistrate, honorary treasurer of Sydney Hospital and a member of several charities. Despite all this, Ewan shied away from public life. In 1881 James Ewan purchased at Regentville, near Penrith, from the former Sir John Jamison (Regentville) Estate. Ewan commissioned eminent architect W. W. Wardell to design Glenleigh. Previously living in Darling Point, Woollahra, Ewan's health was failing and it is thought to have prompted his move to the celebrated clean air of the Blue Mountains foothills. By then Marion had given birth to six of their eight children, all of whom were under the age of eight. In March 1882 Ewan was advised to travel to England for a kidney treatment. In his absence, he left his brother-in-law Watson in charge of overseeing the construction, in conjunction with Wardell. Mr. Willis, a local Penrith builder had begun work on the house in May 1882. A dispute arose regarding payment and a design change. Watson and Wardell were unable to resolve the matter and in January 1883 city builder, John Buchanan was given the contract. Buchanan worked frequently with Wardell, including renovations to Glanworth, Watson's house in Darling Point, Woollahra - Ewan had lived next door during these works and frequently visited the house on their completion. Wardell was also an advocate of the interior decorators Lyon, Cottier & Co., Watson employing the Company to decorate Glanworth and it is possibly through this association that Ewan became familiar with both Wardell and Lyon, Cottier & Co. Lyon, Cottier & Co. are attributed with the elaborate interior decoration, although there is no documentary evidence to confirm this. Glenleigh marked a significant departure in Ewan's architectural tastes, his former home Ranelagh, in an Italianate style was befitting of a city merchant, but not a country gentleman. Instead, Glenleigh referred to Ewan's heritage, being in a Scottish vernacular farmhouse style. Wardell was concurrently building Grafton Wharf warehouses for Frazer and Co. and the two structures bear a resemblance to each other. The Grafton Wharf was constructed of Hayes Best White bricks, which Ewan liked so much he asked that they also be used at Glenleigh. Documentary evidence to this effect discounts local folklore that Glenleigh was constructed with ballast bricks from one of Ewan's import ships. The Ewan's moved into Glenleigh in 1884, although Ewan spent many nights in the city at Watson's Glanworth for business purposes. Marion remained in Penrith, being visited by Maggie Watson and her children for several days at a time until Maggie became unwell and travelled with her family back to England. Watson's departure left the business affairs on Ewan's shoulders, doing further damage to his health. In 1889 the decision was made to sell the company, due to the death of Maggie and Ewan's constant health problems. As such a large house, \\"Glenleigh\\" required the employment of two female servants, a governess and a maid, who lived in the main house, as well as four women and seven men, who occupied cottages on the property. These men and women saw to the dairy herd and the horses. Marion also had constructed Hope Cottage, a convalescent home for sick servants of \\"not so kindly employees\\".Mariette 2003:49 Ewan also made a substantial donation to the establishment of the Nepean Cottage Hospital, now the Nepean District Hospital. Despite his generosity, the local community did not warm to him - there was no local announcement of his death in August 1903 and very few local residents attended - in sharp contrast to the 200 Sydney merchants and bankers. It was left to Marion, who lived a further 11 years, to endear the community through her charity work and support of the Presbyterian Church. She died in July 1914. Mariette (2003:52) believes that Ewan was a financially shrewd man, hard working and loyal to his family. To him, wealth enabled him to \\"indulgence in quieter pursuits, including his family, his involvement in his agricultural interests and the running of his convalescent home for sick servants. Yet, despite his acts of benevolence, his apparent parsimony and reticence did not endear him to the people of Penrith who saw him as a hard- headed Scottish merchant whose main interests lay in the commercial life of Sydney rather than at home in Penrith - a reputation that lives on today, immortalised in the bricks and mortar of Glenleigh.\\" 'Glenleigh' was sold in 1917 to Messrs Morris and Ransley, who let it to an ostrich farmer. The house continued as a gentleman's residence until 1933, when it was purchased to Charles Smith. Smith leased the property to a church mission, who used it to house Aboriginal girls. In 1940 Dr Charles Monticone, an eccentric Italian, bought the house. Shirley Hazzard immortalised him as Dr Montyfiore in her novel \\"The Transit of Venus\\". Hazzard's evacuation, as a schoolgirl, from Sydney for fear of Japanese invasion in 1941 to \\"Glenleigh\\" by Monticone formed the basis of Dr Montyfiore. Monticone lived as a recluse, except for his French housekeeper, until 1979. The estate was put up for auction by Raine & Horne in 1984, with of grounds with access to the Nepean River and a private boat ramp.SMH, 26/5/1984 The present owners purchased the house in 1984 and are in the process of reinstating the interior and renovating the building more generally.Mariette, 2003 Painter William Whittlam was responsible for the three-year project of helping restore Glenleigh's interior paint finishes by scraping away unsympathetic fluoro orange paint a previous owner had applied to engraved brass fire surrounds, removing cream distemper from walls once covered in stencilled butterflies and swirling floral patterns. Then owner and entrepreneur Fred Grotto had interests in suburban wedding reception centres, food outlet, nursery, manufacturing and photo laboratories. The ceilings fortunately were relatively untouched and may be unique in Australia. In the music room Mozart, Haydn and Mendelssohn gaze down from garlanded and gold- leafed frames; in the library Shakespeare, Milton, Scott and Burns hint at Ewan's literary tastes in the 1890s. The dining room is perhaps the most remarkable - dark green, gilt with cameos of potential ingredients in the form of painted leaping hares, stags at bay, freshly hooked fish and a brace of partridges. William Wilkinson Wardell, architect William Wilkinson Wardell was born in 1823 in Poplar, London. He trained as an engineer, before spending some time at sea. On his teturn he worked for the commissioners of sewers and for an architect. Through his interest in Gothic Revival architecture he became friends with Augustus Pugin and Cardinal John Henry Newman. Wardell designed a number of churches in the London area, the largest being the Church of Mary and Michael, Commercial Road, Whitechapel. Wardell and his wife, Lucy Ann Butler, immigrated to Melbourne in 1858, due to Wardell's poor health. He was appointed clerk of works and chief architect in the Department of Works and Buildings. He was dismissed in 1878 and moved to Sydney, where he established a successful private business. He continued to design churches, public buildings and business premises, domestic architecture formed only a small portion of his business. By 2017 the property has been sold to Yundi Hua, chairman of the Shanghai Minhang Real Estate Development Company, who are said to be planning to land-bank the property and complete its restoration begun under previous owner, Graham Windridge and the late Fred Grotto.SMH, 27-28/1/2017  Description  ;Grounds/ estate: zoned Rural 1A(1) under Interim Development Order No. 93.

Glenleigh is an extremely important element in the landscape as seen from the Mulgoa Road, Western Freeway and western railway.AHC, 1978 Two drives approach the house, the front drive from Mulgoa Road to the north, and a back drive from the east off Mulgoa Road, climbing more sharply up the elevated ridge on which the house and outbuildings are sited. These buildings given their elevation and west, north and easterly aspects, have commanding views of the Nepean Gorge, Blue Mountains and Penrith Valley. The drive approaches the house complex from Mulgoa Road to the east. Approached by the original drive of olives & pines. The driveway from Mulgoa Road was originally fenced and lined with stone pines (Pinus pinea) and some Japanese black pines (P.thunbergii) some of which still remain.Read, Stuart, pers. comm., 11/2007 A large garden surrounds the house with some intact remnants of an elaborate 19th century garden layout and details. It contains some notable plants including a large Queensland kauri pine (Agathis robusta), large camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), several Chir or Himalayan pines (Pinus roxburghii) to the north, several stone pines (P.pinea) to the north and lining the front or northern drive. Significant plantings of dwarf to medium- sized conifers and other elements have occurred since the 1980s and 1990s including a blue spruce (Picea pungens 'Glauca') north of the house, a golden Conybeare cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa 'Saligna Aurea') west of the house, a formal garden of dwarf conifers south-west of the house, a rose arbor allee in a similar location, a weeping mulberry (Morus nigra 'Pendula') south of the house, a golden rain tree (Koelreuteria paniculata) south of the aviary. A small trial macadamia (M.integrifolia cv.) orchard has been established along with a commercial nursery south of the house.Read, Stuart, pers.comm., 11/2007 and 8/2008 visits ;House: Scottish baronial two-storey house with more austere service wing.

Some have marble, tiled and engraved brass fireplaces, original plaster and stencilled wall and ceiling finishes, rendered walls, cedar joinery and panelling. The interior decoration has been attributed to Lyon, Cottier & Co. Ewan was exposed to the company's work on a number of other occasions. This, together with the not inconsiderable similarities to the Company's other commissions, is given as evidence. \\"Glenleigh\\" is decorated in the fashionable style of the Company, which arose out of the Pre-Raphaelite and Arts and Crafts Movement. A more detailed description of the interior decoration is available in Mariette (2003). ;Outbuildings: Group of three Victorian domestic buildings, all extremely well constructed and in almost original condition.

Heritage listing  As at 27 August 2008, Glenleigh is significant as the home of prominent merchant James Ewan and his family. The house, in the Scottish farmhouse vernacular style, displays Ewan's Scottish heritage, as well as his private nature. The house is significant as a rare example of the domestic work of architect W. W. Wardell, who was favoured by the Sydney rising middle class of the 1880s. The lavish interior decoration, probably by the firm of Lyons, Cottier and Co., was for private appreciation. The work of the decorating Company is of State significance in its own right, as one of the most complete and well preserved examples of the Company's work. While in the form of a country villa, \\"Glenleigh\\" is unusual, being constructed and used as a primarily place of residence for the Ewan family. Glenleigh Estate was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. 'Glenleigh' is of state significant through its associations with James Ewan, prominent merchant and director of Frazer and Co. - a successful wholesale grocery business, which grew into a substantial mercantile import company. The Ewan family made a substantial contribution to the establishment of the Nepean Cottage Hospital, today the Nepean District Hospital. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The interior decoration of \\"Glenleigh\\" is of state significance as a rare intact example of interior decoration of the 1880s, probably by the firm of Lyon, Cottier & Co. The opulence of the decoration is in keeping with the Arts and Crafts movement. Devotes were drawn from the educated middle-classes and \\"Glenleigh\\" exemplifies the taste of this class. 'Glenleigh' Scottish farmhouse vernacular style is significant as a departure from the Italianate style chosen by the majority of the wealthy for their dwellings. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. A rare domestic example of W. W. Wardell's iconic designs. The interiors of \\"Glenleigh\\" are of state significance as a rare surviving example of Arts and Crafts style decoration. Examples of Lyon, Cottier & Co.s interior decorations are not altogether rare, what distinguishes \\"Glenleigh\\" is the extent of the preservation.

It was designed by James Fraser, the existing lines branch and the New South Wales Government Railways. It was built in 1907, with fabrication by R. Tulloch & Co.; and erection by day labour. It is also known as Emu Plains (Nepean River) Underbridge and Penrith (Nepean River) Underbridge. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 June 2013.  History  The Main West Railway Line runs from Granville to Bourke and was completed in 1885. By 1900 certain sections of John Whitton's single track railway network were operating at or near saturation, these included the famous Zig Zag near Lithgow, the Main West from Emu Plains right through to Bathurst, the Main South from Picton as far as Harden and the Main North between Maitland and Muswellbrook. Also, the metropolitan railways were congested by the combination of suburban and freight traffic. The Line was duplicated through Lithgow to Bowenfels in 1891 and then onto Wallerawang in 1922. Pratt trusses were introduced to Australia from the United States in 1892 with the construction of the light- rail Yass Tramway. Thereafter they became the standard for Main Line railways for spans over . While previous forms of truss had lent themselves to construction from timber, with stocky timber sections with good compressive and buckling resistance forming the diagonal members, the Pratt Truss reversed the direction of load in the diagonal members, enabling light rods or flat bars to be used in tension, making steel trusses highly efficient. The New South Wales Railways continued to employ the use of steel Pratt trusses for major bridge crossings until the advent of reinforced and prestressed concrete in the 1970s. The original railway, of the John Whitton era, crossed this river in 1867 on a massive wrought iron girder bridge. It was built for double track but only ever carried a single track with the adjacent space used for single lane road traffic. By the turn of the century, single line working was inadequate for the increasing traffic and the old bridge would not be strong enough for the steady increase in locomotive sizes and weight. Additional river piers in the river, as was done upstream at Menangle, was not considered appropriate so the decision was made to build a new heavy duty truss bridge and let the old bridge be used for two-way road traffic. That is still the current arrangement. James Fraser, a future Commissioner, designed the new bridge as a series of double-track, American Pratt trusses for double the locomotive weights so as to allow for future increases without building another expensive replacement. Fraser joined the New South Wales Government Railways and Tramways in 1881 and rose to be engineer-in-chief for existing lines (1903‚Äì14), assistant-commissioner for railways (1914‚Äì16), chief railway commissioner (1917‚Äì29) and transport commissioner (1931‚Äì32). He was largely responsible for beginning the electrification of Sydney's suburban network and for the first stages of the city railway. His 1907 bridge is still in use, carrying modern heavy diesel locomotives and heavy wagons of coal and wheat. Fabrication by the local firm of R. Tulloch & Co. proved the capacity home steelworks to handle projects of such magnitude that later enable them to supply all the bridges for the North Coast Railway 1911-23. Instead of a forest of temporary staging in a flood prone river, Fraser chose to build the trusses continuously, from one bank to the other, over the piers and two intermediate timber trestles within each span. When completed, the linking members over the piers were removed and the bridge became five independent spans.  Description  Five span, double track, riveted steel American-style Pratt through-truss railway bridge, with one and four spans between brick piers. The 1867 Whitton era Victoria bridge is adjacent.  Condition  As at 8 December 2009, the bridge is in good condition with the following defects: crack in caisson, minor corrosion and pitting in truss chords, stringers, connections and bracing members, and splitting transoms. The Nepean River Underbridge is of high integrity, retaining its original fabric in a good condition.  Modifications and dates  *1961: Service pipes added. *1995: Safety platform and walkway added.  Heritage listing  The 1907 Nepean River Underbridge is significant as one of the largest steel truss bridges in NSW, and remains the oldest truss bridge still in use in the metropolitan area, with a continuous railway use for over 100 years. The bridge is an imposing landmark structure over a major waterway and is an excellent example of a railway Pratt truss underbridge. Its significance is enhanced by its location adjacent to the 1867 Whitton era railway bridge which together demonstrate the evolution of railway bridge design from British railway technology from the mid 19th century through to the change to American technology of the early 20th century. The bridge is significant for its historical associations with James Fraser, Chief Railway Commissioner of the NSW Railways (1917‚Äì29) and Transport Commissioner (1931‚Äì32), who was responsible for the design of the bridge during his role as Engineer-in-Chief for existing lines (1903‚Äì14). The bridge was constructed as part of the duplication of the Main West Line and used innovative construction techniques to avoid interruption of the construction programme in case of severe flooding. The bridge is also significant as its fabrication by the local firm of R. Tulloch & Co. which proved the capacity of local steelworks to handle projects of such magnitude, with the bridge becoming a benchmark for railway bridge construction throughout NSW. Emu Plains Underbridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 June 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Nepean River Underbridge has historical significance as part of the duplication of the Main West Line, one of the major lines on the NSW rail network. The bridge remains the oldest steel truss bridge in use in the metropolitan area, and has had a continuous railway use for over 100 years. Fabrication of the bridge by the local firm of R. Tulloch & Co. proved the capacity of local steelworks to handle projects of such magnitude that later enabled them to supply all the bridges for the North Coast Railway 1911-23. The bridge became a benchmark for railway bridge construction throughout NSW. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The bridge has historical associations with James Fraser, who was responsible for the design of the bridge during his role as engineer-in-chief for existing lines (1903‚Äì14). Fraser was also chief railway commissioner (1917‚Äì29) of the NSW Railways and transport commissioner (1931‚Äì32). James Fraser's design philosophy of building for future demand resulted in a durable, cost effective structure. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Nepean River Underbridge has aesthetic and technical significance due to its length, long spans, and its location adjacent to the 1867 Whitton era Victoria Bridge (both bridges being fine examples of railway viaduct construction) provides significant landmark quality. The bridge is also one of the largest truss bridges in NSW. The Nepean River Underbridge has technical significance as the construction technique employed was a technical innovation that avoided the potential for serious interruption due to floods. Instead of using temporary staging in a flood prone river, the designer chose to build the trusses continuously, from one bank to the other, over the piers and two intermediate timber trestles within each span. When completed, the linking members over the piers were removed and the bridge became five independent spans. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Nepean River Underbridge has research significance as the two parallel bridges demonstrate the evolution of railway bridge construction design during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Nepean River Underbridge is an excellent representative example of a Pratt truss railway viaduct construction, a technology introduced to the NSW rail network with the changeover to American bridge technology in 1892.

He was Bishop of Iquique from 2006 to 2012. When appointed at the age of 42, he was the youngest bishop in the history of Chile. Accusations that he had sexually abused minors forced his resignation in 2012. Civil procedures concluded when prosecutors could not establish a case against him, but church proceedings ended with his removal from the clerical state in 2018.  Biography  √ìrdenes was born in Iquique on 29 October 1964. After obtaining a degree in obstetrics and childcare at the University of Tarapac√°, he entered the Pontifical Major Seminary of Santiago de Chile, where he completed his philosophical and theological studies, earning a bachelor's degree in theology. On 14 December 1996 he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Iquique. There he was Rector of the Marian Shrine of \\"La Tirana\\", Director of the Lay School of Formation and Diocesan Secretary for the Pastoral Coordination. After Iquique's Bishop Juan Barros Madrid was transferred the Military Ordinariate of Chile, √ìrdenes became Diocesan Administrator on 17 November 2004. On 23 October 2006, Pope Benedict XVI named him Bishop of Iquique. When made a bishop at the age of 42 he was the youngest bishop ever appointed in Chile. He received his episcopal consecration on 18 November from Francisco Javier Err√°zuriz Ossa. While bishop he supported the reconstruction of churches and parish buildings that were destroyed by the earthquake that hit the Tarapac√° Region in June 2005. On 2 October 2012, Rodrigo Pino charged publicly that Ordenes had repeatedly abused him sexually when he was as young as 15 and an acolyte at the Iquique cathedral. Pino asked only that Ordenes be removed from the priesthood. By then the Apostolic Nuncio to Chile, Archbishop Ivo Scapolo, had conducted a four-month-long church investigation and sent his findings to the Vatican. On 3 October Scapolo asked Ordenes to resign and to avoid publicity while his case was reviewed. Instead Ordenes gave a newspaper interview that appeared three days later. He said that whatever he did with Pino he had done nothing \\"not with a minor\\" (no con un menor de edad). On 8 October 2012, √ìrdenes submitted his resignation as Bishop of Iquique citing health problems and Pope Benedict XVI accepted it the next day. √ìrdenes was not seen in public in Iquique on 14 November 2013 when he presided at his mother's funeral in the La Tirana shrine. As of 2018, he was reported to be living \\"a life of penitence and prayer\\" in Peru. On 26 January 2018, civil prosecutors dismissed their case against Ordenes after determining they could not verify the charges against him. Ordenes never complied with a subpoena requiring him to submit to questioning. On 11 October 2018, Pope Francis laicized √ìrdenes \\"as a consequence manifest abuse of minors\\". He is no longer a priest and cannot appeal that decision.

Despite being notorious for his erratic behavior and abuse of power, he was highly influential, held important army commands, and served as long-time chairman of the Ugandan Military Tribunal, a military court used by Amin to try and eliminate political dissidents and rivals. By commanding an unauthorized attack on Tanzania in October 1978, Butabika was responsible for the outbreak of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War which ultimately resulted in his death in combat, probably during or shortly before the Fall of Kampala.  Biography   Early life and 1971 coup  Butabika reportedly convinced Idi Amin (pictured) at gunpoint to become President of Uganda during the 1971 Ugandan coup d'√©tat. Born as Juma Ali Oka Rokoni, Butabika was of Nubian‚ÄìKakwa descent, and a grandson of Kakwa paramount chief Sultan Ali Kenyi Dada as well as the cousin of Idi Amin's father. Having completed only a few years of primary education, he was reportedly illiterate. At some point, Butabika joined the Uganda Army, and rose to second lieutenant during the rule of Milton Obote. Over time, dissatisfaction grew among parts in the military about Obote's government, resulting in a conspiracy to remove him from power. Butabika joined the conspirators, and their coup was planned at his house. The initial plan was to blow up Obote's plane at the Entebbe International Airport on 24 January 1971, but Butabika's wife informed her brother-in-law Ahmad Oduka, Senior Superintendent of Police, of the plot. He was supposed to be among those on the plane, and his sister-in-law urged him to stay at home on that day to save his life. Oduka, however, was loyal to the government and informed Minister of Internal Affairs Basil Kiiza Bataringaya. Though the assassination of Obote was prevented, the putschists still managed to launch a coup d'√©tat on 25 January 1971. They overthrew the government, but then became unsure about the further course of action. Amin was initially reluctant to assume the presidency, whereupon Butabika reportedly threatened him at gunpoint to accept his appointment as President of Uganda. Meanwhile, Butabika's wife had fled the capital out of fear that her informing Oduka of the putschists' plan would have repercussions. Soon after the coup, Butabika was involved in the kidnapping and murder of two United States citizens around July 1971, namely journalist Nicholas Stroh and Makerere University lecturer Robert Siedle. The two had tried to gather information on unrest and mutinies that had broken out among some Ugandan military units as result of Amin's seizure of power.  Career under the Amin regime   Abuse of power and army commands  Butabika became one of leading military figures under the new regime. Despite this, he was widely considered insane in Uganda, even by his own colleagues in the military. He was notorious for his eccentric, \\"erratic\\" and excessive behavior, including extreme brutality. According to George Ivan Smith, Butabika believed himself to be a \\"demi-god\\" as the government allowed him to kill and torture at will, while Peter Jeremy Allen described him as \\"merciless psychopathic killer\\" of \\"low mentality\\". Similarly, businessman Gordon Wavamunno had a very negative opinion of Butabika, and regarded him as one of those who \\"were intoxicated with unlimited and irresponsible power, and did not hesitate to abuse it at the slightest opportunity or excuse.\\" The nickname by which he is best known stemmed from his extreme behavior: \\"Butabika\\" is the name of a prominent psychiatric clinic near Kampala, and a byword for people with a mental illness in Uganda. Promoted to lieutenant colonel, Butabika served as commander of \\"elite\\" units that were regarded as especially loyal to Amin, including the Chui Battalion and the Malire Battalion. As time went on, elements in the military grew dissatisfied with Amin's regime. Brigadier Charles Arube was among those who felt sidelined, and organised a meeting of high-ranking commanders in March 1974. Butabika was present, and offered Arube his help in cases where he felt ignored by the president. Soon after, Arube attempted to oust Amin in a coup d'√©tat. The Malire Battalion mutinied and joined the coup, but Butabika stayed loyal to Amin. In the end, Arube's coup failed.  The Military Tribunal  Despite his extremely limited education, Butabika was also appointed as chairman of the \\"Military Tribunal\\" in 1973. The Military Tribunal had been set up by Amin to circumvent regular courts and enforce his decisions; it thus had the reputation to \\"rubber-stamp[ ] Amin's death sentences\\". According to Amnesty International, the tribunals Butabika chaired were de facto kangaroo courts and passed judgements without regard to laws or proper procedure. He often improvised sentences on the spot. Most prominently, he acquitted several senior military figures who were accused of involvement in the forced disappearance of 18 prominent Ugandans. In contrast, Butabika passed extremely harsh judgements where opponents to the regime were concerned, earning a reputation as \\"one of Amin's chief executioners\\". One Ugandan dissident noted that the Lieutenant Colonel's tribunals generally resulted in the death of the accused; they were either executed or released, only to be rounded up and murdered by Uganda's secret service, the State Research Bureau. Butabika chaired several prominent tribunals, such as when he sentenced British author Denis Hills to death in 1975 for calling Amin a \\"village tyrant\\". Two years later, he chaired the tribunal that sentenced 12 men to death for conspiring to murder Amin; this trial in particular was described as \\"travesty of justice, a 'show', since the conventions and pleas of guilt were obtained by force from the accused\\". He did, however, acquit Wod Okello Lawoko, senior manager of Radio Uganda, after the latter had fallen out of favor with Amin and been arrested on charges of treason. Though Butabika was once dismissed as chairman on one tribunal for misconduct, namely corruption in late 1976, he was later reinstated.  Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War and death  Map of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War, including the territory captured by the Uganda Army during the invasion of Tanzania (dark blue) By 1978, hostilities had greatly increased between Uganda and the neighboring state of Tanzania, with reports surfacing of invasion plans by the Tanzania People's Defence Force. Butabika was among the proponents of a preemptive strike against Tanzania, even though several other leading Ugandan officers believed that their military was not ready for a conflict with Tanzania. The situation escalated on 9 October 1978, when an altercation broke out between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian border guards. One of Amin's close advisors, Colonel Abdu Kisuule, later claimed that the entire incident had been orchestrated by Butabika to gain \\"favors and cheap popularity\\" from the president. According to this version, the Ugandan soldier who caused the altercation had been Butabika's brother-in-law, and his death in a shootout with Tanzanians caused Butabika to seek revenge. Others however report that the exact identity of the Ugandan soldier remains unknown, and that Butabika was lied to by his subordinates about the course of events; in that case, it is possible that he actually believed that Tanzanian border guards had initiated hostilities. In any case, Butabika consequently ordered an unauthorized attack on Tanzania, resulting in the outbreak of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War. His forces easily overran the Tanzanian troops stationed at Mutukula and Minziro, whereupon he telephoned Amin, claiming that Tanzania had launched an attack and that he had responded with a counter-attack. The president had already been eager to annex Tanzanian territory, and allowed the invasion to proceed. Reinforced by other UA detachments, Butabika occupied the entire Kagera salient (northern Kagera Region) until stopping at Kyaka Bridge, which was destroyed. The UA troops proceeded to celebrate while looting, raping and murdering in the occupied area. The Tanzanian military quickly regrouped, causing the UA to retreat back into Uganda even as President Amin declared Kagera's annexation. The Tanzanians launched a large counter-offensive, and the Ugandan military soon started to disintegrate under the onslaught. By the time the Ugandan border town Mutukula fell to the Tanzanian army in January 1979, Butabika was back in Kampala and prepared the celebrations for the 8th anniversary of Amin's rule. The lieutenant colonel took part in a parade at Kololo on 25 January, where he and other high-ranking commanders performed a traditional Nubian dance. One Ugandan later commented that when he saw the dancing officers on live television, he realised that his country's leadership \\"did not know what exactly was going on\\" in regard to the war. Butabika died in combat during the later stages of the war, though it is disputed when and where he was killed. According to an article by the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor, he died during the Fall of Kampala. On 10 April 1979, the Tanzanian forces and their UNLF allies entered the city, encountering only light resistance. Butabika was reportedly one of the few leading Ugandan commanders who stayed in the city, and was killed in a firefight with Tanzanian soldiers of the 205th and 208th Brigades in the Bwaise-Kawempe area as they attempted to secure the northern section of the city on 11 April. In contrast, Tanzanian journalist Baldwin Mzirai wrote in his 1980 account of the war, Kuzama kwa Idi Amin, that Butabika was killed at a Tanzanian roadblock on the Bombo road on 7 April 1979.  Personal life  Butabika was a Muslim, though he also believed in magic. One observer described him as \\"short and small [...] bully\\" who enjoyed challenging \\"far more strongly-built men\\" for fights. He was married to a Ugandan woman of the Baziba tribe.

It was designed by George Allen Mansfield and built from 1878 to 1879 by James Evans. It is also known as Upper Castlereagh Public School and residence. The property is owned by New South Wales Minister for Community Services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The land on which the school building is sited was originally part of the of Portion 54, granted to Edward Field in 1803. This block was donated by the family for the purpose of building the school.Penrith Lakes Scheme - Regional Environmental Study - History of European Settlement 1983 (pp 43-44). The school symbolises the basic decision of the State to provide public education for all children as distinct from Church connected education. School in the church hall opposite ceased forthwith and for just under 100 years this single room school was the centre of basic education for children at Upper Castlereagh.Udy, 1999 James Rutledge arrived in Castlereagh in 1840, employed as a school teacher, but he was also a lay preacher. As these two activities needed to be provided in one building his first ambition was to build a church. The church on Old Castlereagh Road, which opened in 1847, remains the oldest Wesleyan church in Australia. For James and his wife Lucy (granddaughter of two convicts: they married in 1842) this church represented everything they held dear. James declared that to him, it \\"was hallowed ground\\". The Rutledge family was not Irish but had been in Ireland for 200 years. Before that they lived on the English-Scottish border giving allegiance to neither monarchy, but to their family name only. The Rutledges were devout Protestants. The descendants of three Rutledge brothers who moved to Ireland with Oliver Cromwell, driving Catholics from their farms (having had Cromwell sack Rutledge Castle in England), were deeply-religious Wesleyans. Ministers of the church were present in every generation. It was James Rutledge's intention to be an ordained Minister but this opportunity was lost when he left Ireland to come to New South Wales.Wilcox, 2016, 3  Description  School/Chapel A simple rectangular hall with attached side entry porch typical of rural public schools of the period. Gothic revival in form and detailing the building features steeply pitched gables with timber barge boards, braces and finials, together with simply stepped buttresses to the porch walls and Tudor arched entrance. Major finishes include face brickwork to walls, stone basecourse, sills and buttress dressings and contrasting rubbed brick heads to windows and entrance porch. The roof is corrugated iron sheeting. Windows are boarded over, the main entry door is timber, framed and sheeted. Out buildings associated with the main school building included the original brick privy. Schoolmaster's residence A simple Victorian painted brick cottage with hipped corrugated iron roofs to main structure and front verandah. Extant original windows are 2 x 6 pane double hung sashes. Chimneys to main residence and service wing feature simple corbelled brickwork tops and strings.  Condition  As at 23 July 2002, The physical condition of the school and residence is poor with problems such as rusting or roof iron, gutters and downpipes and deterioration of exposed timber elements and painted finishes: # Restored school to be used for community seminars - by school children and adults; and # Residence to be used by caretaker/guide for the heritage precinct on both sides of Castlereagh Road.  Modifications and dates  Boarded timber lean to added to school (south elevation) plus additional slated timber lean to at rear of house. Unsympathetic additions and original details in evidence.  Further information  The significance of the sites as representative of important early personages and social patterns in the Castlereagh area should be retained. This historical/social, cultural significance is, in large measure, associated with the site through verbal transfer of information and the evidence of documentary sources. Physical elements that represents aspects of this significance include site boundary demarcation elements (early fences and tree planting). Opposite the site are elements erected for a special social purpose of importance to the area as a whole (eg the original weatherboard school and its later replacement, the church, Castlereagh Road etc). The continuing use of a site for functions is a means of preserving its historical significance.  Heritage listing  As at 25 January 2013, this group of items has strong associations at a state level with the beginnings of the Wesleyan movement in Australia, and the construction of the first Methodist Church in Australia. The development of the education system at the local level is represented by the education facilities. The establishment of the first Wesleyan chapel in Australia is a significant contribution to the historical development of the area, in association with the constribution of two early schools to cater to the valley population. The retention of part of the original layout of the Upper Castlereagh township, particularly as it related, and continues to relate, to Castlereagh Road at a local level adds to the significance of the place. This is a highly significant cultural landscape of state heritage significance (as a whole).ERM, 2001 First school in the area conducted in Chapel opposite from 1840. Then transferred to public school 1878 under control of NSW Department of Education. School and cottage designed by G. A. Mansfield, one of the prominent architects of the 19th century. School is part of a heritage precinct located opposite.Castlereagh Cultural Landscape Study, 1999 Of local significance for its role in the education of many early residents.Fox & Associates, 1987. Local significance due to the association with the early development of this scattered rural community. Upper Castlereagh Public School was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The school is a visible reminder of the decision to establish public schools in the nineteenth century. It is a sample of Mansfield's work at the same time he was planning Prince Alfred Hospital. Together with the Chapel, Hall and Cemetery, the School forms an historic heritage precinct. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Constructed of brick with a steep corrugated iron gabled roof, the school room and brick residence are features of the development of this rural community. They form a part of the early Church/School precinct at Upper Castlereagh. The sites are aesthetically pleasing and harmonious in their immediate physical settings and for the aesthetic character of individual grouped elements viewed from within the sites. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. In conjunction with the 19th century Chapel, Hall and Cemetery opposite, this is now classed as a \\"heritage precinct\\". As a contemporary community by using residential Academy opposite for educational purposes: spiritual purposes and social purposes there will be a continuous flow of people.

Kronstadt and Petrograd in 1917 The newspaper was printed daily in 5,000-10,000 copies. Golos Pravdy was one of the first legal Bolshevik newspapers to appear outside of Petrograd after the February Revolution. The local groups of the Bolshevik Party had raised funds (up to 4,000 Russian Rubles by ) and they hired a private printing press. On Fyodor Raskolnikov (a student at the Marine Academy and veteran Bolshevik journalist) arrived in Kronstadt to become the editor-in-chief of Golos Pravdy and was put in command of the local party committee. Other editors of Golos Pravdy included Boris Zhemchuzhin, Pyotr Smirnov and Sernion Roshal. The Bolshevik activists of Kronstadt distributed Golos Pravdy among sailors of the Baltic Fleet, soldiers at the military garrison and workers at the gun powder factory on the island. Golos Pravdy routinely reprinted materials from the main Bolshevik newspaper Pravda, including speeches and articles by Lenin, Kalinin and Stalin and materials from the 7th All Russian Party Conference (April Theses). The newspaper also frequently carried letter written by local residents and resolutions from meetings of sailors, soldiers and workers. Within the party, the editorial line of Golos Pravdy belonged to the moderate camp which opposed the call for an immediate overthrow of the Provisional Government. Whilst Golos Pravdy and the Bolshevik representatives in the Kronstadt Soviet were part of the moderate Bolshevik camp, the Kronstadt Bolshevik Party Committee was aligned with the radicals in the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee and the Vyborg Bolshevik Party District.

IWRG has held their Castillo del Terror show since 2005, usually late in the year. As with the majority of the IWRG shows it took place at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, the home of IWRG. The main event was the eponymous Castillo del Terror Steel cage match where the last person eliminated would be forced to unmasked per the Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", stipulation. Background Starting as far back as at least 2002, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a fall show, around the Mexican Day of the Death, under the name El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\"), or IWRG Prisi√≥n Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Castillo del Terror shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2017 Castillo del Terror show was the 13th year in a row that IWRG has promoted a show under that name. Event The El Castillo del Terror show featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed themselves as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in wrestling matches. The semi-main event match was a six-man tag team match with the team of Black Warrior, Capo del Sur, and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. taking on the trio of Mr. Electro, Trauma II, and Villano V Jr. During the match Vilano V Jr. accidentally hit Mr. Electro, leading to their team losing the match. Afterward, Mr. Electro attacked Villano V Jr. with a steel folding chair, only for Villano V Jr.'s uncle Ray Mendoza Jr. and his brother Kaving came to his rescue, running off Mr. Electro. For the 2017 version of the El Castillo del Terror match 10 wrestlers put their mask on the line in the main event steel cage match; Black Drag√≥n, Capo del Norte, La Mosca, Oficial Spartan, Tortuga Leo, Trauma I, Violencia Jr. and Warrior Jr. For the first ten minutes of the match, none of the wrestlers were allowed to leave the cage. Once the ten minutes were up competitors could escape the cage by climbing up the side and over the top of the cage to safety. Eight wrestlers climbed out, leaving only Oficial Spartan and Black Drag√≥n. At that point in time Spartan's tag team partner, Oficial Rayan came to the ring with a steel chair in hand. While not officially part of the match, Rayan climbed into the cage to help Spartan out. The two attacked Black Drag√≥n, even trying to handcuff him to the steel cage to make it easy for Spartan to leave the cage. In the end, Black Drag√≥n avoided the handcuffs and managed to climb out of the cage before either Los Oficiales Elite members could stop him. After the match, Oficial Spartan unmasked and revealed that his real name was Victor Montes Martinez, that he was 43 years old and had been a wrestler for 23 years at that point. After his unmasking it was confirmed that he had previously wrestled under the ring names \\"Omega\\" and \\"Arlequ√≠n Rojo\\" and been unmasked.

As demand for places increased additional facilities were required and it became necessary to augment capacity by establishing the Coppice Lunatic Hospital in 1859 and the Mapperley Asylum in 1880. The facility eventually reached a state of decay and after services transferred to Saxondale Hospital near Radcliffe-on-Trent, the hospital closed in 1902.

The show was the 10th year in a row that IWRG has held a Guerra del Golfo show, which usually takes places in the early spring, around March or April. The eponymous Guerra del Golfo tournament consists of three matches in total, with two \\"qualifying matches\\", multi-man steel cage matches where the last person left in the cage is \\"punished\\" by advancing to the main event of the night. The two losers were then be forced to wrestle inside the steel cage under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. For the 2017 \\"Guerra del Golfo\\" Freelance lost the main event match to M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and Veneno despite not originally being part of the match. On the undercard Herodes Jr. successfully defended the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship against El Hijo de Pirata Morgan. The show featured three additional matches. Production Background The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has a long-standing history of holding major event focused on a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. In 2005 IWRG created a specific spring-time show promoting the steel cage match concept under the name Guerra del Golfo, or \\"Gulf War\\", referring to the Gulf of Mexico (not the Gulf War in the middle east). The Guerra del Golfo shows featured two \\"qualifying\\" multi-man steel cage matches where the loser would later be forced to face off against each other in the main event of the show. In the final cage match the two wrestlers would wrestle where the loser would be forced to either unmask or, if they are not wearing a mask, have his hair shaved off. The use of the steel cage in three matches distinguishes the Guerra del Golfo event from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\"), or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The first two Guerra del Golfo steel cage matches are contested under elimination match rules, which means wrestlers escape the cage by climbing over the top of the steel cage to the floor. The last wrestler in the cage will be put in the final match of the night. Unlike the first two steel cage matches the final match is normally contested under pinfall rules. At the 2012'Guerra del Golfo the final match ended up differently than announced. Oficial Factor and Oficial 911 were supposed to face off one on one, but Factor's teammates Oficial Rayan and Oficial Spartan as well as Oficial 911's teammates Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro all climbed into the cage to turn it into an elimination match. In the end Oficial AK-47 lost the match, despite not originally being in the match. The Guerra del Golfo shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and is their home arena, with the group rarely venturing outside of Naucalpan. The 2017 Guerra del Golfo show was the eleventh IWRG promoted a show under that name, and the tenthyear in a row since becoming an annual event from 2008 forwardand the eleventh Guerra del Golfo show owing to IWRG holding two events in 2009. Prior to the 2017 event four wrestlers had lost their masks; Ultra Mega, Tortuguillo Ninja I, Destroyer, and Astro, while seven wrestlers were shaved bald; Cerebro Negro, Arlequ√≠n Rojo, Chico Che (twice), Oficial AK-47 (twice), and Danny Casas. Event The Guerra del Golfo event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Super Mega was originally booked for the first of the two Guerra del Golfo steel cage matches, but for unexplained reasons, Gringo Loco returned to IWRG after an over six-year absence to compete in the match. For the first match Apolo Estrada Jr., Freelance, El Hijo del Diablo, Gringo Loco, and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. risked their hair, while Pantera I, Tortuga Mike and Trauma I risked their mask. In the end, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. lost the match and was forced to compete in the main event. In the second \\"Guerra del Golfo\\" qualifying steel cage match the referee ejected Hip Hop Man from the match, stating that he did not have enough hair to risk. In his place El Hijo del Alebrije was added to the match. Veneno, Black Terry and Cerebro Negro risked their hair, while El Diablo Jr., Emperador Azteca, Golden Magic, El Hijo del Alebrije, Imposible, Trauma II, and Villano IV defended their mask in the cage. In the end. Veneno ended up being left in the cage, which meant he had to risk his hair in the main event of the night. The main event match started out with Veneno and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. fighting in the cage, with both wrestlers trying to escape the cage to win the match. At one point Veneno was almost at the top of the cage when Freelance unexpectedly entered the arena and prevented Veneno from leaving the cage. Moments later Freelance climbed in the ring to attack Veneno, only for both Veneno and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. leaving the cage. As a result, the referee decided that Freelance would be shaved bald despite not originally being in the match.

Two of them expanded their setup by adding Gajiƒá, who was also a neighborhood teenage friend who possessed some basic musical knowledge having attended a music school. Though, by Jankoviƒá's own admission, Gajiƒá played the piano better than him, Gajiƒá decided to switch over to flute as an homage to his favorite band Jethro Tull. He managed to become comfortable on a new instrument fairly quickly, soon becoming a bit of a musical authority among this now three-piece. Gajiƒá performed with Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje around Sarajevo for two years before beginning to record material for a debut album during fall 1983. The shambolic recording process took seven months before the album named Das ist Walter got released by Jugoton in April 1984 in the small print of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label's extremely low commercial expectations. Though the album was initially released in the small print, the final count was 100,000 copies sold, setting a record for exceeding the initial release by 30 times. In Autumn 1984, they embarked on a 60-concert nationwide concert tour, making them one of the biggest Yugoslav rock attractions after just one album. In the mid-1980s Gajiƒá worked on two more album. The second studio album Dok ƒçeka≈° sabah sa ≈°ejtanom (English: While you're awaiting dawn with the devil) is released through Jugoton on June 11, 1985 and the third Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari () is released through his hometown based record label Diskoton in 1987.

It was built from 1809 to 1868. It is also known as Glenmore Heritage Valley Golf and Country Club. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1809-16 the Luttrell family were granted land in the Mulgoa Valley, and sold this in 1815-16 to neighbour William Cox. Also in 1809 an adjoining of land were granted to William Cox - and used for pastoralism, had fine orchards and vineyards. Between 1816 and 1852 the Cox family had strong associations with Glenmore. The father William Cox retained Glenmore until 1817, conveying it then to his fourth son George. His brother Henry Cox bought the lands off George in 1823 at the time of his marriage, and is most closely associated with the property. In 1825 Henry gained another grant from William and George sold Henry a grant he had acquired in 1815 from Thomas Hobby. In 1824-25 Glenmore homestead appears to have been built, on the former grant of Robert Luttrell. It was the principal home of Henry Cox and family and head station of his pastoral estates. By 1825 Henry had a large estate with fertile and well watered land between Mulgoa Creek and the Nepean River. Convicts were used to clear the holding. It was used as a holding farm for animals from his other lands west of the Blue Mountains, on their way to the markets in Sydney.Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1997 Glenmore was a busy centre for many years, with grape vines, wheat, corn, alfalfa and all kinds of horse and cattle feed and sheep roaming the homestead.Nepean District Historical Society, 2014 In 1845-5 the first homestead was built for Henry Cox. In 1850 Heny Cox had his sheep transferred to a property he had purchased at Broombee between Mudgee and Bathurst. The family moved there in 1851. In 1852 Glenmore was sold to his half-brother, Alfred Cox, who in 1853 sold it to merchant Thomas Sutcliffe Mort. Between 1852 and was the Riley family association with Glenmore (the Rileys were already leasing land in the Mulgoa Valley). In 1854 T. S. Mort sold Glenmore to James Riley (who was later to become the first Mayor of Penrith, in 1871). The estate was developed as his private home. In the 1860s land use changed in the area from pastoralism to fruit growing and dairying, particularly with the arrival of the railway to Penrith in 1863 and thus ready access of products to the city markets. In the eastern wing of the house was added for James Riley. The farm was known (along with Winbourne, Fernhill and the Fairlight Homestead, for the abundance and success of their crops and vineyards. In 1882 James Riley died. His wife and four daughters remained living at Glenmore. In 1891 the estate was put up for sale/rent, noting it was both residence and working farm. including of forest, fattening paddocks, homestead and \\"magnificent\\" grounds, three good dams and a spring at the cottage. In Riley's widow Christina died and his daughters set up a select girls' school in the house. In land acquisition of adjoining land, and land sales of portions by D. Hattersley & C. Holswich, graziers. Hattersley subsequently bought out Holswich. Portions of the estate were sold off during the 1920s - it was reduced to its present boundaries by 1929. In 1926 the earliest plans to use it as a golf club arose, the course opened in 1927 (nine holes, now known as the course's 'back' holes), continuing in the 1930s with a guest house, tennis, horse riding, shooting, swimming, fishing, archery, table tennis and bridge. The valley was increasingly known for its scenery and historic associations. In the 1930s Glenmore operated as golf course and guest house under Mr & Mrs T. O'Rourke, also tennis, horse riding, shooting, swimming, fishing, archery, table tennis and bridge were available. The Mulgoa Valley was increasingly becoming known for its scenery and historic associations. (Winbourne was another key valley guesthouse of this era). In 1937 the Glenmore Country Club purchased the property. In 1938 the Glenmore Country Club added an extra \\"front\\" nine holes to the course. In 1940 the southern part of the estate around the homestead was in use as golf links and the northern part was reserved as grasslands. In 1947 Glenmore and the golf links were bought by Mary Woodland, who leased it as a golf club to a succession of lessees. 1959 Glenmore Golf & Country Club bought the business, Mrs Woodland retained ownership of the land. A liquor licence was granted. In 1975 the property was classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). In 1978 internal additions were made to main homestead including wall stripping, installation of a new bar, enlarging and reconcreting the patio, repainting, and reseeding/dressing the greens. From 1981+ there were at least two changes of owners. Warren Anderson, a property developer from Western Australia, bought Glenmore in 1981, as well as nearby Fernhill, Boomerang in Elizabeth Bay and Tipperary pastoral stations in the Northern Territory.Davies, 2014, 68 From 1982 the Department of Planning conducted a Regional Environmental Study of the Mulgoa Valley, leading to SREP 13 - Mulgoa Valley gazetted in 1987, with an emphasis on the conservation of heritage, natural and landscape values. In 1986 a putting green was constructed. In 1993 the present owners Askhour P/L bought the property, re-roofed and repainted the main house, recorded and demolished a side verandah to the main house, converted former barn to golf pro shop, constructed a fresh water pipeline from the Nepean River, installed a new electrical substation and underground mains, removed Bunya pine tree #2, built new entry gates, driveway, parking areas, amenities building next to existing barn, machinery shed and compound.

Description  Glenmore lies between Mulgoa Road and Mulgoa Creek to the east and west, between two points to the north and south where road and creek are close together, south of Penrith. The land slopes gently upwards from Mulgoa Road to a ridgeline then falls steeply eastwards to the creek. The main homestead is near the site's centre, close to the ridgeline. Views to the house from the road are obstructed partly by landscaping and partly by the original stone barn, to its southwest. A driveway from Mulgoa Road approaches the house and barn through a newly constructed parking area. Remnants of original tree plantings survive, particularly to the northwest of the homestead, together with some of the early hedge plants and trees beside the driveway to the south. The main homestead is U-shaped in plan with the front 2-storey wing facing northeast. The side wing facing northwest has a wine cellar under part of its length, and a disused attic towards its southwest end. A small lean-to on the northwest side was built in c.1920s. The opposite wing is single storey, with an extension at the southwest built c.1970s. *1809 rural land grant with 1824+ homestead. *1868addition, large underground cellar for wine, stone barn, a school from , and post 1920s subdivisions/sales a golf club from 1929 and more recently a function centre.

Secure fence to Mulgoa Road erected to dissuade vandalism  Heritage listing  As at 4 March 2005, Glenmore estate is an integral part of a relatively intact rural landscape developed by the pioneering Cox family in the early years of the colony of New South Wales, and subsequently throughout the 19th century. It is thus a physical record of the development of farming in Australia in general and the Mulgoa Valley in particular. The remnants of early exotic plantings include some of the finest specimens of their species in New South Wales. The existing house and garden remnants at Glenmore are a substantial and rare surviving example of an early 19th century country residence, adapted for changing uses over time. The estate is associated with significant personalities in state and local 19th century history, notably Henry Cox and James Riley. There is archaeological significance in the potential evidence of other buildings and structures on the site. Because of the scarcity of documentary evidence about many aspects of the former homestead, the archaeological resource contains the only remaining evidence. Glenmore has aesthetic values as a landmark on Mulgoa Road since its construction in 1825. The house and barn, associated large trees and setting, are located on a ridge and are visible from many places.general S.o.S., from Orwell & Peter Phillips, 1997 - elements of ranked relative significance, see below, for more detail, see CMP.

It was produced and directed by Dean Hamer, Joe Wilson and Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu. The filmmakers previously explored trans rights in the Pacific in their films Kumu Hina and A Place in the Middle.  Synopsis  Leitis in Waiting is the story of Tonga leitis, native transgender women fighting a rising tide of religious fundamentalism and intolerance in their South Pacific kingdom. They are led by LGBT rights activist Joleen Mataele, who founded the Tonga Leitis Association, which provides support and shelter to transgender women. The film centers on the Miss Galaxy Queen pageant, an annual beauty competition for leitis, and on a national consultation on LGBT rights initiated by Mataele.  Production and release  Dean Hamer and Joe Wilson met Joleen Mataele during a screening of Kumu Hina arranged by her long-time friend Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu. They had originally intended to make a short film about the Miss Galaxy Queen pageant (which was later released as Lady Eva), but expanded the project when Joleen Mataele launched a national discussion in 2016 on LGBT rights in Tonga, documenting the opposition she faced from conservative church groups. Leitis In Waiting was presented at the Documentary Edge Festival's DOC Pitch Competition 2017 as a project-in- development. Hamer has explained that discussion of LGBT in Tonga is often dominated by outside voices from countries like Australia, and that part of the motivation for making the film was to raise the profile of Tongalese voices. He has also cited the continued existence of anti-sodomy laws as an important part of the discussion. ‚ÄúColonial era laws are still on the books in eight Pacific countries. We want to bring more awareness to these issues across the Commonwealth.‚Äù Leitis in Waiting would later have its European premiere at the inaugural Festival of Commonwealth Film. According to Joleen Mataele, the film is a means of speaking plainly and directly to decision makers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted to have a document of the work that we do. This film can help us advocate and make our voices heard internationally. There‚Äôs no substitute for putting your story out there without concealment. We‚Äôre telling it like it is.‚Äù The filmmakers employed an unusual release strategy. Alongside major festival screenings, they screened the film across the Pacific and worked with Pacific LGBT groups to create advocacy events, where the film screening was a means to gather people and resources in different communities. The film was produced in association with Pacific Islanders in Communications and was broadcast on PBS television.

It was designed in a vernacular style and built from 1810 to 1870, possibly by the Andrews family. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Infrastructure, a department of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Very little is known about the history of the site. The timber slab hut appears to be very early, around the turn of the 18th century, and is very likely the original house for the property. The larger, later house is believed to have been built by the Andrews Family, who lived there for approximately 100 years. Nothing is known of the original inhabitants of the hut.  Description  A simple late nineteenth century four roomed cottage, originally of slab construction and now clad in fibro and masonite. The house has a steeply pitched hipped corrugated iron roof, framed with round timbers - \\"pole construction\\" - which indicates the possibility of an earlier construction date than previously thought. The return verandah to 3 sides, which has been reframed, follows the original form. There is a 1950s(?) Patio to the rear. The small windows are double hung and of 6 panes to both the upper and lower sashes, with only one original window surviving. There is a skillion addition to the rear, which houses the kitchen and bathroom. Most of the joinery has been replaced with much poorer quality joinery than the original. There is some original joinery remaining in the front room. All doors have been replaced. An early two roomed slab hut is located at the rear of the house. It is constructed of hand adzed timber slabs, scarfed at the bottoms and set into a bed log. The slabs are battened at the top to a hand hewn log. The barn has squared window openings, each containing a hinged slab \\"shutter\\" with diagonal cross brace. Inside is an early brick cooking fireplace with chimney, indicating the early use of the building as a residence. It has had a small verandah added at a later date. This hut is most likely the original house, with the more substantial house a later expansion/addition.  Condition  As at 26 March 1999, the house has suffered extensive vandalism in recent months, and needs urgent security measures. The Early Slab Hut is substantially intact in its structure, although the interiors have been changed. Rose Cottage has been altered and recent extensive vandalism has reduced its intactness/integrity further.  Modifications and dates  *Reclad in Fibro and Masonite - possibly Inter War period; *Skillion addition to rear - possibly Inter War period; *Reroofed - Not known; *Replacement Windows - Not known; *Replacement Bathroom - c.1950s; *Internal Joinery removed - Not known; *Rear Patio with concrete slab and roof (currently corrugated green plastic) - c.1950s; *Fibro Shed to north side of patio - c.1950s;  Further information  Amendments to the Heritage Act require that the property be included on the State Heritage Register. Appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that this takes place. Stable, long term tenants, acting as care takers, are the best option for the care and protection of this property.  Heritage listing  As at 4 January 1999, Rose Cottage and the slab hut are highly significant for their association with early settlement of the Werrington district and for their continuous residential use by a single family for approximately 100 years. The early two roomed slab hut, located at the rear of the house, is most likely the original house, with the more substantial house a later expansion/addition. The timber slab hut is of very high significance as one of few surviving examples of Old Colonial Rustic Vernacular Architecture in the Sydney Metropolitan Region. Rose Cottage and Early Slab Hut was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Rose Cottage and the Early Slab Hut has State historical significance for its association with the exploration and settlement of Western Sydney and in particular, small village development along the Great Western Highway. The slab hut is of particular significance as a rare surviving example of an early pioneer's residence. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Rose Cottage has aesthetic significance as an example of a mid to late nineteenth century rural cottage. The Early Slab Hut has high aesthetic significance as an example of an early nineteenth century pioneer's residence. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Rose Cottage and the Early Slab Hut has high social significance for its association with the exploration of Western Sydney and the initial development of the Werrington district. They are also significant for their association with the Andrews Family who resided there for approximately 100 years. The site has State significance for its demonstration of a pattern of life which no longer exists, in particular, the lives of the early pioneers of Western Sydney. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Early Slab Hut has exceptionally high technical/research significance for its demonstration of early nineteenth century building techniques, particularly the use of hand adzed timber slabs in construction. Rose Cottage has some technical/research significance for its demonstration of mid to late nineteenth century building techniques. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Early Slab Hut is a rare example of its type in the Sydney Region. Rose Cottage is a somewhat altered rural cottage, relatively uncommon today. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Early Slab Hut is representative of Colonial Rustic Vernacular Architecture. Rose Cottage is representative of nineteenth century farm houses.

It is also known as The Natural Area and Agnes Banks Sand Deposits. The property is owned by CSR Limited and the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Londonderry/Agnes Banks sand deposit was first recognised for its commercial potential in 1942. Sand had been extracted from the deposit for over thirty years, initially under consent from the then Cumberland County Council. Penrith City Council first issued consents in 1967 for the extraction of sand from land held under permissive occupancies from the Crown Lands Office and from land held under private tenure. Penrith Council later realised the need for an overall management framework for the extractive industries and during the mid 1970s formed a working committee consisting of Council, the then Department of Mines, Department of Lands and the extractive industry companies. This committee sought information and produced guidelines for co-ordinating ongoing extraction and rehabilitation within a defined management area. In 1982 after extensive consultation with the community in the locality, sand extraction companies and government agencies, Council adopted in principle the management plan, which, inter alia, addressed management of extraction, drainage, staged extraction and rehabilitation. Regular meetings of the parties were held to ensure compliance with the plan. Comments received from the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service (NPWS) at the time indicated the Service's concern for the inter-relationships between sand extraction and the proposed nature reserve to the south of the management area. As a consequence provision was made for a wide buffer strip between areas designated for extraction and the nature reserve. The nature reserve proposal involved lengthy discussion with government agencies, Council and the extractive industry companies. The proposal was initiated by the Scientific Committee on Parks and Reserves in August 1968. This Committee had advised of the scientific value and uniqueness of the sand areas and of the threat to them posed by sand extraction. In the following years several proposals were advanced by the NPWS and by Benson of the National Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens. Negotiations between the parties continued until a compromise proposal put forward in 1978 by White of P. B. White Minerals (now Pacific Mining Pty. Ltd.) was finally accepted. However the NPWS although accepting the proposal, noted in correspondence to the Department of Lands at the time that the proposal was sub-optimal in area and composition. The Agnes Banks Nature Reserve was proclaimed on 26 March 1982. On the 18 April 1985 two development applications were received by Council which in part were for consent to extract sand adjacent to the Agnes Banks Nature Reserve. The National Trust of Australia (NSW) wrote to Penrith City Council on 23 August 1985 indicating its proposal for the extension of the Nature Reserve to ensure it properly sampled the range of plant communities on the site. On the 26 August 1985, the Trust wrote to the Heritage Council requesting the placing of an interim conservation order (ICO) on the remaining areas of vegetation outside the Nature Reserve. ICO No. 569 was gazetted on 27 September 1985 for a period of two years subsequently ICO No. 800 was gazetted on 18 September 1987. In August, 1987, The Readymix Group, Amatek Limited and K. H. Dixon Pty. Ltd. made a submission by way of objection to the former Minister for Planning and Environment in regard to ICO No. 569. Formal objections to the making of ICO No. 800 dated 5 February 1988 were subsequently received by the Heritage Council. Commissioner Kevin Cleland was appointed to hold an inquiry into the submission by of objection on 25 July 1988 in accordance with Section of the Heritage Act, 1977. A total of twenty seven submissions were received of which fourteen were presented to the inquiry and a further six were read on behalf of the writers. The Companies, Department of Mineral Resources and Department of Lands objected to the making of the ICO. The majority of the other submissions supported the making of a Permanent Conservation Order. Several submissions related to other matters.Cleland 1988  Further information  The Agnes Banks Natural Area adjoins the Agnes Banks Nature Reserve created in March 1982. The nature reserve is managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Heritage listing  As at 25 January 2013, the Agnes Banks Natural Area is of State Heritage significance for its environmental heritage with natural, scientific and aesthetic significance for the following reasons: Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes and climate The \\"Agnes Banks Sand\\" is described as a stratigraphic unit of Pliocene of Pleistocene age (7 million-300,000 years ago) and probably a fluvial deposit which has been redistributed by westerly winds. The sands are surrounded by and overlie lateritized tertiary alluvial deposits, mainly clay and silts which make up the Cumberland Plain to the south and east. The sand deposit is unique in that although it is from the present coast, it supports unusual vegetation in many ways similar to coastal sand dune vegetation such as Myall Lakes, and with affinities also to Hawkesbury sandstone vegetation which is located in the Sydney Basin. The deposits themselves are highly important scientifically: as a reference site for understanding the past climatic history of the region; and, for comparison of the vegetation with similar vegetation on coastal sand deposits. The sediment making up the deposit originates from sandstone rock of the Blue Mountains and as such demonstrates the evolutionary process of weathering and deposition. Importance in demonstrating existing processes or natural systems The Agnes Banks Natural Area supports four distinct associations. These are described as: # Low open forestof Banksia serrata and Angophora bakeri which is confined to the well-drained crests of the large dunes; # Woodlandof Eucalyptus sclerophylla, A. bakeri and B. serrata on well- drained and moderately well-drained positions; # Woodlandof E. sclerophylla, E. parramattensis and B. aemula on shallow sand; and # Low-open Woodlandof E. parramattensis which is confined to poorly-drained situations. Studies by the National Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens indicate that species distribution is dominated primarily by a moisture drainage factor which produces a continuum of species. Projective' canopy cover and fire also influence the distribution of the vegetation. The relationship between these environmental factors and vegetation communities is clearly demonstrated at the Agnes Banks Natural Area. Importance in exhibiting unusual richness or diversity of flora The diversity of soil types and conditions has given rise to a corresponding diversity of vegetation types as indicated above. Importance for rare and endangered or uncommon flora, communities, ecosystems and landscape As described in I above, the sand deposits at Agnes Banks are an unusual and rare landform which, in conjunction with vegetation cover, results in a rare landscape type. Areas of original vegetation on the sand deposits associated with the Hawkesbury-Nepean rivers are extremely limited. The area is thus significant as a unique sample of this vegetation, which is otherwise not conserved. The Natural Area support several species which are considered rare or threatened, being represented by small populations, disjunct populations, or being at or near their geographic limits. These include the following: * Intergrades between Banksia serrata and B. aemula (formerly B. serrati folia) in parts of portion 157. * Acacia Bynoena on portion 157small populations elsewhere. * Restio pallenssouthern limit at Agnes Banks. * Persoonia nutanspopulation on portion 157 is possibly the only surviving location for this species * Petrophile sessilisnorthern limit at Agnes Banks, uncommon elsewhere. * Leucopogon virgatuscommon at Agnes Banks overall but uncommon in the Nature Reserve. * Dillwynia tenuifoliasmall populations, vulnerable in the long term. * Micromytus minutifloraas above. The whole community, with associations relating intergrading with each other, in this isolated inland position, at a low elevation are unique. Likewise is the ecosystem mechanics which operate and determine the species distribution. Importance as representative of the range of ecosystems which characterise sand vegetation type More than half of the original sand area of (sic.) at Agnes Banks has been cleared or quarried. Only two of the five plant communities recognised on the sand are represented in the existing Nature Reserve. Of the Reserve's only or 3.5 per cent (sic.) of the original sand mass is conserved. One of the plant communities - sedgeland - has now been completely destroyed through sand mining operations. The current Agnes Bank Reserve does not sample any Low Open Forest Banksia Serrata and Angophora Bakeri or Woodland E. Sclerophylla, Banksia Serrata and Angophora Baker plant associations. The only other known occurrence of B. Serrata in the general area is a tiny stand on freehold land which is badly damaged. Furthermore, the Agnes Banks Natural Area supports other species, namely Persoonia nutans, and Petrophile sessilis, which are not adequately conserved. This inadequate representation of the variation in the system limits the scope of the area for scientific research. Importance for information contributing to wider understanding of Australian natural history By virtue of their use as research sites, teaching sites, type localities and reference sites: # the isolated location of the deposit makes it suitable for biogeographical studies; # the relationship with the surrounding/underlying clay is of interest as is the internal dynamics controlled by soil water status and fire frequency; # the distinct change in vegetation at the sandclay interface; # the B. aemula/B. serrata interface/hybrid swarm presents a good opportunity for population genetics/autoecological studies; # the complex ecotone between plant association of Woodland and Low Woodland; # the site is unusual in geomorphological terms; and # the sands are important as a soil reference site. Furthermore, as environmental education is a component of school curriculum, the demand for areas such as Agnes Banks for field studies, is great.Heritage Council Submission to Commission of Inquiry, 1988 Aboriginal sites already identified at Agnes Banks are believed to date to about 13,000 years ago. Open sites of this age are rare in eastern New South Wales. It is possible that older sites are situated within or under the sand. Agnes Banks may prove to be a significant source of information about human occupation during the late Pleistocene period. The Agnes Bank Natural Area was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was written by showrunner and executive producer Chris Chibnall, directed by Sallie Aprahamian, and first broadcast on BBC One on 28 October 2018. In the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) brings her human friends ‚Äì Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill) ‚Äì back to Sheffield, where they discover a serious problem is roaming around the city in the form of giant spiders. Guest stars include Chris Noth and Shobna Gulati, with Sharon D. Clarke reprising her role as Grace O'Brien. The episode was watched by 8.22 million viewers and received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  Having returned to Sheffield, the Thirteenth Doctor goes to meet with Yasmin's family alongside Ryan, whilst Graham heads home to grieve over Grace's death. After Yasmin leaves to pick up her mother, Najia Khan, the Doctor and Ryan encounter arachnologist Dr. Jade McIntyre while trying to meet the family's next door neighbour. Gaining entry, the group discover its owner, McIntyre's colleague, has been killed by a large spider. After Graham rejoins them upon having found something similar at his house, the group learn that McIntyre has been investigating bizarre behaviour patterns in spider ecosystems, after suspending experiments with spiders at her laboratory. The Doctor deduces that the giant spiders and behaviour patterns are linked to a recently built luxury hotel complex, which Najia worked at until recently fired by the hotel's wealthy American owner, Jack Robertson. Arriving at the hotel and joined by Robertson, Yasmin and Najia, the group learn the spiders have infested the complex and that they are now sealed in by them. While Ryan and Graham capture a spider for examination, the rest of the group discover the spiders came from abandoned mine tunnels beneath the complex, discovering the bodies of Robertson's bodyguard and personal assistant. Further investigation soon reveals the tunnels were used as a dumping ground for industrial waste by one of Robertson's companies. McIntyre, who revealed to the Doctor her experiments involved genetically modified spiders, realises the giant spiders are the offspring of a specimen that had been dumped by the same company, on the belief it was dead. The Doctor theorises the toxicity of the dumping ground mutated them further. To kill them humanely, the group lure the offspring into a panic room Robertson built into the hotel, before encountering the specimen itself in the ballroom. Upon finding it, the Doctor and McIntyre realise the spider is dying from breathing difficulties due to its massive size. Before the Doctor can ensure it dies humanely, Robertson kills it with his bodyguard's gun, much to her disgust. With the situation resolved, Ryan, Yasmin and Graham contemplate returning to their normal lives but decide to see more of the universe with the Doctor, much to her delight.  Casting  After the premiere episode, \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\", was broadcast, it was confirmed that Chris Noth and Shobna Gulati would be among a number of guest actors that would appear in the series.  Broadcast and reception   Ratings  \\"Arachnids in the UK\\" was watched by 6.43 million viewers overnight, a share of 29.3% of the total TV audience, making it the second- highest overnight viewership for the night, and third for the week on overnights across all channels.

History After the Franco-Prussian War, the Army began to study replacements for its cast bronze 15 cm Kanone C/61 and steel 15 cm Kanone C/64 breech loaded cannons. Although Prussian artillery had outclassed their French rivals during the war the breech mechanism the C/64 used was weak and there was a tendency for barrels to burst due to premature detonation of shells. In 1872 a new gun which retained the same caliber as the previous gun was designed and placed in production. The new gun designated the 15 cm Ring Kanone C/72 was assigned to fortress and siege artillery battalions of the Army. Each artillery battery consisted of four guns with four batteries per battalion. Design The C/72 was a typical built-up gun constructed of steel with a central rifled tube, reinforcing layers of hoops, and trunnions. The C/72 featured a new breech which although similar to the breech of the C/64 had a semi-circular face which allowed the gun to avoid the stress fractures which caused catastrophic failures in its square blocked predecessor. This type of breech was known as a cylindro-prismatic breech which was a predecessor of Krupp's horizontal sliding-block and the gun used separate- loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The C/72 was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns such as its Russian cousin the 6-inch siege gun M1877 or the Italian Cannone da 149/23. Like many of its contemporaries, the C/72 had a tall and narrow box trail carriage built from bolted iron plates with two wooden 12-spoke wheels. The carriages were tall because the guns were designed to sit behind a parapet with the barrel overhanging the front in the fortress artillery role or behind a trench or berm in the siege role. Like its contemporaries, the C/72's carriage did not have a recoil mechanism or a gun shield. However, when used in a fortress the guns could be connected to an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on a concrete firing platform and a hook on the carriage between the wheels. For siege gun use a wooden firing platform could be assembled ahead of time and the guns could attach to the same type of recoil mechanism. A set of wooden ramps were also placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by gravity. There was also no traverse so the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire. For transport, the gun was broken down into two loads and for towing by horse teams or artillery tractors.  World War I  The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Since the C/72 was heavier and wasn't designed with field use in mind it was employed as a fortress gun. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. The theorists hadn't foreseen that trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns had robbed them of the mobility they had been counting on and like in the Franco-Prussian and Russo-Turkish war the need for high- angle heavy artillery reasserted itself. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell and that meant emptying the fortresses and scouring the depots for guns held in reserve. It also meant converting coastal artillery and naval guns to siege guns by either giving them simple field carriages or mounting the larger pieces on rail carriages. A combination of factors led the Germans to issue C/72's to their frontline troops: *An underestimation of artillery losses during the first two years of the war and an inadequate number of replacement guns being produced. *Many artillery pieces were neither tall enough or capable of the high-angle fire necessary to fire from entrenched positions. *Few light field-artillery pieces had the range or fired a large enough projectile to be useful in an indirect fire role. Although new guns with superior performance were introduced the C/72's remained in service until the end of the war due to the number in service and a lack of replacements. However, their poor range eventually became a handicap. In 1886, Portugal bought several C/72 artillery pieces and they were still in use by the time the Great War began. They were initially deployed in forts around the city of Lisbon, but during the war they were moved to batteries elsewhere, like in neighboring city of Set√∫bal and the islands of Azores and Madeira, for coastal defensive duties.

It was founded by Richard Wood in 1968 and has become the largest supplier of early musical instruments worldwide.  History   J Wood & Sons Ltd.  The Early Music Shop is the trading name of J Wood & Sons Ltd., a family firm which was incorporated in 1850 by Joe Wood, with its original business name of 'J Wood Music'. In 1877, the business expanded and moved to Bradford, where it became J Wood & Sons Ltd. Almost 100 years later during the revival of early music, J Wood & Sons Ltd. received some unusual historical instruments as part of an education order. Intrigued, Richard Wood, the founder's great-great-grandson, researched these instruments by attending a music fair in Frankfurt ‚Äì the Musikmesse Frankfurt ‚Äì during which he met Otto Steinkopf, a pioneer in the reconstruction of early instruments, at a Moeck stand, and speculatively bought a collection of recorders, crumhorns and string instruments. Local enthusiasts immediately took to the new stock, which quickly sold out, and subsequently J Wood & Sons Ltd. formed a separate department within their business specialising in early music. This was henceforth known as 'The Early Music Shop', and is now considered to be the \\"centre of the early music universe\\".  Revival of the Early Music Movement  The birth of the early music revival attracted musicians to a variety of unique historical instruments. Interest in early music and historical instruments increased following David Munrow's success, particularly in the music he produced for the TV series The Six Wives of Henry VIII in 1971. Munrow's score for this series featured authentic music using only historical instruments, thus generating much enthusiasm for early musical instruments and music from the renaissance period across audiences worldwide. Munrow himself was a loyal and enthusiastic customer of J Wood & Sons Ltd., having fiercely encouraged Richard Wood to start up a business specialising in these historical instruments, and even helped devise the name of \\"The Early Music Shop\\". Consequentially, demand for renaissance instruments increased, and so The Early Music Shop began trading with other businesses in the same field, such as Moeck and Mollenhauer, and began holding an exhibition in London for all makers and publishers involved in early music in order to generate publicity. As a result, the business continued to grow, and moved to Manningham Lane in Bradford in 1987 as part of Woods Music Shop, where it continued to produce historical instruments and kits in its workshops until 1999.  The Early Music Shop today   Move to Salts Mill  In 2007, following its acquisition by Music Sales, the headquarters for The Early Music Shop moved premises from Woods Music Shop in Bradford, and the main showroom is now situated in the renowned Salts Mill, in the centre of Saltaire, a village in West Yorkshire. Saltaire has World Heritage Site status, thus the new location for The Early Music Shop has benefited from the many visitors drawn to the iconic Victorian model village. The main showroom in Saltaire features many different medieval instruments. Indeed, Salts Mill has been used to host many Early Music Concerts since the business' move to Saltaire, such as a concert and workshop led by renowned early musicians Rachel Podger and Pamela Thorby, performances by Leeds Baroque Choir & Orchestra, and on regular occasions concerts led by Red Priest, a British Baroque instrumental band. After the move, the firm began offering regular tuition in its main showroom, and hosts regular recorder, viol, harp and lute lessons for students of all standards. It also includes an agency for second-hand instruments, and a repair workshop. The new showroom for The Early Music Shop has been described as \\"an Aladdin's Cave of affordable early music instruments\\", and the business serves as the exclusive UK distributor for Moeck recorders, and a UK agent for: K√ºng recorders, Mollenhauer recorders, Bizzi harpsichords, Lu Mi viols, Camac harps and many others. Demand for historical instruments has kept increasing since the move to the new premises and the business in general has been referred to as 'a treasured national institution'. A second showroom is located in Denmark Street, long-established as London's \\"Tin Pan Alley\\". Both branches of The Early Music Shop frequently attend a variety of Early Music courses and Festivals, involving pop-up stands and workshops, across the United Kingdom. In recent years, the business has also supplied musical instruments and props for a variety of TV and film projects, including Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Alexander, Kingdom of Heaven and many others.  New Ownership and 50th Anniversary  After 10 years of ownership by Music Sales, The Early Music Shop was acquired in August 2018 by Chris Butler, a career music industry executive and long-term supporter of the business. The acquisition coincided with the launch of a new website and a commitment from the new owner to consolidate The Early Music Shop's position as the largest source of historical instruments worldwide. The Early Music Shop celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018, and the business prides itself on its knowledgeable, dedicated team of staff, some of whom have been with the company for over 30 years.  London International Festival of Early Music  The London International Festival of Early Music taking place at Blackheath during November, 2018. Since 1973, The Early Music Shop has hosted an international festival of early music in London, which includes various concerts, instrumental performance competitions and an exhibition, which is attended by approximately 100 exhibitors from the UK and overseas. The exhibition features a vast display of early musical instruments, music publishers and societies, and is said to reflect \\"the constantly growing interest in performing early music\\". First hosted at the Royal College of Music, the event moved to the Royal Horticultural Halls, before moving back to the Royal College of Music, where it became an annual event. In 2002 the festival moved to Greenwich, but now takes place at Blackheath Halls, London's oldest surviving purpose-built cultural venue.

The newspaper was published between April 22, 1917 and November 26, 1917.–ì–æ—Ä–¥–µ–µ–≤, –ü–µ—Ç—Ä –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á. –ö—Ä–æ–Ω—à—Ç–∞–¥—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏—Ö –∏ —Å–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–≤ –≤ –º–∞—Ä—Ç–µ - –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä–µ 1917 –≥–æ–¥–∞ 180 issues of the newspaper were published during the course of 1917. Whilst the Trudovniks represented the far-right in the revolutionary fervour of Kronstadt, Trud, Zemlia i More had a prominent profile (the Trudoviks and Popular Socialists had very little following within the Baltic Fleet and no presence in base soviets, but did count of civilian support from the town population). The newspaper was launched as a replacement of the pre-revolutionary newspaper Kotlin, which published its last issue on April 21, 1917. The initial editorial team consisted of A.K. Tachkov (Secretary of the Food Commission of the Kronstadt Soviet), A.P. Skobennikov (Food Commission chairman), and A.F. Pervaya. The first issue of the newspaper carried the motto 'In labour and struggle we will gain your right', a modified version of a Socialist-Revolutionary slogan. The front page carried the descriptions 'Organ of the Labour Socialist Union' and 'Daily newspaper for the political and economic life in Kronstadt'. Tachkov served as editor of the newspaper for the first ten issues. Several prominent leaders of the Petrograd Soviet sent congratulatory messages to Trud, Zemlia i More for its first issue, such as Petrograd Soviet chairman Nikolay Chkheidze, Irakli Tsereteli, Matvey Skobelev and Nikolay Sokolov. The Bundist leader Mikhail Liber also sent a congratulatory message, published in its April 25, 1917 edition. On June 1, 1917 the name of the newspaper was changed to Trud i Zemlia ('Labour and Land'). The decision to change the name of the publication was taken at a meeting of the Kronstadt Labour Socialist Union, at which the organization proclaimed its allegiance to the Labour Socialist Party. Furthermore, when the Labour Socialist Party (Trudoviks) and the Popular Socialists merged in June 1917, the newspaper became the organ of the Kronstadt branch of the Labour People's Socialist Party. The local leader of the merged party and new editor of the newspaper was A.E. Hanuch. Trud i Zemlia exchanged sharp polemics with the Bolshevik organ Golos Pravdy, the latter personally targeted Hanuch in its writings. On August 18 the workers at the Kronstadt Marine Plant, the Emergency Docks and other enterprises in Kronstadt adopted resolutions at their respective meetings calling for a protest against the attacks of the counter-revolutionary press, such as Trud i Zemlia and Kopeika. N.S. Kolinin and A.R. Prekrach served as editors for Trud i Zemlia between issues 106 and 156.

The simulator machine was announced by researchers at McMaster University on behalf of the Origins Institute on 4 October 2018. The machine was developed primarily to study a theory that suggests life on early Earth began in \\"warm little ponds\\", rather than in deep ocean vents, nearly four billion ago. The simulator can recreate conditions of the primitive Earth to see whether cellular life can be created, and then later, evolve. According to physicist Maikel Rheinstadter, who is also the director of the simulator project, \\"We want to understand how the first living cell was formed - how the Earth moved from a chemical world to a biological world.\\" The one-of-a-kind planet simulator, manufactured by Angstrom Engineering Inc., can control temperature, humidity, pressure, atmosphere and radiation levels that may be consistent with conditions on the early Earth, or conditions on other astronomical bodies, including other planets, exoplanets and the like. The simulator project, begun in 2012, was funded with $1 million from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Ontario government and McMaster University, and was built by Angstrom Engineering Inc of Kitchener, Ontario. Observations According to researchers, preliminary tests with the simulator, under possible conditions of the early Earth, created protocells, not living but very important nonetheless. According to biologist David Deamer, the machine is a game changer, and the cells produced so far are \\"significant\\". The \\"cells are not alive, but are evolutionary steps toward a living system of molecules ... [the simulator] opens up a lot of experimental activities that were literally impossible before.‚Äù Based on initial tests with the new simulator technology, project director Rheinstadter stated that it \\"seems that the formation of life is probably a relatively frequent process in the universe\\".
