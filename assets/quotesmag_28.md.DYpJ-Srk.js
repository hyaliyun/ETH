History Close to the West Highland Line, about three miles (5 km) from the Gruund, are five large parallel drainage ditches known as 'The Soldiers' ditches' that were dug by British army soldiers between 1763 and 1764 under the direction of Ensign James Small of Lord Loudoun's Regiment, the Government Factor of the forfeited estate of the Jacobite supporters, the Robertsons of Struan in Kinloch Rannoch. Ensign Small had been stationed at Finnart and in 1754 he took up his new appointment and remained here in office until 1777 when he died, having made many considerable improvements in the area and especially to agriculture, such as the use of lime, a crushing machine being introduced so that lime could be used to reduce the acidic nature of the ground.A History of Rannoch after the 45.

These lands were the site of the summer shielings of the Rannoch inhabitants and the intention was to produce land upon which crops could be grown and pasture created. These extensive works, intended to \\"drain and sweeten the soil\\" were in vain and the lands were left to their previous purpose, however such was the extent of the excavations that they remain visible and attracted the name of 'The Soldiers trenches'.

The Fall of Berlin took place on 27 October 1806 when the Prussian capital of Berlin was captured by French forces in the aftermath of the Battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt. The French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte entered the city, from which he issued his Berlin Decree implementing his Continental System. Large- scale plundering of Berlin took place.Leggiere p.19 Occupation While Prussian forces and their King Frederick William III fled eastwards to K√∂nigsberg in East Prussia to continue resistance, the subsequent Treaty of Tilsit compelled Prussia to cede large portions of its territories and accept French garrisons in its major fortresses and settlements. Prussia became a client state of France, forced to pay large indemnities, and Berlin itself remained occupied until early 1813. A garrison was also established at the nearby Spandau Citadel. Following Napoleon's Retreat from Moscow in 1812, Prussian forces serving as auxiliaries for the French switched sides and supported Russia. This combined with major uprisings across Prussian territory, forcing French troops to retreat and abandon Berlin. The city then became a major target for the French who attempted to recapture it during the German Campaign of 1813, ending only with the complete French withdrawal following the Battle of Leipzig.Leggiere Impact Although Berlin had previously briefly been raided during the Seven Years' War, its occupation was a major blow to the Prussian leadership. It destroyed the reputation the Prussian Army had gained during the days of Frederick the Great. After arriving in Berlin, Napoleon visited the tomb of Frederick and is reported to have said \\"if this man were alive I would not be standing here now\\". This became an iconic scene in German culture, portrayed in Prussian films such as Old Fritz (1927) and Kolberg (1945).Schulte-Sasse p.111 In the wake of the fall of Berlin, a major reform movement was launched to restore the fighting effectiveness of the Prussian Army and renew the nation at large in order to plan a war of revenge against France.Carr & Hearder p.11 The reformed Prussian forces playing a key role in the subsequent French retreat from Germany in 1813-14, and during Napoleon's final defeat during the Waterloo Campaign in 1815.

Controversy The St Louis Workhouse has been subject to numerous controversies regarding living conditions of prisoners, abuse of incarcerated, and the use of penal labor. The organization ArchCity Defenders filed a class action lawsuit against the facilities describing the living conditions as inhumane. The lawsuit alleged that the civil rights of detainees within the facility had been violated due to the poor sanitation, limited ventilation, and poor medical care.A significant issue regarded the temperatures within the unconditioned workhouse during the summer months which was alleged to have exceeded 120 degrees. In response to the controversy the city of Saint Louis spent 40,000 dollars to provide temporary portable air conditioning for the prison.

Early life  Born Hector Crespo, he was raised by his single mother in the Jersey City area of New Jersey. Starting in his early teens, he frequently socialized in the West Village area of New York City, the historically gay epicenter of New York City's LGBTQ community. His sexual orientation as a gay man caused his mother to reject him. For periods of time in his mid-to-late teens, he was homeless or lived with friends. Due to the transient nature of his living situation, he did not complete high school, having stopped attending during the ninth grade. His personal experiences with the impact of rejection due to sexual orientation would deeply shape his adult views of the concepts of chosen family and self-created identity.  Ballroom scene  Hector frequently socialized on the Christopher Street pier in the West Village area of New York City. The location was a popular gathering place for African American and Latino LGBTQ+ people, many of whom also participated in the underground ballroom scene. It was there that Hector first encountered the dance form known as Voguing which had emerged from ballroom culture, as well as met transgender women of color associated with the ballroom scene. In ballroom culture, Houses serve the dual role of teams in ballroom competition as well as providing surrogate families for LGBTQ+ members, many of whom had experienced rejection by their biological families and in broader society. Members of Houses traditionally take the house name as their surname (e.g., Willi Ninja) to denote their chosen family. In 1982, Hector Crespo joined the newly formed House of Extravaganza (original spelling), founded by his friend Hector Valle. The House of Extravaganza was the first primarily Latinx ballroom house in what had traditionally been an almost exclusively African American community. Angie Xtravaganza, a transgender woman of Puerto Rican heritage, took on the role of House Mother and became a close friend and confidant to Hector. In ballroom competition, Hector represented the House of Xtravaganza in various categories including ‚ÄúFace‚Äù and ‚ÄúModel's Effect,‚Äù where he quickly developed a reputation as a worthy runway competitor. By the late 1980s, the underground ballroom scene began to garner mainstream attention in mainstream media. This culminated with Madonna's 1990 hit single and music video for \\"Vogue,\\" inspired by the dance form created by the ballroom community, and the 1991 documentary film Paris Is Burning which made stars of several ballroom personalities who to that point had remained mostly unknown outside of the scene. The House of Xtravaganza and its members were closely associated with both Madonna's \\"Vogue\\" and Paris Is Burning; Hector Xtravaganza appeared in the runway competition scenes of the documentary film. The mainstream attention provided Hector the opportunity to work as a fashion stylist and designer for various popular music artists, including Lil‚Äô Kim and Foxy Brown. The deepening AIDS crisis of the early 1990s impacted the House of Xtravaganza and the broader ballroom scene. Hector himself was diagnosed as HIV-positive by 1985. Mother Angie Xtravaganza died from complication of AIDS in 1993. That same year, Hector assumed the role of House Father, a position he held until 2003. These experiences drove Hector to use his notoriety as a ballroom personality in support of HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns and projects. During his tenure as House Father, Hector hosted numerous events for the ballroom community. He also developed a reputation as an advisor to other houses and younger members of the growing ballroom scene, which had begun to network to cities across the United States. By the mid-1990s, Hector legally changed his name to Hector Xtravaganza, further demonstrating his association with the House as his chosen surrogate family and his self-created identity. He was featured in the 1996 documentary film ‚ÄúMirror, Mirror‚Äù and the 2006 documentary ‚ÄúHow Do I Look‚Äù directed by Wolfgang Busch. In 2004, Hector took the honorary title of House Grandfather, with former Madonna dancer and choreographer Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza taking the role of House Father. Hector had the words ‚ÄúGrandfather‚Äù and ‚ÄúXtravaganza‚Äù tattooed on his forearms and frequently posed for photos displaying the inked title. In 2005, Hector Xtravaganza was inducted to the Ballroom Hall of Fame, an elite group of ballroom pioneers and icons. He was extensively interviewed for Chantal Regnault's Voguing & the Ballroom Scene 1989-92 (Soul Jazz books, 2011) and appeared in Legendary: Inside the House Ballroom Scene (Duke University Press, 2013) by Gerard H. Gaskin. He appeared in the Icona Pop music video for \\"All Night\\" along with other House of Xtravaganza members. In 2017, veteran television producer Ryan Murphy began working on a drama for the FX network set in the New York ballroom scene of the 1980s. To ensure an accurate depiction of ballroom culture of the period, several consultants were enlisted to assist on the show, including Hector Xtravaganza. The series Pose premiered on FX in June 2018.  HIV/AIDS advocacy  The AIDS crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s had a deep and personal impact on Hector. He was himself diagnosed as HIV-positive by 1985 and lost numerous friends and surrogate adopted family members to the virus. In response to the crisis, Hector committed to leveraging his ballroom notoriety and position within the House of Xtravaganza as an HIV/AIDS awareness advocate. In 1990, along with other members of the New York City's ballroom community, he founded the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) House of Latex project. The House of Latex serves as the outreach partner for the GMHC to members of the LGBTQ+ African American and Latino community of the ballroom scene. The GMHC Latex Ball is one of the largest annual events in the NYC LGBTQ+ community and a central activity in the organization's outreach programs serving young LGBTQ+ people of color. In 1994, Hector, along with other members of the House of Xtravaganza, appeared as part of an HIV/AIDS awareness public service campaign sponsored by GMHC targeted to the LGBTQ+ people of color ballroom community of NYC. The campaign appeared in NYC subway stations throughout the city and helped to breakdown the stigma associated with HIV at a time before there were effective treatments. GMHC named its Xcellence Award in honor of Hector Xtravaganza. Since 2007, the award has been presented annually to a member of the ballroom community for outstanding service in support of HIV/AIDS awareness. In 2018, Hector Xtravaganza appeared in an HIV treatment awareness campaign sponsored by the NYC Department of Health. He was recognized by POZ magazine as one of the 2018 POZ 100 for his contributions to making a difference in the fight against HIV. On World AIDS Day 2018, Xtravaganza was presented with an award of recognition by City of New York Health Acting Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot.  Death  Hector Xtravaganza died of lymphoma in New York City on December 30, 2018. His death was widely covered in publications across the U.S., including Variety, Out, and The New York Times. A memorial celebration of the life of Hector Xtravaganza was held on March 9, 2019 hosted by El Museo del Barrio. The Office of the Mayor of New York City officially proclaimed the day ‚ÄúHector Xtravaganza Day‚Äù in the City of New York. The Pose season 2 episode \\"Worth It\\" was dedicated to Xtravaganza's memory. He had served as a consultant for the show.

It is a variant of the evil twin attack. Details of the attack were first published in 2004 by Dino dai Zovi and Shaun Macaulay. Vulnerable client devices broadcast a \\"preferred network list\\" (PNL), which contains the SSIDs of access points to which they have previously connected and are willing to automatically reconnect without user intervention. These broadcasts are not encrypted and hence may be received by any WiFi access point in range. The KARMA attack consists in an access point receiving this list and then giving itself an SSID from the PNL, thus becoming an evil twin of an access point already trusted by the client. Once that has been done, if the client receives the malicious access point's signal more strongly than that of the genuine access point (for example, if the genuine access point is nowhere nearby), and if the client does not attempt to authenticate the access point, then the attack should succeed. If the attack succeeds, then the malicious access point becomes a man in the middle (MITM), which positions it to deploy other attacks against the victim device. What distinguishes KARMA from a plain evil twin attack is the use of the PNL, which allows the attacker to know, rather than simply to guess, which SSIDs (if any) the client will automatically attempt to connect to.

She was notable for romantic partnership and artistic collaboration with artist Marcel Duchamp, as well as her role in supporting the French Resistance during the Nazi Occupation in Paris.  Early life  She was born in 1891 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She came from a well-off family, and attended public schools in Minneapolis during her childhood. In 1909, she moved to the east coast to study at Vassar College, graduating with a bachelor of arts in 1913. After she graduated, she returned to Minneapolis and attended post-graduate courses at the University of Minnesota. Around her time spent studying at University of Minnesota, she met Matthew Givens Reynolds. They married in July 24, 1916. During their engagement, he received a job offer in New York. They moved to New York and settled in Greenwich Village, where she was exposed to the New York bohemian arts scene at the time. She first met Marchel Duchamp during her time in New York. In November 1917, her husband enlisted in World War I. While he survived combat, he died of influenza in Europe on January 10, 1919 ‚Äì leaving her a widow. After her husband‚Äôs death, she briefly returned to Minneapolis. Her family encouraged her to settle down again and re-marry, but she found this an unsatisfying option in the wake of her husband‚Äôs death. She left for Paris in April 1921, settling in Montparnasse.  Parisian life  Once settled in Paris, she quickly became a popular socialite due to her association with novelist, painter, and poet Laurence Vail. In 1923, she became reacquainted with Marchel Duchamp through her relations to the Paris Social scene. They began to form a relationship. Duchamp, however, was not faithful and pursued relations with other women during this time. Though they never married, from 1927 the two lived in close relation ‚Äì living together, vacationing together, and being seen in public together. In 1929, Reynolds took up bookbinding at the Atelier of master French binder Pierre Legrain. Legrain‚Äôs style of binding was notably modernist in contrast to the prior tradition of French book binding which was more deferential to a classical style. Legrain‚Äôs influence, as well as that of Duchamp, led Reynolds to adopt a relatively avant-garde style of book binding, influenced by French Surrealism. She produced many bindings herself, as well as a few in collaboration with Duchamp, such as their collaboration on a binding for Alfred Jarry‚Äôs Ubu Roi. During 1930s, her relationship stabilized with Duchamp. During this time she actively worked as a bookbinder and continued to collaborate with Duchamp. Though she did not share a working studio with Duchamp, their mutual house was considered itself an extravagant aesthetic affair and frequently hosted the literati and artists of the time. This lasted until the Nazi occupation of Paris, which made it difficult for their relationship. Duchamp left for the unoccupied parts of Paris, urging Reynolds to join him.She refused, saying that the occupation posed little issue to her life, she wrote to Duchamp: ‚ÄúDon't worry, no torture, no boats for six months....Conditions acceptable here and no excitement.‚ÄùLetter from Marcel Duchamp to Frank B. Hubachek, Apr. 22, 1941. Duchamp eventually left for New York in 1942. During the early 1940s, Reynolds played an active role in The French Resistance. She also provided financial support for a variety of friends throughout the occupation. Notably, she helped the artist Jean H√©lion hide from the Nazis after he escaped from a German prisoners camp in 1942.Copy of letter from H√©lion to Katharine Kuh, Jan. 29, 1957 By late 1942, she became aware that she was under Gestapo surveillance and planned to leave occupied Paris. She escaped into Spain by crossing the Pyrenees. After some difficulties, she arrived in Madrid on December 14, 1942. On January 6, 1943, she returned to New York via aircraft.  Later life  She and Duchamp lived together in Greenwich Village until 1945, where longing for her old life in Paris, she left for Paris six weeks after the war ended in 1945. Duchamp joined her briefly, but eventually left in 1947. During this time period, her interest in bookbinding waned, and between 1945 and 1947, she primarily worked as a Paris representative for the arts magazine View. Her health gradually waned from the stresses taken during her escape from the occupation, and in April 1950 she checked into the American Hospital in Neuilly. She was found to be suffering from endometrial cancer. On September 30, 1950, she died from endometrial cancer in her home in Paris, with Marchel Duchamp at her side.

Devices whose displays fold on a vertical axis are designed to fold out into a wider, tablet-like form, but are still usable in a smaller, folded state; the display may either wrap around to the back of the device when folded (as with the Royole Flexpai and Huawei Mate X), or use a booklet- like design where the larger, folded screen is located on the interior, and a screen on its \\"cover\\" allows the user to interact with the device without opening it (such as the Samsung Galaxy Fold). Horizontally-folding smartphones have also been produced, typically using a clamshell form factor. Precursors to the concept have used multiple touchscreen panels on a hinge in a similar manner, but the term is currently synonymous with implementations that utilize a flexible display; concepts of such devices date back as early as Nokia's \\"Morph\\" concept (2008), and a concept presented by Samsung Electronics in 2013 (as part of a larger set of concepts utilizing flexible OLED displays), while the first commercially available folding smartphones with OLED displays began to emerge in November 2018. The first generation of commercially-released foldable smartphones have been faced with concerns over their durability, as well as their high prices. History The Kyocera Echo was a precursor to the current generation of foldable smartphones. In 2006, Polymer Vision showed a roll-able concept and a foldable smartphone, the Readius, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) which also serves as a reader. In 2008, Nokia presented animated concepts of a flexible device it dubbed \\"Morph\\", which had a tri-fold design that could be bended into various forms, such as a large unfolded device, a feature phone-sized unit, and a smart wristband. In a 2019 retrospective on the concept, CNET noted that Morph could be considered a forerunner to the first wave of commercially produced folding phones, as well as a showcase of future possibilities. In 2011, Kyocera released a dual- touchscreen Android smartphone known as the Echo, which featured a pair of 3.5-inch touchscreens. When folded, the top screen continued to face the user while covering the secondary screen. Two individual apps could be shown on the displays, a single app could span across them, while specific apps also featured \\"optimized\\" two-pane layouts. Two years later, NEC released the Medias W in Japan. Unlike the Echo, the secondary screen could be folded behind the phone. The camera rotated with the screen so that the same sensor could face both forward and rear In 2017, ZTE released the Axon M with a similar hinge to the Medias W. ZTE stated that the more powerful hardware of modern smartphones, and improvements to multitasking and tablet support on Android, helped to improve this experience. The development of thin, flexible OLED displays enabled the possibility for new designs and form factors. During its Consumer Electronics Show keynote in 2013, Samsung presented several concepts‚Äîcodenamed Youm‚Äîfor smartphones incorporating flexible displays. One such concept was a smartphone that could fold outward into a single, uninterrupted tablet-sized display. The first Youm concept to make it to a production model was the Galaxy Note Edge‚Äîa phablet with a portion of the screen that sloped over the right-hand bezel. Speculation surrounding the development of folding phones using OLED displays began to emerge more rapidly in 2018. In January 2018, it was reported that LG Electronics had obtained a design patent for a folding smartphone. Later in June, it was reported that Microsoft had been developing a similar device as part of its Surface line, codenamed \\"Andromeda\\" (itself a spiritual successor to a dual-screen booklet tablet prototype Microsoft had been exploring in the late-2000s known as Courier), while Samsung was also said to be developing such a device. In November 2018, the Chinese startup Royole and released the first commercially available foldable smartphone with an OLED display, the Royole Flexpai. It featured a single 7.8-inch display that folds outwards, leaving the display exposed when folded. Later that month at its developers' conference, Samsung officially teased a prototype of its folding smartphone, which would be produced \\"in the coming months\\". The prototype used a booklet-style layout, with an \\"InfinityFlex\\" display located on the inside of the device, and a smaller \\"cover\\" screen on the front of the device to allow access when the screen is closed. At a concurrent developers' summit, Android VP of engineering Dave Burke stated that the next version of the platform would provide enhancements and guidance relevant to folding devices, leveraging existing features.An open Galaxy Fold In January 2019, Xiaomi CEO Lin Bin published a video on Sina Weibo, featuring him demonstrating a prototype smartphone with two flaps capable of being folded inward. Samsung officially unveiled the Galaxy Fold during its media event at Mobile World Congress in February 2019. Alongside the Galaxy Fold, the convention also saw other foldable phones being unveiled or teased, such as the Huawei Mate X, and TCL presenting various prototype concepts featuring its \\"DragonHinge\\" technology (including a braclet-styled device). LG did not unveil a folding device, citing a desire to focus more on re-gaining market share in the smartphone market. It did, however, unveil a \\"Dual Screen\\" case accessory for its LG V50 smartphone‚Äîa folio-styled case containing a secondary display panel inside. Other companies expressed interest in the concept, or have received patents on designs (such as hinge implementations and overall designs) relating to foldable phones. Motorola Mobility had received patents for a horizontal folding smartphone reminiscent of clamshell feature phones. In April 2019, the impending launch of the Galaxy Fold was met with quality concerns from critics, after widespread reports of review units experiencing varying forms of display failure (in some instances caused by accidental removal of a plastic layer meant to protect the screen in lieu of glass, along with other failures). Samsung indefinitely postponed the device's release, stating that it needed time to investigate the failures and improve the device's durability. Huawei also delayed its Mate X, with the company citing its desire to take a \\"cautious\\" approach due to the Galaxy Fold. In November 2019, Motorola unveiled its horizontal-folding Razr‚Äîinspired by its former Razr feature phone line released on 6 February 2020. https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21127955/motorola-razr-foldable-phone-buy- verizon-store-hard-to-find Samsung also announced a similar device known as the Galaxy Z Flip.  Components   Display materials  Foldable smartphones typically use flexible, plastic OLED displays rather than glass (such as Corning's Gorilla Glass product, which is used in the majority of mid and high-end smartphones). Plastic displays are naturally capable of sustaining the required bend radius for a foldable smartphone, but they are more susceptible to blemishes and scratches than traditional glass smartphone displays. Although Corning does produce a flexible glass product known as Willow Glass, the company states that its manufacturing process requires use of a salt solution‚Äîthus making it unsuitable for electronic displays because the salt can damage the transistors used in OLED panels (which are built directly on the panel). Nonetheless, the company stated in March 2019 that it was in the process of developing a flexible glass suitable for smartphones, which would be thick and have a bend radius. Samsung marketed its Galaxy Z Flip as featuring -thick \\"ultra-thin glass\\" with a plastic layer similar to the Galaxy Fold, manufactured by Samsung with materials from Schott AG, which is \\"produced using an intensifying process to enhance its flexibility and durability\\", and injected with a \\"special material up to an undisclosed depth to achieve a consistent hardness\\". A stress test by YouTube channel JerryRigEverything showed the screen was scratched when rubbed with a pick with a Mohs rating of 2 (in comparison, most smartphones tested by the channel begin to experience scratches with 6 and 7-rated picks), placing its durability in line with other folding phones. However, The Verge did note Samsung's statement that the device contained a protective polymer layer similar to that of the Galaxy Fold.

Rising (also known as, Ederlezi Rising and Ederlezi √©bred√©se) is a 2018 English-language Serbian science fiction film directed by Lazar Bodrosa and based on a 1980s short story by Zoran Neskovic that was adapted for film by screenwriter Dimitrije Vojnov. The film stars Sebastian Cavazza, Stoya, Marusa Majer and Kirsty Besterman. Plot In a socialist world in 2148 the Ederlezi Corporation undertakes a space mission to the Alpha Centauri star system. The corporation selects Milutin, a trained cosmonaut, but demands that he accepts Nimani, an android designed to respond to the cosmonaut's desires and to monitor his performance on the ship. Milutin dislikes the idea as he has had poor experiences with women in the past but implicitly accepts when he asks what she would look like. Nimani is activated during the trip and Milutin experiments with her programmed scenarios. He finds her to be too artificial and submissive, unlike the human women he has experienced. Milutin gets bored and creates a scenario where she acts as a young first time lover, in which he rapes her. Milutin discovers that Nimani has a parallel operating system based on experiences shaped by interactions with the user, and that he can remove her pre-programmed constraints if he can get advanced access, which is denied by the ship's onboard computer. The two become romantically entwined, and after Milutin starts an argument scenario, he finds that she is beginning to act beyond her routines, and reads in emotion in the interaction. Determined to find out if her feelings are real or programmed, he forces the ship into a tailspin, which makes the ship's computer grant him advanced access. He deletes the software embedded in her and rather than being grateful for freeing her from her limitations, she reacts negatively to his deletion of her root programming, and denies him sex. Milutin fades into a depression after Nimani rejects his advances. In order to maintain the mission objectives, Nimani tries to befriend Milutin and expresses her understanding of Milutin's goal to give her free will and make her more like a human. Realizing that she is the cause of his depression, she chooses to self-destruct to improve Milutin's mental state. Milutin is surprised to see her crying prior to self- destruction, and is told by the ship's computer her crying response prior to self-destruction was not pre-programmed but natural. He is devastated, but is told that he can save her by charging her internal battery, which requires a space walk and possible radiation poisoning. Milutin is able to charge the battery and successfully reactivate Nimani, but collapses prior to seeing Nimani wake. Nimani embraces and kisses Milutin as the ship continues onward. It is unclear whether Milutin survives. Cast Reception According to an OnVideo film review, \\"A.I. Rising\\" is a film that is a \\"mind-blowing, visually sumptuous space journey [that] will take you ... beyond the stars and deep inside your soul.\\" Playwright Dean Haspiel describes the film as, \\"Adam and Eve in outer space\\"; entrepreneur Cindy Gallup, an \\"amazingly atmospheric\\" film; and author John Scalzi comments that the film is \\"intriguingly philosophical\\", according to the official film trailer. Stoya, in the words of Cineuropa reviewer Vladan Petkovic, \\"turns out to be a talented actress, creating a character that convincingly covers the spectrum between android and human.\\" According to reviewer Jeremy Clarke, the film contains hints of several classic sci-fi films, including \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Metropolis\\", \\"Solaris\\" and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and also notes that, \\"There are more than enough CG exterior spaceship shots to satisfy SF buffs, but far more importantly the relationship material tackles some very deep male/female relationship issues.\\" Film reviewer Srdjan Garcevic stated that \\"A.I. Rising\\" is a \\"visually stunning, ambitious, and timely, examination of love in the age of AI\\". The film was reviewed by others as well. \\"A.I. Rising\\" won several awards, including best film, best director and best actor-actress awards at the Belgrade Film Festival, FEST, as well as the Cineplexx Distribution Award at Vienna's ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs CEE‚Äù Film Festival.

She was one of the first and most active members of the Grange. Through Rose's efforts and the members of the National Grange Organization, the anti-option bill was passed. She was a prominent member of the Patrons of Industry and by her lectures and publications, did much to educate the farmers in the prominent reforms of the day, in which the advancement of women was one which always interested her. Rose was an active worker in the National Woman Suffrage Association, and in 1888, was appointed District President of that organization. Early years and education Ellen Alida Rudd was born in Champion, New York, June 17, 1843. She was the youngest daughter of John C. and Lumeda Fowler Rudd. She was of English descent. The district school, with a few terms in the village academy, furnished her education. Career On December 5, 1861, she married Alfred Rose. In 1862, they moved to Wisconsin, where her life was spent on a farm near Brodhead, Wisconsin. Associated with her husband in an equal partnership, she has lived and worked with him in a companionship which was seldom in that time as other marriages were founded on the idea of masculine supremacy. They had one child, a daughter, who became a well known artist In conjunction with her husband. Rose oversaw all the work of the farm and took a part in all of it. She was a careful, conservative, successful farmer, and in her life, she vindicated woman's right to labor. She was also a reader, thinker and reformer. She took notes of every bill that passed the legislature, and watched every act of Congress. Her reform work was chiefly in connection with the Woman Suffrage Association, and in the ranks of the Labor party. She was an able speaker for both causes. As a farmer, she saw early on the how the financial system disfavored the laboring classes, and was led to associate herself with those who were seeking the emancipation of labor. In 1873, near her home in Brodhead, she joined the National Grange, and for seventeen years, was an active member of that organization, holding many offices, among them county secretary and a member of the State committee on woman's work. As a result of her efforts, assisted by two or three other members, a Grange store was organized, which was in successful operation many years and saved many thousands of dollars for the farmers of Green County, Wisconsin. In 1888, when speculation in wheat produced hard times, Rose prepared and presented to her Grange the following resolutions:‚Äî Those resolutions were unanimously adopted and forwarded through county and State Granges to the National Grange, where they were adopted and placed in the hands of the legislative committee of the Grange in Washington, D.C. where they were urged upon Congress with such force that the Anti-Option Bill in Congress was the result. Rose became a prominent member of the Patrons of Industry, being one of the executive committee of the State association, and by lectures and publications, was educating the farmers in the prominent reforms of the day, including the advancement of women. From her earliest recollection, she was an advocate of woman suffrage, although she did not join any organization until 1886, when she became a member of the Wisconsin Woman's Suffrage Association and was instrumental in forming a local club, becoming its first president. In 1887, she assisted in organizing a county association and was appointed county organizer. In 1888, she was appointed district president.

History Map of Kinsale Harbour in 1741 from the collection of Royal Museums Greenwich, London, England By the early 17th century, Kinsale Harbour was already 'a place of great resort for his Majesty's ships of war'Thuillier, p.00 During the Battle of Kinsale, ships were often careened on the isthmus of the Castlepark peninsula, where (in an area still known as 'The Dock') facilities were provided for ship repair and maintenance. Later in the century, these facilities migrated across the river to the Custom House Quay at Kinsale itself. By the mid-17th century, a small dockyard had been established, with staff including locally-known shipwrights from Chudleigh family (John Chudleigh, first appointed as assistant to the Master Shipwright in 1647, later served as Master Shipwright at the yard and was succeeded by his son, Thomas Chudeleigh). In 1650, victualling facilities were established alongside the dockyard; these played a key role in the provisioning of westbound vessels setting off from England and Ireland to the colonies.Murphy. pp.84-85. In 1683 the newly-constituted Victualling Board appointed an Agent Victualler to Kinsale to oversee these operations.Coad, p. 20. At the same time, work was underway to improve fortifications around the harbour: the 'New Fort' (Charles Fort) was opened in 1682, to complement the 'Old Fort' (James's Fort). The dockyard initially served as one of the bases for the Royal Navy's Irish Squadron. Then, in 1694, the English Parliament established Kinsale as the headquarters for co-ordinating convoy operations in the Western Approaches (for protecting merchant shipping from attacks by privateers). In connection, it became home base for up to forty-three cruizers, deployed there to serve as escort ships (though some were based in Bristol, which had a similar co- ordinating role in relation to the Welsh coast).Thuillier, p.00 The escort cruizers were mainly fifth-rate naval vessels: small but fast; indeed, Kinsale was always limited to handling smaller vessels, owing to the sandbar at the mouth of the River Bandon. Prize vessels were often brought to Kinsale; the vessels would be anchored in the river and their crews imprisoned in the town.Thuillier, p.00 Although the yard was mainly focussed on ship maintenance, some building took place, most notably of the eponymously named frigate HMS Kinsale, which was launched there on 22 May 1700. The yard was small compared to the larger Royal Navy Dockyards in England; yet at the height of its activity, in the 1720s, the complex supported a not insubstantial body of labourers, including sixty joiners, forty shipwrights and an assortment of coopers, caulkers, maltsters and smiths.Thuillier, p.00 A survey of the dockyard undertaken by Sir Charles Vallancey in 1777 describes storehouses arranged around three sides of a quadrangle fronting on to the river, an open courtyard containing a mast pond and other buildings (including offices, a sail loft, paint shop and nail store) all enclosed within a perimeter wall, and an area with a boathouse and slipway; however, Vallancey also reported that, while 'Kinsale was suitable in former years it could not [now] cater for our ships of war which draw more water than formerly'.Thuillier, p.00 Ominously for the yard's prospects, he concluded that this rendered 'the old Dock and Harbour of Kinsale inadequate for any considerable maritime accommodation or enterprise'. By 1765 the Admiralty had acquired a property, further along the coast, at the Cove of Cork on the River Lee. Gradually, over the rest of the century, victualling and other facilities were moved there from Kinsale; but the new site was itself far from ideal. It was only after 1803, when the Agent Victualler suggested instead developing Haulbowline (a nearby uninhabited island in Cork Harbour) that Kinsale Dockyard was fully run down, a process that was completed by 1812. Administration of the dockyard and other key officials Responsibility for naval dockyards rested with the Navy Board until 1832, local superintendence being exercised by civilian resident commissioners.30px This section contains some copied content from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright.

Like elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula, folktales play an important role in Qatar's culture. Some of Qatar's folktales have a distinctive local character while others have been imparted by nomadic tribes wandering between the present-day Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Local folk stories were seldom documented, instead being passed down orally from generation to generation. After Qatar began profitting from oil exploration, the tradition of passing down these stories gradually ceased. Government ministries such as the Ministry of Culture and Sports and local universities have made efforts to preserve and transcribe local legends in publications. Among Qatar's most noted folk heroes are Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a, a 7th-century war poet, and Rahmah ibn Jabir Al Jalhami, an 18th- and 19th-century pirate and transitory leader of Qatar. Recurring themes in Qatari folklore are djinn, pearl diving, and the sea. Myths May and Gilan A large dhow historically used for pearling at a Qatari dhow festival One myth that purportedly originates from Qatar is that of \\"May and Gilan\\", the latter of whom is said to be progenitor of the sail. According to tradition, in old times, a wealthy man named Ghilan resided in Al Khor. Besides commanding a crew of sailors and fishermen, he owned numerous pearling boats. As time passed, a woman named May, who commanded superior number of boats and crewmen, emerged as Ghilan's main adversary. In an incident in which both crews were attempting to harvest the same pearl bed, May taunted Ghilan as her ship raced past his. This incensed Ghilan, who set out to discover a way to best his competitor. While observing a grasshopper, Ghilan took note of how its wings worked, and applied the same principle to his boats, giving rise to the sail. This enabled his boats to travel at higher speeds, allowing him to outpace May's boats to the densest pearl beds. The myth is typically presented in five sequences and is unlike most other known Bedouin stories. According to locals of Al Khor, the myth originated from the Al Muhannadi tribe of Al Khor. The story is not well-known elsewhere in Qatar. Lord of the Sea The \\"Lord of the Sea\\" tale is famous in Qatar as well as the rest of the Persian Gulf region. The story revolves around a water djinn named B≈´ DaryƒÅ, who terrorizes sailors and pearl divers. It remains a well-known tale among Qatar's older population, particularly those who worked in maritime activities. The myth attains its name from the protagonist, B≈´ DaryƒÅ. In Arabic, \\"bu\\" or \\"abu\\" translates to \\"father\\", while \\"darya\\" originates from the Persian term for \\"sea\\". Although the second word has Persian origins, the myth has not been documented in any known Persian literature. An alternative name for the protagonist is \\"≈†eytƒÅn √ål-bahƒÅr\\", Arabic for \\"devil of the sea\\". B≈´ DaryƒÅ was seen as a terrifying and colossal half-human half-amphibian who preyed on those out at sea. Many sailors and pearl divers of the past were convinced of B≈´ DaryƒÅ's existence and took special precautions should they encounter him. In fact, according to one version of the myth, B≈´ DaryƒÅ would sneak onto unsuspecting ships at night before scurrying off with crew members whom he would devour, and in some cases would sink the ship. This provoked seaward travelers to take turns on night watch duty in case of an attack. Wailing-like calls, similar to those of a siren, are reported in the second version of the myth. Unsuspecting sea travelers who would answer these pleas would face their doom at the hands of B≈´ DaryƒÅ. If a whole ship responded to the call, then its resources would be plundered and in most cases the ship would be sunk. As per this version, the only way to repel the hypnotic calling would be to repeat Quran verses. The second version represents a less fanciful depiction of B≈´ DaryƒÅ and contains more elements pertaining to the unknown dangers awaiting in unexplored and undocumented areas of the open sea. It also attempts to reconcile faith and religion with long-held customs in an effort to provide a moral to the story. Folktales Genres of folktales Qatari folktales can be divided into four main categories: witticisms (torfah), anecdotes (nadirah), wisecracks (molhah) and jokes (noktah). The first genre, referred to as witticism in English, provides a combination of social criticism and sarcasm delivered in a witty manner. Humor is not necessary in witticisms; in fact, many witticisms do not highlight elements of humor, but of misfortune and misery. Nonetheless, this misery may be still be communicated in a lighthearted and exaggerated way for entertainment purposes. An example of the witticism, or torfah genre, is the story of Far Boufarah Khayes Al-Merara, narrated by Qatari folklorist Ahmed Al Sayegh. In it, a delusional man kills a mouse with a sword and pridefully places it in front of his doorstep in an attempt to showcase his masculinity. When his wife notices the dead mouse, she does not share his enthusiasm and instead views it as the unnecessary slaughter of a defenseless creature. Incensed, the husband expresses his very strong dissatisfaction of his wife's attitude and threatens to divorce her. After his mother-in-law was informed of the incident by his wife, she pays him a visit and on entering the household, questions who it was that has slain the mighty lion at their doorstep. The husband arrogantly claimed responsibility and, encouraged by his mother-in-law's enabling of his delusional state, moved to forgive his wife for her perceived transgressions. Thus, witticisms can be seen as playing important social roles, with their morals often providing relevant and sensible advice to its listeners. In this context, the lesson taught is, that spouses may have to make compromises and entertain one another's egos, at least to a small extent, in order for a marriage to be successful. Other common morals taught by witticisms include knowing when to remain silent and being vigilant against thieves and fraudsters. Morphology of folktales According to Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the tale published in 1928, the prologue is an essential component of all folktales. A prologue is defined as the opening section of a story which describes its setting, characters and context. Most Qatari and other regional folktales begin with the phrase \\"Blessing of Allah be upon Muhammad\\" or a variant of this. Stories often revolve around multiple members of a family, and recurrent patterns can be seen in the family structure of protagonists, such as orphaned children, children with only one parent, and children with abusive stepparents. Examples of such settings can be found in the folktales of Al-Khadrabouna and Hamad and Hamda. In some tales, Jinn appear as benevolent wish granters, while in others they are cast as the main villains Folktales vary widely in theme, but jinn and the sea feature prominently in a number of stories. Common structures can be observed in Qatari folktales; with most tales starting with a basic demand, escalating to trials and tribulations, and ending with punishment and/or rewards. The aforementioned stories of Al-Khadrabouna and Hamad and Hamda as well as Al-Sofra wal Qadah wal Mushaab illustrate this structural archetype well. In the Al-Khadrabouna tale, the prologue introduces an orphaned brother and sister. The plot of the story concerns the namesake, Al-Khadrabouna, a man whom the sister falls in love and whom her brother contacts on her behalf. A villain is found in the girl's neighbor, who sabotages their meeting out of jealousy and weds Al-Khadrabouna herself. In the d√©nouement, Al-Khadrabouna recognizes the neighbor's deceit and marries the sister instead. Hamad and Hamda is a story about two starving orphan siblings who set out on a journey to find a wealthy philanthropic Sultan who they believe can help alleviate their dire straits. Their journey is fraught with trials as they stave off starvation before falling in a well. A malicious jinn who resides within the well then threatens and frightens the two siblings. As the jinn was asleep, a miracle occurs as a ring worn by Hamad is revealed to have magic powers upon contact with the well wall and conjures an out-stretched snake for the children to climb and escape. Once out of the well, Hamad uses his magic ring to teleport them in front of the Sultan's son whom chauffeurs Hamda and Hamad to the Sultan's palace. Shortly after, the Sultan's son to propose to Hamda. The story ends with both siblings being offered a residence at the palace. The protagonist of Al-Sofra wal Qadah wal Mushaab is a woodworker who has a basic need for wood in order to earn a living and provide his family. As his area has been deforested, he had to embark on a journey in distant lands to find suitable clusters of trees. After arriving at a relatively densely treed area, he swung his axe into a tree thrice, only to summon a jinn on his third blow. The jinn identifies himself as a friendly spirit and awards the man with a magic table which conjures up food. Grateful, the man takes home the table and feeds his family, however, the family still complained of a lack of clothing and money. Therefore, the man returned the jinn, but upon the jinn's refusal for further assistance, he visited the Sultan and offered to trade him the table for supplies. He was scammed, being given only a pouch of rice and a sickly mule. He revisited and pleaded with the jinn, who this time provided him with a magic cup which would grant him anything he and his family should desire. He decided to take the cup to a blacksmith in order to secure it with chains to protect it against thieves. However, the blacksmith learned of the cup's secret and decided to pilfer it. This elicited the man to appeal to the genie for a third time, and was given a magical axe. The man then used this axe to exact revenge upon the blacksmith and Sultan, and was returned of his magical items. Al-Anzroot Seidlitzia rosmarinus, a common desert herb with medicinal properties growing on small sand mounds in Qatar Al-Anzroot revolves around a young man who has trouble with verbal memory. The protagonist is sent on an errand by his wife to collect the al anzroot plant, a dry herb with medicinal values. Along the way he forgets the name of the plant, and repetitively murmurs \\"mafeesh\\" (nothing) to himself. As he is walking along the coast, he encounters two superstitious fishermen who attribute their lack of catch to his repetition of \\"mafeesh\\". Thus, they hit him on the head and ordered him to repeat \\"two big, two small\\" instead in the hopes that it would help their chances. He then happened upon a burial service. His incessant muttering of the phrase \\"two big, two small\\" deeply offended the grieving family, causing one of them to strike him upon the head and ask him to repeat \\"May God have patience and reward you\\" instead. The next venue he appears at is a wedding ceremony, where he once again offends the audience by mourning their joyous occasion. This induced a member of the audience to slap his head and encourage him to instead say \\"May God bless your actions and bring you joy\\". In the proceeding twist of irony, he stumbles upon two siblings who are engaged in a physical altercation. The elder of the two turned and kicked the man after hearing him express happiness at their quarrel, and ordered him to state that \\"You should treat your brother better; be kind to him\\". This phrase was expressed while walking past a man who was shooing a dog away from a mosque, and the words were considered inappropriate by the onlooker. He thus hit him on his head, and asked that he repeat \\"Go away, dog!\\". Finally, the man's journey brought him to a leatherworker who was in the process of attempting to slice a piece of leather, holding it in his teeth while he steadied his incision. Hearing the words \\"Go away, dog!\\" deeply upset him, leading to yet another strike on the head and the leathersmith questioning him, \\"Do you want a slam with al-anzroot?\\", using the term as slang for a hardy, strong strike. Suddenly, the man remembered what he set out to find, and hugged the leathersmith in appreciation. Classified as a witticism, the moral of this story is intended to inform listeners to be conscientious of their speech and to recognize that the setting of a social situation and the timing of an utterance are critical factors in determining the appropriateness of what is said. The Golden Cow A tale recounted by Dhabiya Abdullah Al Sulaiti, this story revolves around a wealthy trader whose three marriages ended after his wives' deaths, with only his last marriage bearing him any children; a girl. Convicted by his love for his infant daughter, he vowed never to remarry to prevent potential mistreatment of her by his would-be spouse. As his daughter matured into a teenager, he soon realized that his daughter would need the guidance and care of a woman. Thus, he questioned her whether she would approve of him remarrying, and when she answered affirmatively, he wedded a new spouse. Fueled by jealousy, the new spouse would routinely abuse his daughter when she was not in her father's presence. This culminated in the young girl planning a stealthy escape from her household. In accordance with her plan, she visited a jeweler and, after explaining her predicament, commissioned him to construct a large golden cow which she could be concealed in. After making daily visits for an unspecified period, the jeweler had finally finished her project. He obligingly gave the girl the key for the golden cow, which she crawled in before being put on storefront display. A statue of a golden bull On occasion, the shop would be browsed by none other than the Ruler's son. Upon his next visit to the shop, he decided to buy the golden cow and place it in his personal chambers. The Ruler's son, who was accustomed to dining in his chambers, finished his meal before briefly leaving and locking his doors. Upon the man's exit, the girl stealthily ejected from the effigy and consumed the leftovers before returning to her hiding place. Bewildered by the recurrent disappearance of his food, he questioned his mother and his maid, but could find no answers, leading him to devise a plan to get to the bottom of the mystery. The plan, which consisted of him hiding in his bed after receiving food from his mother, was a success as he managed to observe the girl go about her routine. He confronted her as she finished eating, questioning her identity and motives. She confessed to the boy her mistreatment at the hands of her stepmother, and he was so swayed by her story that he offered her shelter. Furthermore, he requested that his mother bring food to his quarters every day, even on days that he would be away on international travels with his father. He refused to provide her with a reason when pressed, only stating that it was of the utmost importance that she respects his request. While the boy was on one such travel with his father, his mother was approached by the boy's cousin who pleaded with her to allow the golden cow to a centerpiece at her wedding. The mother reluctantly agreed and the golden cow, as well as the girl, were transported to the bride's wedding chambers. The next morning, when the girl awoke and arose from the cow for her morning breakfast, she was greeted by unfamiliar surroundings and the bride herself. A tense moment of silence briefly occurred between the two girls, before the bride, worrying that the young girl's beauty would attract the interests of her suitor, beat up and ejected the girl from her chambers. In a poor state after being beat up and left hungry, the girl passed out on the street only to be found by Fattoum, an elderly female water carrier. As Fattoum hadn't any children of her own, she saw their meeting as a blessing, and after arriving back home she continued to provide the girl with food and medical treatment. Meanwhile, the golden cow had been returned to the mother of the Ruler's son, but the next day she noticed a peculiarity as the food she had brought to his chambers remained untouched. She informed her son of this peculiarity upon his return, prompting him to ascertain whether the cow had been lent to anyone in his absence. When his mother answered truthfully, the boy fell into a deep depression. Subsequent medical visits could not determine the cause of his condition, hence he remained confined to his bed for years on end. Eventually, the boy's family opted for a stay-at- home folk healer who promised that he would be able to cure their son, but that it may take a period of months or even a year. The folk healer would regularly mix concoctions of flour and water which he would then heat in different townfolk's ovens before feeding the resulting bread to the Ruler's son. Nonetheless, no improvements were noted after eight months, leading many to suspect the folk healer of fraud. Suddenly, a moment of realization dawned on the folk healer after he concluded that he had borrowed every townsperson's oven except for Fattoum. He sent servants to Fattoum's house to carry out the same procedure, and after three consecutive days of feeding the Ruler's son bread baked in her oven, the boy started to show signs of recovery. It was suggested by the folk healer that it was not the bread, but instead the baker who was aiding his recovery. After Fattoum was questioned by the folk healer over the seemingly magical qualities of her bread, she reluctantly revealed that she was assisted by the young girl, and gave her up under the condition that she would be safeguarded from her stepmother. Fattoum also decided that she would see the young girl to the palace. Upon their arrival, the Ruler's son was overcome with happiness. He enthusiastically declared that it was \\"Allah's will\\" that Fattoum and the young girl came across one another, before offering her a residence in the palace alongside her new daughter and proposing to the young girl. The Thorn Tree This story starts off with an aging married woman who has yet to bear a child. While wandering through her neighborhood one day, her dress became entangled in a thorn tree, which she saw as a sign from God. At that point, she promised to God that if she were to be blessed with a child, then her child would look after the thorn tree. Over time, she fell pregnant and gave birth to a girl. As time went on and the girl aged, she had a mystifying incident while playing with her friends in the neighborhood in which she heard the tree demand that she hold her mother to her promise, \\"or else a grave will be dug for you\\". Unaware of what this meant, she ran home to report the incident to her mother. After her mother explained the original promise she made, she instructed her daughter on how to care for tree, reminding her to water it daily. A lone tree standing in the village of Al Ghuwariyah The tree gradually improved in health and appearance over the subsequent years. On one occasion while the girl was watering the tree, a man, who was unknown to her, stopped by the tree and asked her how many leaves the tree had, to which she replied with a question of her own: \\"how many stars are in the sky?\\" This back-and-forth exchange was repeated for a few days. The man, feeling disrespected that his question was answered with sarcasm, visited a local elderly woman named Umm Al-Heilan who was renowned for her cruelness in the hopes that he could learn of a way to win the argument. Umm Al-Heilan informed him that the girl comes by her house daily to play with her daughters, and proposed that he dress in woman's attire, i.e. an abaya and face veil, in order to trick the girl. The next day, the man did as was suggested by Umm Al-Heilan, and met the girl while she was visiting, exchanging pleasantries which included hugging and kissing on the cheek. On the next day, as the girl made her way to the tree, she encountered the same man waiting for her on horseback. They exchanged the same words as previous occasions, except for when the girl retorted with her question, she was stunned when the man revealed his plan the prior day, claiming that she should feel humiliated for having been tricked into kissing and hugging a male stranger. Angered by his deceit, she decided to invite the man for coffee under the tree the following day, during which she would have her revenge. Equipped with herbal medicines, food and alcohol, she rendezvoused with the man as planned, and plied him with alcohol until he passed out from intoxication. Although the man was found and taken home to his family, his recovery was slow and painful. Within the following days, the girl, disguised in traditional male clothing (including a ghutra, agal and thawb) peddled her herbal medicines throughout the neighborhood in the hopes that the man's family would employ her services. Her plan worked, and the man recovered in a matter of days. After fully recovered, he returned to the thorn tree, once again gloating of his deceitful trick and inquiring whether the girl was embarrassed. She responded by confessing that she had gotten him intoxicated, put cucumbers in his mouth and had successfully cured him. The man, astounded by her confession, could do no more than admit defeat. Kaltham Ali Al Ghanem was responsible for collating this particular folktale and documenting it in the second edition of Studies of Qatari Folklore, published by the Ministry of Culture and Sports. A'ssoom and A'rooy Sheep grazing in Ruwayda, northern Qatar Two sheep named A'ssoom and A'rooy are the main protagonists in this story recorded by Dhabiya Mohammed Al Khater. The story starts off in spring when the two sheep are grazing away from home. Strong rains started falling, inducing A'ssoom to try and convince A'rooy to return to their farm. A'rooy refused this suggestion in song, causing A'ssoom to feel humiliated. In retaliation, A'ssoom went to the wolf and asked him to devour A'rooy. The wolf declined A'ssooy's proposition, prompting her to ask the dog to hunt the wolf. When he declined, she went to their owner and asked him to abuse the dog. Upon his refusal, she ventured to the barber and requested that he shave off her owner's beard. Again daunted by refusal, she suggested to the fire that it set the barber's hut ablaze; this too was declined. When she asked the water to extinguish the fire, it refused, so she asked the camel to disperse the water, but was still met with refusal. She attempted to convince the gadash (a type of insect) to sting the camel, but he did not accept. In her final plea, she begged the rooster to scare the gadash into compliance, and was at last met with acceptance. After the rooster successfully startled the gadash, it attacked the camel, causing the camel to leap in and disperse the water, some of which spilled into the fire, inducing the fire to set the barber's house ablaze. The distraught barber then cut off the man's beard, which angered him into beating his dog, and in turn his dog pursued the wolf. Upon the wolf's arrival at the farmhouse, there was no sign of A'rooy, so he ironically consumed A'ssoom instead. Fictional beings Most of the figures from Islamic mythology are present in Qatari folklore, including angels, jinn (spirits), shaitan (devils), houris, and ghouls. As mentioned in the \\"Lord of the Sea\\" myth, the protagonist B≈´ DaryƒÅ is a malevolent half-man half- amphibian, who, according to some versions, attracts seafarers with a wailing call. This being bears some semblance with other sea-based mythological figures such as mermen and sirens. It is speculated that, since B≈´ DaryƒÅ is locally referred to as the 'lord of the sea', this myth may pre-date Wahhabism in Qatar since Wahhabi doctrine explicitly prohibits any entity other than Allah from being referred to as 'lord'. Talking animals, a universal element that is present across all cultures, are common in Qatari folklore. Folk heroes A sketch of Rahmah ibn Jabir drawn by Charles Ellms in his 1837 book The Pirates Own Book Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a, a seventh-century war poet who was born in modern-day northern Qatar, is revered as a folk hero in the country. A more contemporary folk hero can be found in Rahmah ibn Jabir Al Jalhami, an 18th- and 19th-century pirate and transitory ruler of the Qatar Peninsula. In his time, he was known as the \\"Scourge of the Pirate Coast\\". He also features prominently in Saudi folklore, specifically that of its Eastern Province. Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, often referred to as \\"The Founder\\", is a prominent folkloric figure, particularly due to his military achievements, his charitable donations and his promotion of Islam. He ruled Qatar for a period of over 30 years starting in 1878. Preservation After oil operations commenced in Qatar, a dramatic shift on societal customs was witnessed, resulting in a loss of cultural heritage. As folk stories were rarely documented in the past, there has been an urgency by Qatari authorities to preserve and record as much oral history as can be remembered. In particular, the Ministry of Culture and Sports (MCS) and local universities have been at the forefront of these efforts to transcribe Qatari folklore. The MCS and universities in Education City often collaborate with each other by jointly authoring books on Qatari folklore and organizing conferences. In 1983, a joint effort was launched by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states known as the Arab Gulf States Folklore Centre (AGSFC, later renamed the GCC States Folklore Centre), and was headquartered in Qatar's capital city, Doha. The center was responsible for releasing books in Arabic and English, holding conferences and organizing workshops related to Persian Gulf heritage. Furthermore, the center published a quarterly journal known as Al-Ma'thurat al-Sha'biya.

She died in 1919 in Odessa, executed by the police as ordered by the White Russians.  Biography  Jeanne Labourbe was born in Lapalisse, a small town South-East of Allier, where she worked from a young age at a laundry. Her father, Claude Labourbe, and her mother, Marie Labb√©, had 5 children together, of which Jeanne was the third. Since the bloody uprising of Lapalisse against the coup d'√©tat of 1851, a strong feeling of republicanism and social justice was deep rooted in the region. It was the incredible political commitment of Louis-Simon Dereure, one of the first leaders of the International Workingmen's Association and a member of the Paris Commune, that inspired Labourbe's political trajectory. In 1894, aged 17, Labourbe found a job offer to be a French reader in Poland, which was still a part of the Russian Empire at the time. She decided to leave for Poland and was hired as a governess and French reader for a Polish family from Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki. After several years, she became a teacher and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party at the time of the 1905 Russian Revolution. In 1917, she participated in the October Revolution and, on 30 August, 1918, she founded the French Communist Group in MoscowPoulat, E. (1979).

Georges Clemenceau, supporting the ideals of the Russian counter-revolutionaries, sent a squadron of the french maritime fleet to Odessa, looking to militarily suppress the spread of mutinies in the Black Sea. When Jeanne Labourbe found out about the landings, 18 December, 1918, she volunteered to help the port city in a policy of propaganda and defence of the Bolshevik Revolution. In particular, she published a Le Communiste newsletter, written in French, directed at the French forces. However, despite their efforts, the city of Odessa fell to the influence of the White Russians.

Her concern at the lack of black women represented in the visual arts has led her to concentrate solely on making images of women of color. Early life and education Nydia Blas was born in 1981, and grew up in Ithaca, New York. Blas received her bachelor's degree from Ithaca College in cinema and photography with a minor in African diaspora studies. She received her Master of Fine Arts in photography from Syracuse University. Photography Blas began making photographs as a teenager. At first, she was interested in photography as a process, particularly trying and failing until the desired product is achieved. She then became intrigued with photography as a means to influence public opinion, citing the use of photographs by the anti-lynching movement to turn the public against lynching. Blas's photographs explore black identity, particularly young black women and girls. Blas stated that she draws inspiration from Audre Lorde's concept of \\"the erotic\\", which includes not just sexuality but also intimacy among family members and friends. One of her photo series is entitled The Girls Who Spun Gold. The name of the photo series comes from a Virginia Hamilton book The Girl Who Spun Gold, which is an African-American interpretation of the classic fairytale Rumpelstiltskin. Priscilla Frank of HuffPost called the series \\"a celebration of girls in all their sloppiness, softness and strength\\". Most of the subjects of Blas's photographs are black women. In a 2016 interview, Blas noted the lack of black women represented in visual arts, stating \\"This is why I have I chosen to currently make images of only women of color.\\" Blas believes that her work challenges the notion of black women as \\"hypersexual beings\\", saying that the stereotype was created \\"to reinforce very old stereotypes that were created to justify the mistreatment and exploitation of black women during slavery\\". The subjects of her photographs instead express sexuality on their own terms, reclaiming \\"their identities and their bodies\\". Blas's work has been displayed at The Wing in New York City and Washington, D.C.; her work was also included in an exhibition called Vigilance, Struggle, Pride: Through Her Eyes that traveled through Europe. In 2016, Blas was a Visual Artist-In-Residence at the Center for Photography at Woodstock. In 2018, her photo series Whatever You Like was displayed at the Garey Gallery. Also in 2018, she was one of three recipients of a Light Work grant. Some of her photographs were included in the book Mfon: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora, \\"an anthology featuring the work of more than 100 female photographers of African descent from around the world\\". One of the authors of the book, Adama Delphine Fawundu, referred to Blas's work as \\"striking\\", saying: Community organizer In January 2017, Blas was named as the Acting Executive Director of the Southside Community Center. As of 2018, she was one of the two leaders of the Center, the other being Nia Nunn. Blas and Nunn created an outreach campaign they named \\"Black Girl Alchemists\\", which they targeted at young black women in Ithaca, New York. The campaign encouraged these women to express themselves through literature and art to combat internalized racism and sexism. They won a US$270,000 grant in 2016 to continue their efforts centered on black cultural identity. While working at the Southside Community Center, Blas founded the Girl Empowerment Group. Blas acted as a mentor to the girls in the group, encouraging them to keep diaries, teaching them about self esteem, and organizing events for other teenagers in the black community. Members of the Girl Empowerment Group later became the subjects of her photo series The Girls Who Spun Gold. Through her photographs of the young women, Blas hopes that her subjects can reclaim their identities and their bodies, stating: \\"I wanted my subjects to reclaim, explore, and protect their bodies and sexuality, and to reveal the magic that happens between women and self. I would like this work to state that black and brown females have a right to pleasure and a right to fantasy.\\" Personal life Blas had her first child when she was 18 years old. As of 2019, she has three children. She stated that her experience as a mother \\"runs through all of my work\\".

Description  Rudbeckia texana is a robust perennial growing up to 150 cm (59 in) tall by 30 cm (12 in) wide. It has alternate, mostly basal leaves 9‚Äì20 cm long. The leaves have a leathery texture and are elliptic in shape. Flowering stems appear in the spring, each stem terminating with between 1 and 4 composite flower heads. Flowers have a conical shape and are about 2.0‚Äì4.5 cm tall, 1‚Äì1.5 cm wide with yellow ray florets circling a conspicuous dark brown dome-shaped cone of many small disc florets.  Taxonomy  Because of its morphological differences from Rudbeckia nitida, R. texana was elevated from varietal to species level in 1989.  Distribution and habitat  Rudbeckia texana can be found in western Louisiana and eastern Texas, primarily in remnant wet prairies and along railroads and highways.  Ecology  Like other members of the genus Rudbeckia, R. texana is likely an important source of pollen for native bees, especially Adrena rudbeckiae. Rudbeckia texana blooms between May and November.  Conservation  The Texas coneflower is sensitive to overgrazing, plowing, and other forms of degradation.

Among the most popular coaches in North America, they're manufactured in Pembina, North Dakota, United States. MCI introduced the 102D3 in 1994 to replace the 102B3 and 102C3 models, equipped with obsolete two- stroke engines. The 102D3 was the original designation, used from 1994 through 2001, when MCI changed its name to D4000. The coach uses MCI's platform integral construction, which has come to dominate the US and Canada markets, allowing high durability and easy maintenance. It has a much longer service life than body-on-chassis coaches. Development MCI developed the 102D3 from earlier 102B3 and 102C3 coaches, which had engine compartment too small to fit the new Detroit Diesel Series 60 engines. These four-stroke engines also powered the larger 102DL3 coaches. MCI added an optional wheelchair lift. In the future a lift would be mandatory under ADA regulations. The 102D3 entered production January 1992, followed by introduction into service with Royal Blue Tours, Chameleon Express, Lemi Tours, Gulf Transportation, and Indian Trails. Later the same year, it entered service with Peoria Charter Coach Company, Eyre Bus Service, Kerrville Bus Company, Greyhound's Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma Coaches division, and Trailways of New York. Like its larger sibling the 102DL3, the 102D3 was immediately known for its high speed and the durability of its integral construction, albeit at a smaller size than the 102DL3. Greyhound Canada, which had owned MCI during the development process, introduced the 102D3 in 1995. Variants Santa Clarita Transit of Santa Clarita, California.  MCI 102D3  The original version was the 102D3, entering production in 1994. The 102D3 has large, block fender skirts and a rear-mounted radiator fan side-by-side with the intercooler fan. It has an air intake covered by a large grille, two piece engine door, small headlight/taillights, and a black roof cap. The seating capacity was 46 or 47 passengers, or 49-53 with the high-density configuration. In 2001, MCI renamed the 102D3 as D4000. Greyhound operated a fleet of 98 102D3s. Greyhound Canada operated a further 20 102D3s. MCI D4000 The D4000 was exactly the same coach as the 102D3, renamed by MCI in 2001 to promote a new, simplified designation system. MCI replaced the D4000 with the D4000CL and D4000CT in 2005.CNG-powered MCI D4000CT Commuter Coach, operating for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation.|alt=|left MCI D4000N The D4000N was a narrow variant of the D4000, only 96 inches wide instead of the standard 102 inches.

It has a modified roof (with no visible rivets) and optional frameless passenger windows. In 2008, the D4000CL received a higher passenger deck for increased luggage capacity.  MCI D4000CT  The D4000CT was a modernized version of the D4000. It received enlarged headlights from the G-Series, revised roof (with no visible rivets), and optional rimless passenger windows. In 2008, the D4000CT received a higher passenger deck for increased luggage capacity. The D4000CT is also offered with a Cummins Westport ISX12 G, ISX12N, or ISL G CNG engine.

Description Boronia corynophylla is a spreading, densely branched shrub that grows to a height of about with its branches covered with soft hairs. It has simple, thin cylindrical to narrow spindle-shaped or club- shaped leaves long and about wide. The flowers are pale red and are borne singly or in groups of up to three on the end of the stems, each on a pedicel long with two tiny bracteoles at the base. The four sepals are egg-shaped, dark reddish brown, long and hairy with many pimply glands. The four petals are egg-shaped and leathery, about long with their bases overlapping. The eight stamens are club-shaped with those nearest the sepals slightly longer than those near the petals. Taxonomy and naming Boronia corynophylla was first formally described in 1998 by Paul G.

Toponyms of Population centers in Turkey *Adana: from the Hittite URUAdaniya of Kizzuwatna,See, e.g., Sirekli Archaeological Project. alternatives: related to the legendary character Danaus, Greek tribe Danaoi, Egyptian enemy country Danaja, Mycenaean refugees Dananayim or Danuna, and Da- na-vo (people living by the river), Scythian nomad people. *Adƒ±yaman: As the official Ottoman Turkish name Hƒ±sn-ƒ± Mansur (\\"Castle of Mansur\\", or Kurdish variation Sems√ªr) was difficult for the locals to pronounce, people were referring the city as adƒ± (its name) yaman (though) since the early 19th century, u.e. \\"its name is tough\\" or \\"(the place) whose name is tough\\" in Turkish. *Afyonkarahisar: from , \\"poppy, opium\\", kara \\"black\\", hisar \\"fortress\\"., i.e. The black castle of the Opium city' in Turkish (The area around has a long tradition of growing opium for the drug industry and was subject of much controversy when under US pressure Turkey forbade opium growing for a period in the seventies). *Aƒürƒ±: From Aƒürƒ± (Ararat) Daƒüƒ±‚Äé (mountain).

Under the Byzantine Empire it became known as Kalonoros or Kalon Oros, meaning \\"beautiful/fine mountain\\" in Greek, In Italian Candelore or Cardelloro.). In his 1935 visit, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk finalized the name in the new alphabet as Alanya, changing the 'i' and 'e' in Alaiye, reportedly because of a misspelled telegram in 1933. *Aliaƒüa: after a member of the influential Karaosmanoƒüullarƒ± ayan family, Karaosmanoƒülu Ali Aƒüa, who owned an estate here. *Amasya: From the Greek name ·ºàŒºŒ¨œÉŒµŒπŒ± comes from Amasis, the queen of the Amazons, who were said to have lived here.

At the beginning of the 14th century it came under the domain of the Karasids and grew as it attracted migrants. In Ottoman times, it was also known as Kemer and attached to Edremit until 1866. *Bursa: After Prusias I, the King of Bithynia who in 202 BC. was granted the Greek city of Cius, which rebuilt the city and renamed it Prusa (; sometimes rendered as Prussa) *√áanakkale: From √áanakkale ceramics, compared by one traveler to Delftware, and an Ottoman fortress called Kale-i Sultaniye () or Sultaniye kalesi (Fortress of the Sultan). As of 1920, the British began to call √áanakkale, Chanak and Kale Sultanie in their reporting.

(1988). \\"Bayazit,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Iranica III.8, 1988, pp.886-887 Bayazit . was repaired many times throughout history. Ultimately, the town was renamed Beyazit itself in the 16th century and later in the 1930s a new town was built in the plain below the old site, hence the new name \\"Doƒüubayazƒ±t\\", which literally means \\"East Beyazƒ±t\\". *D√ºzce: From D√ºzce Pazar (Flattish Bazaar or market on flat ground) a marketplace on the plain 8 km from the historical Konuralp, the seat of the Turkish conqueror of the area on behalf of Osman I at 13th century. *Edirne: From Adrianople (Hadrianopolis in Latin or Adrianoupolis in Greek, founded by the Roman emperor Hadrian on the site of a previous Thracian settlement named Uskudama), *Edremit, Balƒ±kesir: From the original in Greek Adramyttion () or Adramytteion (ŒÜŒ¥œÅŒ±ŒºœçœÑœÑŒµŒπŒøŒΩ) *Enez: From the original in Greek Ainos (), Latinized as Aenus. *Erbaa: From \\"Erbaa\\" means \\"four\\" in Arabic.

This is the name (·ºàŒ∫ŒπŒªŒπœÉŒ∑ŒΩŒÆ in Greek) by which it is called by Strabo in his Geography, 11.4.14. The etymological origin of the word is disputed, but it is agreed that the city was once called Erez. For a while it was called Justinianopolis in honour of Emperor Justinian. In more recent Greek it has been called as ŒöŒµŒªœÑŒ∂Œ∑ŒΩŒÆ (Keltzene) and ŒöŒµŒªŒµŒ∂Œ∑ŒΩŒÆ (Kelezene)Raymond Janin, v.

Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1978, vol. 4, p. 93. *Eski≈üehir: The name Eski≈üehir literally means \\"Old City\\" in Turkish; indeed, the city was founded by the Phrygians in at least 1000 BC, although it has been estimated to be older than 4000 years old. The city was known as Dorylaeum (ŒîŒøœÅœçŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ) in Greek under the Roman Christian era. *Fethiye: In 1934, the city was renamed 'Fethiye' in honor of one of the first pilots of the Ottoman Air Force, killed in 1914 by Al-Samra.Letter from Kibbutz Ha‚ÄôOn: Fallen Flyers Hadassah Magazine, 17 March 2014 Modern Fethiye is located on the site of the ancient city of Telmessos. Over the centuries, it has been called Telmissos, Anastasioupolis, Makre, Makri (ŒúŒ¨Œ∫œÅŒ∑, \\"long one\\") and Beskaza during the Turkish period. *Gaziantep: formerly called Antep or Aƒ´ntƒÅb (ÿπŸäŸÜ ÿ™ÿßÿ®) in Ottoman Turkish, ‚ÄòAƒ´ntƒÅb (ÿπŸäŸÜÿ™ÿßÿ®) in Arabic, there are several theories for the origin of its name: ** A√Øntap may be derived from khantap, meaning \\"king's land\\" in the Hittite language. ** A√Øn, an Arabic and Aramaic word meaning \\"spring\\", and tab as a word of praise. ** Antep could be a corruption of the Arabic ‚Äòaƒ´n ·π≠ayyib meaning \\"good spring\\". However, the Arabic name for the city is spelled with t (ÿ™), not ·π≠ (ÿ∑). ** Ayin dab or Ayin debo in Aramaic, meaning \\"spring of the wolf\\" ** The Crusaders called the city and its castle \\"Hantab\\", \\"Hamtab\\", and \\"Hatab\\".Gƒìorg A.

Ottoman records contains these variations: Geyb√ºyze, Geyb√ºveyze, Geyib√ºveyze, Geyiboyze, Geykivize. Evliya Celebi in one of his trips called it Kekbeziye, in another trip he gave the sentence \\"Gel bize\\" (come to us in Turkish) as explanation for the origin. *Gelibolu: from , Kallipolis, \\"Beautiful City\\"ŒöŒ±ŒªŒªŒØœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus project *Giresun: formerly Cerasus (ŒöŒµœÅŒ±œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ) in Greek. the etymology might be related to the Greek word Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÉœåœÇ (keras√≥s) \\"cherry\\" + -ŒøœÖŒΩœÑ (a place marker). Thus, the Greek root of the word \\"cherry\\", Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÉœåœÇ (keras√≥s), predates the name of the city, and the ultimate origin of the word cherry (and thus the name of the city) is probably from a Pre-Greek substrate, likely of Anatolian origin, given the intervocalic œÉ in ŒöŒµœÅŒ±œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ and the apparent cognates of it found in other languages the region. Another theory derives Kerasous from Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ (keras) \\"horn\\" + -ŒøœÖŒΩœÑ (a place marker), for the prominent horn-shaped peninsula that the city is situated on (compare with the Greek name for the horn-shaped Golden Horn waterway in Istanbul, ŒöŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ (Keras) \\"Horn\\"). The toponym would have later mutated into Kerasunt (sometimes written K√©rasounde or Kerassunde), and the word \\"cherry\\" (as well as its cognates found in other local languages) was derived from the name of the city itself, rather than the other way around. *G√∂cek, Fethiye: possibly from Turkish male name meaning young, fresh, beautiful. The word also is used to mean one foot tall young wheat plant. *G√ºll√ºk: Literally \\"for roses\\" or rose garden. *G√ºm√º≈ühane: From G√ºm√º≈ü (Silver), and Hane (house) i.e. Silver house in Turkish. Name due to the many silver mines in the area. The greec population used for a while in the 19th century the unofficial translation to Argyr√≥polis or Arghyropolis, *Hakkari: unclear name origin (undocumented suggestions: Hakkar tribe, hak-kar-in = can- do-just) *Iƒüdƒ±r: after a western Turkish clan called Iƒüdƒ±r that belonged to a branch of the Oghuz Turks. *ƒ∞skenderun: From Alxander the great *Isparta: from , Baris/ŒíŒ¨œÅŒπœÇ in Byzantine Greek *ƒ∞stanbul: Derived from the Medieval Greek phrase (pronounced ), which means \\"to the city\\",Necdet Sakaoƒülu (1993/94a): \\"ƒ∞stanbul'un adlarƒ±\\" [\\"The names of Istanbul\\"].

Names used in English prior to official Turkish Latinization include Ismid, Iskimid, and Isnikmid.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th ed., s.v. *ƒ∞zmir: from original Greek name \\"Smyrna\\" and \\"Smyrne\\" (Œ£ŒºœçœÅŒΩŒ∑) *Kahramanmara≈ü: *Kandƒ±ra: From K√©ndri or K√°ndora. *Karab√ºk: From Kara (black) and b√ºk (bush) i.e. black bush in Turkish. Karab√ºk was built in the 1930s as the seat of the iron and steel industry of Turkey. *Karaman: From Karaman Bey who was one of the rulers of the Karamanid dynasty. The former name was Laranda which in turn comes from the Luwian language Larawanda, literally \\"sandy, a sandy place\\".Bilge Umar. T√ºrkiye'deki Tarihsel Adlar. ƒ∞nkƒ±lap Kitabevi, 1993. . *Kars: As Chorzene, the town appears in Roman historiography (Strabo) as part of ancient Armenia. For the origin of the name \\"Kars\\", some sources claim it to be derived from the Georgian word ·Éô·Éê·É†·Éò (kari), meaning \\"the gate\\" as was the case for other border region strongholds while other sources claim it is from the Armenian word ’∞’°÷Ä’Ω (hars), meaning \\"bride\\", or rather from ’Ø’°’º’∏÷Ç÷Å ’¢’•÷Ä’§ (ka·πõuts berd), \\"Ka·πõuts Fortress\\". The Turkish etymology offered by M. Fahrettin Kƒ±rzƒ±oƒülu (that the name came from the \\"Karsak\\", a Turkish tribe), has been dismissed as unsustainable by scholars.Bartold, Vasily-[C. J. Heywood]. \\"Kars.\\" Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1997, vol. 4, p. 669. *Kastamonu: The city is believed to have been founded in the 18th century BC. The town was known as Timonion (Œ§ŒπŒºœåŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ in Greek) during the Roman period. The change of name of the town dates to the 10th century AD. Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, a Thracian soldier who became a prominent general and the father of the Byzantine emperor Isaac I Komnenos, was given lands around Kastamonu by Emperor Basil II and built a fortress there named Kastra Komnenon (ŒöŒ¨œÉœÑœÅŒ± ŒöŒøŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ). Manuel came to the notice of Basil II because of his defence, in 978, of Nicaea against the rebel Bardas Skleros.Runciman, pp. 54-55 The name Kastra Komnenon was shortened to Kastamone, and later turkified to Kastamoni and Kastamonu. *Karata≈ü: From Kara (black) and ta≈ü (stone) i.e. black stone in Turkish. *Ka≈ü: in the 1600s the Lord of Teke observed Ka≈ü and Meis from the top of the hill and said, \\"If the islet of Meis Adasƒ± is the eye, then this place will be its ka≈ü (eyebrow in Turkish).\\" It seems Ka≈ü was founded by the Lycians, as Habesos or Habesa. In the Hellenistic period and under the Roman Empire it served as the port of Phellus. It was called Andifli under Arab, Seljuks, and Ottomans, and Ka≈ü since the 1600s. *Kayseri: originally called Mazaka or Mazaca by the Hattians and was known as such to Strabo, during whose time it was the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia, known also as Eusebia at the Argaeus (Œï·ΩêœÉŒ≠Œ≤ŒµŒπŒ± ·º° œÄœÅ·Ω∏œÇ œÑ·ø∂Œπ ·ºàœÅŒ≥Œ±ŒØœâŒπ in Greek), after Ariarathes V Eusebes, King of Cappadocia (163‚Äì130 BC). The name was changed again by Archelaus (d. 17 AD), last King of Cappadocia (36 BC‚Äì14 AD) and a Roman vassal, to \\"Caesarea in Cappadocia\\" (to distinguish it from other cities with the name Caesarea in the Roman Empire) in honour of Caesar Augustus, upon his death in 14 AD. When the Muslim Arabs arrived, they adapted the pronunciation to their writing resulting in Kaisariyah (note that letter C in classical Latin was pronounced K), and this eventually became Kayseri when the Seljuk Turks took control of the city in circa 1080, remaining as such ever since. *Kazlƒ±√ße≈üme, Zeytinburnu: from the historic fountain () with a relief goose () figure below the fountain's inscription, which dates it back to Hijri year AH 953 (AD 1537). *Kilis: In the tablets belonging to the Assyrian period, the name 'Ki-li-zi' is written in cuneiform and a city named as \\"Ciliza Sive Urnagiganti\\" during the Roman Empire period is mentioned. *Kƒ±rklareli: From 'Kƒ±rk' (Forty) and 'El' (Area), i.e. The land of the forties in Turkish. *Kƒ±r≈üehir: From 'Kƒ±r' (grey / steppe ) and '≈üehir' (city), i.e. The grey / steppe city in Turkish. *Kƒ±rƒ±kkale: From 'Kƒ±rƒ±k' (broken) and 'kale' (castle), i.e. The broken castle in Turkish. *Konya: from (icon), as an ancient Greek legend ascribed its name to the \\"eikon\\" (image), or the \\"gorgon's (Medusa's) head\\", with which Perseus vanquished the native population before founding the city. if not hellenised from an earlier Luvian name. *Ku≈üadasƒ±: From 'Ku≈ü' (bird) and 'ada' (islet), i.e. The island of birds in Turkish. *K√ºtahya: From the original in Greek Kotyaion, Latinized in Roman times as Cotyaeum.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04422a.htm Catholic Encyclopaedia: Cotiaeum. *Malatya: From the Hittite Malidiya (melid or milit which means \\"honey\\"). *Manisa: From Magnesia () the place where the original magnetic rocks came from. *Mardin: From a Syriac/Assyrian Neo-Aramaic language name translating to \\"fortress\\" used as the Roman period name Marida (Merida),Fraternit√© Chr√©tienne Sarthe-Orient, \\"Marida (Mardin)\\" suggesting Mardin as a plural \\"fortresses\\". *Marmara Ereƒülisi: From name given 300 AD as Heraclea (·º©œÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπŒ±). *Marmaris: From the Turkish word mermer, Greek m√†rmaron (marble) in reference to the rich deposits of marble in the region. *Mersin: From Mersin Bey, a leader of the Oghuz Turks, a local clan named Mersinoƒüullarƒ± reported by Evliya √áelebi *Milas: From ancient name (, Mylasa) associated with Lycians *Muƒüla: From ancient name Mobolla *Mu≈ü: From Mushki the ancient clan with clover as sign that built the original castle later demolished by Suleiman the Magnificent *Nazilli: According to legend, the son of Aydƒ±n's governor in the Ottoman period, fell in love with a young woman from Pazark√∂y but was rejected by the girl's father.

The Montenegrin detachment in that war was led by Jovan Lipovac. Lekso was remembered for killing a Japanese warrior in a duel before the battle in 1905. Because of this victory, he was decorated with Russian Orden. The Russian government ordered him forty Napoleons in gold annually for the rest of his life. In Manchuria he was promoted to the rank of captain and until the end of the war commanded the cavalry of the Dragon regiment. The saber, which Lekso won the duel with, is preserved today at the Military Museum in Moscow.

She made valuable contributions with her writing to the work of temperance and social purity, and frequently addressed large audiences on these subjects. She took a most conspicuous part in the temperance crusade of her state, riding many miles on her lecture trips, and sometimes holding three or four meetings at different locations within a day. In 1885, she was made the Iowa superintendent of the \\"White Shield and White Cross\\" work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). She was one of the managing editors of the Dial of Progress of Mount Pleasant. Early years and education Cordelia Throop was born in the town of Hamilton, New York, November 17, 1833. Her parents were George A. and Deborah (Goldsmith) Throop. Her mother died in March 1836, when Cordelia was two years of age. Her father died when she was young, leaving Cordelia and a brother, James, two years younger than herself. She was then taken in charge by her grandparents, Richard and Ruth Goldsmith. She received her education in what was then Hamilton Academy (now Colgate University). Having religious aspirations, she had decided to go as a missionary to India when her school days were over, but this was subsequently abandoned, by reason of marked change in religious belief. Just before graduation, she accepted an offer to live with an aunt and an uncle in Galesburg, Illinois, and fill a position as a teacher in that locale. Career William Ramey Cole She was for four years principal in a private seminary for young people in Keokuk, Iowa, under the management of R. M. Reynolds, and accepted later a similar position in the North Illinois Institute at Henry, Illinois. Here, in 1856, she married William Ramey Cole. In 1863, Mr. and Mrs. Cole, with their three young boys, went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Mr. Cole took a course in Harvard Divinity School, was ordained as a Unitarian minister, and went to Mount Pleasant, Iowa. From 1876 to 1884, she was secretary of the Iowa Unitarian Association. She could do this work from the home, being otherwise devoted to family life and the education of her children, E. C, Ralph G., H. A., Clara, Ollieand Arthur; lost one daughter. An important part of her work at this time was the development of the post office mission, which became a firmly-established branch of Unitarian work. She was often called to fill vacancies in the pulpit of the denomination, and on two occasions gave the charge at ordination services. In 1885, she was made state superintendent of the Iowa WCTU department of the \\"White Shield and the White Cross.\\" In this work, she attended conferences, formed religious clubs, and road many miles to meet an appointment, sometimes holding three or four meetings at different locations within twenty-four hours. Cole delivered hundreds of addresses in Iowa and other states. She was at one time assistant to Frances Willard, but in 1889, on the division among the workers, growing out of the political affiliations of the large body, she resigned. After the non-partisan organization of the National WCTU, she accepted the position of national superintendent, still maintaining her allegiance to the Iowa work. In 1896, she was general secretary of the Iowa Prohibitory Amendment League, a state body which had its headquarters at Mount Pleasant. Cole also became involved in the WCTU's social purity movement in the 1880s and 1890s. She made hundreds of public addresses. She served as vice-president for Iowa of the American Purity Alliance. Her lectures to women audiences were a marked feature of her work, and her published leaflets, Helps in Mother Work and A Manual for Social Purity Workers, were considered admirable. With her husband, she edited the Champion of Progress, a state paper, published at Mount Pleasant. Cole was interested in public affairs and literature. She led the first Reading Clubs of Mount Pleasant, and was a co- founder of the Ladies Library Association. She died at Mount Pleasant, April 29, 1900, and was buried at Forest Home Cemetery, in Mount Pleasant.

It originates from the Chern's unanswered question: > Consider closed minimal submanifolds M^n immersed in the unit sphere S^{n+m} > with second fundamental form of constant length whose square is denoted by > \\\\sigma. Is the set of values for \\\\sigma discrete? What is the infimum of > these values of \\\\sigma > \\\\frac{n}{2-\\\\frac{1}{m}}? The first question, i.e., whether the set of values for œÉ is discrete, can be reformulated as follows: > Let M^n be a closed minimal submanifold in \\\\mathbb{S}^{n+m} with the second > fundamental form of constant length, denote by \\\\mathcal{A}_n the set of all > the possible values for the squared length of the second fundamental form of > M^n, is \\\\mathcal{A}_n a discrete? Its affirmative hand, more general than the Chern's conjecture for hypersurfaces, sometimes also referred to as the Chern's conjecture and is still, as of 2018, unanswered even with M as a hypersurface (Chern proposed this special case to the Shing-Tung Yau's open problems' list in differential geometry in 1982): > Consider the set of all compact minimal hypersurfaces in S^N with constant > scalar curvature. Think of the scalar curvature as a function on this set. > Is the image of this function a discrete set of positive numbers? Formulated alternatively: > Consider closed minimal hypersurfaces M \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{S}^{n+1} with > constant scalar curvature k. Then for each n the set of all possible values > for k (or equivalently S) is discrete This became known as the Chern's conjecture for minimal hypersurfaces in spheres (or Chern's conjecture for minimal hypersurfaces in a sphere) This hypersurface case was later, thanks to progress in isoparametric hypersurfaces' studies, given a new formulation, now known as Chern's conjecture for isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres (or Chern's conjecture for isoparametric hypersurfaces in a sphere): > Let M^n be a closed, minimally immersed hypersurface of the unit sphere > S^{n+1} with constant scalar curvature. Then M is isoparametric Here, S^{n+1} refers to the (n+1)-dimensional sphere, and n ‚â• 2. In 2008, Zhiqin Lu proposed a conjecture similar to that of Chern, but with \\\\sigma + \\\\lambda_2 taken instead of \\\\sigma: > Let M^n be a closed, minimally immersed submanifold in the unit sphere > \\\\mathbb{S}^{n+m} with constant \\\\sigma + \\\\lambda_2. If \\\\sigma + \\\\lambda_2 > > n, then there is a constant \\\\epsilon(n, m) > 0 such that\\\\sigma + \\\\lambda_2 > > n + \\\\epsilon(n, m) Here, M^n denotes an n-dimensional minimal submanifold; \\\\lambda_2 denotes the second largest eigenvalue of the semi-positive symmetric matrix S := (\\\\left \\\\langle A^\\\\alpha, B^\\\\beta \\\\right \\\\rangle) where A^\\\\alphas (\\\\alpha = 1, \\\\cdots, m) are the shape operators of M with respect to a given (local) normal orthonormal frame. \\\\sigma is rewritable as {\\\\left \\\\Vert \\\\sigma \\\\right \\\\Vert}^2. Another related conjecture was proposed by Robert Bryant (mathematician): > A piece of a minimal hypersphere of \\\\mathbb{S}^4 with constant scalar > curvature is isoparametric of type g \\\\le 3 Formulated alternatively: > Let M \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{S}^4 be a minimal hypersurface with constant scalar > curvature. Then M is isoparametric Chern's conjectures hierarchically Put hierarchically and formulated in a single style, Chern's conjectures (without conjectures of Lu and Bryant) can look like this: * The first version (minimal hypersurfaces conjecture): > Let M be a compact minimal hypersurface in the unit sphere \\\\mathbb{S}^{n+1}. > If M has constant scalar curvature, then the possible values of the scalar > curvature of M form a discrete set * The refined/stronger version (isoparametric hypersurfaces conjecture) of the conjecture is the same, but with the \\"if\\" part being replaced with this: > If M has constant scalar curvature, then M is isoparametric * The strongest version replaces the \\"if\\" part with: > Denote by S the squared length of the second fundamental form of M. Set a_k > = (k - \\\\operatorname{sgn}(5-k))n, for k \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ ; 1 \\\\le m > \\\\le 5 \\\\\\\\}. Then we have: * For any fixed k \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ ; 1 > \\\\le m \\\\le 4 \\\\\\\\}, if a_k \\\\le S \\\\le a_{k+1}, then M is isoparametric, and S > \\\\equiv a_k or S \\\\equiv a_{k+1} * If S \\\\ge a_5, then M is isoparametric, and > S \\\\equiv a_5 Or alternatively: > Denote by A the squared length of the second fundamental form of M. Set a_k > = (k - \\\\operatorname{sgn}(5-k))n, for k \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ ; 1 \\\\le m > \\\\le 5 \\\\\\\\}. Then we have: * For any fixed k \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ ; 1 > \\\\le m \\\\le 4 \\\\\\\\}, if a_k \\\\le {\\\\left \\\\vert A \\\\right \\\\vert}^2 \\\\le a_{k+1}, then > M is isoparametric, and {\\\\left \\\\vert A \\\\right \\\\vert}^2 \\\\equiv a_k or {\\\\left > \\\\vert A \\\\right \\\\vert}^2 \\\\equiv a_{k+1} * If {\\\\left \\\\vert A \\\\right \\\\vert}^2 > \\\\ge a_5, then M is isoparametric, and {\\\\left \\\\vert A \\\\right \\\\vert}^2 \\\\equiv > a_5 One should pay attention to the so-called first and second pinching problems as special parts for Chern. Other related and still open problems Besides the conjectures of Lu and Bryant, there're also others: In 1983, Chia-Kuei Peng and Chuu-Lian Terng proposed the problem related to Chern: > Let M be a n-dimensional closed minimal hypersurface in S^{n+1}, n \\\\ge 6. > Does there exist a positive constant \\\\delta(n) depending only on n such that > if n \\\\le n + \\\\delta(n), then S \\\\equiv n, i.e., M is one of the Clifford > torus S^k\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k}{n}}\\\\right) \\\\times > S^{n-k}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n-k}{n}}\\\\right), k = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n-1? In 2017, Li Lei, Hongwei Xu and Zhiyuan Xu proposed 2 Chern-related problems. The 1st one was inspired by Yau's conjecture on the first eigenvalue: > Let M be an n-dimensional compact minimal hypersurface in \\\\mathbb{S}^{n+1}. > Denote by \\\\lambda_1(M) the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator acting > on functions over M: * Is it possible to prove that if M has constant scalar > curvature, then \\\\lambda_1(M) = n? * Set a_k = (k - > \\\\operatorname{sgn}(5-k))n. Is it possible to prove that if a_k \\\\le S \\\\le > a_{k+1} for some k \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ ; 2 \\\\le m \\\\le 4 \\\\\\\\}, or S \\\\ge > a_5, then \\\\lambda_1(M) = n? The second is their own generalized Chern's conjecture for hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature: > Let M be a closed hypersurface with constant mean curvature H in the unit > sphere \\\\mathbb{S}^{n+1}: * Assume that a \\\\le S \\\\le b, where a < b and \\\\left > [ a, b \\\\right ] \\\\cap I = \\\\left \\\\lbrace a, b \\\\right \\\\rbrace.

Background and production  The film was produced with funding from European External Action Service program for film development in Africa and the promotion of human rights. Filming took place in Porto Alegre and in various locations on the island of S√£o Tom√©. Arag√£o created the film in order to highlight the issues facing girls in her country, to expose the taboo associated with the topic, and to promote resolution of these problems through education. The issue is recognized as a serious problem in S√£o Tom√© and Principe. Arag√£o has stated that violence and discrimination towards girls are the main reasons they drop out of school, and that she intentionally did not depict her main character, T√≥nia, as quitting her education in spite of the extreme hardships she faced. \\"I chose to show a young girl's empowerment through education...

They began slowly migrating to Europe around 100,000 years ago, where they encountered Neanderthals. DNA extracted from Neanderthal remains and compared to contemporary human DNA showed that Homo sapiens mated with Homo neanderthalensis. Today, Europeans have Neanderthal genes in about 2% of their genome. The book also investigates the lineage of European kings. DNA has enabled geneticists to construct their family trees going back to Charlemagne in the 8th century. Rutherford shows that family trees are not neat and tidy, but tangled webs. They often collapse in on themselves as a result of inbreeding. King Charles II's family tree was particularly bad as a result of incest in the family. Their rational for this practice was to preserve their \\"royal blood\\", and this often had an adverse effect on their health; Charles himself was disabled, epileptic and mentally unstable. The book discusses the genes responsible for some human traits, including red hair, earwax and lactose intolerance/lactase persistence. Racial classification is shown to be a scientifically invalid concept. The genome encodes a huge number of characteristics that differ from person to person, which far outnumber the physical differences between black and white people. Rutherford concludes that genetics cannot be used to define race. Francis Galton and his contribution to the development of eugenics is also examined. The Human Genome Project revealed that humans only have about 20,000 genes, far fewer than scientists expected, and ended up posing more questions than it answered. The project also highlighted the limits of genetics and that it is no panacea for diseases. Rutherford criticises the popular press for their inaccurate reporting on genetics, and companies conducting DNA ancestry tests that produce impossibly accurate results. He says these companies and the press often overlook the fact that genetics is not an exact science ‚Äì it is probabilistic. Reception In a review in The Guardian, Colin Grant described A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived as an \\"effervescent work, brimming with tales and confounding ideas\\". He called the author \\"an enthusiastic guide\\" who disentangles the maze of collapsed family trees and inbreeding. Grant felt that he was \\"especially illuminating\\" on the ill-defined notion of race, and \\"how it both does and doesn't exist\\". He said that Rutherford aims high: the rewriting human history, but called him \\"a commendable historian ... who is determined to illuminate the commonality of Homo sapiens\\". Robin McKie described Rutherford's exposition of the Human Genome Project as \\"elegant\\". Writing in another review of the book in The Guardian, McKie noted how the author is careful to bring the project's \\"dreams of a medical revolution\\" down to earth, emphasising that its \\"greatest achievement ... was working out exactly how little we knew.\\" McKie praised Rutherford for highlighting modern genetics' limitations, that it is better at describing humans as a species than as individuals. He called the book \\"a polished, thoroughly entertaining history of Homo sapiens\\", adding that it is \\"popular science writing at its best\\". In a review in The New York Times, Misha Angrist described A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived as \\"nothing less than a tour de force\\". Despite the book's ambitious tile, he felt that Rutherford \\"deliver[s] on its great promise\\". Angrist complimented the author on his \\"captivating storytelling\\" that is \\"entertaining and engaging\\" and \\"never feels pedantic\\". He was impressed by the way Rutherford dealt with such sensitive topics as race and eugenics, and that he used examples like earwax and lactose intolerance, rather than Mendel's exhumed pea plants to demonstrate how genetics work. Angrist concluded his review by stating: \\"If genetics can ever offer us words to live by, I reckon these are probably the best it can do.\\" Nancy R. Curtis wrote in the Library Journal that A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived should attract readers of both popular and technical science books. She said it is \\"amusing and provocative\\", and \\"may bruise the egos of a few genealogists\\". Curtis did, however, complain that Rutherford gives too much attention to European and British issues, and from time to time \\"succumbs to editorializing on peripheral topics\\", for example creationism and genetic determinism. In a review in The Wall Street Journal, Charles C. Mann was a little critical of the book's title, saying that it \\"is not particularly brief, not exactly a history and not concerned with everyone who ever lived\\". But he was pleased that Rutherford did not fall into the trap of \\"hyping the science to sell the story\\" that popular science books often do. He said the author is \\"an enthusiastic guide and a good story-teller\\", although Mann did complain about Rutherford's many digressions that interrupt the flow of the text.

She left the United Kingdom to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in December 2014. Two months later, in February 2015, school friends Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana joined her in occupied Syria. Begum is one of the youngest British teenagers to join ISIL. In February 2019 Begum was described as \\"missing\\".  Background  Main entrance of Mulberry Academy Shoreditch, formerly known as Bethnal Green Academy Sharmeena Begum was born to Shahnaz Begum and Mohammad Uddin. She was raised by her mother until her father joined them in the UK in 2007. Begum's mother died, of cancer, in January 2014. Her father remarried in September 2014, and Begum left for Syria in December 2014. Begum's father, Mohammad Uddin, said that her behavior changed, she stopped listening to western music, and started going to her room to pray, but he assumed this was a simple grief reaction to her mother's death. At the time of her father's second marriage she lived with her grandmother. Members of her family were sure Begum was targeted for recruitment by a group, known as the \\"Sisters Forum\\", within the Islamic Forum of Europe, that met at an east London Mosque. Women from the group that recruited her have been described as \\"brainwashing\\" her, telling her she would meet her recently deceased mother in paradise, if she died a martyr. Women from the group are reported to have taken her to the airport, for her departure. Sharmeena Begum was friends with Amira Abase, Shamima Begum (unrelated) and Kadiza Sultana. All four went to Bethnal Green Academy.  Joining ISIL  After her mother died, Begum became increasingly interested in religious themes, although her family had previously described her as non- religious. She is said to have begun to pray and stopped listening to western music. According to the police, Begum was groomed by two unidentified women to join ISIL and that those two had taken her to Gatwick Airport on a flight to Turkey, from where she made her way to Syria. According to reports by the family, she received ¬£500 from her grandmother to purchase the plane ticket. Begum was not getting along with her new stepmother, and had gone to live with one of her grandmothers. She used her grandmother's passport for her travels, telling her she needed to borrow the passport for her schoolwork. She used 500 pounds she told her grandmother she needed, for shopping, to buy her airline ticket. East London Mosque, where Begum is said to have met the \\"Sisters Forum\\" The women who groomed her are thought to be members of the East London Mosque in Whitechapel and that they are members of a group called the \\"Sisters Forum\\" within the Islamic Forum of Europe. The mosque, however, denied any involvement in the radicalisation of Begum. Two weeks after her departure, she reportedly called her father to inform him that she did not intend to return. Following his daughter's disappearance, Mr Uddin informed the police of his suspicion that his daughter might have been groomed by Islamists and that her three friends might be at risk as well. Police subsequently approached the three girls to question them about Sharmeena. As they were minors, they gave them letters to pass to their parents to seek permission. The letters were not passed on and police did not follow up. Two months after her departure, she was joined by her three friends from Bethnal Green Academy who had also made their way to Syria via Turkey. According to reports they have been rejoined in Raqqa. It is thought she married a Bosnian fighter who has since been killed. Her current status is unknown; she has been described as missing. Shamima Begum reported last seeing her in Baghuz in June 2018. Jasmine Jawhar, author of \\"Terrorists' use of the internet: The case of DAESH\\", characterized Begum and her school chums as being \\"mesmerised by the romantic idea of jihad.\\"  Criticism of the response of security officials  Begum's travel to Daesh- occupied Syria, followed by the travel of three of her friends, triggered a discussion as to whether UK security officials could have prevented the other girls following her example. The parents of fellow students say they were unaware that Begum had travelled to Daesh territory. Parents who were aware assumed she had returned to Bangladesh out of grief, following the death of her mother. Begum's father was critical that warnings he made, to the police, over his concern her friends might follow her example, were ignored. On 19 February 2019, Cressida Dick, Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service, defended the Police against claims they should have been able to anticipate Begum's friends following her example. Dick disputed that Begum was travelling on the same plane as another teenage recruit, who was prevented from travelling. Dick acknowledged another 15-year-old girl was prevented from travelling the night Begum left, but said she thought the other girl was on a different plane. As for the criticism that the police could have prevented her friends from following her example, she asserted that the police did speak with her friends, but, at the time, saw them merely as witnesses, not potential victims, because \\"knowing somebody's intentions is 'extremely complicated.\\"  See also  * British Bangladeshi * List of British Bangladeshis * United Kingdom and ISIL * Sexual jihad * Brides of ISIL  References  Category:1999 births Category:2010s missing person cases Category:British expatriates in Syria Category:Date of birth missing Category:English Islamists Category:English people of Bangladeshi descent Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the United Kingdom Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant members Category:People from Bethnal Green ","title":"Sharmeena Begum"},{"id":"60122049","text":"is a train station in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan.

The conversations between the two intelligence chiefs took place during 2016 and 2017 in Istanbul, Kathmandu and Bangkok. AS Dulat is a former head of India's external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;), Lt. Gen. Asad Durrani is a former head of Pakistan's external agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and Aditya Sinha is an Indian journalist. Authors A. S. Dulat  A. S. Dulat is a former special director of India's Intelligence Bureau and former chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;) from 1999 to 2000. After retirement he was appointed as advisor on Kashmir in the Prime Minister's Office and served there from January 2000 to May 2004. Asad Durrani Lieutenant General Mohammad Asad Durrani is a retired 3-star rank general in the Pakistan Army and presently a commentator and speaker.Asad Durrani, Strategic decision making in Pakistan, Strategic Studies Durrani previously served as the director-general of the Inter-Services Intelligence and former director-general of the Pakistan Army's Military Intelligence.Muhammad Saleh Zaafir, Former ISI, RAW chiefs co-author book, The News, 21 May 2018 Aditya Sinha Aditya Sinha is an Indian author and journalist. He has been a journalist since 1987, occupying positions such as Editor-in-Chief of The New Indian Express and Daily News and Analysis (DNA). He has reported on terrorism in Punjab, Kashmir and Assam and has also done reporting from Peshawar, Pakistan. He started his journalistic career as a crime reporter in Delhi.  Description  The book covers various topics such as Kashmir, Afghanistan, Ajit Doval, trade wars, the deep state, the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Osama Bin Laden, Hafiz Saeed, Balochistan, the surgical strikes and Kulbhushan Jadhav among other things. In the book Dulat says that ISI is a more influential intelligence agency; however, Durrani observes that \\"R&AW; is at least as good as we are‚Äù but discusses that R&AW; may have the upperhand because it has \\"career intelligence officers\\" whereas ISI consists of army men. In the book Durrani claims that Pakistan may have directed the American SEALs to Osama bin Laden in May 2011 as well as may have collected a payment for the cooperation and pretended to be surprised afterwards. Durrani also says that ISI's involvement in Kashmir has turned out to be less than successful. A.S. Dulat and Asad Durrani have previously collaborated, writing a paper together titled \\"Kashmir: Confrontation to Cooperation\\" in 2013 published by the University of Ottawa. In the book Durrani notes this in the opening chapter, which also mentions another collaboration between the two after the 59th Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs in 2011, when they co-authored an article on intelligence cooperation which was published in The Hindu and Dawn. Aditya Sinha says that the book has \\"no great revelations\\" but is \\"more about perspective\\" and \\"a metaphor for the actual relationship between the two countries.\\"  Aftermath  The book was released jointly by former Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh and former Vice President of India Hamid Ansari as well as other dignitaries on 24 May 2018. The Indian government denied a visa to Asad Durrani to attend the book launch. The publication of the book resulted in accusations of betrayal against Asad Durrani. On 28 May 2018, Pakistan placed Durrani on the \\"Exit Control List\\", barring him from leaving the country. An investigation headed by a three-star general was formed to ascertain whether Durrani violated Pakistan's military regulations. Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif demanded that the National Security Committee (NSC) should discuss the book. While addressing the Pakistan Senate in relation to the book, Raza Rabbani had said that if \\"a politician done the same thing he would have been labelled a traitor.\\" However, in October 2018, Asad Durrani's lawyer said they had not received any notice of an inquiry and sought the removal of Asad Durrani's name from the Exit Control List. Shazar Shafat, a security analyst, suggests two reasons in South Asian Voices (hosted by The Stimson Center) as to why Asad Durrani may be facing the backlash. The first is related to Durrani's comments on Akhand Bharat in the book such as \\"Akhand Bharat isn't a fantasy that nowadays some are thinking\\" (though Dulat calls the idea of Akhand Bharat in the book a \\"crazy, impractical idea\\") and the second is in relation to comments on Kulbhushan Jadhav. However, a report by CNN found that the book (as well as a pirated PDF version) was freely available in Pakistan and that the Pakistani government's \\"overreaction\\", according to Hassan Askari Rizvi and other defence analysts, may be because Durrani did not get prior permissions for such a book. On 22 February 2019, Asad Durrani was found guilty of violating Pakistan's Military Code of Conduct for co-writing the book. Asad Durrani's pension and other allowances have been withdrawn and it is yet to be decided if he should be taken off the Exit Control List.

He worked his way up the ranks during a 53-year career; retiring as Captain and made up to Admiral in retirement and settling in Jersey. He was particularly known for gathering and publishing nautical data and mappings of the Channel Islands, English Channel, French Coast, Bristol Channel and Irish Sea and even gained a mention in the French Maritime Atlas of the 1800s. Most maritime charts from around Jersey and the Channel Islands are believed to be derivations of his work. Life Martin White was born in 1779 (one document says 1781) on Hayling Island, Hampshire, England to his parents Martin and Elizabeth White. His father was a wine-merchant of Postsea, Portsmouth. Early naval service White joined the navy in 1793 at Portsmouth aged about 15 years. In 1794 White he assigned as a midshipman on the 74 gun third-rate under Richard Rodney Bligh. and Alexander were returning from escort duty when they encountered a French squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly consisting of five 74-gun ships of the line, three frigates, and a brig. Bligh fought desperate a solo rearguard action that allowed the Canada to escape. The sinking Alexander took 40 casualties and White and his crew-mates were taken prisoner at Brest. Having gained his freedom White was appointed in 1796 to , which successfully engaged and captured the 36-gun French frigate Elizabeth. White left Topaze by 1800 having made the grade of Master's Mate. On 12 December 1800 White was promoted to Lieutenant following a written examination. The Navy first assigned him to . White is known to have performed surveys on while blockading the ports of Le Havre, St Malo, and Granville. Ill-health forced him to leave the Pygmy in 1804. In 1805 he assumed command of . However, she ran aground on the River Ems on the eastern border of East Frisia in January 1806 due poor navigation by the pilot. There the Dutch were able to seize her. A little blame attached to White but in June 1806 he commissioned the schooner . Then in September 1806 he was promoted to Commander and assigned to command of the store ship . Jersey From September 1808 he was assigned for three years to , a guard ship stationed at Jersey. It seems he took every opportunity while on Vulture for hydrology and survey work both around the Channel Islands and around the French coast. This was not without danger in the period of the Napoleanic wars. Captain Thomas Hurd had been appointed Admiralty's Hydrographer earlier in 1808. If Hurd was not influential in White's appointment to Vulture he would certainly have supported the survey work. In the end White was to set roots in Jersey for the rest of his life, marrying Eleanor Egan on 24 August 1811 and setting up home in St. Helier. White was unemployed for a short while in 1812, before later in that year being assigned the 16-ton vessel Fox for survey work around Jersey. Given the larger vessel in 1817; in 1818 he was promoted to post-captain. His surveys over the ensuing years to 1828 included the English, Bristol, and Irish channels. In 1821 Captain White co-authored with John Walker A survey of the island of Jersey, and its surrounding dangers. It is noted it was able to be published due to the work of Captain Thomas Hurd (1747‚Äì1823) enabling publication of such works to the mercantile fleet. Captain white subsequently updated the work in 1840 and 1861. In 1824 he further published maps and chart of other Channel Island locations and two maps of the coast or Ireland. In 1834/5 he also published Sailing directions for the English Channel: including a general description of the South Coasts of England and Ireland and a Detailed Account of the Channel Islands which was published with revisited editions up until 1850. Captain White worked with Charles-Fran√ßois Beautemps-Beaupr√© mapping the coast of France and is mentioned in the French Maritime Atlas. It is believed he was probably responsible for naming the deep underwater valley in the English Channel Hurd Deep after Hurd. Retirement Around his retirement from naval service in 1846 he authored the work Remarks on the winds, tides, and currents of the ocean : with other phenomena. His promotion to Admiral may post retirement may have been for the purposes of increasing his pension, though when he died in 1865 three years after his wife he left a relatively small personal estate of ¬£200. His daughter Ellen Elisabeth, who had acted as secretary for him without remuneration, and remained a spinster, came into financial difficulties and was helped by Sir John Le Couteur arranging an annuity from the Royal Naval Annuitant Society.

Life  Heinz Baumann grew up as the first son of August and Agnes Baumann in J√ºlich- and attended the humanities-oriented gymnasium . There he came into contact with the teachings of Francis de Sales and early on developed the desire to become a priest. After graduating in 1966, he studied philosophy and theology in Bonn and T√ºbingen under Hans K√ºng and Joseph Ratzinger and was ordained as a priest on 17 June 1972 in Krefeld. After a few years as a chaplain at the Aachen parishes of and he moved to in the on 2 April 1979. On 29 December 1981 (with effect from 1 January 1982) bishop Klaus Hemmerle appointed him to become the successor of Ferdinand Len√üen as pastor of St. Elisabeth. He was introduced into his duties on 17 January 1982. At the end of 1998, Heinz Baumann fell seriously ill for about seven months. After his recovery and return he continued to lead the parish until 2009. He died from illness on 24 April 2010. His grave is located in his birthplace Barmen.  Work  Baumann wanted to see church as a meeting place widely open for anyone and beyond confessional borders. He typically tried to convince people with deeds rather than words and to thereby encourage imitation. He was motivated by a deep belief and commitment to social justice, reflected in a multitude of projects, events and long-term established facilities. Besides his child and youth work he helped long-term unemployed people (f.e. by the creation of an unemployment center), drug addicts, and he supported the peace movement, cross-cultural communication and intercultural exchange. He also encouraged people to take over responsibility and initiative themselves. While to him working with the youth had the highest priority he also continued to maintain already established initiatives such as the \\"Elisabeth Conference\\", a program originally founded in 1908 to support poor people, and among them especially elderly women and, increasingly, single mothers. Between 1989 and 2004 he set up a clothing store for people in need. In 1991, he helped set up a library open to everyone. He also initiated a local newspaper. Between 1991 and 1994, a nationwide exchange program took place under the name \\"\\" between German St. Elisabeth parishes. More than one hundred pupils from cities such as Bottrop, Eisenach, Aachen and K√∂nigs- Wusterhausen participated in this program. Gifted with a certain kind of wit, Baumann became known to also take unconventional and sometimes odd measures to support people in need. He actively participated in many social-political discussions and was not shy to exchange even vehement arguments with superiors inside and outside the church. Open also to worldly amusements, Baumann was guided by his insight: \\"Jesus must have been a happy person, why else would he have turned water into wine?\\" For example, he was a member of the traditional in Barmen and honoured member of the carneval society . From 1990 on he repeatedly celebrated holy masses in the circus tent of the Circus Roncalli whenever they came around to visit Aachen on their journey. The vicinity of the parish church of St. Elisabeth being located at the , one of Aachen's important traffic hubs with the nearby , was utilized by Baumann for large- scale admonishing banners mounted on the building's facade and fencing in order to spread the message and draw attention from motorists and passers-by to global ills as well as to local activities and to ask for help and commitment. Since 1994 on the occasion of the annual World Animal Day he carried out animal blessings of domestic animals in memory of Francis of Assisi. Being a passionate soccer fan since his youth, Baumann officially looked after the team of the 1. FC K√∂ln pastorally, an initiative originally started in 1991 when he supported the players in the struggles after the accidental death of the German Bundesliga player Maurice Banach. Over time he thereby became known as \\"FC pastor\\" nationally. As a diocesan minister, he led seminars and workshops on intergenerationality in the Maria Laach Abbey. In addition, he was deputy federal praeses of the federal association of Catholic male communities and men's facility in Germany. In 1993, Baumann was awarded the prize of the Zeitungsverlag Aachen for demonstrating virtues such as helpfulness, humor, repartee, originality and passion for Aachen. Heinz Baumann inspired the German artist to create several portraits, some of which could be seen posthumously f.e. in the 2012 exhibition \\"Fanum Profanum\\". From 2002, he fought to continue the social services for young people and to keep the unemployment center open against austerity and closure intentions imposed by his superiors. He also advocated for employees threatened with redundancies, including offering parts of his own salary. At the same time Baumann tried to save costs and increase the attractiveness of the church by moving parts of the parish office into the church itself in 2002 (project \\"\\", engl. \\"Desk in the church\\") so that the church could open to visitors also in the mornings. In 2003, further ideas for new usage concepts were presented. In 2005, this led to redesigning the entrance area of the church, which now could be easily inspected from outside through a newly created window in order to remove threshold fears to enter the church from pedestrians in the streets. The parish office was relocated into there and combined with a caf√© meeting point open to anyone. In parallel, in 2004/2005, Baumann personally supported the initiative of several pupils of the parish to repaint the entire interior of the church (project \\"\\", engl. \\"White Christmas\\") and arranged a holiday camp in . These flourishing contacts resulted in that he was asked to inaugurate their local (engl. 'Brother Klaus Chapel') in July 2008.

In 1904 he began to work for the \\"Gesellschaft f√ºr drahtlose Telegraphie m.b.H.\\" (Company for Wireless Telegraphy Ltd.), the later Telefunken, and was sent to Saint Petersburg. After the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War he acquired a contract for the radio equipment of the Russian Pacific squadron. He was involved in the planning of a Telefunken worldwide transmitting system and the construction of the Nauen Transmitter Station, which provided wireless communication with the United States via the Sayville Transmitter station and with the German colonies like the Kamina Transmitter in Togo. In 1908 Bredow became executive director of Telefunken in Berlin. He volunteered for the German signal corps in World War I and organized an entertainment program at the Western Front by using military radio equipment. In 1919 he became the department head and director of the newly-founded Department for Wireless Telegraphy in the Reichspostministerium (Ministry of Posts), the central authority for the entire German radio communications in the Weimar Republic. On 1 April 1921 Bredow was appointed Secretary of State for telecommunications. Hans Bredow laying the first stone of the Haus des Rundfunks in Berlin, 1929 On 16 November 1919 Bredow gave a speech about his vision of a nationwide wireless transmission of speech and music at Berlin's Urania, and in September 1923 the first German public broadcasting transmitter started operating in Berlin. In June 1926 Bredow left the Post administration and became chairman of the administrative board of the Reichs-Rundfunk- Gesellschaft (National Broadcasting Corporation), the federation of broadcasting companies in Germany. On 30 January 1933, the day of the Machtergreifung of the Nazis in Germany, Bredow submitted his resignation and was replaced by August Kruckow on 15 February 1933. Within the following month several employees of the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft were arrested, and subsequently interned in the Oranienburg concentration camp. Bredow protested against these arrests in several telegrams addressed to President Paul von Hindenburg, Hermann G√∂ring, Franz von Papen and Hitler himself. On 9 August 1933 Bredow sent a telegram to Hitler requesting the release of his former co- workers and explicitly asked to be treated like his colleagues in case they were kept in custody. Bredow was arrested on 25 October and kept in pretrial detention for 15 months. In a show trial he was accused of corruption; the initial sentence was revoked by the Reichsgericht in 1938. Bredow retired in 1939 and established a historical radio archive in Wiesbaden, which would become the predecessor of the German Broadcasting Archive. After World War II the Allies appointed him district president of Hesse-Nassau in Wiesbaden (May‚ÄìSeptember 1945). From 1945 to 1953 Bredow was chairman of the supervisory board of the ironworks and the \\"Edelstahlwerke R√∂chling-Buderus\\" and a member of the supervisory board of Philipp Holzmann AG. Bredow made several proposals for the restructuring of broadcasting in Germany and was chairman of the administrative board of the Hessian Broadcasting Company from 1949 to 1951. Bredow died on 9 January 1959 in Wiesbaden.

The club colours are blue and yellow and the team currently plays in the Belgian First Amateur Division. Their home stadium is the 3,000-seat capacity Gemeentelijk Sportpark.  History  The club was founded as Heidebloem Voetbalvereeniging Hulst on 14 June 1942, joining the Royal Belgian Football Association just a few months later. In 1943 the first dressing rooms were built next to the pitch in Hulst, a village encompassed by the municipality of Tessenderlo. In 1970 a new sports centre was built, which was completed in 1973. At that time the club played at the lowest levels of Belgian football, mainly in the third and fourth provincial level in Limburg, at that time corresponding to the seventh and eighth level of Belgian football. In 1992; the club obtained royal patronage for its fiftieth year of existence, thus becoming Koninklijke Heidebloem Voetbalvereeniging Hulst (). Two years later it succeeded for the first time to promote to the second provincial level, the sixth level of Belgian football and almost promoted again the following seasons, losing promotion play-offs twice. The club relegated in 1998 and started merger negotiations with two neighbouring clubs within Tessenderlo: VK Penarol Engsbergen from the village Engsbergen and Schoot Sport from the village Schoot. In preparation of the merger, the club became KVV Thes Sport Tessenderlo in 1999, with the acronym Thes standing for Tessenderlo, Hulst, Engsbergen and Schoot. The clubs in the end did not find a mutual agreement and continued to compete separately during the 1999‚Äì2000 season. Schoot Sport did not want to cooperate and would eventually cease to exist in 2002. Penarol Engsbergen did cooperate with Thes Sport in the youth leagues, but remained a separate club. In 2001, the club moved from its accommodations in the commune of Hulst to the Gemeentelijk Sportpark closer to the centre of Tessenderlo. The terrain was available because Looi Sport, which was the original occupant, had gone defunct a few years before that in 1997. Meanwhile, Thes Sport started its rise in the ranks of Belgian football, promoting to the first provincial division in 2003 and even into the national leagues in 2005, before relegating back in 2009. In 2015, the club again gained access to the Belgian Fourth Division, the lowest level of national football, at which time the merger with VK Penarol Engsbergen did complete and the latter ceased to exist.https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20150128_01499422 Following a title in the 2017‚Äì18 Belgian Second Amateur Division, the club promoted for the first time ever to the third level of Belgian football.

The place has links with Ichhai Ghosh, king of Gopbhum, and it is believed that his capital, Dhekur, was located nearby. The area was earlier a part of Senpahari pargana. History According to Binoy Ghosh, Gopbhum, spread over a part of the present-day Purba Bardhaman and Paschim Bardhaman districts, had two Sadgop kings ‚Äì one ruled from Amrargar and other from Dhekur (also known as Trisasthigar), near present-day Gourangapur. A little prior to 1833, a copper edict issued by Iswar Ghosh (popular as Ichhai Ghosh) was found at Ramganj in Dinajpur district. As per the copper edict, Iswar Ghosh was son of Dhabal Ghosh, grandson of Bal Ghosh and great grandson of Dhurta Ghosh. However, according to the Dharmamangal poems, Ichhai Ghosh was son of Som Ghosh. In spite of the differences, there is both literary and historical support for Ichhai Ghosh. He was the king of a subsidiary (samanta) kingdom, forming a part of Gopbhum, in the 11th century and was a contemporary of Mahipala, an important king of the Pala dynasty. Ichhai Ghosh was possibly more than just a regional power, because the copper edict shows that other kings in the area listened to him. It is possible that Ichhai Ghosh could carve out a large kingdom because Mahipala was kept busy by external pressures from the Chola dynasty of southern India and Kalachuris of central India.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 123-129, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata The Dharmamangal poems speak of a battle between Ichhai Ghosh and Lau Sen, who was king of another subsidiary kingdom in the Medinipur area. The battle was fought at Kandunedanga on the south bank of the Ajay. The Dharmamangal poems mention a king Harishchandra but it is difficult to trace him historically.(He is not to be confused with the legendary Indian king Harishchandra mentioned in ancient Hindu texts). See also - Garh Jungle for Raja Surath's Durga Puja Geography Location Gourangapur is located at . The place is densely forested on the southern bank of the Ajay, a little down-stream from Jaydev Kenduli, which is located on the northern bank of the river. Demographics As per the 2011 Census of India, Gourangapur had a total population of 110 of which 56 (51%) were males and 54 (49%) were females. Population below 6 years was 22. The total number of literates in Gourangapur was 74 (84.09% of the population over 6 years). Culture Ichhai Ghosher Deul is located at Gourangapur. It is one of the few rekh-deuls in Bengal. Scholars date it around 16th-17th century and it was possibly erected by the descendants of Ichhai Ghosh, to perpetuate his memory. David J. McCutchion mentions Ichhai Ghoser Deul at Gourangapur as a large smooth curvilinear rekha deul, having a base of 20 feet square. It is a plain brick structure but for niches and images on tower.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, page 25, The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, According to the List of Monuments of National Importance in West Bengal the Ichhai Ghosh Temple is a monument of national importance. Shyamarupargarh, is located nearby, deep in the forest. There is no trace of the temple of goddess Bhavani built by Ichhai Ghosh, but there is a small temple probably built later. Near Shyamarupargarh, the ruins of a huge building are there in the dense forest. Locals believe the ruins to be that of the palace of Ichhai Ghosh at what once was Dhekkuri or Dhekur, Ichhai Ghosh's capital.

Aestuariicella hydrocarbonica was first isolated in 2015 from oil spill contaminated tidal flat sediments from the Dangjin bay in Korea. Due to the recent nature of its discovery, its taxonomic classification has not yet been accepted. Future research into its evolutionary history and genome may change the naming of this organism. While rare in seawater, A. hydrocarbonica has shown a strong association with plastic debris of various polymer types. It is commonly found along with other gammaproteobacteria capable of degrading hydrocarbons and other high- molecular-mass polymers. Bio-degradation tests have shown that it is capable of breaking down a variety of hydrocarbon polymers. However, it does not degrade the plant polymers casein and starch . These organisms are tetracycline sensitive, but are vulnerable to all other common antibiotics. The distribution of A. hydrocarbonica is not yet described, but studies have found its presence in samples from South Korea and the Mediterranean Sea. This suggests that it may have a broad geographic distribution or be associated with area with high human impact.

She was the first female professor of dermatology in Germany.  Life  Von Mallinckrodt-Haupt, daughter of Stephan von Haupt, Councillor of the District Court, studied medicine in Berlin from 1915, passing her state examination in 1921, followed by specialist training in dermatology at the Charit√© under Franz Blumenthal. In 1922, she received her doctorate for her dissertation \\"Beitrag zur Frage der Immimmit√§tserscheinungen bei Hyphomycetenerkrankungen\\" (Contribution to the Question of Immunity Symptoms in Hyphomycetes Diseases) (grade very good) with Blumenthal in Berlin. Together with Blumenthal, she wrote the chapter on the serodiagnosis of syphilis in Josef Jadassohn's Handbuch der Haut- und Geschlechtskrankheiten in 1929. In 1922, she married the head forester Johann Dietrich von Mallinckrodt in Bamberg, with whom she had two daughters and three sons. She remained at the skin clinic of the Charit√© until 1924 and then moved from Potsdam (where she had lived since 1922) to Daun in the Eifel because of the profession of her husband. She completed a traineeship with Erich Hoffmann in Bonn from 1928 to 1930 and was assistant to Theo Schreuss at the Dermatological Clinic of the Medical Academy in D√ºsseldorf in 1930, where she habilitated in 1932 (Der Stoffwechsel der pathogenen Hautpilze und sein Zusammenhang mit der Pathogenese der Mykosen. Mit experimentellen Beitr√§gen). She also became a lecturer at the Medical Academy. From 1931, she was also a resident physician in Br√ºhl. In 1939, she habilitated again in Cologne and became a private lecturer there. In 1941, she became an unscheduled professor in Cologne and thus the first female professor of dermatology in Germany. In addition, she was a Gausachbearbeiterin in Cologne/Aachen and engaged in the fight against alcohol and tobacco. In 1938, she published on the fight against prostitution. In 1950/51, she founded a private clinic for skin diseases in Br√ºhl and managed it until 1959, when she suffered a heart attack. She is the mother of the toxicologist Marika Geldmacher-von Mallinckrodt.  Research  Von Mallinckrodt-Haupt was mainly concerned with fungal diseases of the skin. Medical mycology was her preferred field of interest and research; she also did research on porphyrin.

Critical response The film received positive reviews from moviegoers and film critics with Butch Francisco of the Philippine Star saying \\"Kung Ikaw ay Isang Panaginip... is a fun movie to watch. Call it baduy if you wish, but we cannot close our eyes to the fact that it is a decently-made movie ... it is a very small movie with an obviously tight budget but I do appreciate the fact that it is inventive, creative and very energetic ‚Äì with its every scene well-planned and well- thought of... It is a far cry from those usual small-budgeted run-of-the-mill Tagalog pictures that are downright stupid and assault the sensibilities of the viewers... Kung Ikaw ay Isang Panaginip is cute, fun and perky. More importantly, it stresses old positive values and traits that are so sorely lacking in most of our films today.\\" The film also marks Magdangal's first film without her long time screen partner Marvin Agustin, of which the team up has produced successful films in the past in FLAMES: The Movie (1997), Kung Ayaw Mo, Huwag Mo!

He was then admitted to an asylum, where he died in 1913, two years before his crimes were discovered. Biography Early life and move to North Dakota Butler was born in 1849, one of three sons born to Ephraim and Rebecca (n√©e Pearson) Butler. He was of English descent, with his family having roots in Braintree, Essex, England. He came from a prosperous family, and around 1882, he moved to North Dakota from Buffalo, New York, buying a 480-acre farm in Niagara, North Dakota. He maintained it on his own, never married and lived as a recluse, avoiding contacts with neighbors and only going out for business purposes in nearby Larimore, North Dakota, hiring farm hands to maintain his farm during the summer months. Insanity, asylum and death Ever since moving to the state, Butler began showing signs of a mental illness, including suffering from hallucinations and thinking that invisible people were chasing him. His mind deteriorated even further around 1906, when he began riding out into the night, screaming at the top of his lungs and scaring the county's residents. Due to being considered a public nuisance, he was admitted to the North Dakota State Hospital under the supervision of Dr. W. M. Hotchkiss. During the following years at the asylum, Butler only gave some trouble at isolated periods to the staff, most of the time just expressing his fears towards invisible figures that were \\"chasing after\\" him and having his picture taken, believing that the camera would suck out his soul. Aside from this, he showed no homicidal tendencies at all. According to Dr. A. W. Guest, Butler was a man of small stature, very gallant and fond of attending the hospital dances, even falling desperately in love with one of the female physicians. On October 22, 1913, Butler passed away while imprisoned in the asylum. His remains were shipped to Middleport, New York, where he would be buried by relatives. Discovery of murders After Butler's death, the estate was divided between his living relatives with the help of attorney W. E. Houpt. In 1915, workmen were sent to excavate the property with the purpose of renovating it. One of these workmen, named Leo Verbulehn, was digging a cellar under the house when he discovered the skeletons. All of them had had their skulls crushed, most likely by a sharp instrument, and at least two had had their legs broken. Initially, there was a theory that five of the remains belonged to a family consisting of two women, probably housekeepers, and their children. Nobody in the neighborhood, however, ever recalled a family that had ever gone missing in the county. The possibility of the family's being Butler's relatives was also ruled out, as he must have murdered them immediately upon entering his premises. Later, police revealed that all the skeletons belonged to young men, one of them being a boy aged between 15 and 18 and another who had a crooked nose. Authorities couldn't identify the individuals and suggested that they were vagrants employed as farmhands by Butler, which would explain why nobody had noted their disappearances. It is suspected that he had probably murdered the men because he thought they were going to steal money from his house, a lot of which he had lying about. It was also noted that there were no traces of clothes of any kind, suggesting that the bodies had been buried nude and that Butler had burned the clothes. In order to dispose of the bodies, Butler had built a trap door, removing three bottom stones from the house foundation. He then had used black dirt and red clay subsoil in order to cover up the burial place of the bodies. Following the grisly discovery, many onlookers visited the farm in order to observe the crime scene. The deputies deposited the victims' aging bones in a box, which was then transported to the office of Sheriff Art Turner. Later, it was discovered that some of the bones were stolen, most likely by souvenir hunters. John Urbanski inquiry A possible lead to the identification of at least one of the victims was the inquiry of Leo Urbanski, a wealthy farmer residing in Long Prairie, Minnesota. At his request, attorney C. B. DeLaurier wrote to the state attorney O. B. Burtness, claiming that one of the victims might be his brother, John Urbanski. John, who also went by the name John Miller, was a young man who disappeared near Niagara in 1902. Before his sudden vanishing, he had written a letter to his brother, stating that he was working for a bachelor in the city. The letter's post mark indicated it had been mailed from Larimore, the town where Butler conducted business. Solving the mystery To this day, Butler's victims remain unidentified. According to Dr. Phoebe Stubblefield, an anthropology professor at the University of North Dakota, if by any chance a surviving member of the people who stole the victims' bones comes forward and hands them over, modern DNA techniques could be used to identify them. In 2016, the Grand Forks County Sheriff's Department reached out to the public in an effort to find new leads, as the old case records were either destroyed or lost.

Its ruins are located on Monte da Pena, near the village of Barro, Torres Vedras municipality, in the Lisbon District of Portugal. The tholos was classified as a National Monument in September 1940.  History  The Tholos do Barro is a megalithic monument dated between 2500 and 2200 BC. It is located close to a hilltop monument to Our Lady of F√°tima. The tholos was discovered in 1908 by Paulo Bovier Lapierre, a French Jesuit priest who was teaching at the Barro college and convent at the foot of the hill. The tomb was excavated a year later by Eugene Jalhay and F√©lix Alves Pereira but the results of their excavations were not published. Among the items found at the site were implements made from amphibolite, diorite and granite, limestone idols and vessels, ceramics, bones, jewellery, a copper dagger and metal rings. Cylindrical idols characteristic of the early Chalcolithic period permitted the tomb to be dated and it is considered to be contemporary with the nearby Castro of Zambujal, one of the most important chalcolithic sites in the Lisbon area. The finds are located in the Lisbon National Archaeological Museum and also in the Leonel Trindade Museum in Torres Vedras. The tomb‚Äôs chamber was oriented from North to South, with a round burial chamber that was covered with overlapping blocks that created a false dome. This was an unusual construction for a tholos in Portugal, as a wooden roof was usually used. The wall of the chamber, six meters in diameter, is still about a meter high. It is believed that the dead were deposited in a seated position, accompanied by various artifacts and food. The chamber, aisle and antechamber together have a length of 9.7 metres. At the entrance, the remains of a wall of limestone blocks on both sides of about 2.70 m in length are interpreted as the remains of the antechamber. The tomb was surrounded by an outer tumulus made of small stones, with a diameter of approximately 13 metres.

It is therefore believed that by changing the date \\"the national holiday was losing its political and revolutionary character and taking on a religious nature\\" with whatever that entailed concerning the assertions of democracy and a constitution. The historian Chr. Koulouri, who researched national holiday-type celebrations from 1834 and after, does not include in them 1 January, but instead six dates related to the royal family. The main celebration before the establishment of 25 March was 25 January, the anniversary of King Otto's landing in Nafplio (1833). The leader of the Filiki Eteria who organised the revolution, Alexander Ypsilantis, kickstarted the operations in Iasi on 24 February 1821. However, the events there were characterised in the collective conscious and history as something isolated, something like a prologue to the Revolution. The complete failure of the movement in a non-Greek area, maybe also the disappointment of the Greeks about the delusion of Russian support propagated by the Filiki Eteria, were the main contributors to the distinction between the events in the Danubian Principalities and those in Greece. The State validated the prevailing attitude and chose 25 March as the national holiday.ŒîŒ±œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ Œí. ŒëœÄœåœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ, Œó Œ≠ŒΩŒ±œÅŒæŒπœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒëŒ≥œéŒΩŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅŒØŒ±œÇ.

According to certain views, the starting date of the Revolution is indeed 24 February, when the Greek revolution in Wallachia started with Alexander Ypsilantis' proclamation Fight for Faith and Fatherland. Since then and with other revolts which took place well before 25 March the Greek Revolution was spread throughout Ottoman Greece, until it reached the Peloponnese. In Greece skirmishes had started before 25 March, as is recorded in the news which have been preserved in the \\"Correspondence of the Dutch Embassy in Patras: 1821\\", the Dutch government having been informed through its ambassador in Patras on 23 March that \\"since this year a latent dangerous situation has broken out\\" and that \\"the Greeks took up arms against the dynast\\". The official declaration of the revolutionaries to foreign governments happened with the proclamation of the \\"Messenian Senate\\" on 25 March 1821.Œ¶ŒπŒªŒÆŒºœâŒΩ ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ, ŒîŒøŒ∫ŒØŒºŒπŒøŒΩ ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ œÄŒµœÅŒØ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒïœÄŒ±ŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµœâœÇ, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ± 1860, œÉ. 29.Œ£œÄœÖœÅŒØŒ¥œâŒΩ Œ§œÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœçœÄŒ∑œÇ, ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒµœÄŒ±ŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµœâœÇ, Œ≠Œ∫Œ¥ŒøœÉŒ∑ 1888, œÑŒøŒº.

Institutionalisation  Panagiotis Soutsos was the first to suggest in 1834 the establishment of the celebration of the Greek Revolution on 25 March, mentioning that it was the day of the spread of the revolution throughout the Peloponnese and the rebirth of Greece, in a petition which Ioannis Kolettis submitted to Otto as a proposition of a law draft. Kolettis', the Foreign Minister, document, is dated 22 Jan./2 Febr. 1835 and suggests to the King to establish celebrations with panhellenic games similar to those of ancient Greece. His proposal is written in French with a German abstract. It mentions that \\"renowned Germanos\\" (celebre Germanos) proclaimed the Revolution on 17 March 1821 in Agia Lavra, and that the revolution spread throughout the Peloponnese on 25 March, which he considers the day of the start of a new era for Greece. He even says that there was a prophecy of the monks of Mega Spilaio that on this date the rebirth of Greece would take place, and that the Ottomans of the Peloponnese knew about it and every year on this date they took emergency security measures (Diamantis, p. 314). The celebrations proposed by Kolettis included competitions in the arts and sciences and in various sports. They would take place in Tripoli, Athens, Hydra and Mesologgi, alternating between the four each year, for a full cycle of four years, similarly to the ancient Olympic, Pythian, Isthmian and Nemean games.ŒîŒπŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒÆœÇ ŒëŒ∏.

Glarakis was one of the main representatives of the Russian Party, the \\"Napists\\", which during this period was favoured by Otto. Otto was trying to boost his popularity by associating himself with the popular expressors of Orthodoxy, and this may be the reason for the religious nature of the decree and the establishment of the holiday. However, on the first celebration of the anniversary, in 1838, the only foreign ambassadors missing were those of Russia and Austria.ŒúŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒµŒ∂ŒØŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œí.

The first celebration took place in Athens which was attended by King Otto and Queen Amalia, political and military authorities and a mass of people.

In 1839, Amvrosios Frantzis mentions that 25 March was a day \\"clear and embedded in the heart of Peloponnesians as the starting day of the Greek revolution\\".  Later  After the official establishment of the holiday, and especially in 1841, there was an attempt by the anti-Otto opposition to expropriate the anniversary, with private celebrations where Korais' figure was especially celebrated. The holiday continued to be a matter of political and localist conflict; Prime Minister Kolettis' decision in 1846 and 1847 to hold an official ceremony on the grave of the Rumelian chieftain Georgios Karaiskakis in Phaleron caused major reactions, as it was considered as leading to identification of the Revolution with one individual.  Celebrations in Greece and Cyprus  On March 25, schools in Greece and Cyprus close along with many businesses. A common feature of Greek Independence day within Greece and Cyprus, are local school parades in many villages, towns, and cities, schoolchildren march in traditional Greek folk costumes and carry Greek flags. The largest celebration takes place In Athens where an annual military parade commemorates the event, attended by the president of the Hellenic Republic and other high ranking state officials, along with hundreds of civilian spectators, the Athens parade starts in the mid-morning, making its way from Vasilissis Sofias Avenue, past the Hellenic Parliament and the Academy of Athens on Panepistimiou Street. Participants of the parade include men and women from all branches of the Hellenic Armed Forces, and civil services such as the Hellenic Fire Service, and Hellenic Police. Before the parade begins the President attends a wreath laying service at Syntagma Square, where the parade passes by every year, the service is held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  History of the parades  Until 1875 the army was lined across the route of the royal procession from the palace to the church and back. In 1875 for the first time the army paraded in front of the palace, a practice starting from the middle of the century in public holidays in France and the German states. The next year, even though there was no military parade because of rain, next to the army was lined also a university column. The earliest reference to a student parade dates back to 1899. Students had also lined during the celebration of 25 March in 1924, when the Republic was proclaimed. The next year scouts and students of military schools joined the military parade. In 1932 the schools of Athens paraded in front of officials in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier together with the scouts, the \\"city guard\\" and the \\"nationalist organisations\\". Since 1936 the student parade, which took place in front of King George and Prime Minister Metaxas, had been institutionalised. During the period of the Metaxas dictatorship the parades of students and phalangists (members of EON) took on significant importance and became connected with the military parade. The practice of student parades continued during the post-Civil War era and after the metapolitefsi. Before 1980, universities also participated in the parade in Athens. In various smaller cities local university faculties also participate, like for example in CorfuŒ¶ŒøŒπœÑŒ∑œÑŒ≠œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒôŒøŒΩŒØŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑŒ∑ŒºŒØŒøœÖ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ≠ŒªŒ±œÉŒ∑ 25Œ∑œÇ ŒúŒ±œÅœÑŒØŒøœÖ ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ Œ±œÄœå œáœÅœåŒΩŒπŒ±, www.corfuland.grŒëŒΩŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒØŒΩœâŒ∑œÉ ŒôŒøŒΩŒØŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑŒ∑ŒºŒØŒøœÖ \\"Œ£œÖŒºŒºŒµœÑŒøœáŒÆ Œô.Œ†. œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ≠ŒªŒ±œÉŒ∑ œÑŒ∑œÇ 25Œ∑œÇ ŒúŒ±œÅœÑŒØŒøœÖ\\", 2017 and Patras.Œ†ŒëŒ°ŒïŒõŒëŒ£Œó 25/3/2017, Œ†ŒëŒùŒïŒ†ŒôŒ£Œ§ŒóŒúŒôŒü Œ†ŒëŒ§Œ°Œ©Œù Œ≤ŒØŒΩœÑŒµŒø File:Pupil parade in Athens Greece.jpg|Male student parade on 24 March in Athens.

Greek Independence Day is celebrated in many cities outside of Greece with large Greek diaspora communities. In the United States annual parades are held in cities like Chicago, and New York. An annual reception at the White House hosted by the President of the United States attended by many prominent Greek Americans has also been held since the tradition was first started by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. A Presidential proclamation is also issued celebrating the day. In Australia parades are held in cities including Melbourne and Sydney, in Canada Parades are held in Toronto, and Montreal.

KFMB specializes in production and supplying of products like biscuits, flour, bread, buns, and vegetable oils etc. in Kuwait. The Company also produces macaroni, animal feed. KFMB shoulders a sizeable role in Kuwait‚Äôs economy by generating $1.3 billion in annual sales revenues and a net profit of $123 million in 2016 KFMB has eight automatic Arabic bakeries, accompanied by Sabhan Bakery that is panoramic in European bread production. It provides automated material handling and storage services through its principal holdings (KFMB has a total storage capacity of 375,000 tons at the port) and is in charge of providing flour and other grains to the country. KFMB factories are considered as one of the largest (3,000 tons of daily milling capacity), state-of-the-art, and acculturated in the Persian Gulf and Middle East areas. KFMB employs almost 4000 employees. History Soon after the state's independence, the Kuwaiti government quickly commenced its program of industrialization, creating a number of new companies under its control. One of these was the Kuwait Flour Mills Company. Incorporated in 1961 the company focused on specialized food products and familiarized them to the market In 1988, ‚ÄòKuwait Flour Mills Company‚Äô was merged with ‚ÄòKuwait Bakeries Company‚Äô and attained its new identity as ‚ÄúKuwait Flour Mills and Bakeries Company‚Äù. KFMB evoked expanding its facilities in order to develop fully integrated operations. As such, the company constructed its own silos and wheat-discharging facilities at Shuwaikh port to offload ships directly into its silos. In the following years, KFMB installed automatic milling systems integrated with packaging as well. The production of the company was augmented to include a full range of flours, including specialized flours used in the production of Arabic bread types, as well as processed flours used in European bread. In 1969, the company launched a factory for the production of Macaroni and in 1970 a factory for the production of Biscuits. Launching a vegetable oil factory in 1976 was another feather in the cap, which was the first of its nature in the Persian Gulf region. Further, in 1978, the company took ambitious steps to build nine automatic bakeries, geographically situated in Kuwait along with the Central Sabhan Bakery, considered as a sign of industrial milestone in Persian Gulf area at that point in time. Again in 1994, KFMB took over the government-run ‚ÄòKuwait Supply Company‚Äô. A company that was commended to serve the citizens by providing and delivering food supply and construction materials. These products were subsidized by the government in accordance with the policies and resolutions of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In compliance with the company‚Äôs mission to achieve food security, the company established the Animal Feed Plant in 1996 for the production of animal feed enriched with nutritional values to serve the livestock that is one of the integral elements for nutrition in the country.

It was painted 1678 and measures . Looted by Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult in 1813 and taken to France, it was bought by the Louvre in 1852. It has been held by the Museo del Prado, Madrid, since 1941. Provenance According to Juan Agust√≠n Ce√°n Berm√∫dez, the work was commissioned from Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo by Justino de Neve (1625‚Äì1685). De Neve was a canon of Seville Cathedral and ecclesiastical president of the Hospital de los Venerables in Seville. He commissioned the painting for his personal collection, and donated it to the chapel at the hospital in 1686. Belief in the Immaculate Conception had been on the rise in Spain since the 16th century and the country became its main defender, even fighting for it to be recognized as an official dogma of the Catholic Church, a goal that was eventually realized in 1854. The Immaculate Conception became a very important cultural symbol during this period, featured in many works of art. In 1813, during the Peninsular War, the painting was looted by Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult and taken to France. Soult left behind the painting's frame which remains in the hospital to this day. The painting remained in Soult's possession until his death in 1851; the painting's alternative name is derived from his. The painting was auctioned in 1852, and acquired by the Louvre Museum for 615,300 francs; reputedly the largest sum ever paid for a painting at that time. It was exhibited there until 1941, during which time Murillo's art fell out of fashion; as a result the Vichy Regime agreed to return it to Spain's Francisco Franco in an exchange of artwork, along with the Lady of Elche and several pieces of the Treasure of Guarrazar. In exchange, Spain's Museo del Prado gave the Louvre the Portrait of Mariana of Austria by Diego Vel√°zquez. In 1981, the Prado's restoration specialist, Antonio Fern√°ndez Sevilla, carried out a careful superficial restoration of The Immaculate Conception of Los Venerables, in preparation for an exhibition dedicated to Murillo. A more in-depth restoration was carried out in 2007. Description Murillo painted around two dozen versions of the Immaculate Conception, possibly the most of any Spanish painter at that time. In the majority, the Virgin Mary appears dressed in a white robe with a blue mantle, her hands crossed over her chest, with a crescent moon at her feet, and eyes upraised towards Heaven. The Immaculate Conception of Los Venerables stands out from Murillo's others due to its triumphant tone. This effect is achieved through Murillo's use of light which creates a sense of movement from the bottom right to the top left of the painting. This upward movement, and the symbolism associated with the clouds and angels surrounding the principal figure, create a visual reference to the Assumption, connecting Mary's purity with her status as Christ's mother. In this composition, Murillo did not include several traditional elements of the Virgin's iconography‚Äîsuch as the Tower of David, the sealed fountain, or palm and cypress trees‚Äîpossibly because these symbols were already featured in the painting's original frame in the Los Venerables Hospital, as described by in the 18th century.

Its causes laid in the \\"rapacity and exactions\\" of Muhammad Akbar Khan, the local governor of the Khost district. The rebellion, which was led by Jehandad Khan, began on 2 May 1912, when Mangal and Jadran tribesmen in Khost, Afghanistan rose up, quickly overwhelmed various isolated garrisons, and besieged Muhammad Akbar at Matun. Later that month, they were joined by the Ghilzai. Understanding the danger posed by the revolt, Habibullah sent Muhammad Nadir Khan to quell the rebellion. Alongside regular infantry, Nadir was also aided by Tajik levies who were unlikely to show any sympathy to the rebels. In the British Raj, tribesmen of the Kurram District were restricted from entering Afghanistan to aid the revolt. Muhammad Akbar eventually managed to break out of his besieged fort. By the end of May, Nadir had forced the rebels to sue for peace, and Jehandad Khan had fled to the British Raj, where he unsuccessfully lobbied for a British intervention. On 13 June, the rebellion was reported to be subsiding, and peace negotiations were going on in that same month. However, peace negotiations broke down, and in June 1912 fighting resumed. It ended on 14 August 1912, when the rebels surrendered after concessions were unexpectedly given by Afghan authorities, which included the replacement of Muhammad Akbar Khan by a new governor, Dost Muhammad. Habibullah's decision to show clemency to the rebels laid in a desire to conciliate enemies inherited from his predecessors, and the understanding that his acceptance of western ideas and encouragement of modern technical improvements had undermined his own popularity.

Palmer, The Improvement of Humanity: Education and the French Revolution, Princeton University Press, 2017, pp. 192-195 or Tenth-day Cult (French: ) was a semi-official religion of France during the Directory period of the French Revolution, intended to offer a non-Christian alternative after the dechristianisation of the country. It replaced the Christian Sunday worship with a quasi-religious festival on the day of rest in the 10-day week of the French Republican Calendar.Eric Voegelin, From Enlightenment to Revolution, Duke University Press, 1982, p. 172Andrew J. S. Jainchill, Reimagining Politics After the Terror: The Republican Origins of French Liberalism. Cornell University Press, 2008, pp. 84-88. The Decadary Cult was a system of worship based on festivals, so-called , which were celebrated every , the day of rest in the 10-day week of the Republican calendar. In addition, there was a cycle of annual festivals, celebrating various themes such as youth, old age, the foundation of the French Republic and the execution of Louis XVI. The festivals included the singing of patriotic songs, banquets, games, and the presentation of awards. The festivals were highly politicised, patriotic events, intended to promote Republican norms and values among the populace.  History  The French revolutionary period saw a number of attempts to establish a quasi-official civil religion, despite the formal separation of state and religion enshrined in the 1795 Constitution of the Year III. These included Robespierre's Cult of the Supreme Being, the Cult of Reason and, during the later post-Terror period, the Decadary Cult and Theophilanthropy. The rose to popularity after the adoption of the Republican Calendar in October 1793. Jean-Baptiste Matthieu, a member of the Committee on Public Instruction, presented draft legislation which called for local celebrations throughout France on all 36 of the year. Robespierre enthusiastically adopted Matthieu's plan and led a grand festival devoted to his deistic Cult of the Supreme Being on 8 June 1794, the of 20 Prairial of the Year II. The Decadary Cult was officially established by the laws of 17 Thermidor (4 August 1798), 3 Fructidor (20 August) and 23 Fructidor (9 September), and by decree of Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau on 20 Fructidor (6 September 1798).Zina Weygand, The Blind in French Society from the Middle Ages to the Century of Louis Braille.

After the Coup of 30 Prairial VII and De La R√©velli√®re's resignation from the Directory in 1799, Theophilanthropy fell from favour and there was a return to the original form of the Decadary Cult.Jean-Pierre Chantin, \\"Les adeptes de la th√©ophilanthropie\\", Rives m√©diterran√©ennes, 14, 2003 [in French] Napoleon Bonaparte's ascent to power with the Coup of 18 Brumaire and establishment of the Consulate in 1799 effectively ended the Decadary Cult, as Napoleon moved to re-establish the Roman Catholic Church in the years following, leading to the Concordat of 1801.General Michel Franceschi, Ben Weider, Wars Against Napoleon: Debunking the Myth of the Napoleonic Wars. Savas Beatie, 2008. A decree on 7 Thermidor of the Year VIII (26 July 1800) ended the cult for French citizens; only government officials were still required to attend these events.

He was part of the academy's first graduating class in 1986; he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in history and was awarded the Commander-in-Chief's Medal. He subsequently completed an additional twelve months of training at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, before he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Royal Australian Armoured Corps. His early career was marked by appointments in cavalry, armoured personnel carrier and tank units, which included troop and squadron command appointments within the 2nd Cavalry Regiment.

Biography Harold Sheehan, whose father was a general practitioner, was the second of thirteen children (6 males and 7 females). After education at Carlisle Grammar School, Harold Sheehan studied medicine at the University of Manchester, graduating MB ChB in 1921. Harold Sheehan began his practice of medicine by joining his elder brother Gerald, who had taken over their father's practice upon the latter's death. Harold Sheehan worked as a general practitioner from 1921 to 1927. He became in 1927 a demonstrator, and later a lecturer, in the University of Manchester's department of pathology. There the professor of pathology was John Shaw Dunn, who supervised Sheehan's MD thesis (1931) on the deposition of dyes in the mammalian kidney. In 1932 Sheehan graduated MSc with a thesis on renal elimination of injected urea and creatine. By means of a Rockefeller medical fellowship for the academic year 1934‚Äì1935, he studied renal function at the Johns Hopkins Medical School's department of pathology.

Architecturally, the most notable part of the complex is the main domed church whose only remaining part is its foundation.

The club took part in two editions of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, with their best result coming in the 2017 season when they finished 5th. In their most recent season, the 2018 edition, they finished 7th out of seven teams.  History  In August 2016, it was reported that Prima Small Goods would be sponsoring Buang FC for the fourth consecutive year, indicating that the club was founded sometime before 2013. Ahead of the 2017 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, it was revealed that Buang would be making their debut in the competition. The side were due to kick off the season in May 2017 against Southern Strikers, but their opponents didn't show up. As a result, their first match of the season was an away tie against champions Lae City Dwellers, which they lost 6‚Äì0. The side failed to register a victory until the sixth round of fixtures, when they secured a 3‚Äì2 victory against Vitis Yamaros, before adding a second victory in the penultimate week of the season against Madang FC. They would ultimately finish 5th, despite failing to complete their final match amidst reports that they, alongside two other clubs, had failed to pay the full affiliation fee for the season. The side struggled with payments again the following season, which started similarly to the previous season with an 8‚Äì1 defeat against Lae. As the season wore on, Buang failed to register any victories and several of their scheduled fixtures did not take place and were deferred. With one week until the playoffs, the side still had four washout matches to play, a situation blamed on 'administrative failures including financial responsibilities'. On May 11 2018, it was reported that the side had failed to comply with the NSL's requirements, and that remainder of their fixtures were awarded against them, 0‚Äì3. This left them bottom of the table with twelve defeats from twelve matches.

The area of Western Togoland is divided into five regions: Volta, Oti, Northern region, North East region and Upper East Region. In September 2020 separatists in Western Togoland declared independence from the Republic of Ghana. Western Togoland has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 2017. History The German Empire established the Togoland protectorate in 1884. Under German administration, the protectorate was regarded as a model colony or Musterkolonie and experienced a golden age. During the First World War in 1914, Britain and France invaded the protectorate. After the German defeat and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the western part of Togoland became a British mandate, British Togoland. After the Second World War British Togoland became a United Nations Trust Territory that was under British administration. In 1957 they voted in a plebiscite to become part of what is now Ghana. On May 9 2017, the Homeland Study Group Foundation () unsuccessfully tried to declare the independence of Western Togoland. On May 7, 2019, the national executive of the Volta separatist group, Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF/FGEP), Emmanuel Agbavor has rejected claims that the group had a militia. On September 25, 2020, secessionists demanded that Ghanaian Security forces leave the Volta Region after attacking several police stations in the North Tongu District of the Volta Region. In a press statement declaring their secession from Ghana, the Homeland Study Group Foundation under the leadership of Charles Kormi Kudzordz declared sovereignty over the area. The Government of Ghana did not take the declaration seriously, viewing it as a \\"joke\\", although prominent security expert Adib Sani urged the government to treat the issue as a national security risk. There have been injuries and deaths in the clash(es) following the declaration of independence though the Republic of Ghana claims to have gained intel on those clashes before they occurred. Ghanaian sources claim the secessionist group heading the independence movement, the Homeland Study Group, is under control. However, the secessionists took over arms and set up road blockades. The president of the Republic of Ghana has denied negotiating with the secessionists. Demographics About 4 million people live in Western Togoland. Languages of Western Togoland include French, Ewe, Dangme, and English. The main religions are Christianity, Islam, Af√°, and Voodoo and the majority of the people in this region are Ew√©s.

A biography of the English rock band the Beatles, it provides a musicological assessment of their work and a study of the cultural impact they had during the 1960s. It was first published in the United States by Harmony Books and took Gould seventeen years to complete, after he had begun working on the project with editor William Shawn for the Farrar, Straus and Giroux publishing company. It was the first book by Gould, who was formerly a professional musician. Can't Buy Me Love was a commercial and critical success. Several reviewers have identified it as being among the best of the many books written about the Beatles. Background and development Jonathan Gould had studied cultural anthropology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York but had never considered a career in writing. In between his work as a studio drummer, he wrote a sample chapter, covering the period in 1962 when the Beatles signed their recording contract with EMI. At a dinner party, he discussed the idea of a full book with Jacob Brackman, the cultural critic for New Yorker magazine, who suggested he contact William Shawn, Brackman's former editor and subsequently an editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux. For two years until his death in December 1992, Shawn served as a mentor to Gould as he wrote further chapters. Gould continued with a new editor, Jonathan Glusman, but the loss of Shawn's guidance and distractions in his private life hindered his progress on the manuscript. Gould credits artist Lisa Corinne Davis, whom he met on a blind date organized by a friend, with providing the inspiration for him to return to the book. He carried on developing the manuscript with Glusman, who had since moved to Harmony Books, an imprint of Random House. Can't Buy Me Love took seventeen years to complete, from Gould signing his book deal with Farrar, Straus and Giroux, to its publication by Harmony in 2007. The book ran to 661 pages, with illustrations and rare photographs of the band. Publication and reception By 2007, some 500 books had been written about the Beatles. Following Bob Spitz's The Beatles: The Biography in 2005, Can't Buy Me Love was one of the first major Beatles biographies published after the band's Anthology multimedia project, which had culminated in the publication of an authorized book in 2000. Whereas Spitz sought to present a fresh interpretation of the Beatles' story and re-evaluate aspects of their career, Gould's work combined a biography of the band with both a musicological assessment of their work and a study of the cultural impact they had during the 1960s. Shortly before its release, the book received highly favorable reviews from industry publications such as Booklist, Library Journal and Publishers Weekly. The first of the pre-publication trade reviews, however, from Kirkus Reviews, was so critical of Gould's work that Glusman chose to hide the piece from him. The book was then lauded in The New York Times Book Review. As a first-time author, according to screenwriter and journalist Nina Shengold, Gould had scored a \\"hole in one\\". In the first two months after publication, Can't Buy Me Love was reprinted three times in the hardback format. The book was published in Britain on the Portrait imprint. For the trade paperback edition, released in November 2008, the cover carried a quote from The Baltimore Sun declaring it to be \\"The best book ever written about the Beatles\\". In her 2016 study of the band's historiography, Erin Torkelson Weber comments that Gould's biography proved more impressive to \\"knowledgeable readers\\" than Spitz's, which suffered from an abundance of factual errors and an opinionated approach that revealed the author's bias. Reviews Mark Rotella of Publishers Weekly gave Can't Buy Me Love a starred \\"signature\\" review and said that \\"[Gould] has written an engrossing book, both fluid and economical (aside from one overlong section on the concept of charisma) ... Gould's deft hand makes the book sing. This is music writing at its best.\\" In his review for USA Today, Anthony DeBarros wrote that while \\"another book about The Beatles ‚Äì perhaps the single most-dissected band in the history of rock 'n' roll ‚Äì seems a superfluous exercise\\", Gould's work \\"excels by providing what's been missing from many biographies: context\\". Jim Caligiuri of The Austin Chronicle said that despite the many books about the Beatles and the 1960s, \\"Few, if any, approach both subjects together in the manner that Jonathan Gould does.\\" He described it as a \\"galvanizing read\\" and complimented the author's \\"insightful\\" assessments of some of the songs, predicting that \\"All [readers] will enjoy the tale of four extraordinary men and a band whose music can only be compared to itself.\\" Writing for The Guardian, author Jon Savage praised Gould for \\"retell[ing] this mythic fable in a way that makes it seem new again\\" through the combination of biography, musicological analysis and cultural context. He concluded: \\"With only minor mistakes of emphasis and quirks of taste, Gould's book is an essential addition to Beatle literature, ranking up there with [Ian] MacDonald's magisterial Revolution in the Head and Devin McKinney's brilliant Magic Circles.\\" In Britain's Record Collector magazine, Terry Staunton described Can't Buy Me Love as \\"endlessly fascinating, with the potential to become indispensable\\" on a par with Savage's England's Dreaming, adding that Gould's music critiques were the equal of MacDonald's \\"landmark Revolution in the Head\\". John Kehe of The Christian Science Monitor titled his review \\"Another Beatles book? Yes, maybe the best ever.\\" He praised Gould's originality, saying that his description of the Beatles' \\"incubation\\" in Liverpool was superior to any of his predecessors'. Kehe also wrote: \\"It's professional musician Gould's uncanny ability to so vividly describe the Beatles' music ‚Äì so vividly that you'd swear you could hear it playing ‚Äì that elevates his book above the rest of the Beatles canon ...\\" References External links * First chapter extract from the book, in The New York Times Book Review, October 2007 Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:Books about the Beatles Category:British biographies Category:Biographies about musicians ","title":"Can't Buy Me Love (book)"},{"id":"60123209","text":"Cuckoo Song by Frances Hardinge, is a children's or young adults' fantasy novel by Frances Hardinge, published on 8 May 2014 by Macmillan in the UK, and by Abrams Amulet in the USA. It won the 2015 Robert Holdstock Award for best fantasy novel, and was short-listed for the 2015 Carnegie Medal. The story takes place in the early 1920s, a few years after the First World War. It is mainly set in the imaginary English city of Ellchester. Ellchester is beside an estuary, hilly, and has many bridges. It also has a fairy underworld, called the Underbelly, populated by the Besiders, forgotten fairy beings. The Architect built it as a new home for them to move to now hidden secret places in the countryside are becoming rare. Hardinge tells us that the name of The Grimmer, the pond Triss is rescued from, is taken from the name of a millpond in her grandmother's village, Wickham Skeith in Suffolk. The character of Violet Parish is loosely based on her grandmother, who as a young woman shocked her home village by arriving there riding a motorcycle.  Plot  Triss has been unwell since being rescued from The Grimmer, a pond near their holiday cottage in Lower Bentling. Her memory is hazy. She sees her dolls coming alive. She has a gargantuan appetite, and feels an urge to eat her possessions as well as food. She finds dead leaves in her hair, and her tears are spiderweb. Her sister Pen hates her with a vengeance, and makes curious insinuations. At home in Ellchester, she discovers a Besider delivering letters from her dead brother, Sebastian, who writes of being stuck in a perpetual winter. Catching it, she learns about the Underbelly where many Besiders live, and that she only has seven days to live. Triss follows Pen to a meeting with the Architect. Pen admits she led Triss to the Grimmer to be abducted. The Besiders threw a stick doll containing some of Triss's possessions into the Grimmer, which emerged as a changeling with Triss's appearance and some of her memories. Learning she is not the real Triss, she now identifies herself as Not-Triss. Mr Grace the tailor exposes Not-Triss as a Besider changeling to her parents, and urges them to burn her. Pen rescues her, having become sympathetic to Not-Triss's situation. Violet Parish helps keep them safe from Mr Grace and her parents. The girls visit the Underbelly to meet the Shrike, who explains Triss's abduction was to punish her father for breaking an agreement with the Architect. Not-Triss now seeks to locate and rescue the real Triss from the Architect. She also wants to release Sebastian's soul, and prolong Not-Triss's own life beyond its seven-day design. In the end Not-Triss manages to save herself by trapping one of her belongings in her brother's watch and frees Sebastian from the limbo of the afterlife while saving Violet from her winter curse.

GamePros The Rookie was more vehement: \\"The players are flat and 2D, while occasionally bad camera angles really drag down the action. The control is atrocious because the players react to the ball too late, and you can't manually switch to the player close to the ball.\\" While the Saturn version was largely ignored by reviewers, The Rookie found it more enjoyable than the PlayStation version, citing better control, though he still advised gamers to hold out for World Series Baseball '98 instead.

He was once known by thousands for his newspaper writings, sharing his locally acquired knowledge using the pen-name \\"Coyyan\\". Biography His father, Thomas O'Leary, arrived on the third boat into Moreton Bay as second mate to the vessel, marrying Mary Mangan, one of the passengers, taking up a farming block on the Logan River trying to grow arrowroot, then becoming a teamster taking many trips to the Gympie goldfields, before moving to Brisbane where, in 1858, second son Michael O'Leary was born in Springhill. Michael O'Leary's siblings were John Joseph (1954-1933), Margret (1862-1944), Thomas Mangan (1865-1897), Mary (born 1868), and Brigid (born 1871). In March 1881, Michael O'Leary left Brisbane on the ship Katoomba for the Palmer Goldfields in the far north of Queensland to prospect and travel widely through north- east Queensland's wet tropics, writing about his experiences in local and southern papers, living in North Queensland until he died, in Cairns, on 17 August 1930, aged 72. O'Leary's brothers John Joseph and Thomas Mangan had also migrated to the far north of Queensland, with elder brother John outliving Michael O'Leary having played a prominent role within the Cairns' provisional boards and local governments, and his younger brother having died in a horse accident at Irvinebank. Pioneer After Michael O'Leary completed an apprenticeship as a printer in Brisbane, he left for the Palmer Goldfields to the north of Queensland where he met and befriended north-east Queensland explorer and prospector, Christie Palmerston, travelling with Palmerston on several prospecting trips through the wet tropical forests between Cooktown and Cardwell exploring and storing up knowledge of the wet tropical forests and ranges. As a prospector, O‚ÄôLeary was one of the first Anglo-Australians to arrive in the upper Tully River area in the early 1880s. He employed local Aboriginal men in his pursuit of alluvial gold. Writings During his years prospecting in the rainforests, O‚ÄôLeary kept a notebook and wrote a bush diary which he later published as widely read extracts in local newspapers, under the name Coyyan (a local Aboriginal word for white quartz), with his writings being printed in all of North Queensland's leading newspapers, also appearing in the southern newspapers. As a writer, O'Leary included writings about the wet tropical ranges and the Aboriginal peoples for whom these ranges and forests were home, including notably learning from Aboriginal peoples and writing about Aboriginal bush living and own names for water falls, bodies of water, mountain peaks, and landscape features previously unknown and unnamed by the Queensland state.

It consists of two sections: open-air section between ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Widzew and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Niciarniana stations, and a tunnel, currently reaching ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna station.  Existing sections   ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna - ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Widzew  Historically, this long section was opened in 1865 as a part of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Factory Railway. \\\\- a company established by Karl Wilhelm Scheibler and Jan Bloch. The railway allowed ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to be served by trains running on the Warsaw-Vienna railway. In 1903 ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Widzew station was opened, serving both \\"factory line\\" to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna and a circular line leading to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Kaliska station, both of which operated on different track gauges. The track gauge was unified during World War I. Before World War II a third station - ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Niciarniana - was opened. The line was electrified in 1954. In 2011 the section was closed, as the general reconstruction began. The old buildings of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna and Niciarniana stations were demolished, tracks were dismantled, and ground works began. In 2012 the construction of a cross-city tunnel from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Niciarniana stations has begun, along with the construction of new stations. These works required replacing a secured level crossing with an underpass for Niciarniana street and replacing the platforms with a new island platform over the underpass. On 11th of December 2016 the section was reopened, being served by ≈ÅKA commuter trains, Polregio regional trains and PKP Intercity trains.

In 2010, a contract for a feasibility study into a conventional rail tunnel was awarded to the Spanish company, Sener. The plan for conventional rail tunnel consisted of a double-track tunnel running between ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna station and railway line no. 15, running between ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Kaliska and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ≈ªabieniec stations, with the possibility for both stations to access the tunnel. The plan proposed the construction of two additional stops: ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Polesie. ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie will be located under the intersections of Zielona and Zachodnia streets with Ko≈õciuszko Avenue. ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Polesie is proposed to be located near the intersections of Ogrodowa and Jan Karski streets, near the Manufaktura shopping gallery (former site of I.

The double- track connection with Kaliska and ≈ªabieniec stations will be provided by an underground branch post ≈Å√≥d≈∫ W≈Ç√≥kniarzy, where the tunnel will split into 4 single-track tunnels - a pair for each station. The total length of the tunnel is estimated to be approximately . On 28th of November 2016 PKP PLK started an bidding process to selecting a contractor for designing and building the cross-city tunnel between Fabryczna and Kaliska stations. The maximum cost of the contract was estimated at 2.17 billion PLN, with a proposed construction period of between 48 and 51 months. In September 2017, the contract was awarded to a consortium of Energopol Szczecin and Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Budowy Dr√≥g i Most√≥w (eng. Road and Bridges Construction Company) from Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki, starting with an offer estimated at 1.59 billion PLN. The contract was signed on the 28th of December 2017. The construction works began in August 2019, starting with construction of drill chamber in the area between Odolanowska and Stolarska streets in Polesie district. From there two tunnel boring machines will begin drilling the tunnel toward western end of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna station (double-chamber) and toward ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Kaliska and ≈Å√≥d≈º ≈ªabieniec stations (single-chamber). The tunnel is expected to be complete sometime in 2022 or 2023. In February 2020 a plan for a third stopping point - ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Koziny - was approved.

Background  Ratcliffe grew up in Moston, Manchester. He was described as being well-known and well-liked and supported Manchester United F.C. He attended the North Manchester school for boys. Ratcliffe was white, medium build, 5ft 7ins tall with brown eyes and short ginger hair.  Disappearance  On 31 August 2008, at 4.45pm Ratcliffe was dropped off by his aunt, Kimberley Pierce, outside a hostel on Tib Street in the Northern Quarter, Manchester city centre. Pierce instructed Ratcliffe to call her once he was settled, though he never did. This is the last confirmed sighting of Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe was due to visit the Men‚Äôs Direct Hostel in Longsight, a homeless shelter, but he never arrived. Ratcliffe was believed to be carrying a backpack containing a packet of crisps and five pounds cash. At the time of his disappearance Ratcliffe was wearing black trainers, black Nike tracksuit bottoms and a grey and black jacket.  Subsequent events  As Ratcliffe‚Äôs family had not immediately expected to hear from Jordan they did not report him missing until 8 September 2008. In 2010 a British Transport Police PCSO stopped a young man matching Ratcliffe‚Äôs appearance on Waterloo who told the officer that he was from Manchester.

In a career which ran from July 2017 to July 2020 he ran eighteen times and won five of his races. In 2017 he was one of the best two-year-old colts in Europe, winning two races including the Gimcrack Stakes. In the following spring he established himself as a top class sprinter, taking the Prix Sigy and Sandy Lane Stakes before being narrowly defeated in the Commonwealth Cup. He ran poorly in late summer, but returned to form in autumn to record his biggest win in the British Champions Sprint Stakes. He failed to win in six races in 2019 and 2020 and was retired to stud in August 2020. Background Sands of Mali is a dark bay colt with no white markings bred in France by Simon Urizzi. In September 2016 the yearling was consigned to the Osarus sale at La Teste-de-Buch, and sold for ‚Ç¨20,000 to the bloodstock agent Con Marnane. The colt was put up for auction again in April 2017 at Ascot when he was entered in a \\"breeze-up\\" sale, in which horses are publicly galloped before being sold. He was bought for ¬£75,000 by Peter Swann's Cool Silk Partnership and sent into training with Richard Fahey at Musley Bank in North Yorkshire. He has been ridden in most of his races by Paul Hanagan. Sands of Mali is the most successful racehorse sired by Panis, an American-bred stallion who was trained in France, where he won the Prix de Cond√© and the Prix Messidor. Sands of Mali's dam Kadiania was an unraced mare who was gifted to Simon Urizzi by his former employer Yann Loizeau. She was a distant female- line descendant of the influential British broodmare Phase. Racing career 2017: two-year-old season On his racecourse debut Sands of Mali was ridden by David Nolan when he finished seventh in a minor race over six furlongs at York Racecourse on 15 July. Eighteen later he started at odds of 5/1 for a similar event on soft ground at Nottingham Racecourse and recorded his first success as he won by three and three quarter lengths from Eirene with a gap of thirteen lengths back to the other five runners. On 26 August the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Gimcrack Stakes at York and started a 14/1 outsider in a ten-runner field. His opponents included Cardsharp (July Stakes), Headway (second in the Coventry Stakes), Invincible Army (second in the Molecomb Stakes) and Nebo (second in the Richmond Stakes). Sands of Mali took the lead from the start and kept on well in the closing stages to win by two and three quarter lengths from Invincible Army. Paul Hanagan commented \\"He's a bit inexperienced, but he pinged the gates and showed a great cruising speed. He took some pulling up. I think this year is just a bonus with him, he's only going to improve\\". In the Group 1 Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse Sands of Mali was made the 9/2 second choice in the betting but, in a rough race, he never looked likely to win and came home last of the twelve runners behind U S Navy Flag. For his final run of the year the colt was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf over one mile at Del Mar Racetrack on 3 November. Ridden by Flavien Prat he led for most of the way but faded in the straight to finish ninth behind Mendelssohn, beaten three and a half lengths by the winner. In the official European Classification for 2017, Sands of Mali was rated the sixth-best two- year-old of the season, six pounds behind the top-rated U S Navy Flag. 2018: three-year-old season Sands of Mali began his second campaign with a trip to France for the Group 3 Prix Sigy over 1200 metres on heavy ground at Chantilly Racecourse on 13 April and started 4/1 third choice in the betting behind the Prix Yacowlef winner Absolute City and the Prix Thomas Bryon runner-up Alba Power. After racing in second place behind Forza Capitolino he took the lead at half way but was headed by the same rival 300 metres out. He rallied to regain the advantage in the closing stages and won by a short neck from the outsider Alistair. Fahey said \\"It was a solid performance, he gave plenty of weight all round and did a professional job on them. There's still plenty of improvement in him\\". The colt returned to England for the Group 2 Sandy Lane Stakes at Haydock Park on 28 May and started second favourite to Invincible Army in an eight-runner field which also included James Garfield (Mill Reef Stakes), Heartache (Queen Mary Stakes, Flying Childers Stakes), Barraquero (Richmond Stakes), Unfortunately (Prix Morny) and Actress (Anglesey Stakes). Sands of Mali led from the start and got the better of a \\"sustained duel\\" with Invincible Army over the final furlong to win by a short head. After the race Fahey commented \\"He's a very fast horse, we'd love to get a lead with him but nothing was quick enough today. He looked like he was going to win comfortably today, but Paul said he pricked his ears. I'd have settled for a dead-heat, I must admit. It took Paul ages to pull him up, I wouldn't mind trying him over further eventually as he doesn't look like a sprinter\\". On 22 June Sands of Mali was stepped up to Group 1 class to contest the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot and was made the 15/2 fourth choice in a field of 22 three-year-olds. Racing up the stands side of the course (the left side from the jockeys' view) he looked beaten two furlongs out but then made rapid progress despite hanging to the right and finished second, beaten half a length by Eqtidaar. Sands of Mali ran poorly in his next two races, finishing towards the rear in both the July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse (won by U S Navy Flag) and the Prix Maurice de Gheest at Deauville Racecourse in August. Fahey later commented \\"it all went pear-shaped. When you believe in a horse and it doesn't happen, it's frustrating. We were scratching our heads, we did scopes and checked his heart and couldn't find anything\\". The colt produced a better effort in the 32Red Sprint Cup Stakes on heavy ground at Haydock on 8 September when he came home fifth behind the six-year-old The Tin Man. In the Group 1 British Champions Sprint Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot on 20 October Sands of Mali started a 28/1 outsider in a field of fourteen. The Tin Man started favourite while the other contenders included Harry Angel, Limato, Librisa Breeze (winner of the race in 2017), Brando (Prix Maurice de Gheest), Tasleet (Duke of York Stakes), Sir Dancealot (Lennox Stakes) and Donjuan Triumphant (Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte). Sands of Mali took the lead from the start and kept on well under pressure in the closing stages to win \\"readily\\" by a length from Harry Angel. Hanagan said \\"We've been raving about how good he was all season, and it's just great he's shown it on the big stage. I just loved the way he picked up again when Harry Angel came to challenge. I've been lucky enough to ride some very good horses, but I rate him up there with the best of them, and I'm hoping there's more improvement when he strengthens up a bit more\\". Before the end of the year Sands of Mali was bought for an undisclosed sum by Phoenix Thoroughbreds. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Sands of Mali was given a rating of 118, making him the 78th best horse in the world. 2019: four-year-old season For his first run of 2019 Sands of Mali was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Al Quoz Sprint over 1200 metres at Meydan Racecourse. Started the 8/1 third choice in the betting but came home sixth of the thirteen runners behind Blue Point. On his return to Europe he ran third to Brando and Donjuan Triumphant in the ungraded Clyde Stakes at Hamilton Park Racecourse, a race for which he started the even money favourite. At Royal Ascot in June he made little impact as he finished towards the rear of the field behind Blue Point in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes. On his only other run of the year he attempted to repeat his 2018 success in the British Champions Sprint Stakes but finished unplaced behind Donjuan Triumphant after losing a shoe in the race. 2020: five-year-old season Sands of Mali ran twice in 2020, beaten into eighth place in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes behind Hello Youmzain before finishing fourth in a minor race at Haydock Park on his final start. In August he was retired to stud and will stand at the Ballyhane Stud in Ireland. His co-owner Peter Swann said \\"He's been a fantastic servant to us...he's a beautiful-looking horse, big and strong ‚Äì a perfect stallion ‚Äìand we hope we can get some future success from his progeny.\\" Pedigree  References  External links * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart ‚Äì Sands of Mali Category:2015 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in France Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 21-a ","title":"Sands of Mali"},{"id":"60123797","text":"Gonzalo Castillo may refer to: * Gonzalo Castillo (politician) (born 1960), Dominican politician * Gonzalo Castillo (footballer) (born 1990), Uruguayan footballer Castillo, Gonzalo ","title":"Gonzalo Castillo"},{"id":"60123803","text":"Anna Henriette Leetsmann (1888‚Äì1942) was an Estonian Bolshevik activist, politician, educator and historian. She was the only woman elected to the Provincial Assembly of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia in 1917, although she was expelled from the chamber in February 1919 after her Bolshevik activism during the period when Estonian communists, sponsored by the Soviet Union, de facto governed parts of Estonia. By that time, she had already lived in the Soviet Union since the German occupation of Estonia in February 1918; the rest of her life was spent teaching, studying and working for the party in the USSR. She was detained by the Soviet authorities twice for (allegedly) being a Trotskyist; she died during the second period of incarceration.  Early life and education  Leetsmann was born on 12 October 1888 in Kalvi, Viru County,Jaan Toomla, Valitud ja Valitsenud: Eesti parlamentaarsete ja muude esinduskogude ning valitsuste isikkoosseis aastail 1917‚Äì1999 (National Library of Estonia, 1999), p. 296. the daughter of a schoolmaster; she was brought up speaking German and studied at her father's village school in Rannu. She then attended the Zeeh Girls' School in Rakvere, graduating in 1904, and the Rakvere City School, completing her exams. She then taught at the Aseri Cement Factory's school and in 1911 began studying at St Petersburg University.\\"Anna Leetsmann\\", Estonian National Library. Retrieved 3 March 2019. Career  Communist politics and the Provincial Assembly  In 1917, Leetsmann joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) and became secretary of the party's Aseri branch. She served on the supervisory board of Viru County, and was elected to the Provincial Assembly of the newly-established Autonomous Governorate of Estonia. She tended to vote with the socialist faction of the Assembly and was the first woman elected to the Assembly and the only one until Alma Ostra-Oinas joined in November 1918.Toomla, p. 23. In December 1917, the Bolshevik Jaan Anvelt and his party seized de facto power in Tallinn and other parts of Estonia and, sponsored by the new Russian Council of People's Commissars, declared the Provincial Assembly dissolved. Leetsmann endorsed the call and travelled to Aseri to establish a revolutionary committee and organise the cement factory's brigade of Red Riflemen (Punakaart). She was elected, in December 1917, secretary of the Soviet of Workers and Soldiers (T√∂√∂liste ja Soldatite Saadikute N√µukogu) and appointed the Revolutionary Commissar of Viru County. The Imperial Germany Army expelled the communists in February 1918 and Leetsmann retreated to the Soviet Union to teach and work for her party; in the meantime, Germany withdrew from the Baltic lands after losing the First World War, prompting the Soviets to reoccupy the territory despite the Estonian Provisional Government declaring its independence. Once the resulting Estonian War of Independence had forced to the Russians out of Estonia (by February 1919), the Provincial Assembly moved to establish its first Constitution.\\"Estonia: History\\", Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved 3 March 2019. Its members also expelled Leetsmann, on 5 February, and she took no further part in Estonian politics.  Life in the Soviet Union, teaching and captivity  Leetsmann never returned to Estonia. In 1923, she became head of the Estonian division of Communist University of the National Minorities of the West and lectured in the party's history. After studying at the St Petersburg Institute of History and Research (1930‚Äì32), she taught at the MN Pokrovski Pedagogical Institute and served as Deputy Director. Two years later, she was appointed to a position in the Education Department in St Petersburg (by then renamed Leningrad). After Sergey Kirov's assassination in December 1934, she left the city and the following year became Head of the Education Department in the Dubrovnik District of Tobolsky District in the Omsk Oblast. The next year, she was arrested and accused of harbouring Trotskyist sympathies; expelled from the party, she was released but later rearrested and died while detained, on 5 March 1942.

It was influential in introducing Americans to tofu, included recipes for making and using tempeh and other soy foods, and became a staple in vegetarian kitchens. History The Farm is an intentional community founded in 1971 in Lewis County, Tennessee. Their diet is vegan, which at the time was uncommon in the United States. UNICEF, seeing an opportunity to examine a large group all eating the same diet, sent nutritionists to the community. When the UNICEF experts checked the members' nutritional intake, they found it provided adequate protein but fell short in providing carbohydrates, fats, and calories. Recipes were developed to provide community members with guidance in following the experts' advice, and then collected to become the cookbook. The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook was first published in 1975 by Book Publishing Company, the publishing arm of The Farm, and was a commercial success for the community. In 1978 a revised edition titled The New Farm Vegetarian Cookbook was published. In 1982 it was translated into German and published under the title Soja Total. According to its publisher it was the first completely vegan cookbook published in the United States. Louise Hagler wrote several books on soy foods. She became a vegetarian in 1969. Contents The book emphasizes soy products such as soymilk, tofu, and tempeh, and gives guidelines for making them from scratch. Douglas Stevenson in The Farm Then and Now said it was one of the first cookbooks to provide \\"easy-to-follow, good-tasting\\" vegan recipes. The Farm leader Stephen Gaskin wrote in the introduction that the cookbook was not intended to be \\"cultish, faddish, or scare people off\\" but instead to educate readers and inform them that a vegetarian diet is based heavily on beans. Impact Cooked tofu Academic Matthew Roth in Magic Bean:The Rise of Soy in America called it a staple in vegetarian kitchens. Shurtleff and Aoyagi said the book played an important role in introducing soy foods and a vegan diet to Americans, made a major contribution to \\"westernizing recipes previously Oriental in origin\\", and encouraged vegetarianism not only as a diet but as a lifestyle. Vegetarian Times said it pioneered vegan nutrition and introduced America to cooking with tofu. Vegetarian historians Karen and Michael Iacobbo said it was instrumental in introducing Americans to tofu, tempeh, and textured vegetable protein in the 1970s. Reputation In 1990 Vegetarian Times called it a staple in vegetarian kitchens and in 1994 named it one of the five best vegan cookbooks. Food historians William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi called it pioneering and influential. The Vegetarian Journal called it a \\"famous\\" cheese-alternative cookbook, noting its recipe for Macaroni and \\"Cheese\\" Casserole, which uses nutritional yeast as a cheese substitute. The Fellowship for Intentional Community called it a classic.

It aired on Epix. It presents the arguments of Stalcup, who stated that a missile strike had actually downed the airliner, contradicting the official National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation. Stalcup himself is the main narrator. The film runs 90 minutes and first aired on Epix on July 17, 2013. Stephen Pope of Flying expressed his belief that the film was made in good faith rather than out of cynical motives. Background Stalcup, the head of the Flight 800 Independent Researchers Organization, began his advocacy in 1997. He is a physicist. Contents The film states that the plane was destroyed by three proximity fuse missiles, but does not state which party did it. According to the film, the primary radar data was the key piece of evidence related to the theory, and it discusses this for about three minutes and thirty seconds. The film also stated that shootdown sequence video made by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was not accurate and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) hid or tampered with the remains from the crash. It includes testimonies of people who saw the crash who stated that a missile shootdown occurred; Pope characterized these as taking up a larger amount of the film. Greg Evans of Bloomberg Businessweek stated that \\"The film offers no dissenting interpretation of his facts, or even outside acknowledgement that his facts are facts. Nor does the documentary attempt to explain how a cover-up that would require hundreds of participants could remain secret for 17 years.\\" Its interviewees include one person each from the NTSB, Trans World Airlines (TWA), and the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA): Hank Hughes, Bob Young, and James Speer. The end of the film has a list of people who declined to be interviewed, including former President of the United States Bill Clinton and FBI and NTSB employees; \\\\- Also at Houston Chronicle Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times stated that this list was \\"lengthy\\". Reception Pope argued that the film should have spent more time on the radar data theory rather than focusing on the witnesses. He expressed his view that the film's conclusions were flawed and that the official NTSB report described what happened to the flight. Genzlinger stated that the documentary had a \\"serious and somber\\" tone instead of a \\"crackpot conspiracy theory\\" tone, but that the large number of people who chose not to be interviewed \\"leaves it one-sided\\". Verne Gay of Newsday stated that the film fails to explain how information that was suppressed would have remained unleaked, citing the Edward Snowden affair, and that the film does not explain what would have happened to the remnants of any missiles. He added that \\"At the very least, this film indisputably establishes that pain and doubt -- often lashed together -- are deeply human traits.\\" Alex Davies of Business Insider stated that the film did not show adequate support for its claims.

The event was established in 2018, started by national race organisers Run4Wales.  Background  The title sponsor is Associated British Ports, the operator of South Wales' ports including Newport Docks. The first race in 2018 saw nearly 10,000 runners take part in both the marathon (3,444 finishers) and the 10K version (2,576 finishers). Local sports body Newport Now has estimated that the 2018 race brought ¬£1.1m to the local economy. The course is known as particularly flat, and flatter than its sister race, the Admiral City of Newport Half Marathon. It was designed by Welsh Olympian Steve Brace. Wales' most successful sprinter, Christian Malcolm, is also involved with pre-race events and a warm- up prior to the race.  Route  The Half Marathon held in March follows the National Cycle Network Route 88 path to the historic Roman fortress town of Caerleon (Isca Augusta), and through Caerleon Road. In contrast the Marathon and 10K go south of the city, over the City Bridge to Coronation Park and the Grade 1-listed Transporter Bridge. The marathon continues on to the particularly flat land around the coast of eastern Newport, towards Llanwern, Goldcliff and Magor, mostly former or current marshlands with firm road conditions and flat terrain. Organisers describe the event as one of the UK's flattest with over 70% of participants claiming a personal best in 2018.  Organisation  Sponsors include the Welsh Government, the UK Office for National Statistics, the University of South Wales, Newport City Council and the city retail centre Friars Walk.  Event history   2019 event  It was announced in May 2018 that the event will return, with the 2019 marathon and 10K will take place for the second time on 5 May 2019. Tata Steel have been announced as a new sponsor and the Family Mile will also resume in 2019. Entry is priced at an early rate of ¬£45, and ¬£40 for Welsh Athletics affiliated runners.  2018 result   Marathon  The inaugural ABP Newport Marathon took place on 29 April 2018. The winner was Neath Harriers' James Carpenter with a time of 2:33:31. The fastest female was Natasha Cockram of Mickey Morris Racing Team with a time of 2:44:58. The marathon saw a wide range of participants, from one of the oldest runners, 80 year old Sydney Wheeler of Chepstow Harriers, to former boxer Matthew Edmonds. A separate Family Mile also took place.  10K  Cardiff AAC's Ieuan Thomas won the 10K with a time of 00:29:43, and Shaftesbury Barnet Harriers' Rachel Felton was the fastest female with a time of 00:35:03.

Old Provost is the equivaleny of Deputy Provost. Byers Close on the Royal Mile is named after him.The Closes and Wynds of Edinburgh: The Old Edinburgh Club. Life He was born in Edinburgh in 1569. His background is unclear but he appears to have been from a wealthy family of merchants and bankers. In the late 16th century he bought tenements (from Gilbert Lauder) on the Royal Mile north of St Giles Cathedral close to the Old Tolbooth and the Luckenbooths. Here he rented out the flats and ground floor shops and presumably ran his own bank (probably 369 High Street). He was Treasurer of Edinburgh Town Council 1612 to 1615. He also served as Depute Provost (at that time confusingly termed \\"Old Provost\\"). In 1615 he built Coates Hall, later called Easter Coates, then west of the city (now lying between Palmerston Place and Manor Place). The building contains carved stone lintels brought from his house on Byers Close, plus a marriage lintel bearing his initials JB (written as IB in old script) and MB for his wife. He served as Dean of Guild 1619 to 1624.Edinburgh City Council: List of Deans of Guild He died on 24 November 1629. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. His monument stands on the western wall of the original churchyard, on the lower north section close to the half- sunken vault of John Baptist Medina. The magnificent monument was created by William Wallace. His Royal Mile tenements were acquired by William Dick of Braid after Byres' death. Family He first married Margaret Barclay of Towie. They had one child, a daughter, Rachel Byres. Two other daughters died in infancy. Rachel married Thomas Sydserff. Margaret died in 1616 and in 1617 he secondly married Agnes Smith sister of John Smith of Grothill (a future Provost of the city). They had six sons and one daughter including his heir: Sir John Byres of Coates and Warriston, 2nd Baronet (1619-1648). Trivia Coates Hall was bought by William Walker around 1800. His spinster daughters, Mary and Barbara Walker, gifted both the garden of their home and huge funds to the Episcopal Church of Scotland in 1873 for the building of St Mary's Cathedral. In 1887 (following the death of the sisters) Coates Hall (Easter Coates) became the Cathedral Choir School serving the then newly built St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral being remodelled by George Gilbert Scott and John Oldrid Scott, architects for the cathedral next door (which now dwarfs Coates Hall).Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker It is noteworthy that the Walker sisters chose to be buried next to John Byres in Greyfriars Kirkyard.

In 2002, he was the first person of Latinx heritage elected as President of the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP). He has won national and international awards for his writing, including the Contemporary Poetry Series Competition (Postmortem, 1992) and an International Latino Book Award (POEMA, 2010). Across genres, he is known for a seriocomic writing style that investigates the overlapping of voices, experiences, and tensions that complicate immigrant life in the United States and throughout the global Latin American diaspora. He is a professor of English and the Coordinator of the Creative Writing Program at the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee.  Early life and education  Kilwein Guevara was born in 1961 in Belencito, Colombia, a small Andean town 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest of Bogot√°, to John Kilwein (a social worker and, later, educator) and Beatriz Guevara Kilwein (a homemaker and, later, bilingual secretary). His father was born in Pittsburgh during the Great Depression. Born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, his mother emigrated from Bogot√°, Colombia in 1963. At the age of two, Kilwein Guevara moved with his parents and brothers from Colombia to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, first living with his paternal grandparents in the Hazelwood neighborhood, then home to the Jones and Laughlin Coke Works. Of those early experiences, Kilwein Guevara has noted: > I was six or seven and listening to the immigrants and the natives and the > migrants (some transplants from Germany, Italy, Colombia, Ireland, Poland, > Hungary, Jim Crow Alabama, Mississippi, and Mexico by way of Weirton, West > Virginia). To speak with an accent, to speak another language, to coexist > giddily with tongues I didn't understand, to listen for tenor, to study how > people laughed at the deli or pointed at the bread counter, to imitate how > we learn to injure or sooth, to laugh or cry, this was quotidian. By the age of seven, Kilwein Guevara and his family had resided in six different rental properties in Latin America, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh. Eventually by the mid-1970s his family was able to take up permanent residence in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, where Kilwein Guevara graduated from high school in 1979. From 1979 to 1983, Kilwein Guevara attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he double-majored in English Writing and Behavioral Psychology . While a student, he was hired by the Hillman Library to work the circulation desk of the Spoken Arts Collection. He has written that this job was formative: \\"In Hillman I also heard recordings of Neruda, Eliot, Plath, Sexton, Martin Luther King, Jr., Delmore Schwartz, e.e.cummings, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Hayden and Frost.\\" While an undergraduate, he studied with Patricia Dobler and Diane Ackerman. He attended Bowling Green State University (Ohio) in the mid-1980s, earning a Master of Fine Arts in fiction writing. While at BGSU, he worked with Robert Early and Philip F. O'Connor. In 1990, Kilwein Guevara completed a doctorate in fiction writing and literary studies in the Department of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he studied with the novelist John Goulet. Of the latter, he has written: \\"Of the many things that John helped to clarify for me over the thirty years of our friendship is that literature at its best animates the core social functions of bringing humans closer to one another, of mitigating unwelcome solitude, and of growing our empathy for the world at large.\\"  Poetry  Kilwein Guevara's poems tend to focus on the intersections and overlaps of experience, language, time and space. His poems are both lyrical and experimental, Latin and North American, meticulous yet unpredictable. Colombian author Jaime Manrique calls Kilwein Guevara \\"righteous, funny, tender, melancholy, outrageous, musical, philosophical, terrifying, formal, colloquial, a realist, a surrealist, and a visionary‚Äîall at once.\\" Kilwein Guevara's aesthetic, as described by the literary critic Michael Dowdy, is \\"scavenger Infrapoetics\\" where poems \\"emerge from materialist and ecological conceptions of language\\" and employ \\"surrealist, magic realist, and vanguardist practices.\\" Poet Patricia Monaghan writing for Booklist stated, \\"the word multicultural might have been coined for this poet, who alludes to Dante as casually as he deploys Spanish slang.\\" Kilwein Guevara's first collection of poetry, Postmortem, was published in 1994 by the University of Georgia Press and was nominated for the National Book Award. It was one of two winning selections for the Contemporary Poetry Series judged by Lynn Emanuel. The other was Susan Wheeler's Bag 'O' Diamonds. Publishers Weekly called Postmortem \\"a captivating view of immigration‚Ä¶Guevara's vivid use of color binds him to all those estranged from their homeland.\\" His debut collection highlighted the complex and interrelated histories of violence that have united Colombia and the United States of America. Kilwein Guevara's Poems of the River Spirit was published in 1996 by the Pitt Poetry Series. Kilwein Guevara's Autobiography of So-an-so: Poems in Prose was published in 2001 by New Issues Press and was nominated for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Poet Michael Simms said the collection \\"leaps easily from image to image, using the rise and fall of prose syntax the way that a mountain goat uses thin ledges to scale impossible cliffs.\\" John Bradley, writing in Rain Taxi, notes that \\"[Kilwein Guevara] takes autobiographical material and imaginatively recasts it into something of nearly mythical proportions.\\" Kilwein Guevara's POEMA was published by The University of Arizona Press as part of their Camino del Sol Latinx Literature Series in 2009. Author Pablo Medina called POEMA \\"a necessary book for our time‚Ä¶ the work of a mature and remarkably gifted poet.\\" Poet and critic Francisco Arag√≥n, writing for The Latin American Review of Books, stated: \\"POEMA establishes the Colombian-born Guevara as the most 'Latin American' of Latino poets in the United States, if not simply one of our most cosmopolitan poets, period.\\" Poema According to Kilwein Guevara, poema (Spanish for poem) is \\"a miniaturist form, especially the combustible lyric‚Ä¶ the tinier the space, the greater the poem's expansive energy.\\" For Kilwein Guevara: > Poema feels and is thought by the human body. Poema hunts and is haunted. > Cut a line of poema open and it glows optic red. Poema spreads by capillary > effect‚Ä¶ It involves pain, like torn muscle between ribs. Poema celebrates > joy and dolor and boredom. It is many tongued, polytropos. About the collection POEMA Michael Dowdy writes: \\"Here is part of ‚ÄòJoan Brossa as the Emerald Moth Discharging Energy,' which takes as its departure point the Catalan avant-garde poet's 1967 art-object: > This is the strophe starring Joan Brossa as the panicked emerald moth, Joan > Brossa en Espa√±a, ensnared, Joan Brossa being eaten by a wet strawberry, > Joan Brossa writing POEMA on a clear lightbulb, Joan Brossa swimming the > butterfly, Joan Brossa a shape of color balancing on a blush orchid in > tierra caliente, Joan Brossa at twilight staring up at Gederme, Joan > Brossa's statue with mountainous feet and legs, genitalia and twisting torso > transparent liquid glass with buzzing filament. > The passage's sensual liquid movement is a long way from [Mart√≠n] Espada's > Whitmanian anaphora and [Juan Felipe] Herrera's rollicking, shamanistic list > poems. Like the infinitive in \\"The Easter Revolt,\\" progressive tense verbs > and adverbs (\\"starring,\\" \\"writing,\\" \\"swimming,\\" \\"balancing,\\" \\"staring,\\" > \\"twisting,\\" \\"buzzing\\") propel the poem's energy outward, away from the > object (\\"tablespoon,\\" \\"lightbulb,\\" \\"moth\\") to radiate in the night sky, the > embodied strophe simultaneously gigantic (\\"mountainous\\") and tiny as a > filament.  Other writing  Across genres, he is known for a seriocomic writing style that investigates the overlapping of voices, experiences, and tensions that complicate immigrant life in the United States and throughout the global Latin American diaspora. Kilwein Guevara has written a full-length play, a comedy entitled \\"El √∫ltimo puente/The Last Bridge,\\" which received a staged reading Off-Broadway at Urban Stages, directed by Charlie Schroeder. In collaboration with colleagues Mike Sell, Barbara Blackledge, and Brian Jones, Kilwein Guevara staged a black-box performance of Autobiography of So-and-so at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. In 2010, he published a book of literary translations in Madrid, Spain with Traves√≠as Ediciones. With research from a Fulbright grant to Ecuador, Kilwein Guevara traveled to do research for a novel entitled The Thieves of Guevara.  Activism  In 2002, Kilwein Guevara was the first person of Latinx heritage elected as President of the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP). Kilwein Guevara has been involved in labor organizing (as an elected officer with the American Federation of Teachers Local 3535), community organizing, language arts education in public schools, and in political resistance campaigns (the Wisconsin Uprising and the unsuccessful campaign to unseat Governor Scott Walker through a recall effort).  Career as an educator  Kilwein Guevara has held numerous teaching positions across North and Latin America: Bowling Green State University (Ohio), Florida State University (Tallahassee), Marquette University (Milwaukee), Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (Bogot√°), Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla), Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Vermont College (Montpelier), and since 2003 as Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he directs the Doctoral Program in Creative Writing  Published works   Bibliography  *Postmortem.

The character is portrayed by Mike Smith, Bubbles is one of the three main characters on the show along with Ricky LaFleur and Julian He was created by series creator Mike Clattenburg. Bubbles also appears in three feature-length film. He appears in the films: Trailer Park Boys: The Movie (2006), Countdown to Liquor Day (2009), and Don't Legalize It (2014). Bubbles also appears in numerous spin-offs, including Out of the Park: Europe, Out of the Park: USA, and The Animated Series, for which the latter Mike Smith voices him. Character biography Bubbles is the youngest primary character, Julian and Ricky's closest friend, and the series' breakout character. In the first season, like most of the characters in the show, Bubbles maintains a somewhat- reserved demeanour to look good on camera. As the series progresses, he reveals many sides to his personality. Bubbles' full name is never revealed, and he is simply referred to by hospitals, courts, and other officials as \\"Bubbles.\\" A Haligonian, he is known for his hoarse Maritimer English, sensitive nature, pearl snap shirts, and thick glasses that magnify his eyes to a considerable degree. Bubbles has never been seen without his glasses, even in photographs of him as a child. The episode \\"Propane, Propane\\" reveals that Bubbles may be legally blind, as he cannot see how many fingers are held up directly before his face by a truck-driving instructor who admonishes him for not being able to see \\"jack shit\\". Bubbles often acts as the Boys' conscience and tries to be the voice of reason during their misadventures. He is intelligent and has a larger general knowledge than most of the other residents, displaying knowledge of Greek philosophy, classical literature, as well as a strong interest in spaceflight and rocket science, which results in one special episode in which he and the Boys meet Canadian astronaut Commander Chris Hadfield and participate in a spaceflight training simulation. He regularly chastises his comrades for being \\"drunk and on drugs\\" and gets upset whenever they fight; he is often forced to act as a peacemaker between the two in such scenarios. He also believes in (and harbors a fear of) Sasquatches (which he calls \\"samsquantches\\"). When he was age 6, Bubbles' parents fled the trailer park to escape debt collectors, and he was placed with Julian's grandmother. Bubbles lives in a tool shed with his numerous cats, who are his only family. In Don't Legalize It he acquires a school bus that he inherited from his parents, although it isn't shown or mentioned again by Season 8. Bubbles has taken it upon himself to care for every stray cat in Sunnyvale, including a mountain lion he named Steve French (\\"If You Love Something, Set It Free\\"). At the beginning of the series, he makes his living by salvaging shopping carts, repairing them, and selling them back to stores. In later seasons, he attempts to start various legitimate enterprises, which are always promptly usurped by the Boys as fronts for illegal operations and ultimately destroyed. Despite this, he is usually willing to partake in the Boys' various get-rich-quick schemes with only mild objections, because he considers Ricky and Julian to be his only family other than his \\"kitties.\\" While Bubbles isn't always spared the consequences for their activities (especially in later seasons), he usually is able to escape jail time because Ricky and Julian often cover up his involvement in their schemes when facing arrest. However, Bubbles gets arrested at the end of Season 4 after he was caught driving with a fake license as part of a scheme. He also brings heat upon himself and Julian and Ricky in Season 7, after stealing Patrick Swayze's personal model train while in Maine to arrange a drug deal with singer Sebastian Bach. The theft leads to a $50,000 reward for Bubbles, causing Jim Lahey (at that point reinstated as police officer) to violate their peace treaty to make an attempt to arrest the Boys in the hopes of getting the reward. Although his life is not always easy, Bubbles takes great pride in being a self-made man and prefers his simple life of independence to any offer of free lodging from his friends. Bubbles has a sentimental, kind nature and often cries when threatened, upset, or moved by kind gestures. The episode \\"Dear Santa Claus, Go Fuck Yourself\\" reveals that Julian's grandmother promised Bubbles' parents that Julian would always look after him. Bubbles dislikes gunfights and is often appalled at the dangerous situations that Ricky and Julian get themselves into, but when he is forced into a shootout his firearms of choice are Ak-47 variants, such as the Galil MAR and Type 56 assault rifle. Bubbles' wrestling alter-ego is the \\"Green Bastard\\". His favorite band is Rush, and was Alex Lifeson's guitar tech at a concert. Conky Conky is a ventriloquist puppet that Bubbles allegedly received from a family member who used him in vaudeville times. Conky wears a sweater over a flannel shirt and large glasses similar to Bubbles. Bubbles treats Conky as a trusted friend, but bestows him with a caustic, annoying, and domineering personality. Conky tends to insult people, especially Ricky; his utterances even shock Bubbles himself. Not long after Bubbles created Conky, Ricky and Julian stole Conky and threw him into the local swamp because they were tired of \\"his\\" insults and worried about Bubbles' sanity. In Season 4 Episode 5, they must recover Conky to convince Bubbles to go to the hospital to have an infected tooth treated. Conky immediately resumes insulting Ricky and bullying Bubbles. After convincing Ricky not to shoot Conky, Julian shoots Conky \\"dead,\\" demolishing the puppet's face. Julian and Ricky dispose of the remains in the swamp as a distraught Bubbles looks on. At the end of Season 7, a stressed-out Bubbles retrieves and restores Conky. During this time, it is implied that Conky might have his own sentient consciousness, as he calls the police on the boys while everyone, including Bubbles, is seemingly asleep. Eventually, Bubbles realizes that he needs to lose Conky for good and \\"drowns\\" him. Conky reappears briefly in Season 8, but is not seen nor heard from again afterwards. In Season 7 Episode 9, Bubbles tells how his grandfather, a vaudeville ventriloquist, left Conky to him. This could be a retcon for Conky's origin or an indication of Conky's warping influence on Bubbles' sense of reality. Looper described Conky as the most divisive character in the series. Reception and legacy American musician Axl Rose has been described as a big fan of the series and of Bubbles. Axl brought the character's actor, Mike Smith, on tour with him. In 2005, Mike Smith in character as Bubbles, along with Robb Wells and John Paul Tremblay as Ricky and Julian, threw out the first pitch at the home opener of the 2005 Toronto Blue Jays season at the Rogers Centre. A Trailer Park Boys- themed restaurant was opened in Halifax, Nova Scotia called Bubbles Mansion. It was partly owned by Mike Smith and closed in 2010.

Known for being a skilled soldier, Umar Shaikh was one of Timur's military commanders and also served as a regional governor. He died in 1394, predeceasing his father by over a decade. Birth and early career Umar Shaikh Mirza was one of four sons of Timur who survived infancy. His mother Tolun Agha was a concubine. There is some disagreement regarding whether Umar Shaikh or his brother Jahangir Mirza was the eldest of Timur's sons. The Mu'izz al-Ansab (The Glorifier of Genealogies), the most important source regarding the structure of the Timurid royal family during this period, is contradictory on this point. It states that Jahangir was the eldest, but the family of Umar Shaikh is presented first in the genealogy itself, implying that he was born first. Narrative sources, such as the Zafarnama by Nizam-ud- din Shami, and Yazdi's book of the same name support the notion that Umar Shaikh was older. Umar Shaikh proved himself an accomplished warrior and a skilled horseman, taking part in many of his father's campaigns. In 1376, Timur appointed him governor of Ferghana. War against Tokhtamysh In 1388, war broke out between Timur and his former mentee, the Khan of the Golden Horde, Tokhtamysh. By this point, Tokhtamysh and Timur had already engaged each other several times. Timur's lands were attacked on two fronts; Tokhtamysh launched his assault from Bukhara while his ally Qamar-ud-din Dughlat did so from Ferghana. At the same time, a rebellion erupted in the province of Khwarazm. Umar Shaikh was sent against Dughlat, while Timur himself marched towards Tokhtamysh. Dughlat was quickly defeated by the prince, prompting Tokhtamysh to flee from Timur's advance. Timur at this point diverted his attention to Khwarezm and brutally suppressed the rebellion, resulting in the devastation of the region. Tokhtamysh once more attempted to attack in the winter of that year but was again defeated, this time by Umar Shaikh. Timur chased the Khan out of his lands and in 1391 launched a counteroffensive against him. This culminated in the Battle of the Kondurcha River, which took place in the Golden Horde territory of Volga. Umar Shaikh led the left wing of the army, his brother Miran Shah the right, their nephew Muhammad Sultan the centre and Timur himself the rear. While initially indecisive, the battle seemed to turn in the Khan's favour when Umar Shaikh's contingent was detached from the main army and nearly overwhelmed. However, this was averted when Tokhtamysh himself was forced to abandon the field while under attack by Timur, leading to confusion and panic among his troops. The Golden Horde's army was routed and forced to flee, the soldiers being chased and cut down by the Timurids. The death toll of the battle was estimated to have been 100,000 men and women. Death The Tomb of Jahangir in Shakhrisabz, Uzbekistan In 1393, Timur defeated the Persian Muzaffarid dynasty with the capture and execution of its final monarch, Shah Mansur. Timur bestowed the kingdom's former territory of Fars on Umar Shaikh to administer as governor. The prince's earlier post of Ferghana was given to his son Iskandar Mirza. However, Umar Shaikh was not able to hold this position for long. In 1394, whilst answering summons from his father, Umar Shaikh was killed after being shot in the neck by an arrow fired from the Kurdish fortress of Kharmatu, near the city of Baghdad. Timur reportedly did not show any emotion upon learning of his son's death. Umar Shaikh's governorship was given to his eldest son Pir Muhammad, while his body was escorted by his wives and his younger son Iskandar to the city of Kesh (modern day Shahrisabz). Here, he was buried alongside his brother in the Tomb of Jahangir, part of the Dorussaodat mausoleum complex. Presently, the tomb is the best surviving part of the structure.

A young man appeared when they opened the door, then immediately two other men armed with guns and with their faces uncovered showed up at the door. Once inside, they forced Jose Ignacio to lie on the ground while his spouse and their four children were taken to another room, where the men warned the family not to call the police until midnight. The spouse asked the men what were they planning to do to Jos√© Ignacio. One of the men replied that it had yet to be decided and that they were going to talk about it. Ten minutes later, the spouse left the room to check if they had gone. They had taken her husband. The ETA members had left, but first, they had cut the phone intending to leave them without means of communication. Around 9:30 p.m., some neighbours found Ustaran's vehicle, a white Chrysler 150, at the entrance to the building's garage on San Prucendio street in Vitoria beneath the headquarters of the UCD. The neighbours located Jose Igancio's body inside the car on the back seat. He has been shot in the back and head. No charges were brought for this attack. According to the Ministry of Peace and Coexistence of the Basque Government, the case has been closed unsolved. The day after the murder, ETA political- military claimed responsibility for this attack. The group called the killing ‚Äúa response to the crossroads that the UCD party, who held power, has created for the Basque's democracy due to the approval of the Status a year ago.\\" The group also stated that the attack had taken places against \\" the repressive escalation that UCD has launched on Euskadi.\\" The identity of the perpetrators of the crime remained unknown. In June 2018, the National Audience restated the 1983 decision that they were not able to identify the three gunmen who had pulled him out of his house and killed him.

Anthony Statue Fund, is a nonprofit, all-volunteer organization dedicated to placing the Women's Rights Pioneers Monument, the first statue honoring women‚Äôs history in New York City‚Äôs Central Park. With support from the New York City Parks Department and the Central Park Conservancy, the statue honors Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Sojourner Truth, who were pioneers in the battle for women‚Äôs right to vote and the larger movement for women‚Äôs rights. The site is the northwest corner of the Literary Walk portion of The Mall, the widest pedestrian path in Central Park, that spans from 66th Street to 72nd Street.  Mission  To commission and maintain a statue in Central Park dedicated to honoring women's history. To create an educational campaign around women's rights history. To challenge municipalities to honor more women and people of color in public spaces.  History  Since 2013, the Statue Fund/Monumental Women campaign dealt with the City to \\"break the bronze ceiling\\" in Central Park to create the first statue of real women in the Park's 165-year history. Monumental Women raised $1.5 million in mostly private funding to pay for the statue, including contributions from foundations, businesses and over 1,000 individual donations. The statue campaign is dependent on private donations. Several troops of the Girl Scouts of Greater New York have donated money from their cookie sales to the fund and the fund has received a $500,000 grant from New York Life. The effort has the support of numerous elected officials, including Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, every member of the New York City Council Women‚Äôs Caucus, Congresswomen, U.S. Senators, as well as historians, foundations, and others. The Women‚Äôs Rights Pioneers Monument was created by sculptor Meredith Bergmann, who in July 2018 was chosen out of 91 artists who applied for the commission to create the statue. The New York City Public Design Commission approved Bergmann‚Äôs statue design on October 21, 2019. The sculpture was unveiled in Central Park on August 26, 2020, also celebrated as Women‚Äôs Equality Day, to mark the centennial anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote nationwide.  Statue design and process  In 1995, the artist Meredith Bergmann was working on a film set in Central Park and noticed there were \\"no sculptures of actual women of note and accomplishment.\\" and 23 years later she was the sculptor who was awarded the commission for the design chosen to honor women of the suffrage movement in Central Park.Sculpture as seen on 8-26-2020 The call for sculptors involved a Request for Qualifications and Request for Proposals, in which Monumental Women invited sculptors to submit illustrations of previous work, curriculum vitae and their approach to the design of the monument in sketch, text form or both. 91 artists from across the nation applied. The submissions were reviewed in a blind selection process by a diverse jury consisting of art and design professionals, historians and representatives from New York City Parks and the Monumental Women. Four qualified finalists were invited to submit models for the monument with Bergmann ultimately receiving the commission. The competition was coordinated and managed by architecture firm Beyer Blinder Belle Architects & Planners LLP. The statue depicts Sojourner Truth speaking, Susan B. Anthony organizing, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton writing, ‚Äúthree essential elements of activism,‚Äù in Bergmann‚Äôs vision. Bergmann researched the women extensively, painstakingly studying every photo and description she could find in order to accurately portray not just their physical characteristics, but also their personalities. She believes it is important that a monument to them be ‚Äúlarger than life‚Äù to reflect the large impact that they had on history. A few hours after the unveiling Bergmann worked on a tight timeline to complete the statue in time for the unveiling on August 26, 2020, the fastest she‚Äôs ever completed a work of this scale. After receiving approval for her design from the New York City Public Design Commission in October 2019, Bergmann immediately began creating the 9-foot-tall clay figures. The rest of the process, including making molds, casts, pouring the molten bronze, final touch-ups and patina, will take nearly all the remaining time until the scheduled unveiling on August 26, 2020. The sculpture was installed in Central Park on August 25, 2020, to mark the centennial anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which granted American women the right to vote.  Criticism  The Statue Fund/Monumental Women campaign has withstood criticism during the approval process of Bergmann's statue. The initial design of the statue featured Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton holding a scroll listing the names of 22 other suffragists. This was criticized as marginalizing these 22 other activists (seven of whom are women of color) and reducing them to a mere footnote. In the second maquette of the statue, the scroll was removed entirely, leaving only Stanton and Anthony. This version of the statue was unanimously approved by the New York City Public Design Commission. The Commission mostly issued critiques regarding the artistic elements of the statue, but concluded their statements saying, \\"(...) the Commission gives approval conditioned upon the understanding that, separate from the statue of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, the applicant will work to identify meaningful ways to acknowledge and commemorate women of color who played an active role in the Woman Suffrage Movement.\\" However, the monument began receiving public criticism about its lack of representation of women of color. This seemed an especially acute issue given that the subjects of the statue, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, were co-editors of the first few volumes of The History of Woman Suffrage, a six-part history of the women's suffrage movement that, some scholars and journalists claim, largely omitted the contributions of black women. This criticism was made despite a word search of the first three volumes of The History of Woman Suffrage finding African American woman suffragists mentioned at least 85 times, often with much detail and direct quotes. Sojourner Truth is mentioned over 50 times, Frances E. W. Harper 16 times, Mary Shadd Cary four times. Historian Rosalyn Terborg-Penn said she used The History of Woman Suffrage and Stanton and Anthony‚Äôs newspaper, THE REVOLUTION, to help identify African American woman suffragists.'‚ÄôAfrican American Women in the Struggle for the Vote, 1850-1920'‚Äô, p. 4 In the wake of public criticism, the statue was redesigned again, this time featuring three figures: Anthony, Stanton, and Sojourner Truth. Truth, an African American abolitionist, suffragist, and activist, was active in the same time as Anthony and Stanton. Many people are satisfied the inclusion of Truth as representation of women of color in the suffrage movement. However, Truth is most famous for her 1851 \\"Ain't I a Woman\\" speech, and Monumental Women lists this speech as a reason for her fame. Several versions exist, as provided at The Sojourner Truth Project and the one most commonly reproduced portrays Truth as using a southern slave dialect unlikely for a New Yorker. It written by Frances Dana Barker Gage, nearly twelve years after the speech was given, and the statue does not specify any version.

It was flown but not granted a Certificate of Airworthiness. Design and development In 1939 √Årp√°d Lampich designed a single-seat club trainer constructed from wood, steel sheet and steel tubes. Its wing, which was mounted on top of the fuselage, was rectangular in plan out to angled, blunted tips and built around a wooden I-beam spar at about 25% of the chord, assisted by an auxiliary spar near the trailing edge. The latter was a steel cylinder for about half the span, extended outboard with steel pates on which the constant-chord ailerons were mounted. The ribs were wooden ahead of the main spar but light alloy plate behind. The wing was internally braced with diagonal steel tubes and fabric-covered. Externally, it was braced on each side with a steel tube strut from the lower fuselage longeron to the main spar at about 40% span. The fuselage was a steel tube structure which from the wing rearwards had four longerons forming a parallelogram section, deeper than wide. There was additional cross-bracing under the wing and a low, shelf-like forward projection to carry the wooden-framed open cockpit, placed just ahead of the wing leading edge, and the nose. A rubber-spring landing skid ran from the nose to just aft of the wing strut attachment point. Aft, the fuselage tapered to a conventional tail with a blunted rectangular horizontal tail on its top. Its fin was small and hinged a flat-topped, quadrilateral rudder that reached down to the keel and worked in a cut-out between the elevators. The fabric-covered tail was constructed from steel tubes and light alloy plates. Below it there was a faired, sprung tail skid. The LS-16 first flew in 1939 but it failed to receive a Certificate of Airworthiness, its structure being judged too weak and too flexible.

Prior to the Second Republic, lesbians in Spain were largely ignored, eclipsed by gay men. They faced discrimination as they challenged definitions around what it meant to be a woman. While homosexuality was not condemned by law, it was possible for lesbians to face more severe punishment when charged with violation of morals because of their sexual orientation. During the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the first modern laws specifically punishing homosexual acts came into force, though few cases ever came to court because gays and lesbians were considered by jurists to have mental illness. Lesbians also lived in a culture oriented around the Roman Catholic Church, which set gender norms and dictated laws which left women in general with few rights and little social capital. Where lesbians were more accepted, they tended to be stereotypes as either very masculine or overly feminine. Their social capital was at its strongest during this period in Madrid. A few prominent lesbians would rise in this period, though their lesbianism would not be known by wider society in many cases until many years later. These women included Marisa Ro√´sset, Victoria Kent, Carmen de Burgos, Irene Polo, Carmen Conde, Matilde Ras and Elena Fort√∫n who were all part of a lesbian circle during the 1920s. The Second Republic would usher in a period where women had more rights under the law, and where women were politically empowered for the first time. Homosexuality was also stripped from the penal code, though there were still ways for which lesbians could be charged, for example by being deemed dangerous to the state, or simply being detained by the state even if their behavior was not criminal. Prominent lesbians of this period included Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil, Am√©rica Barroso, Margarita Xirgu, Irene Polo, Carmen de Burgos, Mar√≠a de Maeztu, Victoria Kent and Victoria Ocampo. Lesbian women were often lumped alongside heterosexual women in the Civil War period, and blending in was often a survival technique. Homophobia and gender violence in Nationalist zones and rural parts of Spain made life dangerous for lesbians. Those who could went into exile. Some who could not often found themselves in prison. The end of the war saw Francoist Spain reimpose strict Roman Catholic based gender norms and a return of women lacking legal autonomy. Women who did not adhere to expected gender norms, like lesbians, were at increased risk of punishment by the state. At the same time, the state largely could not understand lesbianism so the risk was less than that of their male counterparts. Women in exile faced a double burden of being lesbian and female. Some lesbians continued to be involved in the activism they had espoused in the Second Republic and the Civil War. Historical memory has helped share stories of LGBT people during the Civil War. This can be problematic at times because the stories of many lesbians have been forgotten or never told in the first place. It makes it hard to remember lesbians if they have been erased from history.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800 - 1922)   Laws around homosexuality  Spain came into the twentieth century lacking laws about homosexuality, having only created its first penal code in the modern era in 1822. Inspired by the French Napoleonic Code of 1810, neither mentioned homosexuality as sodomy had been legal in France since 1791. While Spain's criminal codes were amended in 1848, 1859, and 1870, homosexuality was never mentioned as there were other ways, namely public scandal laws and laws against immorality, that could be used to prosecute it. While the law made no distinctions between same-sex sexual activity and opposite-sex sexual activity, sexual offenses could still be prosecuted if resulting from a case about the violation of morals. Leniency in sentencing would be totally arbitrary and lesbians could find themselves more severely punished for violating societal gender roles.  Same-sex marriage  One of the first recorded same-sex marriages in Spain occurred on 8 June 1901, when Elisa S√°nchez Loriga and Marcela Gracias Ibeas married after deceiving a Galician priest into performing the wedding ceremony. Repudiated by their family and having their deceit discovered by neighbors, the couple fled to Porto, Portugal where they were arrested. The pair would then flee to Argentina.  LGBT culture  Following the end of the First Republic in 1974, the Bourbon monarchy was restored in Spain along with its conservative brand of Roman Catholicism. Despite this, LGBT culture primarily focused around gay men began to develop in Madrid and Barcelona without huge opposition from Alfonso XIII. This period represented a shift in Spain, where non-sexual lesbian love between women went from something of an idealized part of the cultural imagination of the closeness between women to that of a pervert with mental illness. These ideas were often internalized by lesbians of the period, with many feeling tortured and unhappy as it was difficult for them to live openly. There was no culture for lesbians to draw from, with no historical role models or body of literature for women to identify with. Society often blamed parents for their daughters being lesbians, accusing them of providing a bad education which resulted in them becoming homosexuals. Some lesbians who were discovered in this period were forced to undergo conversion therapy, voluntarily submitting to it because they viewed themselves as defective and sick in the head. The creation by Freud of psychoanalysis encouraged many to believe that the method could be used to cure homosexuality. These cures often involved chemical and surgical approaches, with hormone treatments first which were then followed by drugs designed to remove a women's sexual libido. If this failed, women would be subjected to aversion therapy, which sometimes included shock therapy. If a woman still had homosexual thoughts, surgical treatments would be undertaken, including removal of the uterus or ovaries. In a few cases, lobotomies were also performed. To avoid this, many lesbians just went into deep denial. The most well known LGBT figures in pre-Second Republic Spain were gay men. These included Emilio Castelar, Jos√© L√°zaro Galdiano, √Ålvaro Retana, Miguel de Molina, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Luis Cernuda and Alfonso Hern√°ndez Cat√°. On the literary scene, there were few lesbians. Lesbian writers in this period were often erased in multiple ways as part of a broader issue of women's erasure in society. They were often forced to use male pen names to be published or had to remove female characters from stories. Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil began writing about lesbians in 1919.Sanfeliu Gimeno, Luz .\\"Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil; an alternative life and work to the society of his time \\" . Retrieved on 25 August 2016 . Her writing was characterized by an ultramodern avant-garde aesthetic. In discussing lesbianism, her work demonstrated that Spanish society was backward in its thinking and out of touch with the rest of Europe.  Societal views of lesbians  A manual published in 1908 described a lesbian as \\"an active, courageous, creative type, of fairly determined temperament, not too emotional; lover of life outdoors, science, politics or even business; good organizer and pleased with positions of responsibility .... Her body is perfectly feminine, although her inner nature is largely masculine.\\" Lesbians were also described in another sexology publication in that period as \\"congenital inverts\\". A third described them as \\"pseudoinvestidas\\", suggesting they would have been heterosexuals had they not been lured into inversion by others. Another espoused that lesbians could not be women, because women exist only as binaries, coupled with men for the purpose of reproduction.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930)   Laws around homosexuality  The first laws criminalizing homosexuality appeared in Spain in the 1928 Penal Code. Implemented for a four-year period that ended in 1932, the law applied to both sexes, and came out of Miguel Primo de Rivera's disgust towards homosexuals in the Spanish military. Primo de Rivera justified these laws by calling back to an earlier time, when Catholic Monarchs ran Spain and the Roman Catholic Church persecuted homosexuals. Article 601 resulted in two to twelve years in prison for people engaging in dishonest abuses of people of the same sex. Article 616 stipulated, \\"Those who routinely or with scandal, commit acts contrary to modesty with persons of the same sex, will be punished with a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 pesetas and special disqualification for public office from six to twelve years.\\" () Homosexuality itself was not illegal, but rather same-sex sexual acts were. Few prosecutions were ever brought to trial because jurists, influenced by medical scholars like Gregorio Mara√±√≥n, believed homosexuals were sick in the head.  Lesbian culture  In the 1920s, Spain was very Catholic in terms of cultural orientation. Women in general during this period faced many types of social discrimination, and had few rights. They were wards of their male family members, could be forced into marriage and could not divorce. The Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera occurred during a period where Spanish women were influenced by Anglo-Saxon flappers and the French gar√ßonnes, who helped redefine Spanish womanhood, femininity and masculinity. Set against an international backdrop of return to normalcy and previous gender roles following World War I, it combined femininity with sensuality. There were two stereotypes of Spanish lesbians during the 1920s: butch lesbians who had mannish manners, and flappers. Butch lesbians at this time were characterized by their cigar smoking and consumption of wine and spirits. They imitated men. Lesbian flappers imitated Carlota, from the novel Sab. These were European women, who found freedom through work outside the household. In Madrid, these women had considerable cultural capital, and were portrayed as being almost Grecian in appearance, without any degeneration associated with them. For some men in the Primo de Rivera period, there was no separation between feminism and lesbianism; the two were easily confused by many men including Gregorio Mara√±√≥n. Gregorio Mara√±√≥n saw lesbianism as a result of women eschewing traditional feminism, and instead taking up more masculine pursuits like sports.  Prominent lesbians  Spanish lawyer and Congressperson Victoria Kent during her time as Director General of Prisons in 1931. Marisa Ro√´sset, Victoria Kent, Carmen de Burgos, Irene Polo, Carmen Conde, Matilde Ras and Elena Fort√∫n were all part of a lesbian circle in Madrid during the 1920s. Lesbians in the late 1920s faced a number of challenges. People viewed them as having a mental illness, and being inverted. A prominent lesbian of this period was Victoria Kent, one of three women elected to the first Congreso de Diputados in the Second Republic. In 1924, she made history when she became the first woman to join the Colegio de Abogados de Madrid and become a lawyer. In 1926, she was appointed vice president of in Madrid. Like others, her lesbian status would not be well known until after the Civil War. Elena Fort√∫n was another prominent lesbian of the era, known for her vividly written children's stories. She had an unhappy childhood and never managed to fit in. She felt disgust at the idea of binding herself to a man for life. From a young age, she always wanted self- determination. Despite this, she did marry a cousin in 1908 and it was her husband who encouraged her to take up writing. The couple had two children.  Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1937)   Laws around women and homosexuality  Until the start of the Second Republic, women in general had few rights under the law. Things changed, with the introduction of laws that would empower women more generally in this period. They included the ability to run for political office, to vote, and to be able to get divorces. In 1931, Article 616 was repealed when the new Spanish constitution came into force with the birth of the Second Republic. Within a few years, the Spanish Criminal Code in the Second Republic no longer included any mention of homosexuality. While this was not comparable to equality for women promised under law, it marked a major step forward in advancing nascent rights for the LGBT community in the country. Liberalization in laws would also not bring things like marriage equality. Radical Socialist Party member Victoria Kent and PSOE member Luis Jim√©nez de As√∫a pushed for reforms of the 1932 Penal Code. This reform saw the elimination of homosexuality as an aggravating factor in crime. Jim√©nez de As√∫a also successfully lobbied for the inclusion of ‚Äúestado peligroso‚Äù into Spanish criminal law for the first time. This law allowed the state to intervene after a crime had been committed or to prevent potential crimes being committed if they thought a potentially dangerous situation was going to occur. This was followed up by ‚Äúdefensa social‚Äù, which allowed the state to act in defense of protecting society from people it considered dangerous, even if their behavior was not considered criminal in and of itself. The 1933, the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes removed homosexuality as a crime from the books, except among members of the military. Beggars, ruffians, pimps and prostitutes were still considered criminals. Passing on 4 August 1933, it was approved unanimously in the PSOE and Communist dominated Congreso de Diputados.  Lesbian and gay culture  The Second Republic ushered in a period where people would accuse their political enemies of being homosexual. Unlike in some countries like Germany, the Second Republic period never saw any movement to try to end homophobia. Despite a liberalization in laws, culturally homosexuality was still considered a disease. Lesbians would still face broader discrimination as a result of their gender, which would leave them at risk of patriarchal male culture and gender-based violence. For the LGBT community more generally, the Second Republic started a period of distinct culture and broader LGBT intellectualism. Some women's homoerotic literature was shared during the Second Republic, with much of it linked to leftist writings, which were associated with feminist and free love movements.  Prominent lesbians  Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil in 1933. Portrait of Carmen de Burgos by Julio Romero de Torres in 1917 One of the most prominent lesbians of this period was Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil, a Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) member and founder of Mujeres Libres. She denounced her contemporaries for supporting the current patriarchal paradigm. Later, she started working for the newspaper Umbral, where she met her partner Am√©rica Barroso in 1937. S√°nchez Saornil argued in this period that motherhood was just one option available for women, and that women should first and foremost be autonomous individuals. Rather than her anarchist ideology, her own experiences as a lesbian probably informed her views about motherhood. Her lesbian status would not be well known until the 1980s, though she wrote using a male pen name in the Second Republic period, where she defended lesbian desire. Those who worked with her at Mujeres Libres in this period have said that S√°nchez never hid she was a lesbian from them, and that her non-normative relationship with Am√©rica Barroso was well known. Margarita Xirgu was a well known Catalan stage actress during the Second Republic who was known in the theater community as an out lesbian. She performed in many plays written by her openly homosexual friend Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, including Yerma, Blood Wedding, and Do√±a Rosita. At the premiere of Yerma in Madrid, right-wing supporters in attendance interrupted the show to accuse her from their seats in the upper gallery of being a lesbian and a queer. She left Spain in January 1936 for an overseas tour, where she performed a number of Lorca's plays. She was met by appreciative audiences in Mexico that year. Irene Polo was another Catalan lesbian, who was also a self-taught journalist and out to those in the newsroom. In her youth, she was known to bathe naked at Port de la Selva on the Costa Brava with the goal of attracting other women. Meeting Margarita Xirgu in Barcelona in January 1936 for an interview after the performance of Do√±a Rosita, she left her position and followed the theater group to Mexico. Her abrupt decision to move resulted from her love for Margarita Xirgu. The pair would split a few years later as the relationship was largely a one-sided affair. Neither Margarita Xirgu nor Irene Polo would return to Spain. Polo committed suicide in Chile in 1941 by jumping out of a window. Carmen de Burgos was a prominent lesbian during the time of the Second Republic. The first professional woman journalist in the country, her open lesbianism was tolerated as a decadent vice. A number of her works had the theme of lesbianism running through them. She was linked romantically to fellow feminist and Portuguese suffragette Ana de Castro Os√≥rio.N√∫√±ez Rey, Concepci√≥n (2014). ¬´Un puente entre Espa√±a y Portugal: Carmen de Burgos y su amistad con Ana de Castro Os√≥rio¬ª (pdf).

Mar√≠a de Maeztu, Victoria Kent and Victoria Ocampo spent time living at the Residencia de Se√±oritas in Madrid during 1931. The residence allowed women to openly discuss their radical beliefs, including the concept of free love and prison reform. In the early 1930s, Mar√≠a de Maeztu had an intense interest in Victoria Ocampo and was jealous of Victoria Kent. In 1931, Victoria Kent became the General Director of Prisons (), the first woman to get a high ranking political appointment in the Second Republic.  Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)  Little is known about lesbians during the Spanish Civil War, as they largely disappeared from history and their stories were bundled generally without lesbian context alongside heterosexual women. Homophobia was present in rural areas and inside Republican and National armies. It was less present in Republican-controlled cities. During the war, many LGBT people went into hiding for their own protection as those who were out or suspected of being homosexual were often hunted down by local authorities. Being a lesbian in the Civil War period could make women a subject of violence, as her existence challenged societal regulations about the roles of women. Safety for women meant complying with hegemonic Spanish culture. Huelva was taken by Nationalist forces on 29 July 1936, with full control of the province taking place by September 1936. During the Civil War, gay men and lesbian women behind Nationalist lines were often sent to Prisi√≥n Provincial de Huelva, one of the two most notorious prisons in Spain at the time. There, they were tortured and received particularly harsh punishment. Some lesbians there may have been misidentified as merely women who defied social conventions about the role of women. Aware of outside perceptions of them, women and lesbians in prison did not perpetuate a cycle of sexual violence against others behind bars with them.  Prominent lesbians  During the Civil War, Kent initially assisted by procuring supplies for Republicans in Guadarrama and later by assisting child refugees fleeing Spain. Soon, she was appointed as the First Secretary at the Republican Embassy in Paris, where she continued her work in trying to secure passage for Spanish refugee children, attempting to get them into the United States.  Francoist Spain (1938‚Äì1975)   Laws around women and homosexuality  In the immediate post War period, the government's primary concern was removing political and armed resistance. LGBT people were not and would not be a major focus until they had eliminated these threats, and were able to force a form of conservative Catholicism on the populace. More pressing issues for lesbians included a return to a reduced legal status. The repeal of the law allowing divorce occurred on 23 September 1939, and severely restricted ways which in women, including gender non- conforming lesbians, could behave outside their homes by placing legal and cultural constraints on them.Daimon. Revista Internacional de Filosof√≠a, n¬∫ 63, 2014, 207-222 ISSN: 1130-0507 The 1932 Penal Code with its concepts of ‚Äúestado peligroso‚Äù and ‚Äúdefensa social‚Äù were re-purposed by Franco in 1954 to criminalize homosexuality as a sex crime. The 1933 Ley de Vagos y Maleantes was used by the Franco regime until 1970 to criminally punish homosexuals. Its constitutional replacement was Ley de Peligrosidad Social, which labeled homosexuality as a mental illness. These laws would later be used to imprison women and to commit them to mental institutions. Lesbians in Francoist prisons were charged with prostitution instead of homosexuality, which makes it impossible to determine their numbers when compared to gay men.Conxita MIR CURC√ì, Pobreza, Marginaci√≥n, delincuencia y pol√≠ticas sociales bajo el franquismo. Lleida, Ediciones de la Universidad de Lleida, 2005. This was because the regime had only two categories for women's employment: housewife and prostitute. Despite this, the Franco regime largely could not comprehend lesbian activism, and the number of prosecutions of women was always much lower than those for gay men, especially in the later years of the regime. Lesbians who did find themselves in prison were often easy blackmail targets for guards. This was because a number of lesbians had sex behind bars for non- political prisoners. Some of these relationships were non-consensual as female guards might use their power to force other women to have sex with them and rape them.  In exile  Carmen Conde, Victorina Dur√°n, Margarita Xirgu, Ana Mar√≠a Sagi, Irene Polo, and Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil survived the war as Spain's most famous lesbians, but all were required to go into exile for their own survival. While relatively open about their orientation in exile, they all tried to maintain levels of discretion about it. Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil went into exile at the end of the Civil War, facing three disadvantages: being a woman, a writer and a lesbian. During the 1950s, 62-year-old Victoria Kent became involved with New York philanthropist Louise Crane, who was 15 years her junior, while living in exile. Starting in 1954, the couple published Ib√©rica: por la Libertad. The magazine was one of the most important publications among Spanish moderates living in exile. It only closed in 1974. It served to pressure the US Government to end its ties to Franco, even as the US sought to strengthen to combat the perceived communist threat.  Lesbian culture  Because of the Franco regime's beliefs about women, including an inability to understand lesbianism, there was some underground culture available for lesbian women. Where multiple men using public urinals was suspect, girls having parties without boys in attendance was viewed less circumspectly as it was assumed by many that they were being pure by not inviting boys. Their invisibility protected lesbians in ways that it did not protect men because many people believed lesbianism did not exist. Lesbians would often use code words, such as librarian, to identify one another. Because beaches were gender segregated, it was often an easy place for lesbians to socialize. A Spanish literary tradition for lesbians would not start until the end of Francoism. The most significant piece of Spanish lesbian literature in this period was Oculto sendero by Elena Fort√∫n, which while never officially published was circulating by 1945 and told the fictionalized account of a Spanish lesbian in exile. The first lesbian organization in Spain would not be founded until 1979 in Barcelona, and lesbians would continue to maintain a lower profile in the LGBT community in Spain than their gay male peers.Hooper, John (2006). The new Spaniards . Penguin. 0-141-01609-4 . When not maintaining a lower profile, they were actively ignored by their male peers as completely unimportant.  Historical memory  The Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory was founded in 2000 by Spanish journalist Emilio Silva after he successfully located the remains of his grandfather and eleven others in a roadside ditch. Starting in 2002, he began lobbying for historical memory to become law, which it did in 2007 with the support of the Zapatero government as La Ley de Memoria Hist√≥rica. It did not overturn Law 46/1977 and Pacto de Olvido that provided amnesty for members of the Franco regime. By law, victims existed but perpetrators did not. One aspect of historical memory has involved identifying the bones of LGBT people killed during the Civil War. This is questioned by some, who do not understand how finding and identifying the bones of Francoist victims will assist Spaniards in resolving their complicated past. For many families of LGBT people, identifying remains is important because it is all they have of their family member. They do not have any larger legacy. Lesbian stories are harder to find as gay men had much more visibility as a result of more brutal punishment by the Franco regime. Lesbians, benefiting from lower visibility as a means to avoid repression, have a much harder history to document in the Civil War period. According to documentary film maker Andrea Weiss, historical memory requires people first know stories about people before they can be remembered. While broad strokes are known, many of the individual stories are lost or forgotten so they cannot be remembered. It makes it impossible to understand the level of suffering endured by Spain's LGBT community during the Civil War.

Campaign for women's suffrage The Thomson sisters were active members of the Edinburgh WSPU and were involved in protests in London and Scotland. On 21 November 1911, they were among the 223 protesters arrested at a WSPU demonstration at the House of Commons, to which they had travelled with other women from the Edinburgh branch, including Jessie C. Methven, Edith Hudson, Alice Shipley and Mrs N Grieve. The demonstrations followed the \\"torpedoing\\" of the Conciliation Bill.Crawford, Elizabeth (1999).

The Women's Suffrage Movement in Britain and Ireland. Routledge. p237. The four women were arrested along with Donald McEwan, who had ordered the taxi from Edinburgh, and subsequently tried in Jedburgh Court on 19 May. The jury found the charges against Agnes (then 67) were 'not proven' and recommended leniency for Elizabeth (then 65). Elizabeth was sentenced to three months while the others each received nine- month sentences. They were sent to Calton Jail where the women immediately went on a hunger strike. The Cat and Mouse Act The Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913, also known as the Cat and Mouse Act, had recently been introduced which allowed prisons to release women whose hunger strike had reached a critical stage. Elizabeth was released under the act on 23 May on licence to return when her health improved. None of the women returned to prison when their licences expired and Leneman records that Elizabeth \\"vanished\\" after her release, no longer attending WSPU meetings as police actively sought her there.Leneman, Leah (1995). A Guid Cause. Revised edition. Mercat Press. p140-144. Agnes continued to be active in the movement, and wrote to the Scottish Prison Service to intercede on Arabella Scott's behalf in August 1913 when she was rearrested under the Cat and Mouse Act at a WSPU protest in London and returned to Calton Jail.Leneman, Leah (1995).

Biography  Jos√© Luis Caso Cortines was born in Comillas in a large family. Even though he was born in Cantabria, he moved to the Basque Country at the age of 22 in the 50s. He was the founder of Alianza Popular in the Basque country in 1982. Later, he was President of the People's Party of Irun as well as Councillor there, where he was living. Jose Luis was retired and had been working as a councillor for the People's Party (PP) in Renteria ( Guipuzcoa) since 1995. The attack took place at the end of 1997. He also belonged to the Board of Directors of Guipuzcoa's PP and the Board of Directors of PP of the Basque Country. He was a married man with two children and a granddaughter. At the time of the murder, he was 64 years old of age. His successor in office, Manuel Zamarre√±o Villoria, was murdered a few months later, in June 1998.  Murder  In December 1997, ETA members Francisco Javier Garc√≠a Gaztelu, alias Txapote, Irantzu Gallastegui Sodupe, alias Amaya, Sebasti√°n Lara Mendiaraz, Alfonso Sebastian Iriarte, Jesus Maria Lombide Lorente, Maria Cristina Gete Echevarria and Ana Bel√©n Eg√ºes Gurruchaga formed part of the Donosti command.

He was located at the back of the bar having a drink. At 22:54, Jose Luis was approached by an individual who fired at him, reaching the right parieto- temporo-occipital. Jos√© Luis died instantly from this shot. The shooter, whose identity was not identified, threatened five customers and the owner of the bar with a revolver to ensure they would not follow him. After the police officers arrived, the judge of guard ordered the lifting of the corpse around 00:30 p.m. The following day, thousands of people marched in San Sebastian in protest against this murder. The Third Section of the Criminal Chamber of the National Court issued the judgment n¬∫ 44/2006, dating back to June 30, 2006. The accused were acquitted of the crime of murder, which they were accused of by the public prosecutor, due to lack of proof. After this attack, there was no claim of responsibility by ETA in the following days. However, the judgement was that they were responsible.

It is both a residency and offices.  History, alterations and architecture  The Palace is grade 1 listed as of 1950. Due to the amount of works done to The Palace over many centuries, it is difficult to know the exact original date. Construction started again in the 12th century under Bishop Seffrid II, following the fire of 1187 which destroyed the town and Chichester Cathedral, as shown on the walls of the Great Kitchen and in the entirety of the Chapel. Reconstruction of the Chapel took place in the 14th century under the work of Bishop John Langton. Other than this, the Chapel has remained unchanged for over 800 years. Bishop Robert Sherborne undertook major construction projects at the Palace, including the remodelling of the south-west and south-east wings. Bishop Sherborne also had a wing built to the north of the west end. Bishop Edward Waddington restored the Palace from a supposedly ruinous condition in 1727. Bishop John Buckner also restored and altered the building in 1800.  Occupants  Principally, The Palace is the residence of the Bishop of Chichester, currently The Right Reverend Dr Martin Warner. His office and staff are also based here. The Bishop‚Äôs chaplain, currently The Reverend Canon Stephen Ferns (also Canon Residentiary and Treasurer of Chichester Cathedral), also has his office at The Palace. Since the appointment of The Venerable Luke Irvine-Capel as Archdeacon of Chichester in 2019, The Palace has served as the residence and office of the Archdeacon and his family, following the relocation of the office of the Archdeacon of Chichester from the Diocesan Church House in Hove back to Chichester.  Rooms  The Chapel - The east window of the chapel dates from the 14th Century. In the window are a number of medallions and panels of the arms of previous bishops. Within the jambs are carved stiff-leaf foliage. The walling is of Quarr Abbey stone as well as a little flint. There are four further ancient windows on the north wall. The two central bosses in the vaulting are also decorated with foliage. Also within the chapel is a 12th Century fresco with links to Saint Richard of Chichester. Beneath the High Altar of the Chapel is a relic of Saint Richard. On occasional days each year, the Chapel is open to the public. The Great Kitchen - This chamber, sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúBishop‚Äôs Kitchen‚Äù is no longer used for its original purpose. Contained within this room are some of the earliest features and walls of The Palace. The roof is likely to have been replaced in the 15th Century as the style of architecture is thought to be too advanced for the date of the walls. Nowadays, as one of the largest complex of rooms in The Palace, it is used for hosting receptions and functions, as well as housing temporary displays of art and crafts. The Prebendal School also use part of the wing in which The Great Kitchen is for education purposes. The Tudor Room - Sometimes known as ‚ÄúThe Sherborne Room‚Äù, in honour of Bishop Sherborne who built the wing of the palace in which this room lies, this is one of the most notable rooms of The Palace. The original medieval ceiling with ornate decoration is still in place. Hung on the walls are 16th-century paintings. It was once used as a dining room, as it occasionally still is. Mostly, this room is now used for large receptions, dinners and exhibitions, as well as diocesan meetings. Palace Yard - This is a row of cottages that would have originally been used to house domestic staff and servants at The Palace. They form part of the Cathedral Close and are now let out as homes to members of the general public. The rest of The Palace is made up of offices and private apartments. Certain rooms of the private apartments are used by the occupants for personal entertaining of guests.  Gardens  Since 1976, The Palace Gardens have been leased to the city council and are now a public park surrounded by the Roman city walls offering views of the Palace, Cathedral and Bell Tower. Within the park is a large area used for growing fruit and vegetables which is currently managed by local charity Grow Chichester. A large portion of the gardens have been retained for the private use of the occupants of The Palace.

A dedicated trade unionist and member of the CGT, she founded the Syndicat g√©n√©ral des employ√©s de banque et de commerce in 1945, the year when she was elected as one of the first women to serve on the municipal council of Saint-Denis. She continued her political support of the Communist party until she was seriously injured while trying to save a ballot box from right-wing militants in the 1956 legislative elections. She headed the Union des femmes de La R√©union until her death in 1994. Biography Born on 14 September 1907 in Saint-Leu, Isnelle Baret was the daughter of the forester Aim√©e L√©opold Baret and Eug√©nie Gaspard. She attended private Catholic schools, receiving the elementary school certificate. By the time she was 25, she had lost her parents and her six siblings who, unable to afford treatment, had all died from malaria or tuberculosis. In 1941, she married Raoul Amelin, a police inspector and communist militant. Encouraged by her husband, she became an active member of the CGT. As a bank employee, she founded the Syndicat g√©n√©ral des employ√©s de banque et de commerce where she served as secretary general from 1945 to 1955. As a member of the Comit√© R√©publicain d‚ÄôAction D√©mocratique et Social (CRADS), she participated in the municipal elections of 1945, winning a seat on the city council of Saint-Denis until 1958 and then again from 1958 to 1964. She also became the first president of the local branch of the Communist Union des Femmes Fran√ßaises (UFF) in 1946. In 1952, in her role as CGT administrator, she inaugurated a nursery for household workers and supported the activities of the Syndicat des bonnes et des blanchisseuses, the union for housemaids and laundary workers. Actively supporting the fight for the decolonisation of La R√©union, she was seriously injured by right-wing activists while trying to protect a ballot box during the 1956 legislative elections. As a result of her activities which were considered subversive, she was forced to retired when she was only 48. She nevertheless continued to work as a women's rights activist within the F√©d√©ration r√©unionnaise de l'UFF, serving as president for the rest of her life. Isnelle Amelin died in Saint-Denis on 4 February 1994, aged 86, from an illness she had contracted two years earlier while undertaking humanitarian work in Madagascar.

Danish Guinea 1845 and 1847  left √òrnens first voyage began on 5 May 1843, immediately after she entered service, under command of Andreas Chr. Polder. This voyage carried √òrnen to Tanger, Gibraltar, Madeira and further on to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The following year √òrnen went on a voyage into the Mediterranean, along the west coast of Africa to Danish Guinea (now eastern Ghana) and further to the Danish West Indies. The visit to Danish Guinea was due to reports of illegal slave trade, religious sacrifice of two children and rebellion. √òrnen arrived in September 1843 and took the responsible for sacrifice, King Addum of Aquapim and his minister Sebah Akim, into custody on the ship. They were sentenced to death, later reversed to imprisonment for life. In addition, their village was burned to the ground. A landing party under command of second lieutenant Otto Chr. Hammer, conquered the fort Prinsensten, which had been taken by the rebellions. Hammer also led negotiations with the king of Agna, who had taken part in the rebellion and slave trade. In 1847 new unrest erupted in Danish Guinea and √òrnen was again sent to help defend the Danish forts Prinsensten and Christiansborg. After heavy fightings on land and bombardments from sea was a fragile peace negotiated and √òrnen could leave for the West Indies again. This was the last time a Danish Naval ship visited the Danish colonies in Africa. Two years later, in 1849, they were sold to the British Government for the price of 10,000 Pound sterling.  West Indies 1845‚Äì49  After the first visit to west Africa in 1845 √òrnen continued to the Danish West Indies. Once arrived, √òrnen took on board the Danish naturalist Anders Sand√∏e √òrsted (brother to H.C. √òrsted) on order from the Danish Admiralty and assisted him in his studies of the life in the deeper parts of the Caribbean. He made significant collections of marine life, down to depths of 1000 fathoms and brought the collections and sketches back home to the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen. Two years later √òrnen arrived again in the Danish West Indies, after her visit to west Africa. This time there was also unrest on the Danish West Indies and √òrnen took part in the dramatic events, which led the Danish Governor-General of the islands, Peter von Scholten, on the 3 July to declare immediate emancipation of all the slaves on the three Danish islands St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. Jan (St. John). √òrnen remained in the Caribbean until March 1949 and then returned to Copenhagen.  First Schleswig War  √òrnen returned to Denmark in 1849 in the middle of the First Schleswig War, and was immediately fitted to serve in the naval blockade of the German harbour in Danzig. The following year √òrnen, under the command of Frederik Chr. G. Muxoll, participated together with the corvette HDMS Saga and 4 gunboats in the fighting at Fehmarn, which was occupied by the Danish troops on 17 July 1850.  Later years  Between 1852 and 1858 √òrnen was stationed in the West Indies. In 1859 √òrnen, under command of Adser Enevold Ludvig Knudsen, was sent on a voyage to Iceland and Greenland. This was the first visit of a naval ship in Greenland for more than 100 years, as the last visit was by the frigate Blaa Heyren in 1736‚Äì37. √òrnen was decommissioned in 1866 and broken up in 1871.

It has a long string-like body, with large eyes, a red dorsal fin, elongated leading rays, and a short anal fin near the caudal fin. It grows up to 2 metres in length. Etymology The species was presumably named for Albert G√ºnther, an ichthyologist at the British Museum (Natural History).Dianne J. Bray (2020) Lophotus guentheri Fishes of Australia. Retrieved June 20, 2020. In his formal description, Johnston named the species guntheri, although the correct spelling for species named after G√ºnther is guentheri. The species' common names include the crested bandfish, crestfish, unicorn fish and unicorn ribbon-fish.  Distribution and ecology  The crested bandfish is a marine pelagic species, found at depths up 90 metres, although it may occur at depths up to 300 metres. The species has been found in four locations in the western Pacific: in Australia, near Emu Bay, Tasmania and off the New South Wales coast; Johnston Atoll; and southwestern Taiwan. However, its true distribution is likely wider than this. The species' diet comprises cephalopods and small fish. It has an ink sac, which may be used as a defence mechanism when it encounters danger.  Conservation Very little is known about the crested bandfish, although specimens have been reported to wash ashore following storms. The crested bandfish has been evaluated as \\"Least Concern\\" for the IUCN Red List,J. Moore (2019) Lophotus guntheri IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 2019: e.T123374956A123376508.

After teaching for some years, she graduated with a Medical Degree from Howard University College of Medicine in 1897, with a specialization in Bacteriology. She was one of the leading women practitioners of the Western Reserve and was also prominent as a woman suffragist of the west. Davis served as secretary of the Erie County Medical Society, and recording secretary of the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association. Early years and education Carrie Chase Davis was born August 13, 1863, on a farm near Castalia, Ohio. She was a daughter of Thomas Robert and Sarah Ann (Chase) Davis. Her father was a native of New York, born February 14, 1824, and became well known as a leading farmer and stock raiser near Sandusky, Ohio. His home was one of the best known stations on the Underground Railroad between the United States and Canada. He was a highly educated man, a student of Oberlin College and a Congregationalist with wide influence. Sarah Ann Chase was born near Castalia, September 13, 1841, and after her marriage to Thomas Robert Davis, October 20, 1859, became the mother of two children, of whom Dr. Davis was the elder. The other daughter, May Davis, a physician, was born at Castalia, April 5. 1866. Her grandparents were Henry Nichols Chase and Mary Chapman Waller Chase; and Dr. Thomas Davis and Mary Avery Davis. The Davis family left Ohio in 1868, settling at Bloomington, Illinois, so that the daughters could have good school advantages. For nine years, Davis obtained her early education at Normal, Illinois, where her mother died in 1875. The father then took his daughters to Missouri, where they grew up at Unionville. Davis attended and graduated (1884) from Normal School and Business Institute, at Stanberry, Missouri. In 1885 and 1886, she attended the State Normal School, Emporia, Kansas. Career Davis and her sister became successful in the educational field. In 1887, DAvis took up a homestead in Trego County, Kansas; making a final proof on the property, March 4, 1893. During these six years, she taught in the schools and teachers' institutes of Trego, Brown, and Sheridan counties. In 1893, Davis removed to Washington, D.C. where she attended Howard University Medical College, sessions 26, 27, 28, 29, 1893‚Äì7, and graduated M. D. in 1897. She practiced medicine in Washington until December, 1897, when she gained experience as a resident physician at Lying in Charity Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1898. After her graduation from that program in 1899, she removed to Sandusky, where she commenced her medical practice. For the next decade, she steadily progressed professionally, and also became widely recognized as a champion of women's rights, especially in the matter of obtaining the privilege of suffrage. Davis was a leading member of the Erie County Medical Society, of which she was secretary, and was also actively identified with the Ohio State and the American Medical Associations. Her prominence as a suffragist was further indicated by the fact that for a number of years, she held the position of recording secretary of the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association. She was president of the Civic Club of Sandusky, a member of the board of managers of the Rest Room, and a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. In religion, Davis belonged to the Congregational church. She died in Tennessee, 22 March 1953, and willed her body to Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999|page=18 With a network of trails, the area offers an opportunity for secluded outdoor recreation close to Roanoke. The area is part of the Craig Creek Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 6 miles southeast of New Castle, Virginia. It is between Catawba Creek Road (Va 779) on the southeast and Wildlife Road (Forest road 224) on the northwest. Trails into the area include: *North Mountain Trail, Forest Trail 263, 13.2 miles, difficult, yellow blazed *Deer Trail, Forest Trail 186, 1.6 miles, difficult, blue blazed *Turkey Trail, Forest Trail 187, 1.6 miles, difficult, blue blazed *Grouse Trail, Forest Trail 188, 1.5 miles, difficult, blue blazed Wildlife Road, Forest Road 224, gives access to the area on the northwest. Boundary of the North Mountain wildland as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The North Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Catawba and Looney. Natural history The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and exposed sites. There are about 39 acres of the Dragons Tooth Trail/McAffee Knob Special Biological Area on the southwest boundary. Unusual flora and fauna found in the area include a globally rare shrub, the pirate bush; vascular plants, the small spreading pogonia and sword-leaved phlox; and an invertebrate the orangefin madtom. There are stands of pure table mountain pine, mostly on southeast to southwest facing ridges and slopes with dry, well-drained soils; and there are areas of mixed oak and table mountain pine. Table mountain pine requires fire to regenerate because it has serotinous cones that need heat to open and disperse its seeds. Management of these areas require prescribed burns in order to maintain the forest in its present condition. Topography The area is distinguished by ridges that trend northeast/southwest. The ridges, composed of sandstone or shale, have parallel drainages flowing into broad limestone valleys. North Mountain is typical with small steep sideslope drainages. The highest elevation is 3062 feet along the crest of North Mountain while the lowest elevation of 1410 feet is near the southeastern edge along VA 600. Silurian-aged sandstone underlays about 75 percent of the area, with the remaining area underlain by Brallier and Martinsburg shale. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. North Mountain was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. Herbicide has been used to manage a Tree of Heaven infestation along the Wildlife Road, Rt. 224. A timber sale of 42 acres, the Broad Run timber sale approved in 1998, was accomplished by allowing public firewood cutting without road building, log landings or logging equipment. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Most of the area is designated ‚ÄúBackcountry‚ÄîNon-Motorized‚Äù. Along the Wildlife Road there are areas of ‚ÄúEarly Successional Habitat‚Äù, and a section in Roanoke County is designated ‚ÄúSource Water Protection‚Äù.

The title of the song comes from a slang expression used by Dick Morgan, an eccentric member of the Ben Pollack orchestra. Morgan was the banjo and guitar player in the band who used a replica of a python in his act. George Simon recalled how the song came about: \\"Glenn composed one of the songs, \\"When Icky Morgan Plays the Organ, Look Out!\\" ‚Äî dedicated to his good friend Dick Morgan, who had played guitar in Pollack's band.\\" Miller recorded ten songs with the Clark Randall orchestra in March 1935. \\"Icky Morgan\\" was released as a Brunswick 10 inch 78 single in 1935 as Brunswick 7415 backed with \\"Troublesome Trumpet\\".In 1936, Bob Crosby and his Orchestra, most of whose members played on the Randall version, performed this composition on the Ford V-8 Revue. The song appears on the 2001 compilation album Bob Crosby and His Orchestra: And Then Some, Parts 1 and 2 of the Complete Discography on Halcyon, HALC 142, and the 2005 compilation series The Glenn Miller Story, Vol. 1-2 on Avid Entertainment. \\"Doin' the Jive\\" \\"Doin' the Jive\\" was composed by Glenn Miller and Chummy MacGregor in 1937 and recorded for Brunswick on November 29, 1937, and released as Brunswick 8063 with \\"Humoresque\\" and as Vocalion 5131 with \\"Dipper Mouth Blues\\", was a song with lyrics that introduced a new dance, \\"The Jive\\": \\"You clap your hands/And you swing out wide/Do the Suzie Q/ Mix in a step or two/Put 'em all together/And you're doin' the jive\\".

Her musical inspirations include Fela Kuti and Ebo Taylor. Abot has toured and performed with Common, Lauryn Hill, Seun Kuti and Stephen Marley. Abot's origin story and family history play an important role in her musical work. For instance, her grandmother's name FYFA WOFO inspired the name of her debut album in 2016. FYFA WOFO centers around a narrative in which an African woman becomes pregnant with a white man's child. Abot developed FYFA WOFO into a multimedia project while she participated in NEW INC, the New Museum's incubator for artists, designers and technologists. Abot's music bends genres and is inspired by jazz, afropunk, hip hop and soul, as well as tribal and indigenous sounds. She is concerned with themes ranging from black empowerment, personal histories, identity and spirituality. Her second EP, NGIWUNKULUNKULU, was released in 2018. NGIWUNKULUNKULU translates to \\"I am God\\" in Zulu and is the result of her personal identity exploration in reaction to apartheid's lasting impact in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Paul, born in 1987 in South Africa, grew up in the United Kingdom and Greece, on an island of Kythira. Due to her family's limited resources at the time, Paul learned how to work with various materials at an early age.

Work and career  Paul uses sculpture, drawing, and textile to explore domestic spaces. Her work is particularly inspired by blurred lines between the interior and the exterior. As Paul is a trained sculptor, her art has also been influenced by Classical Greek sculpture. Exhibitions Paul's solo exhibition La Perma- Perla Kraal Emporium, which explores hospitality and community, has been hosted at The Breeder gallery in Athens and at the Spike Island Artspace in Bristol, UK. A distinctive feature of this exhibition was a long table where Paul invited visitors to join her at rolling clay beads while drinking sage tea. The clay beads were also used to create bead curtains, which were part of Paul's exhibition and are a recurring theme throughout her work. Her collaboration with a British painter Faye Wei Wei , exhibition Marzanna, Yours Again was hosted at Hot Wheels Projects in Athens .

The group was first organized in the early 1990s to demand an end to the country's military dictatorship. The coalition organized demonstrations, strikes, and other civil resistance actions against the regime of Nigerian president Ibrahim Babangida from 1991‚Äì1993, particularly against the nullification of the 1993 Nigerian presidential election. At its peak, the coalition had more than 40 affiliated groups.  Context  The Nigerian Second Republic was overthrown in a military coup led by General Muhammadu Buhari, which established a military dictatorship under the control of the Supreme Military Council. Buhari was subsequently overthrown by Ibrahim Babangida. Babangida followed several policies to loosen political control, including easing restrictions on freedom of expression. He also promised to return the country to civilian rule by 1990. However, Babangida repeatedly delayed liberalization measures, and civil society leaders did not have faith that he would genuinely give up power. One attempt to return the country to democracy through a national conference was repressed by the government in September 1990, leading several civil society leaders to the conclusion that forming an organized pressure group to push for democratization was crucial.  Founding  The Campaign for Democracy was founded in November 1991 at a conference in Jos held by the National Consultative Forum, and six other human rights groups, women's groups, and labor organizations. Their primary goal at the founding was to advocate for a return to civilian rule through the holding of a sovereign national conference. The group's first chairman was doctor and activist Beko Ransome- Kuti, who was frequently arrested for his work with the group.  1993 presidential election  As part of Babangida's controlled return to democracy, two legal political parties were allowed to compete in a presidential election in June 1993. Businessman Moshood Abiola won the election, but Babangida annulled the results. Under pressure from the Campaign for Democracy and an alliance of other civil society groups, Babangida was forced to resign and ceded power to a transitional government led by Ernest Shonekan. Shonekan was tasked with holding a new presidential election in 1994, but was prevented by the November 1993 coup led by Sani Abacha.  Fragmentation and later years  The Campaign for Democracy broke into two groups in late 1994, with a significant portion of the group's executive council accusing Chairman Ransome-Kuti of colluding with the Abacha regime. The faction that supported Chairman Ransome-Kuti remained as the Campaign for Democracy, while the breakaway faction formed the Democratic Alternative, a competing coalition. The Campaign for Democracy remained as a pressure group for greater democracy in Nigeria throughout the Abacha regime and after the transition to civilian rule. After the 2019 Nigerian general election the CD accused the government of President Muhammadu Buhari of stealing the election and demanded his resignation.

He worked as an executive officer at the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office and was the executive director of the non-profit Enlace, an organization founded by Congressman Jesus \\"Chuy\\" Garcia, that worked on social issues in Little Village. Rodriguez ran for 22nd ward alderman in the 2019 election for Chicago City Council, in an open race to succeed incumbent Ricardo Munoz. Facing three other candidates in the first round of the election on February 26, 2019, he won 64% of the vote and became the alderman-elect. On April 10, 2019, Rodriguez joined six other newly elected members of the City Council in protesting against the approval of tax increment financing for the Lincoln Yards and The 78 real estate developments.  Chicago City Council  Rodriguez took office as a member of the Chicago City Council on May 20, 2019. In November 2019, Rodriguez was one of eleven aldermen to vote against Mayor Lori Lightfoot's first budget. On April 11, 2020, Hilco Redevelopment Partners, with approval by the administration of Mayor Lori Lightfoot, coordinated an implosion of a 275-foot smokestack during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a cloud of dust and particulate matter to envelop the surrounding area, mostly contained within the boundaries of Chicago's 22nd Ward. Rodriguez notified the community of the pending implosion through social media after Hilco failed to inform the community as it had promised.

It is located in Valencia and is aligned with the far-right, specifically Espa√±a 2000. It is the main organisation related to prostitution and an important pressure group in its field. The official business model for the member clubs is to allow prostitutes to work independently of the venue, paying only for the rent of rooms and drinks. However, in a ruling from the High Court of Justice of Andalusia, the \\"Mossos d'Esquadra and the testimonies of many sex workers\\" show this is not the case. Aims The association works to give a positive image of the business involved in prostitution. It defends the legalisation of prostitution claiming that it would bring economic security to prostitutes, through a legal framework that regulates the sector. It also \\"defends the exclusion of minors and drugs in their businesses [and] base the activities on the free will of the prostitute, the client and the entrepreneur of the clubs\\". They also criticise street prostitution using hygiene arguments. Some, but not all, of these points align with sexual workers's objectives. The requirements to become a member are: * To be a businessman from a recognised company. * Not being involved in illegal drugs. * Not to allow the involvement of minors. The association has been criticised in that its criticism of street prostitution favours the association's mode of business: prostitution in its premises is the only type of prostitution that provides them with income. The apparent defence of sex workers is only motivated by their business interests, according to E. Villa Camarma. While the beliefs and aims of the association have been publicised the media, it has almost always been contrasted with data from other sources. History The association was founded in 2000, at a time when there was a certain tolerance of prostitution in Spain after prostitution was decriminalised, and its constitution formalised the following year. Among its founders was Jos√© Luis Navarro Roberto. In 2001, ANELA denounced a case of trafficking in people in which a Romanian and a Lithuanian were the victims. The following year, the association applied to join the CEOE. In 2003, ANELA offered the councils of Valencia and Madrid funding for a pilot scheme to make hotels available to street prostitutes during a trial period. In January 2004 they criticised the reform in article 188.1 of the Criminal Code, which made exploiting the prostitution of another person an offence. This followed a ruling from the Higher Court of Andalusia requiring club owners to register prostitutes for Social security. In 2006 about four hundred clubs were members of the association. Judicial operation Operaci√≥ Il¬∑lusionista (Operation Illusionist) uncovered an exploitation network in Coslada, Madrid in 2008. ANELA alleged that it did not know that such practices existed. Two business associates (owners of the Riviera and Saratoga clubs) ended up in jail for being involved, as did two police officers. That same year ANELA criticised a campaign to persuade men to abstain from using the services of prostitution, which was organised by the city council of Seville. In 2009 they criticised the Plan Integral de Lucha contra la Trata de Seres Humanos con fines de explotaci√≥n sexual (Comprehensive Plan to Combat Human Trafficking for Sexual Purposes) and pointed out the ambiguity of two High Courts of Justice rulings: one in Galicia established that prostitution is a person's own economic activity while the other from Catalonia considers that he is someone else's. The former secretary, Jos√© Luis Roberto, resigned in 2011 because his extreme right wing activities could give a bad image to the businesses associated with ANELA. That same year ANELA criticised the Generalitat Valenciana for removing the association's advertising from buses, claiming discrimination. In 2015 it was found that some clubs had underage employees. The association explained that they were tricked by the presentation of falsified documentation. In the same year, the association complained about the lack of a regulatory framework that is only present in an exemplary way in Catalonia.

Early life and career Emmett Stull Goff was born on September 3, 1852, on a farm just south of Elmira, New York one of a family that eventually numbered five brothers and three sisters. Goff attended the common schools of New York and the Elmira Free Academy, from which he graduated in 1870. For the next five years, he worked on the family farm. By 1875, despite not having any formal experience as a teacher, he began a short career as a schoolmaster in Elmira. New York Geneva Agricultural Experiment Station When the New York Geneva Agricultural Experiment Station was founded in 1882 to focus on agricultural scientific research and the establishment of experimental plantings, Goff was hired as the Station's first horticulturist by Edward Lewis Sturtevant. An early project was to develop a botanical listing of the known vegetables propagated and marketed by nurserymen in New York State, a catalog that extends over 190 pages. His work on apple varieties culminated in a report that was, at the time, the \\"most noteworthy collection of its kind in the United States\\" containing over 700 named varieties of apples and crabapples . While developing his classification of plants of New York, Goff published his observations on cross fertilization relating to the dominance and recessiveness in certain characters of the common garden pea, seventeen years before the rediscovery in 1900 of Gregor Mendel‚Äôs Law of Genetic Inheritance. In the 1880s The Geneva Station was under pressure to achieve visible results that could be exhibited to farmers. Goff was involved with establishing small plots demonstrating the effectiveness of new fertilizers, insecticides or varieties alongside control plots devoted to the old way of doing things. University of Wisconsin - Madison The Wisconsin Agriculture Experiment Station was established in 1883 at a time when the decline in agricultural productivity due to infertile soils was a growing concern. Goff was recruited to Wisconsin in 1889 by his Geneva Station colleague Stephen M. Babcock who had joined the staff a year earlier. Subsequently, Dean William Arnon Henry appointed Goff as the university's first Professor of Horticulture and as the Horticulturist to the University Agricultural Experiment Station. At Wisconsin Goff investigated therapy of apple scab, potato blight and scab, corn smut, onion mold, spot disease of strawberries, and grape mildew and rot, in addition to the development of reagents and spray machinery. Perhaps his best single work was the study carried on at Madison and the University of Chicago on \\"The Time and the Manner of the Formation of Flower Buds in Fruit Trees\\" published in 1899. Goff authored Principles of Plant Culture (1897) which by 1916 had reached its eighth edition. This volume was followed by Lessons in Pomology (1899) and Lessons in Commercial Fruit Growing (1902) Goff planted an orchard on the Madison Agriculture Station grounds seeking fruit trees hardy enough for Wisconsin's winters. In travels around the state and in conjunction with orchardist Arthur L. Hatch, Goff discovered that Door County, Wisconsin ‚Äì the peninsula on the east shore of Wisconsin that extends into Lake Michigan - is remarkably suited for fruit growing. The subsequent growth of the cherry industry brought Door County national prominence. In the classroom, Goff built a student enrollment from less than a dozen to more than 300 by 1902. This was at a time when there were few departments in the college and presumably every student took at least one course in horticulture as part of their program. Death Goff died suddenly on June 6, 1902, at age 49 as a result of unsuccessful intestinal surgery. He was buried in the Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin.

The term has been used principally for elections in the U.S. state of Virginia. For the 2020 Democratic party primaries, Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and North Dakota are conducting firehouse primaries. North Dakota is using the term firehouse caucus for its event.Josh Putnam. North Dakota Democrats Plan to Hold March 10 Firehouse Caucuses, FrontloadingHQ blog, March 13, 2019 Because firehouse primaries are held with more limited locations and time frames than state-run primaries, and party officials have more control over who the candidates are, firehouse primaries have been criticized as relatively undemocratic by some American commentators.Roger Chesley. Undemocratic way of selecting Democratic Party nominees. The Virginian-Pilot, Mar 1, 2017 Firehouse primaries are the norm for the selection of candidates for public office in political parties outside of the United States and some parts of South America. The selection of candidates to compete for political officer on behalf of a political party in European nations is usually done by paying party members or party officials, or a mix of both, often without the use of any public infrastructure or direct funding. It is unusual for there to be any particularly strict or explicit legislation governing how parties can select their candidates. As such, a term like 'party selection', 'party election' or another local term is more likely to be used than 'firehouse primary'. Most countries do not have a system for voters to publicly register as identifying with a particular political party as in the United States which makes open primaries more difficult, though not impossible, to hold.

He is the founder and CEO of Red Balloon Security in New York City, a cybersecurity firm that develops new technologies to defend embedded systems against exploitation.  Career  Cui was formerly a researcher with Columbia University's Intrusion Detection Systems Lab where he worked while pursuing his Ph.D. in computer science at Columbia University. His doctoral dissertation, entitled ‚ÄúEmbedded System Security: A Software-Based Approach,‚Äù focused on scientific inquiries concerning the exploitation and defense of embedded systems. Cui received his Ph.D. in 2015, and founded Red Balloon Security to commercialize his firmware defense technology now known as Symbiote. Cui has publicly demonstrated security vulnerabilities in widely used commercial and consumer products, including Cisco and Avaya VoIP phones, Cisco routers and HP LaserJet printers. He has presented his research at industry events including Black Hat Briefings, DEF CON conference, RSA Conference, REcon security conference and the Auto-ISAC 2018 Summit. Cui's security research has earned the 2011 Kaspersky Labs American Cup Winner, 2012 Symantec Research Labs Graduate Fellowship and the 2015 DARPA Riser In 2017, the United States Department of Homeland Security cited his company with the ‚ÄúCrossing the Valley of Death‚Äù distinction for the development of a commercially available cyber defense system for critical infrastructure facilities, which was produced following a 12-month DHS funded pilot study to evaluate cyber sabotage risks to the building systems of a DHS Biosafety Level 3 facility.  Dukedom  In 2020, Cui received the noble title of duke from the Principality of Sealand. Cui's royal title grants him an official territory, or duchy, of one square foot within the micronation, which he has named SPACE. As a Duke of the Principality of Sealand, Cui joins the ranks of notable figures who have also received nobility titles from the micronation, including English cricketeer Ben Stokes and musician Ed Sheeran.  Security Research  Symbiote Cui is best known for his role in the development of Symbiote, a host-based firmware defense technology for embedded devices. Symbiote is injected into the firmware of a legacy embedded device where it provides intrusion detection functionality. It does so by constantly checking the integrity of static code and data at the firmware level, in order to prevent unauthorized code or commands from executing. Symbiote is operating system agnostic and is compatible with most embedded devices. Red Balloon Security has already released Symbiote for commercial printer brands like HP and other devices. On June 21, 2017, Red Balloon Security announced the launch of Symbiote for Automotive Defense, an automotive version of the standard Symbiote technology, at the Escar USA Conference in Detroit. In 2016, Popular Science named Symbiote one of the ‚Äú9 Most Important Security Innovations of the Year.‚Äù HP LaserJet Printers In 2011, Cui was part of a research effort at Columbia University, directed by Professor Salvatore Stolfo, to examine security vulnerabilities in HP LaserJet printers. The project found chers announced significant security flaws in these devices which could allow for a range of remote attacks, including triggering a fire hazard by forcing the printer's fuser to continually heat up. HP released a firmware update soon after these findings were released. However, team claimed they found 201 vulnerable HP laser jet printers in the U.S. Department of Defense's network and two at HP's headquarters months after the security patch was released. In 2015, HP licensed Cui's Symbiote technology to use as a firmware defense against cyber attacks for its LaserJet Enterprise printers and multifunction printers. Cisco IP Phones At the 29th Chaos Communication Congress in December 2012, Cui and Solfo presented the findings of their DARPA funded research study, which exposed a vulnerability in Cisco IP phones (CiscoUnified IP Phone 7900 series) that could allow an attacker to turn them into bugging devices. The exploit gained root access to the device's firmware, which could enable the interception of phone calls. It would also allow an attacker to remotely activate the phone's microphone in order to eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Funtenna At the 2015 Black Hat Briefings cybersecurity conference, Cui unveiled a firmware exploit called ‚ÄúFuntenna‚Äù which manipulates the electronic processes within common devices like printers, phones, and washing machines in order to create radio signals which could secretly transmit data outside of a secure facility. The attack could even work with devices within an air-gapped system. News outlets such as Ars Technica and Motherboard noted Funtenna's potential for turning infected devices into covert spying tools. Monitor Darkly At the DEF CON 24 security conference in 2016, Cui, along with his principal scientist Jatin Kataria and security researcher Francois Charbonneau, demonstrated previously unknown vulnerabilities in the firmware of widely used computer monitors, which an attacker could exploit to both spy on the user's screen activity and to manipulate what the user sees and engages with on the screen. Called ‚ÄúMonitor Darkly,‚Äù the firmware vulnerability was reported to affect Dell, HP, Samsung and Acer computer monitors. The vulnerability was specific to the monitors‚Äô on-screen-display (OSD) controllers, which are used to control and adjust viewing options on the screen, such as brightness, contrast or horizontal/vertical positioning. However, as Cui, Kataria and Charbonneau noted in their talk abstract for the 2016 REcon security conference, with the Monitor Darkly exploit, the OSD can also be used to ‚Äúread the content of the screen, change arbitrary pixel values, and execute arbitrary code supplied through numerous control channels.‚Äù The security news site CSO Online said about the vulnerability, ‚ÄúBy exploiting a hacked monitor, they could manipulate the pixels and add a secure-lock icon by a URL. They could make a $0 PayPal account balance appear to be a $1 billion balance. They could change ‚Äòthe status-alert light on a power plant's control interface from green to red.‚Äô‚Äù The exploit was later used in a Season 3 episode of the Mr. Robot show, in which the FBI uses it to take screenshots of Elliot Alderson‚Äôs computer. BadFET At the 2017 REcon security conference, Cui and security researcher Rick Housley demonstrated a new method for hacking processors through the use of an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP. Known as electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI), this class of attacks has been investigated before, but Cui and Housley‚Äôs new technique, known as ‚ÄúBadFET,\\" is adapted to exploit modern computers and embedded devices, by impacting multiple components within these devices at the same time. By using a 300 volt EMP pulse from 3 millimeters away, the BadFET attack bypasses the Secure Boot protection that keeps processors from running untrusted code. Cui and Housley also introduced an open source EMFI platform that makes BadFET available to other security researchers, for further analysis, testing and development. Thrangrycat On May 13, 2019, Cui and his research team (composed of Jatin Kataria, Richard Housley and James Chambers) jointly announced with Cisco a critical vulnerability in Cisco's secure boot process identified as CVE-2019-1649, and referred to as ‚ÄúThrangrycat‚Äù by Red Balloon Security. The vulnerability affects a key hardware security component developed by Cisco known as the Trust Anchor module (TAm). The vulnerability is considered significant, as TAm underpins the secure boot process in numerous Cisco devices, including routers and switches. As WIRED Magazine explained in its reporting on the Thrangrycat vulnerability: \\"Known as the Trust Anchor, this Cisco security feature has been implemented in almost all of the company‚Äôs enterprise devices since 2013. The fact that the researchers have demonstrated a way to bypass it in one device indicates that it may be possible, with device-specific modifications, to defeat the Trust Anchor on hundreds of millions of Cisco units around the world. That includes everything from enterprise routers to network switches to firewalls.‚Äù Cisco describes the TAm as a ‚Äúproprietary, tamper-resistant chip‚Äù that is ‚Äúfound in many Cisco products‚Äù and ‚Äúhelps verify that Cisco hardware is authentic.‚Äù The vulnerability could enable an attacker to modify the firmware of this module to gain persistent access on a network and carry out many different types of malicious activity, including data theft, importing malware and physical destruction of equipment.

This riot took the homes, jobs, and lives of many Filipinos in the area. Unable to receive help or protection from the white police, Filipinos were easy targets for radicalized and angered whites who saw them as thieves of their women and jobs. Under the cover or darkness, and occasionally during the daytime, mobs of white men would harass, threaten, beat, and even kill innocent Filipinos for no other reason than their presence. This is just a single example of the violence that Filipinos faced in America due to their employment as laborers. Anti-Filipino sentiments forced the passing of legal acts to further push Filipinos out of America. In the late 1920s anti-Asian sentiment in the US grew, culminating in the Immigration Act of 1924. Unlike other Asian groups at the time, Filipinos were permitted in the country as a result of the US Colonization of the Philippines, and although they were legal residents, they still faced a great deal of discrimination. Many of these workers found jobs in Eastern Washington on the numerous farms in the area. At the same time the Ku Klux Klan had been exploiting this existing anti-Asian sentiment with the residents of the valley, claiming to protect white women from the threat of interracial dating, and local men from the source of cheap labor. In November of 1927 this culminated in a series of intimidation and threats by the KKK in the valley. Beginning the night of November 8th, a mob gathered at a local boarding house owned by an interracial couple, demanding all Filipino boarders leave town. Throughout the week Filipino workers were threatened with death if they did not leave the valley. Most were forced onto trains out of town, or simply left on foot. Those who remained were put into the county jail for their own protection. Overall hundreds of Filipinos were forced out of the valley as a result of the riot, which was finally ended November 11th. In the aftermath of the incident, the local leaders were arrested and put on trial, eventually being found guilty by an all white jury and sentenced to 10 days in jail. Background The first Filipinos to move to the United States were mostly limited to pensionados, well-educated young men from privileged families looking to send their sons to university in the U.S.. Later, large numbers of Filipinos immigrated to Hawaii to meet labor demand on sugar plantations. Around 64,000 Filipinos immigrated to Hawaii by 1930.. Quickly, however, some of these immigrants left Hawaii's strict labor regime in search for better socio-economic opportunities on the U.S. mainland. Filipinos were mass hired at fruit plantations in Washington's Yakima Valley. Employers used this sudden influx of immigrant labor to undercut the wages of white laborers, causing resentment among the Valley's white population that would eventually develop into full-blown riots and racism. In the late 1920s anti-Asian sentiment in the U.S. grew, culminating in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1924. Unlike other Asian groups at the time, Filipinos were permitted in the country as a result of the US Colonization of the Philippines, and although they were legal residents, they still faced a great deal of discrimination. Many of these workers found jobs in Eastern Washington on the numerous farms in the area. At the same time the Ku Klux Klan had been exploiting this existing anti-Asian sentiment with the residents of the valley, claiming to protect white women from the threat of interracial dating, and local men from the source of cheap labor. Additionally, the \\"Alien land law\\" prohibited those ineligible for citizenship to own land, but Yakima natives on the reservation felt exempt from this law, allowing Asians to tend and own their land. Due to the legal loophole exempting Filipinos from the Exclusion Act and legal segregation, vigilante violence was heavily employed by whites from all classes. Beginning the night of November 8th, a mob gathered at a local boarding house owned by an interracial couple, demanding all Filipino boarders leave town. Mobs of white men swarmed into the town of Toppenish, attacking and harassing Filipino workers for two days straight. On the first night, men rushed into homes of Filipinos, injuring residents and destroying houses and furniture. Filipinos were gathered and forced to leave on trains under threat of death. Those who chose to stay were told they would be hanged if found after dark, and were placed in jail under protective custody by police. Filipinos in the Valley were subject to arson and dynamite bombings perpetrated by white vigilante groups who accused Filipinos of \\"stealing\\" white women from white men and for cooperating with \\"barbaric black natives\\". The Ku Klux Klan in the Valley was led by Tyler A. Rogers, the local Kleagle. The Klan claimed to uphold the law and denied their night-riding approach at justice. They attracted significant support from the Valley's white population due to their outspoken opinions against interracial dating or relationships. Not only were the Filipino laborers harassed and tormented by the KKK, but their employers were threatened and beaten too. Results and outcome Most Filipino residents of the Valley were forced onto trains out of town, or simply left on foot. Those who remained were put into the county jail for their own protection. Overall, hundreds of Filipinos were forced out of the Valley as a result of the riot, which was finally ended November 11th. In the aftermath of the incident, the local leaders were arrested and put on trial, eventually being found guilty by an all white jury and sentenced to 10 days in jail. Whites who resented the Filipinos pushed for a removal of the Filipinos exemption status from the Exclusion Act. The Tydings-McDuffie Act in 1934 granted the Philippines its independence after a ten year period. This limited Filipino immigration to the United States to 50 people a year, even less than the 100 allotted to Japan and China. To deal with the Filipinos that already came to America, the Filipino Repatriation Act of 1935 was passed, offering a paid one way ticket for Filipinos to return home, as long as they promised never to return. While most fled out of fear and self-preservation, some Filipinos, estimated to be about 25 individuals, stayed to host their annual Rizal celebration. Further riots The series of riots in the Yakima Valley only shows a small portion of the violent riots Filipinos faced. After the Yakima tragedies, riots were started in other small farming towns where Filipinos were the main labor force. Exeter and the Watsonville riots are a few of the better known riots that took place after Yakima. These riots were similar in nature to the ones in the Yakima Valley, featuring groups of white men using threats and violence in an attempt to run the Filipinos out of town. Like the Yakima riots, Filipinos were shot, beaten, and killed mercilessly.

She was born in Englewood, New Jersey. Ebner's artwork takes the form of photographs and poems that question the limits and ambiguity of language.  Career  Ebner received her BA degree from Bard College in 1993. Before she entered Yale University in 1997, she stopped her photographic practice to focus more on her work as a poet. She participated in the St. Mark's Poetry Project in New York and worked for the writer Eileen Myles. Although Ebner is no longer a poet, she takes her inspiration from poems and looks for ways to include poetry within her photographic work. She graduated from Yale in 2000. From 2010 to 2018, Ebner taught the University of Southern California's Roski School of Art and Design. In 2018 she was named chair of the Pratt Institute's photography department.  Process  Ebner takes her photographs in black and white. In an interview with Mouse Magazine, Ebner explained that she believes black and white \\"means a way of seeing the world that doesn't exist in reality; it's a way of seeing the world that is about difference.\\" Ebner claims a photographer always has the choice to keep the colour or discard it. This means that the choice between colour and black & white is always an act of discarding the color information of the images. For Ebner, photography is about the lines of action: writing with blank ink on a world that's in shades of grey.  Themes  Portraits The first well known portrait made by Shannon Ebner is called: Portrait of My Ex-Girlfriend (1998). The picture was taken while she was a graduate student on Yale's MFA program. Ebner placed the picture in a jar of water and left it there while she embarked on a road trip to Nova Scotia where she hoped to meet Robert Frank. When she returned, she took the lid off the jar exposing the blurred picture resulting to be Portrait of My Ex-Girlfriend. The submerging of photographs in jars filled with water is a method that Ebner kept using during her career. The photograph Paging Walter (2009) was made the same way. Ebner shot a portrait of Walter Benjamin and exposed the picture to the same process: because of the solubility property of water, the photographs emulsion sloughed off, leaving behind a ghostly trace of the original print. Language Language is the main subject in the photography of Ebner's career. Her work is an exploration of language and sign systems. \\"Ebner often takes symbolic or linguistic signifiers and detaches them from their usual contexts. She uses language in unexpected and multi-layered ways, with puns, palindromes and borrowed phrases.\\"  Public collections  Ebner's work is included in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Guggenheim Museum, New York.

According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography he was born about 1448. A businessman based in London, he was a member of the Mercers Company. Early life The Tates were a successful business family with international trading connections. The subject was known to contemporaries as \\"John Tate the younger\\", Tate, called \\"the yonger\\", is mentioned by Wynkyn de Worde in the colophon to a book he produced in 1496, an encyclopaedia, De Proprietatibus Rerum by Bartholomeus Anglicus (in John Trevisa's translation). This book has been claimed to be the first printed on English paper. and is believed have been the son of the John Tate who served as Lord Mayor of London in 1473. Neither father nor son is to be confused with a third John Tate, apparently a cousin of the subject, who was knighted and who served as Lord Mayor in 1496-97 and 1514‚Äì15. Papermaking Sele Mill has been rebuilt since Tudor times Tate acquired a long-established watermill called Sele Mill. At that time it was just outside Hertford which has since grown to include the suburb of Bengeo. Sele Mill is on the River Beane, a chalk stream, near its confluence with the River Lea. This facility was converted into a paper mill. Paper was produced there in the 1490s, and possibly earlier. The catchment of the Beane was a rural area, but there is evidence that Tate found customers locally with some of his paper being used for record-keeping by the Woodhall estate a few miles upstream.The document in question was a court roll. See Papermaking in Britain 1488-1988: A Short History. Richard Leslie Hills Importantly for his business plan, the mill was less than 30 miles from the capital which could be accessed via Ermine Street or the River Lea (see note). One London-based customer was Wynkyn de Worde, who took over Caxton's print shop in the 1490s. Another London-based customer was Henry VII of England. The king, who had given Hertford Castle to his wife in 1487, visited the mill in 1498. He is known to have made a return visit the following year. It has been suggested that one of the watermarks used by Tate, a Tudor rose, was designed with royal use in mind. The quality of the paper was good, but the mill seems to have ceased producing it at the beginning of the 16th century for reasons which are not clear. Tate mentioned the building in his will of 1507 along with a stock of white paper he had there. Possibly he could not get a good enough price for his paper, although, as far as is known, there were not any other British producers. Final years Tate wrote his will in 1507 and died that year or the following. He had been living at Mincing Lane in the City of London and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the- East.Richard L.

It was built in 1905‚Äì1909 under the proposal of Viceroy of Zhili Yuan Shikai (Ë¢Å‰∏ñÂáØ) and Assistant Director-General of Railways Hu Yufen (ËÉ°ÁáèÊ£ª), with Zhan Tianyou (Ë©πÂ§©‰Ωë) or Jeme Tien Yow as engineer-in-chief. When building the railway, Zhan reduced the length of Badaling Tunnel by using a switchback‚Äîor ‚Äú‰∫∫‚Äù-shaped rail track called in China as the shape of it resembles the Chinese character ‚Äú‰∫∫‚Äù (pinyin: r√©n; literally: people); he also used vertical shafts to facilitate the excavation of the tunnel. The railway formally opened in 1909, with a total length of 201.2 km. Starting from Liucun Village in Fengtai, it connected Beijing to Zhangjiakou via the Guan‚Äôgou Valley with 14 stations, 4 tunnels and 125 bridges. In 1912, four stations with passing loops were built in the Guan‚Äôgou section. The railway was merged into Beijing-Suiyuan Railway in 1916, and later into Beijing-Baotou Railway after the founding of People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC). The rail tracks located within the city area of Beijing were gradually dismantled to meet the need of urban traffic. In 1995, the former Xizhimen Station (Ë•øÁõ¥Èó®Á´ô) was designated as Major Historical and Cultural Site of Beijing, and in 2013, the section between Nankou (ÂçóÂè£) and Badaling (ÂÖ´ËææÂ≤≠) was listed as Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level.  History   Background  In late 19th century, railway and mining became targets of Western powers in their colonial endeavours in China. In 1895, the Guangxu Emperor issued an imperial edict, claiming to carry out a national reform through a variety of measures, where railway construction was considered a top priority. Britain and Russia thus began competing for the power to build railways in North China, but the Qing government rejected both of them in 1898. Around a year later in 1899, Kinder, the British engineer-in-chief of the Imperial Railways of North China (ÂÖ≥ÂÜÖÂ§ñÈìÅË∑Ø), carried out preliminary surveying in areas between Beijing and Zhangjiakou, and this led to the rivalry between Britain and Russia for the control of Inner Mongolia. Russia made a request to the Qing government for approval of building the railway, but was refused by the latter. On June 1, 1899, Russia forced the Qing government to make a commitment that it would consult Russia or Russian companies beforehand in the case that companies from any third country wanted to build railways in the north of Beijing or Northeast China. After the Siege of the International Legations, the Qing government signed with Britain Regulations on Britain Returning the Imperial Railways of North China („ÄäËã±ÂõΩ‰∫§ËøòÈìÅË∑ØÁ´†Á®ã„Äã) and Regulations on Following the Returning of the Imperial Railways of North China („ÄäÂÖ≥ÂÜÖÂ§ñÈìÅË∑Ø‰∫§Ëøò‰ª•ÂêéÁ´†Á®ã„Äã), which excluded any third country from building railways in areas within 80 miles in the north and south of the Shanhai Pass and between Fengtai and the Great Wall in the north. This caused objection of Russia and France, which made representations to the Qing government on the latter Regulations. Ultimately, it was agreed that no foreign capital shall be used to build railways in the north of Beijing, including the railway between Beijing and Zhangjiakou, and neither the railways, if built, nor the revenue made from the railways shall be transferred to foreign countries as collateral.  Planning  In 1905, Viceroy of Zhili Yuanshikai and Assistant Director-General of Railways Hu Yufen submitted a memorial to the throne, asking for approval to build the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway. The project was expected to take 4 years at a cost of 5 million taels of silver. The Imperial Railways of North China would contribute 1 million taels of silver annually to the budget and in return, receive 800,000 taels of silver per year from the Boxer Indemnities. The proposal was approved in February the same year. Based on the recommendation of Liang Dunyan (Ê¢ÅÊï¶ÂΩ¶), Yuan Shikai chose Zhan Tianyou as the chief engineer. In May the same year, the Qing government appointed Chen Zhaochang (ÈôàÊò≠Â∏∏) as the director-general of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway and Zhan Tianyou as the assistant director-general and chief engineer. Meanwhile, the Beijing- Zhangjiakou Railway Administration was established in Tianjin, and a branch office was opened in Fuchengmen, Beijing. Zhan Tianyou soon led two Chinese graduates of railway engineering Xu Wenhui (ÂæêÊñáÊ¥Ñ) and Zhang Honggao (Âº†È∏øËØ∞) to carry out the surveying They started in Liucun Village, and proceeded in Nankou, Guan‚Äôgou, and Badaling. On May 31, they reached Zhangjiakou and tried to find a site for the Zhangjiakou Station. Before deciding the final location of the station, Zhan visited Governor-General of Chahar Pu Ting (Ê∫•È¢ã) and other local officials.  Construction  Construction began on October 2, 1905, in three sections.  Section I: Fengtai (‰∏∞Âè∞)‚ÄìNankou (ÂçóÂè£)  This section was 55 km long, starting from Bridge 60 of Beijing-Fengtian Railway (‰∫¨Â•âÈìÅË∑Ø) located in the east of Fengtai Station in Liucun (Êü≥Êùë). When building the section, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway borrowed sites and facilities from the Imperial Railways of North China, and agreed, through negotiation, to pay the latte an annual rent of 200 taels of silver. On September 30, 1906, the section was fully built and put in use. Meanwhile, the Xizhimen Station (Ë•øÁõ¥Èó®Á´ô), designed by the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Administration, was established also in 1905‚Äì1906.  Section II: Nankou-Chadaocheng (Â≤îÈÅìÂüé)  This section was 16.5 km long, covering the most challenging part in the Guan‚Äôgou Valley (ÂÖ≥Ê≤ü). To be closer to the construction site, Zhan Tianyou moved his office to Nankou (ÂçóÂè£). In order to satisfy the need for ballast and locomotives, a ballast factory was built in Nankou in 1906, and a locomotive factory, the Jingzhang Manufactory (‰∫¨Âº†Âà∂ÈÄ†ÂéÇ), was established in the same year. When building the railway going through the Jundu Mountain (ÂÜõÈÉΩÂ±±), Zhan Tianyou used a zigzag, at a high gradient of 0.033. Owed to the design, the length of the Badaling Tunnel was reduced from 1.8 km, which was beyond the construction capacity back then, to 1.095 km. Before the excavation in Badaling began, Japanese merchant Amemiya Keijirou (Èõ®ÂÆ´Êï¨Ê¨°ÈÉé) and Kinder recommended foreign machinery and contractors to Zhan Tianyou as a solution to the seemingly unconquerable task. Zhan, however, stood fast on using an all-Chinese team. When building the tunnel, in addition to cutting from the two sides of the mountain, Zhan also drilled two vertical shafts from the mountaintop, so that workers can excavate within the mountain on four surfaces simultaneously. Of the two shafts, the bigger one was 33 m deep and 3.05 m wide. Together, they contributed to a daily excavation of 0.9 m. Also, with fans installed, the shafts could bring air to the tunnel, and served, after the tunnel was finished, as ventilation shafts, through which the smoke puffed by the train could run out. To accelerate the construction, workers worked in shifts. Among the 60 people in each shift, 40 were responsible for blasting and 20 for transportation. When building the rail track going through the Juyong Pass (Â±ÖÂ∫∏ÂÖ≥), Zhan decided to build a tunnel in the nearby mountain to avoid damaging civilian houses. During the excavation, the construction team found a gorge that had probably been blocked by other people, which, together with the soft mountain rocks and soil, posed a great challenge to the construction. In 1907, the Qing government ordered the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Administration to plant trees along the railway. On April 14, 1908, the 367 m Juyongguan Tunnel was completed, and on May 22, the 1,090.5 m Badaling Tunnel was completed. Before that, construction work of the 141 m and 46 m tunnels in Shifosi (Áü≥‰ΩõÂØ∫) and Wuguitou (‰∫îÊ°ÇÂ§¥) had been finished.  Section III: Chadaocheng-Huailai (ÊÄÄÊù•)-Zhangjiakou The section was 129.7 km long. The construction started even before the second section was completed, and work on this section was largely accelerated by the completion of the first two sections as construction materials could be transported by rail. The major challenges in this section lied in the Huailai River Bridge (ÊÄÄÊù•Ê≤≥Â§ßÊ°•) and the section between Jiming Mountain (È∏°È∏£Â±±) and Xiangshuipu (ÂìçÊ∞¥Èì∫). For the former, Zhan Tianyou built a steel truss bridge with timber-pile foundation and concrete abutments; for the latter, the riverbed was raised with fillings, and cement was used to protect the track from flood damage. On July 4, the railway finally reached Zhangjiakou.  Opening  Wuguitou Tunnel; foundation damaged by flood. On August 11, 1909, with some final work finished, the project was formally completed. On September 19, Minister of Posts and Communications Xu Shichang (Âæê‰∏ñÊòå), Director-General of Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Zhan Tianyou, and Assistant Director-General of Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Guan Mianjun (ÂÖ≥ÂÜïÈíß) took the train and checked the railway section by section. A celebration tea party was held in Zhangjiakou on September 21. On September 24, the Beijing- Zhangjiakou Railway was formally opened. An opening ceremony was held in the Nankou Station on October 2, with over 10,000 people present, including foreign diplomats in Beijing and Tianjin, representatives of the minister of Beiyang (ÂåóÊ¥ãÂ§ßËá£), and senior officials of the Ministry of Post and Communications. Xu Shichang, Zhan Tianyou, and Zhu Junqi (Êú±ÂêõÊ∑á) made speeches on the ceremony. The actual total cost of the 201.2 km railway was 289,000 less than the initially expected 7.29 million taels of silver, and the cost per km (34,500 taels of silver) marked the lowest of all railways in China. More importantly, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway was Qing Dynasty‚Äôs first and only railway that had been designed, built, and managed solely by Chinese. After the opening, the railway was used for various purposes, including transporting mails between Fengtai and Zhangjiakou. The Qinghe railway station gradually took place of the Qinghe waterway in transporting passengers and cargo. The ballast production in Nankou ended, while the Jingzhang Manufactory expanded.  Later development  Sun Yat-sen on inspection tour; at Zhangjiakou Station Liucun, the 0km point of Peking-Kalgan Railway, in October 2020 In 1910, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Engineering Bureau moved to Zhangjiakou under the new name of Zhangjiakou-Suiyuan Railway Engineering Bureau, to support the construction of Zhangjiakou-Suiyuan Railway (Âº†Áª•ÈìÅË∑Ø). In September 1912, Sun Yat-sen (Â≠ô‰∏≠Â±±), who resigned from the post of interim president of Republic of China, showed great interest in railway undertaking. He met Yuan Shikai in Beijing, and took an inspection tour to Zhangjiakou by train. In 1916, as the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Authority merged into the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Authority, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway became a part of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. In April 1921, the railway extended westward to Suiyuan, and further to Baotou in January 1923. In 1928, the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway was renamed Peking-Suiyuan Railway (Âπ≥Áª•ÈìÅË∑Ø), and was renamed again after the establishment of PRC as Beijing-Baotou Railway. In 1924, six kilometres of the railway near the Xiahuayuan Station (‰∏ãËä±Âõ≠Á´ô) was relocated due to flood damage. After the outbreak of Japanese Aggression against China, the railway was seized by Japanese army. On July 25, 1939, ten kilometres of the railway in the Huailai section was relocated due to flood damage, and the Wuguitou Tunnel and Shifosi Tunnel were discarded also because of flood damage. In 1940, four newly built tunnels and five newly built bridges were put in use, and the ruling gradient rose from 0.333 to 0.358. In 1953, the railway between Kangzhuang (Â∫∑Â∫Ñ) and Langshan (ÁãºÂ±±) was relocated. In 1960, due to the expansion of Tsinghua University (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶), the rail track in the north of Qinghuayuan Station (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂõ≠Á´ô) was relocated to the east, and new buildings were established in the south of the original station, which turned into a freight yard. In 1968, due to the need of Beijing‚Äôs urban traffic, the railway between Guang‚Äôanmen (ÂπøÂÆâÈó®) and Xizhimen was dismantled, while that between Liucun and Guang‚Äôanmen maintained operation. In 2016, for the construction of Beijing-Zhangjiakou inter-city railway, rail tracks within the Beijing city were all dismantled and the Qinghuayuan Station was closed permanently.  Commemoration and conservation  In 1919, Zhan Tianyou died of disease in Hankou at age of 58. In commemoration of him, in 1922, the Chinese Engineers Society (‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ∑•Á®ãÂ∏àÂ≠¶‰ºö), together with the Association of Colleagues of Beijing-Suiyuan Railway (‰∫¨Áª•ÈìÅË∑ØÂêå‰∫∫‰ºö) and other organisations, built a 3 m high bronze statue of him in the Qinglongqiao Station (ÈùíÈæôÊ°•Á´ô). In 1926, Zhan‚Äôs wife Tan Juzhen died and was buried with him. In 1982, the Ministry of Railways of PRC, the Beijing Railway Administration, and the China Railway Society moved their tomb in Baiwanzhaung (Áôæ‰∏áÂ∫Ñ) in west Beijing to a new burial ground behind the bronze statue in the Qinglongqiao Station. In 1995, the former Xizhimen Station was listed as Major Historical and Cultural Site of Beijing under the name of ‚ÄúFormer Xizhimen Station of Peking-Suiyuan Railway‚Äù. In 2007, an industrial historical site survey team, organised by the Capital Museum and Beijing Daily, discovered along the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway over 100 historical sites. In 2009, in the third national archaeological survey, the Zhangjiakou Station, Xinbaoan Station (Êñ∞‰øùÂÆâÁ´ô) and other former stations were listed as industrial historical sites. In the same year, the Capital Museum and cultural heritage committees of districts and counties along the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway made a joint application for listing the whole railway as national cultural heritage.

The film stars Motohiro ≈åta as Taiga and K≈çsuke Yonehara as Y≈´ichi Niina. It is based on the popular card game The Werewolves of Millers Hollow, and incorporates psychological and Boys' Love themes. Plot Taiga Kishimoto (Motohiro ≈åta) is a high school student who is abducted on his way home and wakes up in an unknown place. There he reunites with Niina (K≈çsuke Yonehara), a childhood friend with whom he also had a romantic relationship, although they distanced in later years after Niina changed schools. Both boys discover that they are confined in a school with old classmates and a teacher, where they are soon informed that they will be forced to participate in a deadly and sadistic game called \\"The Werewolf Game\\" (Jinr≈ç Game). Each person is assigned a role that they must keep hidden from others, these being the roles of villagers and two werewolves. The rules are simple: the team who manages to eliminate all the participants of the other team will win. However, there can only be one winner and all those who are eliminated by unanimous vote, accused of being werewolves, will die, as well as the participants who are attacked by the werewolves at night. As if this were not enough, the group discovers that a microchip has been placed in their brains that will activate if they try to escape, which will kill them by releasing a lethal substance. In the same way, the microchip also causes the participants who carry the role of werewolf to attack the villagers at midnight, making them lose all sense of humanity, like a beast. In the middle of this situation of life or death, Taiga and Niina reaffirm their feelings for each other and end up being the last two participants alive. Taiga, knowing that Niina is one of the werewolves, urges Niina to kill him so he can save himself. Niina, however, has lost the will to live long ago and even reveals to Taiga that he tried to commit suicide in the past, so he should be the one to die in punishment for having wished death. When midnight arrives, Niina begins to undergo the transformation and sacrifices himself for Taiga biting himself. The film ends with Taiga promising Niina's body that he will live every day of his life as if it were the last, never wishing for death.

Yahui Zhou currently serves as chairman and co- CEO of Opera. His estimated net worth is USD$2.2 billion.  Early life  Zhou was born in February 1977 in Lijiang, China. In 1999 he received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a master's degree in optical engineering in 2006, both from Tsinghua University in Beijing.  Career  Zhou's career started in 1999 when he started a website called \\"Vulcan Net\\" funded by Tsinghua University. Vulcan Net was a website dedicated to uploading animations made by people in the local area, especially students in the university. Zhou and Tsinghua University closed Vulcan Net sometime in 2004 due to unprofitability. Zhou became an executive manager for the social networking service Renren in November 2005. In March 2007, he stopped working for Renren when he became the general manager of Beijing JiNaiTe Technology Co., Ltd. Zhou worked for JiNaiTe Tech as General Manager from March 2007 to March 2008 until he founded his own company, Kunlun Tech Co., Ltd. Zhou served as Executive Director and General Manager from March 2008 to March 2011 and has served as chairman and CEO since 2011. An official name change to Beijing Kunlun Tech Co., Ltd. was done in March 2011. Zhou is the main owner of the aforementioned company with 30% of shares. In 2015, Zhou's company went public on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Beijing Kunlun Tech Co., Ltd. focuses on the distribution and sale of video games in China through their GameArk application. Beijing Kunlun finalized their purchase of a 60% stake in the gay dating app Grindr in January 2016. The next month, a consortium of investors including Beijing Kunlun acquired Opera Software with Beijing Kunlun acquiring 48%, effectively granting ownership to the company (and Zhou Yahui) by majority. Zhou has served as chairman and CEO of Opera since 2016. In March of 2019, Beijing Kunlun was forced to sell Grindr by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS viewed Beijing Kunlun's ownership of Grindr as a national security threat as Grindr has sensitive personal info such as location, messages and even HIV status which could be accessed by engineers in the Kunlun office in Beijing. Grindr was sold a year later on March 2020 to San Vincente Acquisition LLC for $608 million dollars. On the 13th of April 2020, it was announced that Zhou Yahui would resign as chairman of Beijing Kunlun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He resigned in order to focus on his e-commerce and payment platform Opay, a fintech company incubated by Opera, based in Africa. He was replaced by Wang Liwei.  Personal life  Zhou was married to Li Qiong, his elementary school classmate. They divorced in September 2016.

Description Boronia cremnophila is an erect or spreading shrub that grows to about high and wide. It has both simple and trifoliate leaves but mostly trifoliate. The end leaflet is long and wide and the side leaflets are shorter. The flowers are white and are borne singly on a pedicel about long. The four sepals are narrow triangular, white with pale green tips, long and wide, larger than the petals and hairy. The four petals are white with a pinkish base, long and wide and hairy. The eight stamens are hairy with those nearest the petals slightly longer than those near the sepals. Taxonomy and naming Boronia cremnophila was first formally described in 2015 by Russell Barrett, Matthew Barrett and Marco Duretto and the description was published in Nuytsia from a specimen collected near Mount Elizabeth Station.

Sparer (March 21, 1928 ‚Äì June 21, 1983) was an attorney known as the \\"father of welfare law.\\" He was a prominent legal scholar, founded the organizations now known as Mobilization for Justice and the National Center for Law and Economic Justice, and was the strategist behind the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Goldberg v. Kelly. Biography Early life and education Sparer was born in New York City to Marcus Sparer, a retail merchant, and Ada Cohen. He graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in New York City and enrolled at the City College of New York. In the summer of 1947, Sparer traveled to the southern United States to organize textile workers on behalf of Henry A. Wallace. During his sophomore year of college he was vice president of the student council and led strikes against the school because of faculty and administrators who were antisemitic and racist. Disillusioned with the school he married his classmate Tanya Schecter and they dropped out and joined the American Communist Party. They moved to Schenectady, New York, and worked to organize a General Electric plant except for a two-year hiatus from 1951-1953 where he served in the U.S. Army as a teacher and later as a lifeguard in Panama. Sparer resigned from the communist party in 1956 after learning of Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. Sparer then enrolled at Brooklyn Law School as it was the only law school in New York City that would accept him without an undergraduate degree. He graduated at the top of his class and was editor-in-chief of the Brooklyn Law Review. Career Despite renouncing the Communist Party he needed a letter of recommendation from anti-communist labor leader David Dubinsky to gain his law license. Upon graduating from law school in 1959, he worked as a lawyer for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. He then briefly transitioned to academia assisting Columbia Law School professor Monrad Paulsen with a study of juvenile courts. It was through this research that he became familiar with the antipoverty organization Mobilization for Youth (MFY). At that time MFY was expanding into legal services to provide legal information to low-income clients based on a report by the Vera Foundation. Sparer was the first director of the legal services arm of MFY called MFY Legal Services in 1963. Sparer, instead of following the Vera Foundation's recommendation, pushed the organization to focus on impact litigation to change the institutions that created and sustained poverty. MFY Legal Services became the prototype for storefront poverty law offices which opened in virtually every major American city. In 1965 he left MFY Legal Services and founded the Center on Social Welfare Policy and Law. It served as the center of the welfare rights movement in New York City. Sparer started the Center as the great need of individual clients' demands in neighborhood offices left little time to organize the strategic litigation. His two-tiered model allowed neighborhood lawyers and social workers in community-based offices to handle the day-to-day cases while the Center could partner for the impact litigation. Sparer brought a series of test cases to create a constitutional \\"right to live\\" where the court would recognize the right of individuals to access the essentials of subsistence. Sparer viewed the source of poverty as not from a lack of skills or education but from a lack of power. His test case strategy failed to create a \\"right to live\\" but led to several landmark victories at the U.S. Supreme Court. These victories included King v. Smith, Shapiro v. Thompson, and Goldberg v. Kelly. Sparer transitioned to academia where he taught at Yale Law School from 1967 to 1969 and at the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1969 until his death. While at the University of Pennsylvania he founded the Health Law Project where he was a pioneer in health law and pushed for greater access to healthcare. Death Sparer passed away on June 21, 1983 in Woodstock, New York. He was survived by his wife Tanya and their three children Ellen, Michael, and Carol. Legacy and honors In 1984, University of Pennsylvania Law School renamed the Public Interest Law Conference to the Edward V. Sparer Symposium bringing together legal academics and practitioners to provide insight into the area of poverty law. In 1985, Brooklyn Law School established the Edward V. Sparer Public Interest Law Fellowship Program for law students to prepare for careers in social justice.

Andrew Lincoln expressed interest in directing an episode for season 10, however, he was not able to due to scheduling conflicts. Michael Cudlitz, who directed an episode in season 9, returned to direct the fourth and seventh episodes of season 10. Production for the original 16-episode order of season 10 was completed in November 2019. Production resumed in October 2020, for the six additional episodes for season 10. Casting In February 2019, it was announced that Danai Gurira, who portrays Michonne, would exit the series in the tenth season. Gurira appeared in a limited capacity, in a handful of episodes that was interspersed throughout the season. Later, in July 2019, Gurira confirmed her exit at a panel at San Diego Comic-Con, and stated: In July 2019, it was announced that Thora Birch and Kevin Carroll had been cast; Birch plays Gamma, a member of the Whisperers, and Carroll plays Virgil, a survivor looking for his family. Regarding Lauren Cohan's status on the show as Maggie Greene, showrunner Angela Kang remarked in July 2019, \\"I'll just say that we're working on it.\\" Cohan left The Walking Dead in its ninth season to star in the TV series Whiskey Cavalier, however that series was canceled after one season. In October 2019, Kang affirmed Cohan would return as a series regular in season 11, but also hinted towards her appearance in the second half of season 10. Kang said that in developing season, even before knowing of Cohan's return, they had kept seeding that Maggie was still considered part of the ongoing narrative so that they could work in her return if she had the opportunity. The teaser trailer for \\"A Certain Doom\\", airing after the broadcast of \\"The Tower\\", confirmed Maggie's return to the series. Release The trailer was released on July 19, 2019, at San Diego Comic-Con. The season premiere was made available for streaming to subscribers of AMC Premiere on September 29, 2019.

At the age of six, he and his family were taken from Debrecen, Hungary, to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they spent eleven months. After the Second World War the family immigrated to Israel, where he subsequently served in the Israel Defense Forces and worked as a teacher. He later moved to Canada and then to the United States. In 2018, he was a witness to and survivor of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. He is a jeweler and speaker in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Early life  Judah Samet was born in Debrecen, Hungary on February 5, 1938, to an Orthodox Jewish family. His parents owned and managed two knitting factories and had four children: two sons, Moshe and Yakove, both older than Judah, and the youngest, a daughter, Henyah. The family lived across the street from the synagogue.  Holocaust  In March 1944, Nazis entered Debrecen and forced thousands of Jews into railcars with limited space, food and water. Samet remembers them being ignored by other citizens. He was with his family in a train going to the Auschwitz concentration camp, but it was rerouted to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after Czechoslovak partisans reportedly destroyed train tracks. Samet's father had received tickets and passports to emigrate to the United States but the family was not able to leave in time. Before they were sent to Bergen-Belsen, Samet and his family were held at a lumberyard in Austria. They got to the camp around July 1944, where Samet could only eat flavored water (\\"soup\\") and \\"moldy, rock-hard bread\\" every day, and sometimes bit bones to try to ease the starvation. Samet and his siblings would receive some bread from their mother, which he described as the reason they stayed alive. Samet's mother told him to eat lice, which had infected the camp. A German soldier contemplated killing Samet's mother because she asked for more supplies, but his superior officer decided to keep her as an interpreter for the Gestapo. A fellow inmate of Samet's performed a surgery on Samet's abscess on the back of his head. After eleven months in the camp Samet and his family were sent by train to an unknown location. It was speculated that they were going to the Theresienstadt Ghetto, or off a bridge. The train stopped in a forest close to Berlin, and an armored tank or infantry division showed up. Samet's father then pointed out that the tank's commander was American, and he was later revealed to be a Jew. Samet's father Yekutil died a week later from typhoid fever. Through Paris and Marseille, Samet and his family moved to Israel in 1946, where they lived in an Orthodox orphanage. Samet graduated from a seminary high school.  Career and activities  After graduation Samet served in the Israel Defense Forces' Paratroopers Brigade. His brother Jacob died in the Suez Crisis as a machine gunner for the IDF. Samet also worked as a teacher and managed two towns for the government of Israel. Joining family members, Samet moved to Toronto in 1961 and subsequently to New York City. In New York City, Samet worked at his uncle's coat factory. He met a teacher from Pittsburgh, Barbara, whom he later married and with whom he had a daughter, Elizabeth. Samet moved to Pittsburgh in 1962. He attended Duquesne University but did not graduate. In the Downtown Pittsburgh Clark Building, Samet managed and ultimately owned Irving Schiffman Jewelers, founded in 1941 by his father-in-law. Samet also worked as a teacher. He served for 40 years as a Torah reader and cantor at the Conservative Tree of Life ‚Äì Or L'Simcha Congregation, where he had been a member since 1964. Since 2011, Samet gives public speeches about his life at high schools, universities, and churches. He has said that he was \\"energized\\" by the positive reception of his speeches.  Pittsburgh synagogue shooting  On October 27, 2018, eleven Jews were killed and seven injured in a mass shooting during Shabbat services at the Tree of Life building, marking the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history. Samet was four or five minutes late to the service because he had been delayed by his housekeeper. When he pulled into a handicapped spot on the parking lot, Samet was approached by a man who told him to leave due to the active shooter. Before pulling out of the parking lot unharmed, Samet had a clear vision of the shooting exchange between the gunman and a police officer. Second Lady of the U.S. Karen Pence, First Lady of the U.S. Melania Trump, Samet, and Pittsburgh police Officer Timothy Matson, at a listening session prior to the 2019 State of the Union Address U.S. President Donald Trump invited Samet to be one of his personal guests at the 2019 State of the Union Address, which Trump gave on February 5, 2019. Samet visited the White House and met President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, First Daughter Ivanka Trump, and Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner. After Trump introduced Samet in the Address and noted that it was Samet's 81st birthday, the crowd applauded, gave him a standing ovation, and sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" to him. Samet smiled, blew a kiss, waved down to Trump, stood up, bowed his head, and shouted \\"thank you\\". Trump jokingly conducted with his hands and said, \\"They wouldn't do that for me\\". Samet was not wearing his kippah at the Address because a government employee had told him \\"nobody wears a hat here\\" upon entering the House Chamber. Samet later said that he admired Trump and called him a \\"working man\\". A Republican, Samet supports Trump, saying about him: \\"I like him very much. He is strongly pro-Israel. That a man would go outright for Israel and declare for Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel ... that was something new.\\" Samet is, however, not politically active, as opposed to his Democratic family members.

The peptide SpyTag (13 amino acids) spontaneously reacts with the protein SpyCatcher (12.3 kDa) to form an intermolecular isopeptide bond between the pair. DNA sequence encoding either SpyTag or SpyCatcher can be recombinantly introduced into the DNA sequence encoding a protein of interest, forming a fusion protein. These fusion proteins can be covalently linked when mixed in a reaction through the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. Using the Tag/Catcher pair, bioconjugation can be achieved between two recombinant proteins that would otherwise be restrictive or impossible with traditional direct genetic fusion between the two proteins. For example, issues regarding protein folding, suboptimal expression host, and specialized post- translational modifications can be alleviated by separating the production of the proteins with the modularity of the Tag/Catcher system.  Development and reaction mechanism  386x386px SpyTag and SpyCatcher were formed from the splitting and engineering of the CnaB2 domain of the FbaB protein from Streptococcus pyogenes, which naturally forms an intramolecular isopeptide bond to assist colonization of the host cell. With the formation of the isopeptide bond, the CnaB2 domain becomes more tolerant to conformational, thermal and pH changes. Building upon this, SpyTag was obtained from CnaB2 by extracting the C-terminal beta strand containing the reactive aspartic acid at D556 and leaving the rest of the beta strands containing the reactive lysine K470 and the catalytic glutamic acid at E516 to become SpyCatcher, after further engineering to remove some hydrophobic surface residues. The resulting SpyTag/SpyCatcher can react to form the isopeptide bond with a second-order rate constant of 1.4 ¬± 0.4 √ó 103 M‚àí1 s‚àí1. It is postulated that the reaction mechanism proceeds by a nucleophilic attack of D556 from K470, mediated by E516. By reconstituting SpyTag:SpyCatcher, the resulting conjugated complex acquires the stability of the parent CnaB2 domain. A second generation SpyTag/SpyCatcher called SpyTag002/SpyCatcher002 was then created through phage display that enables the peptide-protein pair to react up to 12 times faster than the original pair, at a rate constant of 2.0 ¬± 0.2 √ó 104 M‚àí1 s‚àí1. The second generation SpyCatcher002 also has abolished self-reactivity that is present with SpyCatcher. A third generation SpyTag/SpyCatcher called SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003 has now also been created through rational design. This reacts up to 400 fold faster than the original pair with a rate constant of 5.5 ¬± 0.6 √ó 105 M‚àí1 s‚àí1. This version is back reactive with the two previous generations of SpyTag/SpyCatcher reagents and reacts. SpyTag/SpyCatcher react with high specificity even when in the presence of bacterial and mammalian cell environments.  Applications  Because of the specificity, irreversible covalent linkage and ease of use, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation system has seen many different applications.  Vaccine production  By fusing either SpyTag or SpyCatcher to self- assembling molecules such as virus-like particles, antigens fused to the other pair can be decorated onto the molecule via the isopeptide bond formed. This enables fast production of vaccines as the central self-assembling molecule can be stocked up beforehand, whilst the antigen can be easily produced under optimal conditions to achieve proper protein folding.  Enzyme cyclization  Cyclization of enzymes by fusing the N- and C-termini of the protein helps elevate the stability of the enzyme against heat. By having SpyTag and SpyCatcher together in the enzyme at the termini, the enzyme will undergo spontaneous cyclization by forming the isopeptide bond. Cyclized beta- lactamase, phytase, firefly luciferase, and xylanase (to name a few) have shown retained enzyme activity even after being subjected to heat at 100 ¬∞C.  Protein hydrogels  Hydrogels have had a wide-range of applications in biomedical sciences. One commonly used type of hydrogel starting material are the elastin-like polypeptides. SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry has been used to produce tailored molecular networks (‚Äúnetworks of spies‚Äù) within these hydrogels that enable the encapsulation of living mammalian cells such as fibroblasts. Subsequent modifications have enabled photo-responsive hydrogel formation, user-defined control over cell-material interactions, combined hyaluronan-elastin-like polypeptides, as well creating protein scaffolds for enzyme flow biocatalysis.  Expanded Tag/Catcher pairs  Before the development of SpyTag/SpyCatcher, the pair Isopeptag/Pilin-C was created from protein Spy0128 of Streptococcus pyogenes. Following SpyTag/SpyCatcher, the fully orthogonal pair SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher was developed from the RrgA protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae that has no cross-reactivity with SpyTag/SpyCatcher. Note that SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher forms an isopeptide bond between a Lys-Asn instead of Lys-Asp found in SpyTag/SpyCatcher. The pair SdyTag/SdyCatcher was also developed in the same year from Streptococcus dysgalactiae fibronectin-binding protein CnaB domain, but since the protein has sequence similarity to the parent protein where SpyTag/SpyCatcher is derived from, this Tag/Catcher pair has cross-reactivity with the latter pair. Rather than finding homologous proteins from different species, a new Tag/Catcher pair was developed from SpyTag/SpyCatcher with minimal mutations. SpyTag I3W (AW) reacts with SpyCatcher F77V, F94A (BVA) but minimally with SpyCatcher, whereas SpyCatcher F77V, F94A can react with both SpyTag I3W and SpyTag. However, the cross-reactivity of SpyCatcher F77V, F94A with both SpyTag versions may limit its utility as a new Tag/Catcher pair. A different chemistry can be exploited for protein ligation: the discovery of an intramolecular ester bond formation in Clostridium perfringens cell-surface adhesin protein Cpe0147 led to the development of another Tag/Catcher pair with Cpe0147565‚Äì587 as the Tag and Cpe0147439‚Äì563 as the Catcher. The ester bond formed between Thr-Gln is irreversible, however by mutating the Thr to Ser, the Ser-Gln ester bond is reversible with a change of pH.  Spy&Go; affinity purification  Mutation of the catalytic glutamic acid residue (E77) in SpyCatcher to alanine stops isopeptide bond formation but does not prevent the initial non-covalent SpyTag/SpyCatcher association. This non-covalent SpyTag/SpyCatcher interaction has been utilized in the affinity purification of SpyTag-fused recombinant proteins. In this purification strategy, termed Spy&Go;, resin-immobilized SpyCatcher is used to harvest SpyTag-fused proteins from cell culture supernatants or cell lysates. Non-specifically bound proteins are removed by washing the resin with a neutral buffer and the target protein eluted at neutral pH using high imidazole concentration. The Spy&Go; affinity resin is based on SpyCatcher2.1 E77A S49C variant termed SpyDock. SpyDock can be expressed in E. coli as soluble protein, purified using Ni-NTA and anion-exchange resins and immobilized to iodoacetyl-activated agarose through the unpaired cysteine introduced by the S49C substitution. In neutral buffers with physiological salt concentration SpyDock binds to SpyTag- and SpyTag002-fused proteins with affinity in the high nanomolar range (Kd = 750 ¬± 50 nM for SpyTag, Kd = 73 ¬± 13 nM for SpyTag002). Affinity to SpyTag003 has not been reported, but requires harsher conditions to ensure full dissociation suggesting it binds tighter. SpyDock-bound proteins are eluted by incubating the resin with 2.5 M imidazole in neutral buffer. The SpyDock resin can be regenerated several times using consecutive washes with 4 M imidazole, 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride and 0.1 M NaOH. Spy&Go; purification of proteins with either N-terminal, internal or C-terminal SpyTag have all been reported. SpyDock resin is compatible with all SpyTag generations (SpyTag, SpyTag002, SpyTag003) and it does not interfere with the later covalent conjugation of the purified proteins with SpyCatcher.

It has roots in Kumina and Jamaican Maroon religion. History According to research by J. W. Pullis the religion originated in the Portland Parish in Jamaica in the mid or late 1800s. It is believed to have a Central African origin in its beliefs and practices. Very little is known about the exact origins of the religion because of little research done on it. It can be deduced that the name of the religion comes from Christian teachings about \\"conviction\\" and the term \\"convince\\" began being used as a term for Myal spirit possession in the Native Baptist Church. Around 1861 many church members split into different camps with the more African oriented splitting off to form the Convince practice. Beliefs and practices Convince belief rests on the idea that humans and spirits are part of one universe where they interact and influence each other's behavior. Many spirits are deceased members of the cult. No spirit is totally good or totally evil. The spirit's will becomes friendly if it is worshiped, unfriendly if it is neglected, and evil if it is summoned to do evil. Religious practices are decentralized and have no authoritative hierarchy. The only structure of the religion is the collection of \\"bongo men\\" that form ceremonies when all agree to converge. Bongo men act as mediums who commune with ancestral spirits. It is a non- textual religion that highlights ritual possession, ritual dancing and healing services. Its ceremonies usually involve the guidance of bongo-men to become possessed by the spirits of the dead. Unlike Kumina its practices are more centered on individual benefit rather than community benefit and some Christian hymns are incorporated.

She first married Charles Gerard, Viscount Brandon when she was fifteen. The marriage was not a success but divorce was difficult. She had two children with Richard Savage, 4th Earl Rivers before her marriage was ended in 1698. Whilst she waited for their divorce her husband became the Earl of Macclesfield so she was a countess when they parted. She was a rich countess as over ¬£12,000 was returned to her from before her marriage. Her children, Anne and Richard Savage had been kept a secret. She said that they died young, but years later the poet Richard Savage claimed to be her son. Countess Macclesfield was appointed as a Lady in Waiting to Princess Anne. Her second husband was Henry Brett. They had a daughter, Anna Margharetta, who was said to be a mistress of George I of Great Britain. However there is poor evidence for this. Colley Cibber is said to have submitted for her approval the text of his play, the \\"Careless Husband\\", which was first put on the boards in 1704 because he valued her opinion.
