It enjoys the reputation as being one of the most haunted houses in the Province. The 45,206 square metres of land that makes up the Cortijo estate is estimated to be worth almost 1.4 million euros. History The mansion was built in the 19th century by the influential Heredia family from M√°laga, one of Andalucia‚Äôs wealthiest families at the time. The building boasts 365 windows, one for each day of the year and was constructed as a cortijo as part of a plan to convert the farm into a grand agricultural enterprise. In 1925, the property passed to its new owners, the Jurado family. It is known in M√°laga as ‚Äòthe haunted mansion‚Äô, not only for its ghostly appearance, but due to numerous reports of mysterious voices and strange sounds that have been reportedly heard there without explanation. It is among the best known ‚Äòhaunted‚Äô buildings in Spain and is considered a sort of temple by followers of paranormal phenomena. Legend has it that the Heredia family, together with other rich families in the area, kidnapped young girls, aged between 18 and 21, and subjected them to sinister satanic rituals, involving rape and murder. The bodies of their victims are said to be buried deep within the property. Whilst it is true that many young girls did disappear during this period, nothing was ever proven to connect their disappearance to the Heredia family. Many say they used their money and influence to evade justice. Whatever the truth of the matter, paranormal enthusiasts maintain that the pain and suffering that took place within those grim walls has led to inexplicable ghostly phenomena.Haunted Mansion Up for Auction, The Euro Weekly News, Thurs May 7, 2009 Recent history In 2002, M√°laga Council approved a proposal submitted by the Mirador group to build a four-star hotel complex in the grounds of the Cortijo Jurado and to renovate the original building to provide a cultural edifice, open to the public. In December, 2004, the construction licence was issued and a high-profile event was arranged, during which M√°laga's Mayor, Francisco de la Torre, laid the symbolic foundation stone to inaugurate the commencement of the project. Four years later, not a single brick has been laid. Since then, the Mirador group has faced a number of lawsuits from clients to whom they sold properties which were never built.Hotel licence revoked at M√°laga haunted house, The Euro Weekly News, Mon July 04,2011 The courts froze the lands of the Cortijo to protect debts of over five million euros, most of which is owed to Promociones Pantie, from whom Mirador secured the mortgage for this property. M√°laga Council is also owed 365,000 euros by the Mirador group.El propietario del Grupo Mirador ser√° juzgado por ocultar sus bienes (Spanish), El Mundo, 27 September 2009 M√°laga Council then contentiously extended the building licence for the original project when it expired in December 2008. In February 2009, opposition councillor, Antonio Serrano, of the ‚ÄòUnited Left‚Äô, lodged an official complaint accusing the town hall of bribery and abuse of power in relation to their dealings with the Mirador group. One of the main issues raised by Serrano was the fact that the town hall had waived the obligatory ten per cent fee for the building licence, which in this case was 900,000 euros. The town hall defended its position by claiming that the regulations had not come into force at the time the agreement was signed. In May 2009 a M√°laga judge ordered the troubled property group, Mirador, who own the property to sell it by public auction, on May 11, at the behest of one of the group's principal creditors, Promociones Pantie.Haunted Mansion Up for Auction, The Euro Weekly News, Thurs May 7, 2009 The auction did not go through due to an administrative error.Curse of Cortijo Jurado strikes again, The Euro Weekly News, Thurs May 21, 2009 References Category:Province of M√°laga Category:Houses in Spain Category:Buildings and structures in Andalusia ","title":"Cortijo Jurado"},{"id":"24689637","text":"Sir Joseph Ignatius Little (1835 14 July 1902) was a lawyer, politician, and judge in the Newfoundland Colony.

He graduated from Brown University in 1996 with a B.A. and received an MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1999. Doeringer is on the faculty at Manhattan's School of Visual Arts. \\"Bootleg\\" paintings Eric Doeringer's bootleg stand at the Geisai Art Fair in Miami in 2007 Eric Doeringer's \\"Bootlegs\\" are small copies of work by eminent contemporary artists including Richard Prince and Lisa Yuskavage. Doeringer reproduces the artworks using \\"collage, digital photography, paint and varnish\\". Doeringer can make between six and fifteen paintings each day and told The New York Times in a 2005 interview that his process is \\"like an assembly line\\". On Saturdays beginning in 2001, he set up a vending table in Chelsea, Manhattan on West 24th Street. Small canvases reproducing contemporary paintings lined the table. Paintings by the original artists (sold within a short walking distance from Doeringer's stand) cost tens of thousands of dollars, while Doeringer's copies sold for less than $100. His total profit in a day of selling paintings has sometimes reached $1500. Time Out stated that Doeringer is \\"famous for bootlegging art on the streets of New York\\". According to Doeringer, the majority of the artists he copies do not mind, while others have sent him cease-and-desist letters. Richard Prince was a \\"fan\\" of his work, while Takashi Murakami put a stop to his copies. Doeringer states that his work is fair use because he \\"culled the pictures from the public domain of the Internet\\". In 2005, Chelsea art dealer Mike Weiss called the police to remove Doeringer's Bootleg stand from 24th Street. Weiss told The New York Times that \\"he did so for reasons that might be condemned in the art world but that made perfect sense for any businessman like himself who has to pay a huge rent\\" and claimed Doeringer was \\"an opportunist and that he just wants his 15 minutes\\". In 2007, Doeringer sold his wares in the Geisai Art Fair in Miami. For the fair, he crafted 42-cent stamps decorated with pictures of celebrities. The stamps, which cost $1, were legally usable as postage and were decorated with photographs of eminent people in the art world. Over his booth, Doeringer placed orange and neon signs that proclaimed \\"Best Art Deals in Miami\\" and \\"Nothing Over $250!\\" The New York Sun deemed his decorations \\"a pitch-perfect metamockery of the art fair's commercialism\\". Conceptual art recreations In 2008, Doeringer began making larger, more faithful recreations of works of Conceptual art by artists like Sol LeWitt, Lawrence Weiner, Edward Ruscha, and On Kawara. New York magazine called a 2009 exhibition of Doeringer's Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings \\"perfectly executed\\" and \\"a genuine aesthetic experience, not just a knowing scold.\\" In 2011, Doeringer exhibited his work at Another Year in L.A.; he titled his exhibition \\"Eastern Standard Time\\". In one piece, Doeringer copied Charles Ray's 1973 avant-garde photograph panorama All My Clothes. Titled All My Clothes (After Charles Ray), Doeringer's photographs each contain himself standing in front of a white background attired in various clothes. In an interview with the LA Weekly, he said he adapted Ray's general ideas for the artwork, adding that the key distinction between their works is the \\"East Coast-West Coast divide\\". Whereas Ray's figure is garbed in a single winter outfit, Doeringer's wears much toastier clothing. Other pieces Doeringer copied and showcased at the Los Angeles exhibition were John Baldessari's Throwing Three Balls in the Air to Get a Straight Line, On Kawara's I Went, Richard Prince's Cowboy photographs, and several of Edward Ruscha's books. In 2012, The New York Times art critic Ken Johnson reviewed Doeringer's solo exhibition at the Mulherin + Pollard gallery titled \\"The Rematerialization of the Art Object\\". In the front room, Doeringer displayed \\"well-made simulations\\" of Damien Hirst's spot paintings and Richard Prince's Marlboro cowboy advertisements. In the back room, Doeringer presented imitations of three artists: Edward Ruscha (counterfeit books), Charles Ray (16 photographs of himself wearing various clothes in imitation of Ray's All My Clothes), and Andy Warhol (a film mimicking Warhol's Empire by recording the Empire State Building). Johnson wrote that Doeringer's \\"distinction is his focus not on canonical works of Modernism but on famous Conceptualist pieces that are themselves art about art\\". In 2013, the Toronto Stars Murray Whyte reviewed Doeringer's Survey, \\"a series of his exacting knock-offs of the late 20th century's greatest art hits\\". In addition to containing imitations of works by Damien Hirst, Richard Prince, and Andy Warhol, the exhibition also contained imitations of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings and Lawrence Weiner's spray paintings. Art critic Murray Whyte wrote that Doeringer is \\"less heretic than prophet, putting the towering genius of a previous generation to its own test\\". Art in Odd Places project During the 2008 Art in Odd Places, Doeringer's project \\"Free Books\\" involved planting cardboard boxes of free books in four different locations. He removed the final pages of each book to deny the readers from discovering the ending. The Daily Telegraph speculated about the broader meaning behind his removal of the final pages: Doeringer later wrote on his website that he appended his name to the \\"front of each book, as a type of signature\\", and altered the books to make them into \\"works of art\\". He noted that a reader could become annoyed his alterations instead of realizing their artistic worth. School of Visual Arts Doeringer lectures at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. He said in a November 2011 interview with the LA Weekly that enraged people from the audience have accosted him for creating bootleg copies of artists' works.

It was initially published by Gollancz on 16 October 2008. The novel was an Arthur C. Clarke Award Nominee in 2009. Summary The Quiet War is a space opera set in the 23rd Century. Some of the Earth's population has fled the planet due to war and catastrophic climate change. In the aftermath of climatic disaster and massive loss of life, humanity has consolidated into three superpowers that control the planet. The population that fled the planet initially colonized the Moon and Mars, but these colonies were destroyed by hostile forces from Earth. The pioneers‚Äîor \\"Outers\\" as they came to be known‚Äîeventually settled among Jupiter's moons Callisto, Europa, and Ganymede, and Saturn's moons Dione, Enceladus, and Mimas. The Outers have survived by using highly advanced genetic engineering and their pure determination for a free life. They have formed a loose form of democracy which over the course of centuries has been dominated by long-lived humans who still remember the events which caused them to flee Earth. The Earthly superpowers have struggled to rebuild the planet. The most powerful and aggressive superpower is Greater Brazil, a nation controlling both South America and the remains of North America. North America has been devastated by climate change, which caused the destruction of civilization there, with few cities left populated. Greater Brazil has taken over this desert continent and forced the population to live by their \\"green\\" politics whereby the population lives in cities while the open land is being restored to a pristine natural state. Greater Brazil is a corrupt state run by a handful of powerful families; it is anti-democratic and culturally conservative. It is semi-feudal; people who are not related to the ruling families by blood or marriage are essentially like medieval serfs. Greater Brazil is threatened by the very existence of the democratic and technologically dynamic Outer colonies, while at the same time greedy for the benefits of Outer technology. Genetic engineering is a particularly touchy subject for Greater Brazil, which interprets extensive \\"cutting\\", as they call it, to be against their green political and religious philosophies. For all of these reasons, Greater Brazil wishes to subdue the Outers and bring them under their control. The novel follows the lives of a small set of individuals, all of them from Greater Brazil, who become caught up in the events set in motion by Greater Brazil's designs for the Outer colonies. These central characters include an arrogant but brilliant \\"gene wizard\\"; a space fighter pilot to whom the gene wizard gives extraordinary powers; a cloned assassin designed by the gene wizard to infiltrate the Outers; a soil biologist who is recruited for a joint Earth-Outer goodwill project; and an unprincipled, ambitious weasel of a man who does his superiors' dirty work. The events of the novel were followed up in 2009 with McAuley's Gardens of the Sun. Critical notes Eric Brown of The Guardian noted \\"Few writers conjure futures as convincingly as McAuley: his latest novel deftly combines bold characterisation, a thorough understanding of political complexity, and excellent science - in this case the biology of terraforming. It's the 23rd century and humanity has split into two competing blocs: the citizens of Earth, ruled by a few powerful families, and the Outers, the descendants of dissidents who fled the repressive regimes of Earth and settled on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. After a slow start, the novel picks up pace to present a future that is wondrous yet marred by human frailty\\". Abigail Nussbaum of Strange Horizons wrote \\"between the flatness of its narrative and the predictability of its characters, there's not much to feel passionate about in The Quiet War, and for the first part in a series this may be a fatal flaw. The novel is undercut by not amounting to a single story‚Äîit ends as the war ends, but with the solar system still in turmoil, the political situation and ultimate disposition of Earth and the Outer colonies still unclear, and our characters hanging in limbo. On the other hand, the novel's ending isn't nearly open-ended enough to create the suspense that'll whet its readers' appetite for the next installment, and since the story itself is not much more than enjoyable, I for one don't feel any compulsion to read the next chapter. \\".

The Peak Lookout is a restaurant located in a heritage house at Victoria Gap, near the summit of Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. It is housed in a 19th-century Grade II Historic Building. Originally known as the Old Peak Caf√©, the restaurant has an open terrace overlooking Aberdeen, Pok Fu Lam Country Park and the South China Sea. The Peak Lookout at Terminal 1 of the Hong Kong International Airport opened in November 2012.  History  The Peak Lookout has experienced major transformations in function and renovations since the site was used in 1888 as a rest place and workshop for British engineers that constructed the Peak Tram line.Brief Information 1444 Historic Buildings, Item #222. In 1901, the site was handed over to the government and built into a chair shelter and rest place for sedan chair carriers for both public and private sedan chairs (similar to taxis and chauffeurs today).Peak Caf√©, Heritage Trails. An 1898 official report stated: \\"A suitable area is being leveled for the accommodation of chairs and it is proposed to erect a permanent structure on this site as a shelter for chairs and bearers.\\" Shortly afterwards, it was reported that: \\"The masonry is completed and the roof is on, so that the coolies can even now shelter from the weather. The building being in an exposed position is built in a very solid and massive way to defy typhoons.\\" In 1902 it was reported that the building had been fully completed: \\"It is divided into two sections, one of which is for the accommodation of public chairs,whilst the other is for private chairs. The former is entirely enclosed, large sliding doors being provided along the front, whilst the latter is left open in front. The Walls are of the blue stone obtainable in the neighbourhood, with granite dressings, and the floors are laid with cement concrete, the roofs being tiled in the usual way. A space is left in front of the shed, clear of the road, on which the chairs can stand during fine weather.\\" It has been suggested that the stone for the building may have been left over from the construction of the Governor's Peak residence, Mountain Lodge, which has now been demolished. It was opened to the public in 1923 when sedan chair carriers were allowed to serve for tourists at the Peak.Â±±È†ÇÈ§êÂª≥.

The catering history began in 1947 when it was suggested that the building should be converted into an open-air caf√©, serving light refreshments. \\"Since that date,\\" wrote an official of the Peak Tram in 1977, \\"the building has been used as a caf√©. Subsequently the arches of the building were fitted with wood and glass doors and, at a latter date, wooden flooring was laid on top of the original concrete floor. Other than these minor modifications, the building stands as it was originally built.\\" The increasing popularity of the Peak area led to a proposal in 1973 to demolish The Peak Lookout building to make way for a car park. The resulting outcry and public petition ensured that this plan was scrapped. The Old Peak Caf√© was given Grade II Historic Building status as a historic building in Hong Kong by the Antiquities and Monuments Office in 1981.List of the Historic Buildings in Building Assessment (as of 18 March 2009), p.14 .

As the 1973 petition was approved, the company Freedragon Ltd. won the bid for the rental contract from the government to continue running the caf√© business when the caf√©'s rental contract expired in 1989.

Most recently in October 2012, The Peak Lookout reopened its doors following a redesign, which includes the introduction of a contemporary raised outdoor terrace for al fresco dining.  Architecture  Originally, the architecture of The Peak Lookout was largely in the Arts and Crafts style, which was popular in late-Victorian and Edwardian times. However, due to numerous renovations and other alterations throughout the years, The Peak Lookout now has a considerably different appearance to when it was originally used as a chair shelter. For example, the roof tiles have been replaced by Chinese ones.Brief Information on Proposed Grade 2 Items, Item#222 . It is a single-storey building with a red, pitched roof, reminiscent of an English country cottage. Adding to this impression are the stone walls, arched windows, black and white half-timbering on the gable, and the visible chimney stack. The building's garden surrounds are notable for the old boundary wall, and a wide variety of trees, shrubs and flowers complete the austere, rural appearance. The inside of the restaurant is dimly lit and decorated with old photographs of life on the Peak several generations ago. Most of the earlier interior ambiance has been retained. The Peak Lookout is one of few remaining examples of Arts and Crafts architecture in Hong Kong, and many people feel that it has become an irremovable part of its surroundings. The restaurant continues to attract local patrons from Hong Kong and visitors from across the globe. Due to its unique historical background, fine food and stunning views, The Peak Lookout is a popular venue for hosting weddings and private events.

History The first known monumental clock made in the United States was the Engle Monumental Clock. The clock was made entirely by clock designer Stephen Decatur Engle in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. It took Engle 20 years to complete the construction of this clock which was finished in 1878. Wanting to display the clock rather than turning a profit, he turned the clock over to two Philadelphia entrepreneurs who marketed the clock as \\"The Eighth Wonder of the World.\\" They toured the clock throughout the Eastern United States, charging 15‚Äì25 cents to view it. It continued to tour across the Eastern United States for 70 years before disappearing in 1951. The clock is currently at the National Clock and Watch Museum. Features The Engle Monumental Clock measures 11' high, 8' wide, and 3' deep and contains three towers. \\"Among its mechanical features are two organ movements, 48 moving figures, and a new type of tellurian (patented by Engle) that illustrates the positions of the moon, constellations, and zodiac relative to the rotating earth.\\" The clock also indicates the day of the week, current month, the phase of the moon, and even the current tides. The clock's first promoter was so convinced of its \\"technical complexity\\" that he offered a reward of $50,000 to anyone who found a clock that did \\"more and worked better.\\" The clock used a number of moving figures including Jesus Christ, the twelve Apostles, the three Marys, Satan, Father Time, the three Ages of Man, Death, Justice, Orpheus, and Linus. Stephen Engle placed an image of himself representing \\"Middle Age\\" as his signature of the clock's maker. On the hour, a skeleton representing Death strikes a bone against a skull attached to the column of the clock. At 15, 30, and 45 minutes past the hour, Father Time strikes a bell with a scythe and turns his sandglass while the central figures of Youth, Middle Age, and Old Age revolve in the arch above the clock dial. At 40 minutes past the hour, a group of revolutionary soldiers appear from the clock while a barrel organ plays \\"patriotic tunes\\". At 55 minutes past the hour, the three Marys come out of the center tower as a procession of the Apostles takes place accompanied by hymns.

King Law Ka Shuk is a Hong Kong historical building situated in Tai Po Tau Tsuen, north of Tai Po in the New Territories. In the past, it was used as an ancestral hall to hold meetings and traditional functions in the village and it is now in full use as a local meeting place. The building was named after Tang King Law, who was one of the ancestors of Tang's Family (or Tang Clan). It occupies a total area of . It was declared as a monument, under the full legal protection of the Hong Kong SAR Government, on 21July 1998.Environment Protection Department - List of Declared Monuments as on 1 January 1999 The temple was constructed in the early 18th century. Apart from being an ancestral hall for people to show respect to their ancestors and hold clan meetings, it was also a study hall for the Tang clans, who were taught with a Chinese traditional teaching method known as Bok Bok Chai. There were a maximum of 40 students at one time and the building was once the premises of Kai Chi School, which was subsequently relocated in 1953. However, as the Hong Kong Government later implemented an education programme in 1948, the building lost its function of being a study hall. It then solely served as a venue for traditional festive functions and village meetings.  Nomenclature  A lantern with the Chinese word 'Tang' on it inside the temple. King Law Ka Shuk was named after the 10th generation ancestor Tang King Law, who was respected as the first generation of Lau Kwong Tong of the Tang Clan in Tai Po Tau.  History  The exact year of construction of the temple cannot be ascertained, but it is believed to have been constructed in the early 18th century. According to local villagers, the ancestral hall was built by Tang Yuen-wang, Tang Mui-kei and Tang Nim-fung of the 13th generation in the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). Descendants of the local Tang clan originated from Jiangxi Province in mainland China and moved to settle in Kam Tin, and later branching out into Lung Yeuk Tau, Ha Tsuen, Tai Po and Ping Shan amongst other areas. A branch of the Tang Yuen-leung lineage settled in Tai Po Tau in the 13th century and founded the walled village, Shui Wai where batteries were erected at four corners of the village while houses were built in an orderly fashion. Due to the construction of the Kowloon-Canton Railway at the beginning of the 20th century, the village was separated into Shui Wai and Tai Po Tau. A three- story watchtower was built in Tai Po Tau for defensive purposes, however, it was demolished in the 1980s. Apart from being a place for ancestral worship, it was used as a shuk (study hall) for preparing clan members for important imperial examinations. For some time, it was used as the premises of Kai Chi School which was subsequently relocated in 1953. Now, it is a venue for holding clan meetings and traditional festival functions.  Design  There are three halls and two courtyards at King Law Ka Shuk, which is a traditional Chinese building with a functional design and elegant ornamental features. Geometric plaster mouldings can be found on the roof ridges and wall friezes while for the internal eave boards, patterns of leafy and motifs are used. To support the roof, there are two drum terraces, each having two granite columns, in the front of the study hall. An altar with six levels, which is intricately carved, can be found in the main chamber of the study hall. It was made in Guangzhou in 1932 to place the soul tablets of the ancestors from Yuen-leung to King-law. There is a slab above the main entrance, which is moulded with the four Chinese characters denoting \\"King Law Ka Shuk\\". The characters were written by well-known calligraphist Tang Yi-nga, who was the son of one of the descendants of the Tang lineage of Dongguan, Tang Yung-Kang. Tang Yung-Kang is also noted for being the Hanlin Yuan Shue Kat Sz (Imperial examination scholar) in the tenth year of the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor (1871) during the Qing dynasty. Restoration Restoration work commenced on 3November 1998 and was completed in January 2001. This construction work was funded by the HKSAR Government, monitored by the Antiquities and Monuments Office of the Leisure and Culture Services Department and carried out by the Architectural Service Department. Other participants included professional conservators from Hong Kong, mainland China and the UK, as well as the villagers from Tai Po Tau Tsuen. In September 1998, before initiating the restoration of the building, in order to ensure that King Law Ka Shuk was properly documented and to allow better understanding of the construction methods, design, materials used and the functions of the building, the Antiquities and Monuments Office commissioned the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology to conduct a detailed cartographic survey and record about the history of the building, also to produce a conservation plan about the restoration. The experts took one month's time to complete the on-site cartographic survey. After that, they produced a full set of measured drawings and plans for the restoration of the building, which include a site plan, floor plans, elevations, sections, roof plans and details like the altar, doors and windows of the study hall. The major objectives of the restoration were not only to fully repair the building, but also to restore it into an architectural style of the Qing Dynasty to the greatest extent, in which dynasty it was firstly built. Some improvement works like re-laying the front courtyard as well as the provision of lighting and power supply for some night time functions or celebrations were also conducted. In order to successfully restore the building into its original appearance, modern materials like cement and steel were removed. However, for reminiscence, two original parapets and the ancestral altar were preserved. Additionally, the murals on the facade, the altar, the woodcarvings and name boards, for example, were all restored by a group of specialist conservators. In addition, the altar, which was specially ordered from Guangzhou by the Tang clan during the restoration in 1932, is the most dedicate relic in the ancestral hall. Dr. John Hurd from the United Kingdom was commissioned by the Antiquities and Monuments Office to help restore the altar and other relics. The altar was re-gilded and brought back to its original splendour. Other relics were also carefully restored by him and his team. Among the rituals of restoration of traditional Chinese buildings, the raising of the ridge purlin, the main roof support beam, is the most significant. During the restoration, the ridge purlin raising ceremony took place on 3June 1999 and was attended by all senior members of the clan.

The selection panel believed that this restored building was representative of the application of best practice renovation methodology. Furthermore, the building demonstrates the value of restoration and conservation of a historic building for community use, for instance, up to the present day, the ancestral hall is the exclusive venue for clan meetings and the celebration of traditional festivals.

It appeared in the June 26, 1978 issue of The New Yorker. Plot summary The story is a to-do list and a how-to-do list containing one sentence of a 650 word dialogue. It features what the girl hears from her mother. The story is mostly told in the second person. The girl hears her mother's instructions and the behavior her mother is trying to instill in her. It is apparent that the mother is trying to give the girl some sort of advice and prescribing the way she should go about her life and daily tasks. One may infer that her mother probably got this language from someone in her past and it was most likely the way her mother spoke to her when she was a young girl, so that's all she's ever known. During the story, her mother's voice sounds somewhat condescending and critical when speaking, suggesting that the girl is likely to become a \\"slut.\\" For example, in the short story, the mother states, \\"on Sundays try to walk like a lady and not like the slut you are so bent on becoming.\\" Throughout the piece the mother tries to pass down certain beliefs from her culture to her daughter. The mother constantly reminds her daughter of how to become the \\"perfect\\" woman in order to fit into the society that they live in. Also, the chores and behaviors that the mother makes the daughter inhabit are directly related to how women's duties should relate to a man's. Like most of Kincaid's piece of writing, \\"Girl\\" is based on her own relationship between her and her mother while growing up. Jamaica Kincaid has also revealed in interviews that the setting of this short story takes place in Antigua. Structure The theme for \\"Girl\\" is mother-daughter dispute. In this story, the mother goes on and on teaching the daughter how to be the perfect woman in society. As the story goes on, the mother‚Äôs directions get more demanding. Whenever the daughter says something, which is rare, it‚Äôs a snap back at her mother.

Scientific American summarized a main finding of his work, \\"The ability to rebound remains the norm throughout adult life.\\" Contributions to the field Bonanno's contributions to the field, summarized in his book, \\"The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss,\\" include the following: * The idea that resilience is the most common, natural reaction to loss or trauma. * Introducing rigorous scientific methods of research to the field of bereavement and trauma; * Describing for the first time a natural resilience as the main component of grief and trauma reactions in people who face major losses, such as the death of a spouse, the loss of a child, having suffered sexual abuse as a child, or losing a loved one in severe stressor events, such as the September 11 World Trade Center attacks; * Replacing with scientific findings the major concepts of grief that are theoretical, unsupported scientifically, but remain popular among practitioners and the lay public today, such as K√ºbler-Ross model of the stages of grief and the idea of grief work based on Freud's ideas;http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2006/01/09/some_comfort_for_the_grieving_theres_no_wrong_way_to_do_it/ Boston Globe Business Day Article: Some comfort for the grieving: There's no wrong way to do it * Demonstrating scientifically that some practices common in grief counseling, trauma counseling, and among therapists after potentially traumatic events can be harmful. These practices include asking people to talk about a loss or to cry about a loss. These practices are common parts of public policy and are based on the underlying assumption that people are not resilient; * Showing that genuine laughter and smiling is a healthy response to a loss or stressor event; is protective; * The first and only researcher having obtained and used pre-loss data to understand the processes of grief; * Based on pre-loss data, outlining four trajectories of grief; * Demonstrating that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome, rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research; * Coining the phrase \\"coping ugly\\" to describe the idea that coping with grief takes many forms, some of which seem counter intuitive. * Because resilience is natural, suggesting that it cannot be \\"taught\\" through specialized programs and that there is virtually no existing research to design resilience training nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs; Resilience Bonanno's research found psychological resilience to be at the core of human grief and trauma reactions. Bonanno's finding of resilience overturns what has been the status quo assumption of a person's experience of grief and trauma in the West since Sigmund Freud nearly a century ago. Bonanno's contribution to the field is to have found resilience through rigorous research and not through anecdotal evidence, theorizing, or simple but unreliable methodology. Many in the field of bereavement have found Bonanno's finding of persistent resilience in the face of potentially traumatic events controversial. Many therapists and psychiatrists, who tend to treat the chronically affected, find it hard to imagine that no treatment is needed for most people who have experienced a loss or even an extreme stressor event, such as during 9/11 or childhood sexual abuse. Further, in contrast to Freud's and his followers' ideas and prevailing popular theories, it is difficult for many people to accept laughter as a healthy response. Another difficult concept, especially in the face a potentially traumatic event when people feel pulled to help in some way, is to realize that offering treatment to otherwise well people can cause harm, by producing the symptoms they hope to avoid. Other critics have claimed the opposite, that far from being misguided, the idea that humans are resilient is so obvious that it is simplistic. Others have countered that it may seem simple, but the idea has escaped researchers for the century between Freud's work and Bonanno's. Policy and treatment for the past century has relied on the false idea that humans are not resilient, a costly mistake in human and monetary terms. That people are resilient even when facing extreme stressors or losses contradicts the stages model of grief. Many resilient people show no grief. They therefore have no stages of grief to pass through. Until Bonanno, therapists and psychiatrists considered the absence of grief a pathology to be feared, rather than a healthy outcome.http://health.discovery.com/centers/mental/articles/qa/bonnano.html Resilience has profound implications for people's concepts of themselves, especially after suffering a severe stressor event. The idea also has important implication for how the therapeutic community thinks of bereavement and treats bereavement. Bonanno's research has shown that universal counseling by grief counselors after potentially traumatic events does more harm than good. Resilience being an inherent part of human experience after major stressor events also may have important implications for public policy, such as how to best treat veterans who have served in war situations and whether to counsel large populations after major stressor events, such as tsunamis or mass shootings. Four trajectories of grief and trauma reactions In 2002 and 2004, Bonanno described the four most common trajectories of grief or potential trauma.Bonanno, G. A., Wortman, C. B., Lehman, D. R., Tweed, R. G., Haring, M., Sonnega, J., Carr, D., & Neese, R. M. (2002). Resilience to loss and chronic grief: A prospective study from pre-loss to 18 months post-loss. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83. 1150‚Äì1164.Bonanno, G. A. (2004).* Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely adverse events? American Psychologist, 59, 20-28. This research was based on longitudinal data beginning prior to the loss. In subsequent studies, Bonanno and colleagues identified the same trajectories following other potentially traumatic events, such as the September 11 terrorist attack in New YorkBonanno, G. A., Rennicke, C., & Dekel, S. (2005). Self-Enhancement among high-exposure survivors of the September 11th terrorist attack: Resilience or social maladjustment? Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 88, 984-998. and the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong.Bonanno, G. A., Ho, S.M.Y., Chan, J.C.K, Kwong, R.S.Y., Cheung, C.K.Y., Wong, C.P.Y., & Wong, V.C.W. (2008).Psychological resilience and dysfunction among hospitalized survivors of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong: A latent class approach. Health Psychology, 27, 659-667. Contrary to common assumptions about loss and trauma, Bonanno's research may indicate that resilience is the most common pattern and that delayed reactions are rare. The four trajectories and the percentages of people who tend to fall into each category are summarized and expanded upon in his book, The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss. The book also includes graphs of the trajectories. The four trajectories are as follows: ; Resilience: \\"The ability of adults in otherwise normal circumstances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event, such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life-threatening situation, to maintain relatively stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning\\" as well as \\"the capacity for generative experiences and positive emotions.\\" ; Recovery: When \\"normal functioning temporarily gives way to threshold or sub-threshold psychopathology (e.g., symptoms of depression or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)), usually for a period of at least several months, and then gradually returns to pre-event levels.\\" ; Chronic dysfunction: Prolonged suffering and inability to function, usually lasting several years or longer. ; Delayed grief or trauma: When adjustment seems normal but then distress and symptoms increase months later. Researchers have not found evidence of delayed grief, but delayed trauma appears to be a genuine phenomenon. Coping ugly Bonanno coined the phrase \\"coping ugly\\" to describe his finding that grief and coping with grief take many forms. Behaviors that may not be healthy ordinarily may be helpful in times of stress, such as self-serving biases.Bonanno, G. A., & Mancini, A. D. (2008). The human capacity to thrive in the face of extreme adversity. Pediatrics, 121, 369-375. Scientific study of grief Before Bonanno's work, a prevailing idea was that grief cannot be quantified or studied in a scientifically meaningful way. Bonanno forcefully argued early that scientific study of grief was possible. The attitude of the field before Bonanno could be summarized by Tom Golden, a prominent bereavement expert who specializes in male grief. He said in 1997, \\"People who are grieving think that researchers are full of crap‚Äîand part of me says, I‚Äôm with you. We don‚Äôt have the tools to measure it yet, there‚Äôs no grieve-o-meter. We need to develop a sense of not knowing.\\" \\"I think that‚Äôs a ridiculous statement,\\" Bonanno said, heatedly, in 1997 in response to Tom Golden's remark. \\"You can measure grief. People want to take a magical, mystical perspective, but it‚Äôs very dangerous to assume that they have access to a sacred realm that research can't touch, relying only on their own observations, feelings, and thoughts‚Äîthings that are very unreliable.\\" This sort of clinical criticism, he argued, is the result of a simplistic attachment to individual patients' life stories. \\"The criticism I most often hear is, 'Your research is very bad, because I have a patient who feels such and such.' Well, I‚Äôve studied hundreds of people.\\" Research methodology Bonanno conducted multi-cultural research into grief and trauma, including studies in Nanjing, China; among war survivors in Bosnia- Herzegovina; and in Israel. He has done multi-dimensional studies of emotion regulation, stressful life events, resilience, and adjustment among college students; a study of emotion and well-being among survivors of childhood sexual abuse (in collaboration with researchers at NIH); and several recent studies of resilience and adjustment in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks in New York City (funded by the National Science Foundation).http://www.tc.columbia.edu/news/article.htm?id=5893 Press Release by Teachers College, Columbia University The fields of bereavement and trauma research rely often on simple measures, such as self-report questionnaires. Self-report measures are simple and inexpensive to give, but are unreliable for several reasons. Of concern to the fields of grief and trauma, self-report measures are biased by how the subject feels at the moment he or she answers the questionnaire. If the subject feels bad at the time of answering the questionnaire, the subject will remember the loss as more devastating. If the subject feels good when taking the questionnaire, the subject will report that the loss was less difficult to endure. This subjectivity can change rapidly. Recognizing that any single simple measure cannot be accurate, one hallmark of Bonanno's research methodology has relied on several independent measures simultaneously. This ensures convergent validity of any findings. For example, his research studies often simultaneously use, among other measures, skin temperature, heart rate, the Facial Action Coding System or \\"FACS\\" pioneered by Paul Ekman, empty chair studies, longitudinal measures over months or years, cortisol, physician and friend reports, and Stroop tests. In addition, he is known for developing new research techniques, such as a measure of ambivalence and the \\"empty chair\\" study with researcher Nigel Field. Criticism James W. Pennebaker's findings, very well supported by data, directly contradict Bonanno's claims on the harmful effects of retrieving bad experiences. One possible explanation and attempt to reconcile this seeming contradiction is the method for retrieving or reviewing bad memories. Pennabaker is known for his pioneering work in writing therapy. It may be that there's something about writing, rather than expressively crying in public, for one example, that helps rather than hurts a person's outcome. Writing may help preserve social bonds, which are crucial to maintain for good outcomes after a loss. Personal life George Bonanno lives in New York, NY with his wife, Paulette Roberts, and their two children.

For a period of over 7000 years, humans have inhabited the Galveston Bay Area in what is now the United States. Through their history the communities in the region have been influenced by the once competing sister cities of Houston and Galveston, but still have their own distinct history. Though never truly a single, unified community, the histories of the Bay Area communities have had many common threads. Prior to European settlement the area around Galveston Bay was settled by the Karankawa and Atakapan tribes, who lived throughout the Gulf coast region. Spanish and French explorers traveled the area for many years gradually establishing trade with the local natives. In the early 19th century the pirate Jean Lafitte created a small, short-lived empire around the bay ruled from his base on Galveston Island before his being ousted by the United States Navy. Following Mexico's independence from Spain, the new nation established long-term settlements, including Anahuac and San Jacinto, around the bay. Early rebellions by the settlers against Mexican rule occurred in the region and it was later the site of the victory of the Texas army over the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution. Following Texas' independence from Mexico and its annexation by the United States, economic growth was centered initially on agriculture and cattle ranching. Commerce grew between Galveston, Harrisburg and Houston in the later 19th century, and created additional economic opportunities as railroads were built through the Bay Area to connect these and other commercial centers. In the early 20th century, the region gave birth to some of the state's earliest oil fields and refineries as the Texas Oil Boom took hold. Refining and manufacturing grew rapidly in the area, particularly around Baytown, Pasadena, and Texas City. The opening of the Port of Texas City, and later Barbours Cut and Bayport, gradually established the region as an important shipping center. As wealth increased in southeast Texas, resorts and other tourist draws developed in the Bay Area. During the 1960s the area became home of the Johnson Space Center, headquarters for the nation's manned space program, which helped diversify the regional economy and began the development of an aerospace industry, and later other high-tech industries. Early history Sauvage en habit d'hiver by Alexandre De Batz, 1735. The present geography of the Gulf Coast was formed during an ice age approximately 30,000 years ago when dramatic lowering of the sea level occurred. As the ice later melted, it formed a flow through the Trinity and San Jacinto rivers and carved wide valleys in the soft sediments, resulting in the creation of the modern system of bays and lakes approximately 4,500 years ago. Humans first entered the region as early as 10,000 years ago following migrations into the Americas from Asia during the ice age. Research has indicated that the first settlements around Galveston Bay may have been constructed around 5500 BCE. The first ceramics appeared around 100 CE, and arrow points around 650 CE. When Europeans first entered the region there were still significant numbers of Native Americans living there. Texas State Historical Association. Texas State Historical Association. Along the southern coast around the Colorado River and Matagorda Bay and up toward Galveston Bay lived the Capoque tribe, a branch of the Karankawa people. The northeast was inhabited by the Akokisa, or Han, tribe as part of the Atakapan people's homelands. The Karankawa were migratory hunter-gatherers. Their diet included deer, bison, peccary, and bears, in addition to fish, oysters, nuts, and berries as they were available. They used portable huts for shelter. Dugout canoes were used to travel the many internal waterways and the coast, an advantage that initially gave them tactical superiority over the Europeans. The Akokisa in the area were similarly hunter-gatherers, and utilized canoes for transport. They became well-known among the Europeans for their hide-tanning abilities, especially for bear hide. During the 18th century the Akokisa population in the area was estimated at about 3,500. Though earlier surveys of the coastline had been made, the first known Europeans to land in the vicinity were under the command of Spanish explorer √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca when he and his crew were shipwrecked in 1528, though it is unclear precisely where they landed. Though subsequent explorers described cannibalism among the local tribes, Cabeza de Vaca made no mention of the practice. He and the other survivors left the area as soon as they were able traveling to safety into Mexico. Texas State Historical Anonymous portrait claimed to be of Jean Lafitte in the early 19th century, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Texas. The Rivas-Iriarte expedition, one of several Spanish maritime expeditions charting the Gulf Coast, performed a detailed scientific exploration of the Galveston Bay in 1687, probably the first such exploration. Texas State Historical Association A 1785 expedition by Jos√© Antonio de Evia charting the Gulf Coast gave the bay and the island the name Galveztown, or Galvezton, for the Spanish Viceroy Bernardo de G√°lvez. Texas State Historical Association During the early 18th Century, French traders first began trade with the Akokisa and the nearby Bidai tribes for furs. In 1754 several traders including Joseph Blancpain established a trading post on the Trinity River a just north of the bay, near modern Wallisville. Spanish authorities quickly seized the post and transformed it into the San August√≠n de Ahumada fort. They named the site El Orcoquisac and established a Catholic mission. The Spanish were not successful in maintaining trade with the natives and the post was abandoned within a few years. Encroachment by Spanish as well as U.S. settlers continued such that by the end of the century native populations had declined dramatically due to disease and territorial pressures from the Europeans. In 1816 Galveston Island was claimed by the pirate Louis-Michel Aury as a base of operations to support Mexico's rebellion against Spain. Aury was succeeded as leader by Jean Lafitte, the famed Louisiana pirate and American hero of the War of 1812. Lafitte, at the time serving as a privateer for the Spanish Empire, transformed Galveston Island and the bay into a pirate kingdom he called Campeche. He established bases for smuggling and ship repair on the Trinity River near the bay and at Eagle Point (modern San Leon). His gang also created a hide-out on the shores of Clear Lake. As late as 1965, treasure from this era was discovered at Kemah.Chang (2006), p. 187 Kearney (2008), p. 177 In response to the piracy, the United States Navy ousted Lafitte from the island in 1821 and the colony was abandoned. Texas State Historical Association. Some settlers in the region remained such as Anson Taylor who had supplied produce and game from the Clear Lake area for Campeche. Mexican dominion and the Republic of Texas The Battle of San Jacinto-1895 painting by Henry Arthur McArdle. In the early 19th century following the Louisiana Purchase, Texas, particularly southeastern Texas, had become an increasing point of contention between Spain and the United States. Various failed attempts, such as the Long Expedition, were made by groups from the U.S. to take control of parts of Texas, resulting in some temporary settlements near the bay including Perry's Point near modern Anahuac. Texas State Historical Association. Texas State Historical Association. Spanish authorities began efforts to colonize Texas to help protect its claim to the territory. Hoping to spur settlement, the Spanish government granted land to pioneers from the United States, including Moses Austin. Texas State Historical Association. Soon afterward, though, Mexico declared its independence from Spain and moved to establish its own control over Texas. Because of fears of the indigenous tribes, officials found it difficult to find settlers in Mexico willing to move into the territory's coastal areas, and therefore continued to allow settlers from the United States into the area with the promise of allegiance to Mexico. Austin's son, Stephen F. Austin, established a colony which extended from east central Texas to Galveston Bay and the Gulf Coast. Some of Austin's original Old 300 settlers, including John Dickson, William Scott, and John Iiams, established homesteads and commercial enterprises around the bay. Texas Historical Association. Texas Historical Association. Texas Historical Association. The Port of Galveston and a permanent settlement were established on the island in 1825 to spur trade. Texas State Historical Association Communities including Lynchburg, San Jacinto, and Campbell's Bayou (founded by one of Lafitte's former officers) were gradually established around the bay. In addition to the Anglo-American and Mexican settlers in the area, a Cajun settlement was established along Armand Bayou. Texas State Historical Association. The Mexican Colonization Law of 1824, however, forbade the creation of settlements near the coast with the intention of protecting the native tribes in the area.Sage (2002), p. 27. Texas State Historical Association The law was not enforced and settlers continued to encroach upon tribal lands. Native tribes remained in the area years afterward but were gradually driven out as European settlers moved into the region. The Akokisa were driven inland where they merged with the Bidai. The Karankwa were driven southward where they eventually established their current homelands in northeastern Mexico. The Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company was formed in New York in 1830 to promote additional settlement around Galveston Bay and other parts of southeast Texas. Texas State Historical Association.Barker (1969), pp. 277‚Äì278. The company gradually brought in many colonists from the United States and Europe, although conflict with Mexican officials over colonization laws initially made these efforts difficult. In 1830, Mexican authorities created a customs and garrison post near the bay commanded by Juan Davis Bradburn.Rodr√≠guez (1997), p. 63‚Äì65. The post, which later became the modern city of Anahuac, was the first major outpost on the mainland shores and temporarily replaced Galveston as a port of entry.Sage (2002), p. 27‚Äì28. New Washington (modern Morgan's Point) and Austinia (within modern Texas City) were also founded by settlers from the company. Texas State Historical Association. Texas State Historical Association. Conflicts between Bradburn and the settlers in the region over land rights, slavery laws, and customs duties led to the Anahuac Disturbances, a prelude to the larger Texas rebellion. As a result, Mexican authorities were driven out of eastern Texas and the settlers began to discuss independence. Texas State Historical Association. Following a coup in the Mexican government, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna became president and revoked many freedoms previously enjoyed by the Texans further deteriorating the government's relations with the region's settlers. Texas State Historical Association. Texas declared its independence and revolted in 1835. Following a number of battles with the Mexican army, the Texas army, under the leadership of General Sam Houston, finally defeated Santa Anna in the Battle of San Jacinto, near modern Pasadena. Texas State Historical Association. The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly. The shores of the bay were initially home to farms and ranches. Longhorn cattle, which had roamed wild throughout Texas, became free resources for producing hides and beef shipped throughout North America. The famed Allen Ranch was established near Harrisburg in what is now southeast Houston and Pasadena, in addition to the Bay Lake Ranch and other ranches established around the bay. Texas State Historical Association The range land of these ranches came to encompass most of the terrain around the bay south of the San Jacinto River. Texas State Historical Association Cedar Bayou (part of modern Baytown), Shoal Point (part of modern Texas City), and other small communities began to develop during this period. Eagle Point (part of modern San Leon) became an important shipping and trading post for slaves. Inland from the bay, the towns of Harrisburg and Houston were both founded on the Buffalo Bayou by entrepreneurs from New York and competed as commercial centers, but neither was as significant as Galveston. Texas State Historical Association. Texas State Historical Association. Davenport (1843), p. 170. Throughout the 19th century these three cities developed increasing influence on the Bay Area communities, particularly as railroads were built through the region. Multiple hurricanes struck the region during this time and after. Though none during the 19th century were catastrophic, they nevertheless caused substantial damage and caused some loss of life.Dunn, Roy Sylvan. , Texas State History Association. Annexation by the United States Longhorn became an important economic resource. Texas succeeded in its bid to join the United States in 1845, one of the key causes of the subsequent Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Texas' annexation brought more people to Texas. Ranching interests expanded around the bay, along with the growth of the farming and lumber enterprises in the region. Texas State Historical Association. The construction of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson (GH&H;) Railroad, begun in 1857, further spurred more growth in the region. Texas State Historical Association During the American Civil War, in which Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited role in the conflict though no major battles were fought on the mainland shoreline. New fortifications, like Fort Chambers near Anahuac, were constructed to ward off a mainland invasion by Union forces and to protect supply routes to and from Galveston. The GH&H; Railroad was used in the recapture of Galveston by Confederate forces in 1863. Makeshift hospitals, such as the Nolan home in Dickinson, were established in the bayside communities. In the aftermath of the war the Texan economy declined for a period. Nevertheless, ranching interests became major economic drivers spawning many other economic enterprises like hide processing plants and shipping companies. Texas State Historical Association Some former slaves were able to take advantage of ranching's economic influence as some successful African American communities were established, including the \\"Settlement\\" in what is now League City. The success of the various enterprises in the area and the growth of Galveston as one of the prime commercial centers in the South and Southwest helped promote the construction of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway, and the La Porte, Houston and Northern Railroad over the course of the 19th century. These railroads built lines near the southwest shore of the bay and led to the creation of La Porte, Clear Creek (modern League City), Webster, Edward's Point/North Galveston (modern San Leon), and others (eventually including Texas City). Texas State Historical Association. Texas State Historical Association Texas State Historical Association. Texas State Historical Association. Toward the end of the century, as ranching's profitability declined, many communities turned increasingly to agriculture. The farming community of Pasadena was established during this time. By the end of the 19th century, the land south of Buffalo Bayou came to be known as the \\"Texas Fruit Belt\\" for the oranges, pears, grapes, and other fruits and vegetables grown in the area.Price (1896), pp. 177‚Äì178 The Sylvan Beach park was created at La Porte as a beachfront summer getaway from Houston. With amenities including bathhouses, boating piers, and a Victorial hotel with a dance pavilion, Sylvan Beach quickly became the most popular tourist destination in the Houston area. Texas State Historical Association. Antrobus (2005), p. 51‚Äì52. In 1900 a massive hurricane devastated the city of Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay. According to some estimates the death toll on the coast outside of Galveston may have been over one thousand. Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed.Munsart (1997), p. 119 Communities along the shoreline declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in Southeast Texas. The region received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe. The wars and the oil boom Downtown Pasadena after the 1915 Hurricane. The sparsely populated communities around the bay transformed during the 20th century. Following the devastating 1900 hurricane, donations by the newly created Red Cross, including millions of strawberry plants to Gulf Coast farmers, helped revive area communities. Texas State Historical Association This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena an important fruit producer for many years afterward. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain. In fact, because the port had opened just before the 1900 hurricane, it was able to handle Galveston's diverted shipping traffic until the island's damaged port was repaired. Following another hurricane in 1915, the Texas City Dike was built to protect the Texas City ship channel from sediment movement in future storms, thus helping to build confidence in the safety of the port. One of the most immediate effects of the dike, however, was to increase the salt levels in West Bay, between Galveston and the southwest coastline. Major tracts of the Allen Ranch were liquidated opening up new development around Pasadena and other bayside communities. Commercial fishing for oysters and shrimp grew as a significant area industry.Sage (2002), p. 37. The lumber industry also continued to grow. A sugar refinery opened in Texas city, a paper mill in Pasadena, and other factories in the early 20th century. Following the petroleum discovery at Spindletop (roughly from Galveston Bay) in 1901 Texas entered an era of economic development known as the Texas Oil Boom. Petroleum exploration at Galveston Bay began shortly afterward with the discovery of the Goose Creek Oil Field in 1903.Henson (1993), p. 46. The first well at Goose Creek was built in 1907 with significant production beginning in 1908 (in 1924 it was the state's third largest field).Henson (1993), p. 46‚Äì47. Texas State Historical Association In 1915 the first offshore oil drilling site in the state was opened at Goose Creek. Gradually other oil fields were discovered around the bay as well, including the Anahuac oil field in 1935. Texas State Historical Association. The first refinery by the bay was built in 1908 at Texas City, followed by refineries in Baytown and Pasadena. Texas State Historical Association The main refinery in Baytown, built by Humble Oil (now ExxonMobil), became the largest in the state.Hinton (2002), p. 134 The gusher at Spindletop in 1901, which was soon followed by Goose Creek. The wealth brought on by the boom transformed the region. The population increased rapidly due to significant immigration from within the United States, from Mexico, and overseas. Mexicans, fleeing the Mexican Revolution in 1910, added significantly to the population of what is now Baytown; Sicilian immigrants added greatly to the community of Dickinson; and Japanese rice farmers settled in Webster, Pasadena, and League City Texas State Historical AssociationCampbell (2009), p. 117.Dillingham (1911), p. 475. (in fact the rice industry on the U.S. Gulf Coast was born in Webster; see Seito Saibara). Texas State Historical Association. Major manufacturing centers developed throughout the Bay Area with Houston acting as the corporate and financial center for the boom.Ramos (2004), p. 154 Wealthy Houstonians created waterfront retreats in Morgan's Point and a boardwalk amusement park at Sylvan Beach, La Porte (together known at the time as the Texas \\"Gold Coast\\"), as well as summer homes at Seabrook and other communities.Kearney (2008), pp. 177‚Äì178 Fox (2007), p. 212 The onset of Prohibition made Galveston Bay an important entry point for smuggling illegal liquor, which supplied most of Texas and much of the Midwest. Boats arrived at locations ranging from Galveston to Seabrook.McComb (1986), p. 160. The Maceo crime syndicate, which operated in Galveston at that time, created casino districts in Kemah and Dickinson and other areas of Galveston County. Houstonians often humorously referred to the county line as the \\"Maceo-Dickinson line\\" (a pun referring to the Mason-Dixon line). Much of the area around Clear Lake was developed as recreational properties for the wealthy, including a large ranch estate owned by Houston businessman James West. Texas State Historical Association. Though the Great Depression closed many businesses in the area petroleum-related growth helped offset the effects. During the World Wars, factories around the bay were pressed into service mass-producing a variety of products including aviation fuel, synthetic rubber, and ships.Stephens (1997), p. 9 The first tin smelter outside of Europe was opened in Texas City becoming one of the world's main suppliers. The population in the Bay Area grew faster than even Houston as processing plants and factories were built and expanded. Ellington Air Force Base was built to the southeast of Houston (adjacent to modern Clear Lake City) and became a major air field and flight training center during the wars. Texas State Historical Association. Industrialization and urbanization during the earlier 20th century led to the pollution of the bay. By the 1970s the bay was described by some sources as \\"the most polluted body of water in the U.S.\\" The ship channel and Clear Lake were rated by some sources as having even worse water quality. Drilling for oil and underground water, as well as large wakes from increasing shipping in the bay, led to land subsidence and erosion along the shoreline, especially in the Baytown-Pasadena area.Henson (1993), p. 51. Today approximately of the historic San Jacinto battleground are submerged, most of Sylvan Beach is gone, and the once prominent Brownwood neighborhood of Baytown has had to be abandoned. In 1947, an explosion on a ship at the Port of Texas City caused fires and destruction throughout the city's industrial complex and other ships creating one of nation's worst industrial accidents. The tragedy caused more than five hundred deaths, more than four thousand injuries, and more than $50 million in damage ($ million in today's dollars). Though the city's growth and prosperity were interrupted, the city and the business leaders were able to rebuild. Texas State Historical Association Modern times Aerial view of the Johnson Space Center, courtesy of NASA. The war effort had brought about significant diversification in the area's industrial base. This diversity facilitated the area's transition to a peacetime economy though the petroleum industry again became a major focus. In 1952 the Gulf Freeway, then part of U.S. Route 75, was completed providing a fast automobile link between Houston and Galveston.Melosi (2007), p. 165. The new freeway, considered an engineering marvel at the time, greatly encouraged new development in the western region of the bay.Melosi (2007), p. 168‚Äì170. Hurricane Carla, Texas' largest storm on record, struck the coast in 1961 causing substantial flooding and damage in Texas City and other communities. Loss of life was minimal thanks to evacuation efforts. Expansion of the flood control dike and construction on the Texas City seawall occurred a result. The project was completed in 1985. NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) was established in the area in 1963. That and the explosive growth of neighboring Houston in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s, caused the remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore to urbanize. The Clear Lake City community was created by the Friendswood Development Company, a venture of Humble Oil and Dell E. Webb Corporation, to support residential growth near the new NASA facility. The communities around Clear Lake rapidly reoriented toward aerospace related industries, and the region's economy diversified further. Urban development spread solidly between Houston and the Bay Area communities. Houston formally annexed most of Clear Lake City in 1977 with Pasadena annexing most of the rest. Most of the other communities around the bay, however, had already incorporated, or incorporated soon afterward, and thus were independent of the metropolis. Texas State Historical Association. Texas State Historical Association. The economic boom of the 1970s and early 1980s that took place in Texas (because of the escalation in oil prices) benefited the Bay Area communities significantly. Industrial operations were expanded including the opening of the U.S. Steel plant in Baytown in 1970, and the Barbours Cut shipping terminal at Morgan's Point in 1977. The Port of Texas City became the third leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. The Barbours Cut terminal, operated by the Port of Houston, became the seventh leading port in the nation. Not all of this development was without controversy, however. In building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of eminent domain to evict residents from nearly one third of the homes in Morgan's Point. Still, when the Texas economy declined in the later 1980s, the economic diversity of the area and substantial annual federal investments related to JSC helped the region fare better than most of Greater Houston. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities helped to dramatically improve water quality in the bay. The Nature Conservancy and Houston's Outdoor Nature Club (ONC) helped encourage nature preservation efforts including creating the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, the Armand Bayou Nature Center, and the Texas City Prairie Preserve.Melosi (2007), pp. 254‚Äì255 Texas State Historical Association. Tourism in the area grew, especially around Clear Lake, led in large part by the Space Center. Some former resort communities of the early 20th century like Kemah and Seabrook re-emerged. The lake itself today holds one of the largest concentrations of marinas in the world.Roddy (2008), p. 265 Barrington (2008), p. 266 Antrobus (2005), p. 57 During the later 20th century and afterward, many of the communities and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and the Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities in the region have been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra- territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of the Bay Area today. Texas State Historical Association. In 2008 Hurricane Ike struck the coast causing substantial damage both environmentally and economically. the ecology of the region is still in recovery with damage caused by both natural pollution (sea salt) and man-made pollution (chemicals washed into the freshwater and the bay) still showing dramatic effects on both the marine and land-dwelling wildlife. Commercial fishing and oyster farming are expected to take decades to fully recover. Most major industry was able to return to normal operations but some tourist areas have taken longer to recover. Discussions of a proposal to build an Ike Dike that would protect the Bay Area, particularly the nationally critical Houston Ship Channel, were begun in 2009. the project is still in the conceptual stage.

A sister restaurant, Veselka Bowery, on East 1st Street and Bowery, opened in November 2011. It closed in 2013. History In 1954, the Darmochwals purchased a candy shop and newsstand at Second Avenue and East 9th Street in New York City in an effort to help the Ukrainian Youth Association purchase the building that housed its headquarters. Wolodymyr Darmochwal gave this venture the moniker ‚Äò‚ÄôVeselka‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì the Ukrainian word for rainbow. In 1960, Darmochwal combined the candy store and newsstand with an adjacent luncheonette. In the following years, as the East Village became known as the Haight-Ashbury of the east coast, Veselka became a social center for a cross- section of the community that included old-world tradition and new-world counterculture. By the time that New York City‚Äôs economic crisis hit in the 1970s, Veselka was a fixture in the neighborhood. It was able to expand during the economic recovery of the 1980s, at which time the row of phone booths at the rear of the restaurant came to be used as informal office space for East Village performance artists.Danford, Birchard 2009, p. 82. The 1980s, Veselka began receiving reviews and awards that spread its reputation beyond its immediate neighborhood. That reputation was further cemented when the restaurant was used as a location for the films Trust the Man (2006), Nick and Norah‚Äôs Infinite Playlist (2008), Trainwreck (2015), Ocean's 8 (2018) and Billions (2018) and memorialized in the songs \\"Veselka Diner\\" by Doctor Rokit and ‚ÄúVeselka‚Äù by Greta Gertler, which was National Public Radio‚Äôs ‚ÄúSong of the Day‚Äù on January 24, 2008.

It was formerly called the Open College of the North West, or OCNW. Formed in 1975 as a partnership between Lancaster University and Nelson and Colne College, the Open College of the North West was developed to accredit courses of learning aimed at adult returners to education with the aim of helping them progress to university education. The success of these early programmes quickly led to other colleges and universities becoming involved and the idea being replicated across the country by other regional 'Open Colleges'. These early courses have now developed into the QAA-approved Access to HE Diploma, which most universities accept as an alternative to GCSEs and A Levels for adult applicants. With the introduction of the Learning and Skills Act of 2000 funding for adult education changed, and some of OCNW's qualifications became ineligible for continued public funding. All awarding bodies requesting access to public funds were required to gain approval from the QCA: OCNW obtained this approval in 2001, but, unusually, retained its status as a QAA Access Validating Agency as well. A full list of Ascentis's QCA approved qualifications can be found on the official list of approved qualifications, i.e. the National Database of Accredited Qualifications (NDAQ). OCNW was the only Open College to become a National Awarding Body; the other regional Open Colleges formed and joined the National Open College Network (NOCN). OCNW has always remained outside NOCN and has no official relationship with it. Ascentis awards two main types of qualification at a range of levels: # QCA Approved Qualifications (including areas such as Teacher Training, Skills for Life, Functional Skills, Vocational qualifications, Foundation Learning tier, ESOL including ESOL International, etc.). # QAA Access to Higher Education, along eight pathways (including Education Professions, Vocational Science, Health and Social Care Professions, etc.). Ascentis is now accrediting learners in a number of countries around the world including Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Taiwan, China, Spain and Argentina. Most of these overseas students are studying for ESOL International qualifications and are often used to gain entry to university in the United Kingdom. On 1 August 2009 OCNW changed its name to Ascentis to reflect the fact that it was now a national and international awarding body and in order to reduce confusion with NOCN members.

Plot The story is set after the Cultural Revolution when the Communist Party was promulgating the idea that all citizens were equal. Mr. Chiu is a recently married man from Harbin. For his honeymoon, he chooses to go to Muji City, located three hundred miles away. The story opens with Mr. Chiu eating lunch with his bride in the square near Muji Train Station, just as his two-week honeymoon is ending. Mr. Chiu is concerned about his acute hepatitis that he had suffered from three months earlier and is afraid of a relapse. A policeman throws tea in the direction of Chiu and his wife while they eat. Their feet get wet, an altercation begins, and Mr. Chiu is unjustly arrested. He asks his wife to catch their train and have someone get him if he does not return by tomorrow. Mr. Chiu is charged with sabotage. The police chief suggests that Chiu should be punished more severely because he is a Communist Party member. Mr. Chiu refuses to acknowledge guilt and proclaims his innocence. While in jail, he asks a guard to provide him with medical attention for fear that his hepatitis has flared up again. He warns them that they will be responsible if anything were to happen to him. The guard does not heed his warnings or his concerns. Mr. Chiu is unfazed by the fleas in the mattress, and is amazed to find that he doesn't miss his wife a lot. He makes up his mind that when he gets out he will write about his experiences and expose the police force. He remains in jail throughout the entire weekend. On Monday morning, Mr. Chiu spots Fenjin tied to a tree in the backyard of the jail. Mr. Chiu realizes that Fenjin is the rescuer sent by his bride. He is told that Fenjin was subjected to punishment for calling the chief a bad name. In return for the release of Fenjin and himself, Mr. Chiu signs a statement acknowledging his \\"crime\\" and promises to never do it again. When the two men are released, Mr. Chiu and Fenjin eat at several restaurants near the police station, eating no more than two bowls at any of them. Mr. Chiu keeps wishing he could kill all of his punishers. \\"Within a month, over 800 people contracted acute hepatitis,\\" six died, including two children. Characters * Chiu Maguang : Mr. Chiu, as he is referred to, is a thirty-four-year-old Chinese male visiting Muji City, China for his honeymoon. He lives and works in Harbin, China. He is a lecturer at Harbin University and is a Communist Party member. * Mr. Chiu's Bride : Described as pale with wire glasses, she is a recent college graduate of the fine arts. She is recently married to Mr. Chiu and is just back from their honeymoon. She has never seen an arrest before and so is terrified. She sends Fenjin, a lawyer, to help release Mr. Chiu from jail. * Chief of Bureau : Described as a \\"thin, bald man, who looked serene and intelligent\\". He unjustly imprisons Mr. Chiu and Fenjin. He cares little that Mr. Chiu might expose his \\"punishments,\\" because he is confident that the public will believe him when he denies Mr. Chiu's claims. * Fenjin : A recent graduate from Harbin University's Law Department. Two years ago, Fenjin had enrolled in Mr. Chiu's course about Marxist materialism. He comes to the jail at the request of Mr. Chiu's bride to help Mr. Chiu out of jail. He purportedly calls the Chief a \\"bandit\\" and is punished for it by being tied to a pine tree at the jail.

He was seamen's priest in Hamburg during World War II, when he also worked among Scandinavian prisoners in Germany, and helped planning and carrying out the operation of the White Buses (De Hvide Busser). Background Berge was born in Stavanger as the son of stereotyper Alfred Berge (1878-1962) and his wife Albertine Johanne Huseb√∏ (1879-1956). He finished his examen artium at the University of Oslo in 1928, and graduated as cand.theol. in 1934. He was assistant priest in Modum from 1935 to 1936. From 1937 to 1940 he was a priest in Oslo. Career Berge was priest at the Seamen's Church (Sj√∏mannskirken) in Hamburg during the Second World War. Berge took over the position previously held by Finn Moestue Husebye, when Huseby had to leave Hamburg because of a conflict with Nazi-friendly Norwegian settlers in Germany. Together with his assistant priest Conrad Vogt-Svendsen he also worked among Scandinavian prisoners in Nazi Germany, making thousands of visits on behalf of the prisoners' families. They distributed large quantities of clothes and food to prisoners all over Germany. Berge and Vogt-Svendsen compiled extensive lists of prisons and prisoners, which were sent to Stockholm and later used as a basis for the White Buses operation in Spring 1945. They also passed on information on planned mass liquidation of concentration camp prisoners towards the end of the war. The Seamen's Church in Hamburg remained intact until Easter 1945, when it was destroyed in a bomb attack on Good Friday, an attack which killed the church's caretaker Oskar M. Olsen. After the liberation of Norway, he was a priest at Ilebu prison from 1946, and priest in Horten from 1950. Berge was decorated Knight, First class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1945, for his work for prisoners in Germany. He was also awarded the Danish King Christian X's Liberty Medal.

The name Maha Sona means \\" the greatest demon\\" or \\"god or demon of the cemetery\\" in the Sinhala language. It is the most feared god or demon in Sri Lanka. Originally a giant who had been defeated and decapitated in a duel by another giant named Gotaimbara (lived in the 1st century BC), Maha Sonaa has had his head replaced with that of a bear or tiger. He is believed to kill people by crushing their shoulders and also by afflicting illnesses. Traditional exorcism rituals are performed to repel the demon in such cases. Sri Lanka Army's Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol units are popularly known as the \\"Maha Sohon Brigade\\", named after this demon. Origins In local folk traditions Maha Sona is formerly a human known as Ritigala Jayasena (Jayasena of Ritigala), a fierce warrior living around the reign of King Dutugamunu. After offending Gotaimbara (one of the Ten Giant Warriors of King Dutugamunu) in a drunken stupor, they agree to a bare-hands dual. Depending on the version of the tale, Gotaimbara decapitates Jayasena either accidentally or by a single kick, where the cadaver is removed to an open graveyard. Seeing the predicament of Jayasena, a deity takes pity and tries to revive him before the cadaver goes cold (or another time limit is reached). Since there is very little time remaining, the deity finds a bear head in a hurry and fits it before reviving him. In the chaos of trying to locate Jayasena's head within the time limit, the deity fits the head backwards. Following Jayasena's revival and seeing the grotesque form, people who come across him are terrified to the point of falling ill. Either because he was found or encountered in a large graveyard, the new persona is dubbed 'Maha Sohona or Maha Sohon Yaka (Great Demon of the Graveyard)' by people according to the popular origin versions. It is also worth noting, the term 'sohon' (‡∑É‡∑ú‡∑Ñ‡∑ú‡∂±‡∑ä) in Sinhala not only means grave or cemetery, but can also mean 'foul' in general. Therefore, 'Maha Sohona' can also mean 'The Great Fell'. However, folk songs around the country also provide alternative origins to Maha Sona without linking him to the person Jayasena. Depending on the folk songs he may be called a demon or a deity. Maha Sona remains probably the deepest etched supernatural being in the Sri Lankan psyche, unsurpassed by the terror the name invokes. Characteristics Maha Sona is believed to haunt graveyards, looking for human prey. He also haunts large rocks and hills, surrounded by human corpses. Junctions where three roads meet are other haunting grounds of this demon, and he is able to spread cholera and dysentery. Maha Sohona is chief to 30,000 demons, and often uses various disguises, each time riding a particular animal such as a goat, deer, horse, sheep and elephant. The tall demon has four eyes and four hands and his skin is red in colour. He has the head of a bear or tiger rides a pig and drinks the blood of a buffalo he carries in his right hand. He is also armed with a pike in his left hand. Maha Sona kills people at night by striking them between the shoulders. The mark of a hand will be embossed on the flesh of the body after this. Apart from killing, he is also able to possess humans. Exorcism In traditional exorcism rituals, dancers dressed as Maha Sona perform to cure patients of illnesses that are believed to have been afflicted by the demon. A traditional mask depicting the face of Maha Sona is used in these rituals. Also, it is believed that when he comes to the earth in the form of a man no one can stop him. In Galle District Sri Lanka Mahasona and other demons (yakshas) such as Riri Yaka were benevolent, though they caused illness in the victims, resulting in healing rituals. Exorcists are of a particular caste, the Berawayas, of whom sadly the majority perished in the Boxing Day Tsunami. The exorcist does not refer to Mahasona as evil, but jokes with him, play cards and eat meat usually throughout the night, till the patient is well the next morning. Professor Bruce Kapferer has written extensively on this in his book 'A Celebration of Demons: Exorcism and the Aesthetics of Healing in Sri Lanka'.

The primary reason for the proliferation of primitive societies in this area is the relative mildness of climate and the abundance of wildlife which through continuous hunting allowed the inhabitants a comfortable life.Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arango In today's villages of Maria La Baja, Sincer√≠n, El Viso and Mahates and Rotinet, there have also been discoveries of the remains of culturally organized societies through the excavation of maloka-type buildings, which are directly related to the early Puerto Hormiga settlements. This is how a woman from the Karib Culture may have dressed Archaeological investigations date the decline of the Puerto Hormiga culture and its related settlements to around 3000 BC. The rise of a much more developed culture, the Mons√∫, who lived at the end of the Dique Canal, near today's Cartagena neighborhoods Pasacaballos and Ci√©naga Honda at the northernmost part of Bar√∫ Island. The Mons√∫ culture inherited the Puerto Hormiga culture's use of the art of pottery but also developed a mixed economy of agriculture and basic manufacture. the Mons√∫ people's diet was based mostly on seashells, sweet- and salt-water fish. The ethnologists who discovered Mons√∫, Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff and his wife Alicia Dussan, found an interesting artificial mound created by them consisting in vases and rests of skeletons. After the first excavations, the Mons√∫ mound was found to be a communal hut that had strong wood logs around it and was built on different levels, each one from a different period of time. The most ancient of these is the TurbanaThe names of the periods of these monticles were chosen randomly according to the name of nearby towns Period, from 3350 BC. This archaeological zone, less than 6 miles from Cartagena de Indias' downtown boasts the most complete collection of ceramic instruments in Colombia and the American continent. The ceramic patterns found in Mons√∫, are a tour de force for students of archeology of the Caribbean sea basin and northern South America. The Reichel-Dolmatoffs later found other artificial mounds, dating from 3200 to 1000 BC, thus making the suburbs of modern Cartagena the seat of the first organized society in Colombia, and one of the most ancient in the Americas. The development of the Sin√∫ society in today's department of Cordoba and Sucre, eclipsed these first developments around the Cartagena Bay area. Around 1500 the area was inhabited by different tribes of the Karib language family, more precisely the Mocanae sub-family. These were: * In the downtown island: Kalamar√≠ Tribe * In the Tierrabomba island: Carex Tribe * In the Bar√∫ island, then peninsula: Bahaire Tribe * In the eastern coast of the exterior bay: Cospique Tribe * In the suburban area of Turbaco: Yurbaco Tribe Some subsidiary tribes of the Kalamari lived in today's neighborhood of Pie de la Popa, and other subsidiaries from the Cospique lived in the Membrillal and Pasacaballos areas. Among these, according to the first chronicles the Kalamari Tribe had preeminence. These tribes, though physically and administratively separated, shared common architecture, such as hut structures consisting of circular rooms with tall roofs inside wooden palisades.Lemaitre, Eduardo; Historia Extensa de Cartagena de Indias, Ed. Aguilar 1976. Edited before the ISBN system was enforced in Colombia, no reedition. Alonso de Ojeda passed through the bay in 1505 but decided to continue to Uraba. First sightings: 1500-1533 Since the failed foundation of San Sebastian de Urab√° in 1506 by Alonso de Ojeda, and the subsequent failed city of Santa Mar√≠a la Antigua del Dari√©n in 1510 by Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, the southern Caribbean coast became a bit unattractive to colonizers, which preferred the more known Hispaniola and Cuba. Pedro de Heredia founder of the city and explorer of its hinterland The Casa de Contrataci√≥n gave permission to Rodrigo de Bastidas (1460‚Äì1527) to again conduct an expedition as adelantado to these areas. Bastidas explored the coast and discovered the Magdalena River delta in his first journey from Guajira to the south in 1527, trip that ended in the Urab√° gulf, seat of the failed first settlements. De Nicuesa and De Ojeda noted the existence of a big bay on the way from Santo Domingo to Urab√° and Panama isthmus, encouraging De Bastidas to investigate. Lemaitre, Eduardo; Historia Extensa de Cartagena de Indias, Ed. Aguilar 1976.Corrales, Manuel Ezequiel; Documentos para la historia de la Provincia de Cartagena, Tomo II, Imp. M. Rivas, Cartagena de Indias, 1883. Colonial era: 1533-1717 Juan de la Cosa, (1460 - killed by Indians in 1509), traveled with De Heredia to the area, and died in the near town of Turbaco in a battle, his office was to make the maps of the expedition due to his expertise after being the first cartographer of America. Cartagena de Indias was founded on 1 June 1533 by Spanish commander Pedro de Heredia, in the former seat of the indigenous Caribbean Calamar√≠ village. Most of Heredia's sailors were from Cartagena, Spain, a city founded by the Phoenicians in 228 BC and also a seaport. As the site had some geographical affinities with the newly discovered bay, thus they decided to name it as for their native city. See Juan de la Cosa. Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, (1495 - Bogot√° now, Colombia, 1579), was the Founder of Bogot√°, 1537, the actual capital of Colombia, and Governor of the City after the death in a shipwreck, in 1554, of Pedro de Heredia Initially, life in the city was bucolic, with fewer than 2000 inhabitants and only one church. A few months after the disaster of the invasion of Cote (see below), a fire destroyed the city and forced the creation of a Firefighting Squad, the first in the Americas.De Castellanos, Juan; Historia de Cartagena, Bogot√°, Biblioteca de Cultura Popular de Colombia, 1942. The dramatically increasing fame and wealth of the prosperous city turned it an attractive plunder site for pirates and corsairs (French privateers, licensed by their king). Just 30 years after its founding, the city was pillaged by a French Huguenot nobleman Jean-Fran√ßois Roberval, (circa 1500 - killed in France by a mob, 1560), known as \\"Robert Baal\\". The city then set about strengthening its defences and surrounding itself with walled compounds and castles. Martin Cote, a Basque from Biscay, soldier in Peru during the Peru Civil wars between the Spaniards, attacked years later. Sunset over Cartagena Harbor as seen from La Popa Many pirates intended the same on Cartagena who was more and more notorious in the thieves' guilds in Europe: * Sir John Hawkins (England), (1532‚Äì1595): Tried to trick Gov. Mart√≠n de las Alas in 1568 to open (against the Spanish Law) a foreign fair in the city to sell its goods for then ravaging the port. The Governor declined and Hawkins tried to siege but failed. * Sir Francis Drake (England), (1540‚Äì1596): Nephew of Hawkins, the famed pirate came with a strong fleet and quickly took the city. The Governor circa 1574 Pedro Fern√°ndez de Busto and the Archbishop fled to the neighboring town of Turbaco and from there negotiated the costly ransom for the city: 107,000 Spanish Eight Reales of the time (Around 200 mill. of today's USD), in any case, the future \\"Sir\\" destroyed 1/4 of the city, the developing Palace of the Township and the recently finished Cathedral. After this disaster Spain poured millions every year to the city for its protection, beginning with Gov. Francisco de Murga's planning of the walls and forts; this practice was called \\"Situado\\". The magnitude of this subsidy is shown by comparison: between 1751 and 1810, the city received the sum of 20,912,677 Spanish reales, the equivalent of some 2 trillion dollars today. * Sir Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis, (1645‚Äì1707), Jean du Casse 1697. Raid on Cartagena (1697) The city recovered quickly from the horrible takeover of Drake and kept growing. The port now seat of the Inquisition in the Caribbean (with Lima's and Mexico's the only 3 seats in America), many public buildings and servants, its importance was confirmed. Desjean's plans were far more than pillage: it was an invasion by all means. King Louis XIV whose mother was a Spanish Habsburg Royal princess, whose son was also the son of a Spanish Habsburg Princess wanted his grandson Felipe V to assert his rights to take over the exhausted, no male succession, Spanish Habsburgs throne and Cartagena de Indias could help significantly if taken \\"manu military\\", too. The political vision behind this invasion was shadowed by the governor of Saint-Domingue (today's Haiti) Jean Baptiste Ducasse who brought his soldiers just to steal, the original plan ending as pirates and thieves again destroying the city. In any case, the entry wasn't easy, because of the recently finished first stage of walls and forts which slowed and made costly the victory. While Desjean only asked for 250,000 Spanish reales in ransom, Jean du Casse stayed a few months later and dishonored the promise of the Baron of respecting the churches and holy places and left them with nothing. The city again, lost everything. The 18th century begins. Other important events in the 16th and 17th centuries were: 16th century: * The brother of the founder, Pedro de Heredia, Alonso de Heredia founded Santa Cruz de Mompox to honour the then governor of the province, Jos√© de Santacruz who was about to make another unjust Residencia, sort of appointment, to his brother, planned by his enemies in the city. Residencia project was successfully overcome by Heredia who later \\"residenced\\" Santacruz for his greed in the expedition made by him to Urab√° in late 1537. * In its typical decentralised and autonomistic state policy, Spain put in Cartagena de Indias, a most interesting seafaring town, many administrative offices: Francis Drake entered in the city after the failure of his uncle Hawkins and destroyed the cathedral John Hawkins intended to invade the city in 1568 Jean Baptiste du Casse and his brigands damaged the military invasion of New Granada of Louis XIV under the Baron of Pointis by ravaging the city and turning into pirates. King of France, Louis XIV, deceased 1715, dreamed with taking over the city and invade the New Granada territories, now Colombia, but failed. # The Royal Houses of Customs, \\"La Aduana\\": Technically the Main directorate for Customs policy in New Granada and its dependencies. Cartagena de Indias's mayors office today is now located there. # The Royal Houses of Accountance: Most of its competences were in the State Finance area, making it analogous to a Ministry of Finance or a Secretary of the Treasury. This office was located in what is today Mapfre's House at La Inquisicion Street. # The Royal Mail House: Although dealing already in 1540 it became developed in the 18th century, staying there till 1821 when it was renamed with the Independence, delivering most of the post in New Granada and to Europe. Today's SUDEB's house occupies its original place. # The Royal Consulate of Commerce of Cartagena de Indias: A privately run institution with public charter, the Consulates of Commerce were express courts for trading quarrels and to promote trade and development in its area. Until 1790 was the only in the area, then succeeded by Caracas (1790), Santa Cruz de Mompox (1793), Panam√° (1798), Santa Fe (1805) and others. # The sea farers Hospital: First and Only military hospital in the area, and until the foundation of the San Juan De Dios Hospital in Bogota the only in New Granada. On its first floor a Poor People's Hospital worked until the San Carlos Hospital in 1730 and the Poors Hospital were opened up in the Santa Clara convent. Today's Naval Museum, with the poor's Hospital in its first floor for a while, they were replaced by those on Gastelbondo Street (San Carlos), and today's Sofitel Santa Clara Hotel, formerly the \\"Poors Hospital of Santa Clara of Assisi\\". # Headquarters of the Royal Regular Armies of Cartagena de Indias: In New Granada, like in most Spanish America, military presence was at least nule and when present was quite concentrated in the important towns : Havana, Mexico City, Lima, Panama and Cartagena de Indias. The permanent army post in New Granada had its headquarters in today's Judges Offices in Cuartel Street. This made Cartagena de Indias also the seat to something similar to a Ministry of Defense in a modern country. Map of the city recently established and without walls. Circa 1550 17th century: * During the governorship of Rafael C√°psir an interesting event occurred in the city: the \\"Cessatio a Divinis\\". The nuns of the Santa Clara convent, on becoming richer than their supervising male tutors, the Franciscan friars, wished to become independent of them and of their financial advice. The Archbishop agreed with the petition of the nuns but the Franciscans protested and made an alliance with the Governor, who decided to storm the Convent, but found that the Archbishop had previously forbidden the Franciscans from saying mass (Cessatio a Divinis). The nuns then thought it wise to reverse their petition but the Archbishop, already involved, preferred to continue. It is said that the city was terribly distressed by the conflict, with daily fights in the streets taking place between citizens allying with opposing factions . The conflict finally ended not only with the Franciscans being deprived of financially tutoring the nuns but also with the Archbishop being banned. Cartagena de Indias San Agust√≠n Street * The Portuguese Company of Cacheu, dedicated to slave trading was closed down by the Crown because of reported frauds and tax money embezzlement. This slave trading company was located opposite today's Marquis de Valdehoyos house (Calle de la Factor√≠a). * Jesuit father Pedro Claver y Corber√≥, (Verd√∫, Catalonia, 8 September 1580 ‚Äì Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 9 September 1654), today known as a Saint of the Roman Catholic Church, (since 1888, by Pope Leo XIII), and \\"The slave of the black slaves\\" departed after numerous requests, in 1622, to the strategic harbor of Cartagena de Indias. There he met and worked together with Jesuit father Alonso de Sandoval, the author of probably the most influential book, De instauranda ethiopum salute, two improved editions in Spanish during the 17th century and other later editions in Spanish, on black people ethnology, black African people and African black slaves sold there and brought from West Occidental Africa. * The Township Palace and Governors House was finished. The fame of this prosperous city turned it into the plunder site for pirates and thieves; the legions for the country's defence soon became insufficient, which is why the kings of Spain decided to approve the construction of castles, forts, and walls that surrounded the city. During the 17th century, the Spanish Crown hired the services of prominent European military engineers to carry out the construction of fortresses, which are nowadays one of Cartagena's clearest signs of identity. Engineering works took well over 208 years, and ended with some eleven kilometres of walls surrounding the city, namely, the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas, named in honor of Spain's King Philip IV. It was built during the Governorship of Pedro Zapata de Mendoza, Marquis of Barajas, and was constructed to repel land attacks, equipped with sentry boxes, buildings for food and weapons storage, tunnels. A part of the 16th and 17th century Fortress of San Felipe de Barajas, Cartagena de Indias, now a city of Colombia This powerful military complex was completed with: # The San Sebasti√°n del Pastelillo Fort: in today's neighborhood of Manga. It is called del Pastelillo (the cupcake) because of its low altitude to avoid being affected by the cannons of the Castle of San Felipe which may have destroyed it if made taller. The fort replaced the first defense of the city, The Tower of Boquer√≥n, a dominating tower similar to the Torre del Homenaje in Santo Domingo, but round. # The Santa Cruz de Castillogrande Fort: in today's neighborhood of Castillogrande, near today's Naval Club, a cross shaped fort which controlled the entry in the inner bay. # The San Juan de Manzanillo Fort: smaller than its counterpart, Castillogrande, in order to avoid crossfiring it, but on the opposite side of the strait. # The San Luis de Bocachica Fort: Beautifully finished cross-shaped fort, an exponent of the renaissance military architecture. Alone, it dominated the Bocachica strait which lead to the ocean but was destroyed by Admiral Edward Vernon in the 18th century, circa 1741, during his failed attempt at conquering Cartagena de Indias. Only some remains can be seen at some places of Bocachica, near its successor, built after 1741, the San Fernando Fort. # The San Fernando de Bocachica Fort: Built nearer to the sea than its older brother, the San Luis, it was more modern and state-of-the-art, being more roundly shaped, with space for more musketeers rather than massive cannons, and far more neoclassical and delicate in its outer layers, revealing the tendency in military architecture in the 18th century. # The San Jos√© de Bocachica batteries: Built with the new plan of the San Fernando Fort, was designed to point to the line of flotation of the ships, and that's why its almost under sea level. # The Angel San Rafael Battery: A masterpiece of the history of military architecture, it's the only exponent in the world of \\"inside defense\\". The battery has few cannons to the outside, only those necessary to support the defense of San Fernando. Its use was to attract the sieging forces to enter a tunnel that appears to be accidentally opened 500 meters away from the fort. The idea behind it was to let invaders think it was easier to siege the castle of San Fernando than it actually was. At the end of the tunnel opens on to a moat inside the battery where more than 400 muskets were located, pointing at the first entrance. The design of the \\"devil holes\\" where the muskets were placed, could not be seen by the invaders, who were then trapped then in a lethal ground . Although no one seems to have experienced this deadly trap, tests done with cattle in the late 18th century confirmed the usefulness of the idea. Recently the Battery, a crown jewel of military architectural history, was rebuilt after years of neglect. # The Santa Barbara Battery: Designed near the tunnel entrance to Angel San Rafael was a small battery used as a decoy to support fire to the Bocachica system. Its most important function was to attract the sieging forces to the mainland so they could glimpse the tunnel entrance and be fired at in Angel San Rafael deadly moat. The Santa Barbara battery disappeared over the years and today only its founding stones remain above the sea. # The Batteries of Chamba and Santiago: Mainly designed as support batteries for San Luis fort, these were razed down by Admiral Edward Vernon in 1741. The ruins of both batteries remain near the shore of the Tierrabomba Island, but no plans exist to rebuild them. # The Batteries of Mas, Crespo and the Revell√≠n of El Cabrero: Destroyed by erosion and the desperate efforts of the 19th century administrations to dynamize the city's building industry were support forts for the massive San Lucas and Santa Catalina fortresses in the city walls.Crates and crates of these Spanish reales dwelled in Cartagena de Indias to be distributed throughout the empire. # The walls of the old city. 11 km of walls, more than 20 mini forts within it, 4 auxiliary doors, only one bridge- fort to connect the city to the mainland. Explanations are unnecessary. When the defenses were finished in 1756, the city was simply impossible to take over. There is a legend, that when reviewing the costs of the defenses of Spain in Havana and Cartagena de Indias, in an effort to reform the chronic spending of his predecessors, Charles III of Spain, in his famed ironic style said while in Madrid, Spain, after taking his spyglass: \\"This is outrageous! For this price those castles should be seen from here!\\" Cartagena was a major trading port, especially for precious metals. Gold and silver from the mines in New Granada and Peru were loaded in Cartagena on the galleons bound for Spain via Havana. Cartagena was also a slave port; Cartagena and Veracruz (Mexico) were the only cities authorized to trade with black people. The first slaves arrived with Pedro de Heredia and they worked as cane cutters to open roads, in the desecration of tombs of the aboriginal population of Sin√∫, and in the construction of buildings and fortresses. The agents of the Portuguese company Cacheu distributed human 'cargos' from Cartagena for mine exploitation in Venezuela, the West Indies, the Nuevo Reino de Granada and the Viceroyalty of Per√∫. On 5 February 1610, the Catholic Monarchs established from Spain the Inquisition Holy Office Court in Cartagena de Indias by a Royal Decree issued by King Philip II. The Inquisition Palace, finished in 1770, is still there with its original features of colonial times. When Cartagena declared its complete independence from Spain on November 11, 1811, the inquisitors were urged to leave the city. The Inquisition operated again after the Reconquest in 1815, but it disappeared definitely when Spain surrendered six years later before the patriotic troops led by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Viceregal era: 1717-1810 The pro-trade, administrative reforms and deregulation economic policies of the new Bourbon Dynasty in Spain stimulated the economic growth and consolidation of the Spanish America. Here, the first Bourbon Spanish monarch, Philip V. Although the 18th century began very badly for the city, soon the downward tendency was curbed. The pro-trade economic policies of the new dynasty in Madrid bolstered the economic performance of Cartagena de Indias and the establishment of the Viceroyalty of the New Granada in 1717 had the city as the greatest beneficiary of the colony. Juan D√≠az de Torrezar Pimienta as governor was the mastermind of the reconstruction of the city after the destruction of 1697. The reconstruction after the Raid on Cartagena (1697) was initially slow, but with the ending of the War of the Spanish Succession around 1711 and the competent administration of D. Juan Diaz de Torrezar Pimienta the walls were rebuilt, the forts reorganized and restored and the public services and buildings reopened. By 1710, the city was fully recovered. At the same time, the slow but steady reforms of the restricted trade policies in the Spanish Empire encouraged the establishment of new trade houses and private projects. During the reign of Philip V of Spain the city had many new public works starting or ending like the new fort of San Fernando, the Hospital of the Obra P√≠a and the full paving of all the streets and the opening of new roads. Battle of Cartagena de Indias Blas de Lezo the Spanish sea farer, with only one eye, one leg and one hand, was one of the military leaders that defended the city from Admiral Vernon in 1741 In March 1741 the city endured a large-scale attack by British and American colonial troops led by Admiral Edward Vernon, (1684‚Äì1757), who arrived at Cartagena with a massive fleet of 186 ships and 23,600 men, including 12,000 infantry, against only 6 Spanish ships and less than 6,000 men, in an action known as the Battle of Cartagena de Indias. The siege was broken off due to the start of the tropical rainy season, after weeks of intense fighting in which the British landing party was successfully repelled by the Spanish and native forces led by commander General Blas de Lezo y Olavarrieta, (1689 - aftermaths of the Cartagena battle, 1741), a Basque from the Gipuzkoa lands, (Spain). Heavy British casualties were compounded by diseases such as yellow fever. This victory prolonged Spain's control of the Caribbean waters, which helped secure its large Empire until the 19th century. Admiral Vernon was accompanied by American Colonial troops, including George Washington brother, Lawrence Washington, who was so impressed with Vernon he named his Mount Vernon agricultural estate after him.The final serious attempt to take the city and invade New Granada was made by Edward Vernon, who failed in one of the biggest military expeditions ever made there From Bogota to Cartagena Jos√© Celestino Mutis lived in the city and collected and classified many plants After Vernon began what is called the 'Silver Age' of the city (1750‚Äì1808). This time was of permanent expansion of the existing buildings, massive immigration from all the other cities of the Viceroyalty, the increase of the economic and political power of the city and a population spur that hasn't been seen yet again. For these events, the political power that was already shifting from Bogot√° to the coast, definitely did and the Viceroys decided to reside in the city for good. The inhabitants of the city were the richest of the colony, the aristocracy formed noble houses with their land estates, libraries and prints were opened, and even the first caf√© in New Granada was established. These good times of steady progress and advance of the second half of the 18th century came into an abrupt end in 1808, with the general crisis of the Spanish Empire, embodied in the Mutiny of Aranjuez, with all its consequences. Alexander Von Humboldt stayed in the city in the early 1800s together with French naturalist Bonpland and saw the closure of the Silver Age For more than 275 years, Cartagena was part of the Spanish Crown. On November 11, 1811, Cartagena declared its independence. Nineteenth Century If there is a word to describe the Cartagena in the 19th century, is by far: decadence. Followed by instability, revolution, impoverishment and depopulation. The chaos brought by the Mutiny of Aranjuez to the Empire and the French invasion of the peninsula put the stability of the Spanish ancient regime in shambles. Although there were two years of grace for the city to prepare itself for what was coming.

He was the son of Julius Ewald Edward Beerbohm (1811‚Äì1892),Internet Archive listing Max Beerbohm: a Biography, by David Cecil ‚Äì Houghton Mifflin, 1965 of Dutch, Lithuanian, and German origin, who had come to England in about 1830 and set up as a prosperous corn merchant. He married an Englishwoman, Constantia Draper, and the couple had four children. Julius Beerbohm's older brother was the renowned actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree; his sister was author Constance Beerbohm. A younger half-brother was the caricaturist and parodist Max Beerbohm. His half-sister Agnes Mary Beerbohm (1865‚Äì1949), who became Mrs Ralph Neville in 1884, was a friend of the artist Walter Sickert and modelled for him in his 1906 painting Fancy Dress.Google Books Listing Baron, Wendy 'Sickert: Paintings and Drawings' Published by Yale University Press (206) pg 315 His nieces were Viola, Felicity and Iris Tree. Travels in Patagonia A European engineer, Beerbohm travelled to Patagonia in 1877 as part of a group sent to survey the land between Port Desire and Santa Cruz. His 1881 book Wanderings in Patagonia; or, Life among the Ostrich Hunters is the account of the time he spent there. In the book he vividly describes the natural history and geography of the country which he labelled 'the last of nature's works'.Internet Archive Listing Beerbohm, Julius 'Wanderings in Patagonia, or, Life among the Ostrich Hunters' Chatto & Windus, London (1881) Beerbohm travelled across deserts and through jungles with the native Indians, the people Ferdinand Magellan had come upon in 1520 when he discovered the country.Internet Archive Listing The life of Ferdinand Magellan, and the first circumnavigation of the globe by Francis Henry Hill Guillemard Beerbohm details a trek through this notoriously hostile terrain and overcomes snowstorms and mutiny, survives a flood and encounters \\"ostrich\\" hunters, puma, and swans. A rank amateur, Beerbohm had no previous knowledge of the land, its flora and fauna. Fortunately, for the most part of the journey he travelled with several old hands at ostrich hunting: the memorable Isidro, the Frenchman Guillaume, and the Austrian Maximo. Most memorable are the several chapters in which the group is stuck on the north side of the Rio Gallegos which was experiencing a severe flood. The group split up, with Beerbohm and Guillaume venturing a dangerous crossing, which almost drowned Beerbohm. When they finally arrived in Sandy Point, the local prison, along with its military guard, mutinied, got drunk, and took over the town, killing many of its citizens. Beerbohm's Patagonia sketches provided the basis for the illustrations for Lady Florence Dixie's Across Patagonia (1881).Dixie, Lady Florence 'Across Patagonia' with Illustrations from Sketches by Julius Beerbohm Published by R. Worthington, New York (1881) Character In a volume of reminiscences collected on the death of Herbert Beerbohm Tree by Max Beerbohm, Herbert's widow Helen Maud Tree recalled Julius: > \\"It was in the autumn of 1882 that I first met Julius, (Herbert's younger > brother Max, their half-brother was then a little boy of ten). Julius was a > brilliant creature, exquisite and elusive: a poet and a dreamer. His poetry > was of the soul: his dreams, alas! were of the earth. He was a potential > millionaire, and from time to time, one would have said, an actual one. But, > over and over again, some bright El Dorado would fade before his vision. > Fortunes came quickly, and as quickly were engulfed in new and glittering > enterprises. Throughout his eager, hunted life triumph and disaster followed > one another in quick succession; but I never saw him ‚Äì even when misfortunes > were huddling on his back ‚Äì otherwise than calm, perfectly accoutred and > equipped, fastidious, fantastic, fascinating and debonair.

Littlewood in 1909 and who was killed in action during World War I; and Marie Marguerite Beerbohm (born 1890), who married Ernest Alexander Stuart Watt (1874 - 1954) on 22 February 1912 at the register office, Hanover Square. The marriage was dissolved in 1913.Divorce petition in The National Archives Julius Beerbohm spent much of his time travelling around Europe losing all his money at casino after casino. Every now and then he would try to recoup his lost money by thinking up some fantastic project, such as an idea to dredge the River Nile to attempt to find the lost jewels of the Pharaohs, or setting up a luxury hotel at Marienbad. This latter was a short-lived venture for after paying the deposit on the hotel Beerbohm left Germany and totally forgot about the entire enterprise until reminded of it by his creditors. Living as he did, he soon lost all of his money and much of his wife's also, and could only continue to live to the standard to which he had become accustomed by borrowing from others. Although facing financial ruin, he continued to keep cabs waiting for him all day at his door, and to attend supper parties where he would entertain the company by reciting one of his poems.David Cecil, Max: a biography Constable, London (1964) pg 10 He wrote the words to a song, Blue-Eyes, Berceuse, which was set to music by Lord Duppin.Bright-Eyes, Berceuse Words by J Beerbohn, Music by Lord Duppin, Chappell & Co, New Bond Street, London He had his linen sent from his London home to Paris to be washed.Johnson, Paul 'Languid in life, quick on the draw' ‚Äì Paul Johnson on Max Beerbohm: A Kind of a Life The Independent 13 October 2002 As he lay dying in April 1906, \\"exhausted by a life of adventure and failure\\"David Cecil, Max: a biography Constable, London (1964) pg 254 Julius Beerbohm managed to maintain the strict standards of his dandyism.

Singing career The youngest of four children, Holborn began her career in the music business at the age of eight and was offered two recording contracts. In 2002, her eldest brother secretly entered her in GMTV's Totstars competition. After weeks of waiting, the phone votes were counted and out of approximately 200,000 votes, Holborn received 164,365. From this, Holborn won a record contract with Universal Records and a scholarship to the Barbara Speake Stage School, beating 6,000 competitors for the top prize. She then released a record with covers of \\"I‚Äôd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\" / \\"My Boy\\" with the bonus track \\"Ben\\", which reached number 27 on the UK Singles Chart, number 5 in Wales and 61 in Germany. As a result of the charting she unseated Lena Zavaroni as the youngest female solo artist to make the UK Top 40. In 2005, Holborn was believed to be an early contender for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, but was ultimately disqualified from the competition as she had already charted a song and was therefore no longer considered an amateur. Holborn has performed at many events in Wales such as Party in the Park 2002 and the Millennium Stadium meeting. Since the competition, she has performed to help raise funds for various charities in the UK. Holborn released her latest single \\"If I Could\\" on various sites on 5 August 2012.

The only known species is Warionia saharae, an endemic of Algeria and Morocco, and it is locally known in the Berber language as afessas, abessas or tazart n-√Æfiss. It is an aromatic, thistle-like shrub of ¬Ω‚Äì2 m high, that contains a white latex, and has fleshy, pinnately divided, wavy leaves. It is not thorny or prickly. The aggregate flower heads contain yellow disk florets. It flowers from April till June. Because Warionia is deviant in many respects from any other Asteraceae, different scholars have placed it hesitantly in the Cardueae, Gundelieae, Mutisieae, but now genetic analysis positions it as the sister group to all other Cichorieae.  Description  Wariona is an aromatic shrub, usually between ¬Ω‚Äì2 m, occasionally only 15 cm or up to 3 m high, that has a network of latex-carrying canals throughout the plant with sticky, white, milky latex. It also has oil canals. It carries glandular hairs that consist of two parallel series of a few cells on top of each other (or biserial). It has thirty-four chromosomes (2n = 34).  Root, stem and leaf  W. saharae has a light brown taproot, reminiscent of a parsnip. The youngest plants consist above ground of a rosette of oblanceolate, dentate leaves. Older plants develop stems, which are initially green but eventually become woody and develop a corky, grey bark. With about 75 Œºm, the diameter of the wood vessels is at the high end of the range within the Asteraceae. Wood fibers are relatively thick-walled. The wavy, somewhat fleshy leaves are set alternating along the stems, 2‚Äì13 cm long and 1‚Äì3 cm wide, oblong to oblanceolate. They are sinuate to pinnately partite, while the main vein in each lobe extends into an acute tip. The leaf is pinnately veined. While the leaf blade narrows at the foot, it still extends to the stem. The leaf surface is softly hairy with glandular hairs particularly near the edge.  Inflorescence  The erect flowerheads stand individually at the tip of the stems or with two or three together. Each is 3‚Äì4 cm long, 4¬Ω‚Äì6 cm wide, and contains disk florets only. The common base of the florets (or receptacle) is flat with indents where the florets are inplanted, while scales and hairs are absent. The bell-shaped involucre consists of four to five rows of green bracts, sometimes tinged purple at the stretched tip and with a papery irregularly fine dentate edge. The bracts in the outer row are 6‚Äì7 mm long and 1¬Ω‚Äì2 mm wide, while bracts in rows further up are increasingly long, eventually reaching 21‚Äì23 mm. Each head carries twenty five to forty florets.  Florets  Each individual floret is bisexual, with a yellow, star- symmetric corolla of 22‚Äì25 mm long, consisting of a narrow, straight or S-shaped tube of 10‚Äì11 mm long, which abruptly widens into a deeply 5-lobed bell, the twisting lobes being 7‚Äì8 mm long, softly haired, with twin hairs and glandular hairs consisting of two piles of a few cells, while the tip is adorned with a tuft of hairs. Like in all asteraceae the five anthers are fused into a tube, through which the style grows, picking up the pollen on hairs along its length. The anthers in Warionia are yellow, 11‚Äì12 mm long, their base reaching 1¬Ω‚Äì2 mm below the attachment to the yellow hearless filaments, and the acute tips reaches 2 mm above the merged tube. The pollen grains are large, approximately globular, tricolpate, carrying spines and with perforations between the spines. The yellow style, has a widened base carrying a nectary, grows to eventually 24‚Äì26 mm long, and splits in its female phase at the tip into two 4‚Äì6 mm long branches. The inner surface of the style branches is completely covered papillae, while the outer surface has hairs extending somewhat below the branches.  Fruit  The fruit below the corolla (called cypsela) is 4¬Ω‚Äì5 mm long, 1¬Ω‚Äì3 mm wide, narrowed at the tip, where it carries a collar, with a shaggy appearance due to white hairs. Like in all Asteraceae the calyx has changed and is called pappus. In this case it consists of two circles of rigid, white-yellowish, somewhat papery bristles, that carry small teeth at regular distances along their length, mostly 15‚Äì18 mm long, but some of the outer bristles only 2¬Ω mm long.  Phytochemistry  The plants produce a pungent smell when touched, due to the aromatic oil, which contains 42‚Äì53% Œ≤-eudesmol, 17¬Ω% trans-nerolidol, 5‚Äì8¬Ω% linalool and about 2¬Ω% guaiol. The essential oil content is approximately 1% of the weight of the dried leaves. When damaged, the plants ooze a very sticky white latex, which, like in the other Cichorioideae, has a high triterpene content.  Taxonomy  Jean Pierre Adrien Warion collected specimens in 1865 and 1866, south-west of the Algerian coastal mountain range. These were named Warionia saharae and described by George Bentham and Ernest Cosson, in the Bulletin of the Soci√©t√© botanique de France in 1872. There are no synonyms. The species was initially assigned to the Cardueae. In the 1970s, scholars thought it better placed in the Mutisieae sensu lato. In 1991 however, Hansen, who made a thorough morphological analysis of the Mutisieae sensu lato, suggested Warionia would be closer related to the Cardueae due to its spiny pollen, the bell-shape of the florets and the stiff hairs on the style.  Phylogeny  Recent genetic analysis identifies the species as the sister of all other Cichorieae, in its own subtribe Warioniinae. The following tree represents the relationships between Warionia and its relatives.  Etymology  The genus name Warionia is named in honor of Adrien Warion (1837‚Äì1880), a French military physician and botanist who made extensive collections while stationed in North Africa. The specific epithet saharae refers to the Sahara desert, in a small part of which this plant naturally occurs.  Distribution and ecology  Warionia saharae is an endemic of Morocco between Tamanar, Ifni, Erfoud and Figuig, and of Algeria, in the Na√¢ma Province and the B√©ni Ounif District. It grows on slopes of the High Atlas, Anti-Atlas and Saharian Atlas, along the coast of southern Morocco, and in the desert, on mafic and siliceous rock, at altitudes between sea level and 1300 m. At Ifni it was found growing together with Euphorbia echinus, E. obtusifolia and Senecio anteuphorbium. The species loses its leaves when seasonal water availability drops below a threshold in summer, but in cultivation it keeps its leaves as long as it is watered adequately. In the wild it occurs to be pest-free, except for browsing goats which can have a detrimental impact on it. Pollen matures before the styles are fertile and this makes the species dependent on cross-pollination. As individuals usually appear distant from each other and pollinating insects may be scarce, seed fertility may be low.  Cultivation  The species can be grown from seed in free draining compost at 30 ¬∞C by day and 15 ¬∞C at night. It may grow to 1¬Ω m in its first year, at which stage the stems become woody. In cultivation, whitefly may be a problem and when it is damp, mildew may occur on the leaves.  Use  W. saharae is said to have healing properties due to the essential oils it contains. An infusion of the dried leaves is used against arthritis and epilepsy. Local healers use it to cure uterus infections. Local women use the plant as a perfume and \\"believe that the supernatural powers attributed to the plant make them more seductive\\".

The play was performed in amateur theatres regularly between 1928 and the 1940s and on radio. Roland revised it in 1955. It received its first professional production in 1976 at the Independent Theatre, Sydney http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowWork&workId;=CRV produced by John Tasker and starring Fay Kelton).Richard Lane, The Golden Age of Australian Radio Drama, Melbourne University Press, 1994 Currency Press published it in 1974, and again in 1986 with another of Roland's plays Granite Peak. Most recently, A Touch of Silk was broadcast on Australia's ABC Radio National on Sunday 2 January 2011 as part of the Playing the 20th Century series.http://www.abc.net.au/rn/playingthe20thcentury/ Other plays of the 1920s included Feet of Clay, a modern take on the Pygmalion myth, and the Gates of Bronze: a fantasy in four scenes. Roland's early writing for theatre is mostly romantic drama or comedy. Her later work was agit prop and highly political. She also wrote the screenplay for what is claimed as the first Australian \\"talkie\\", Spur of the Moment, in 1932, credited as Betty M. Davies.Betty M. Davies on IMDB Guido Baracchi and the Communist Party Roland met the wealthy Marxist intellectual Guido Baracchi, one of the founders of the Australian Communist Party, in the late 1920s. Having left her husband, she booked a passage to the UK in 1933 and discovered Baracchi, also recently separated, was a passenger on the same voyage. They began a relationship, and travelled together to the USSR, where Baracchi was to deliver documents to the Kremlin. While there, Roland worked on the Moscow Daily News, shared a room with Katharine Susannah Prichard, and smuggled literature into Nazi Germany. The first volume of her autobiography, Caviar For Breakfast (1979), was based on her diaries from this period. On their return to Australia, they moved to Sydney, building a house in Castlecrag.Biographical Register: ROLAND, Betty (1903‚Äì1996), Working Lives, University of Sydney Their daughter, Gilda, was born in 1937. In the late 1930s she wrote short, left-wing, agitprop plays, which she regarded as akin to political cartoons, for the New Theatre League in Sydney. The scripts were regularly published in Communist Review, a magazine published by the Communist Party of Australia and edited by Baracchi.Roland, Betty, War on the Waterfront ‚Äì a banned play, Illawarra Unity ‚Äì Journal of the Illawarra Branch of the Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, 7(1), 2007, 49‚Äì55 She separated from Baracchi in 1942, and for the rest of the 1940s supported herself and her daughter by writing radio plays, including The First Gentleman, Daddy Was Asleep, The White Cockade, A Woman Scorned, The Drums of Manalao and In His Steps. She also wrote a comic strip, The Conways, for the Sydney Morning Herald.The Conways by Betty Roland and John Santry, Sydney Morning Herald, 17 March 1949 From 1948 to 1950 she lived in the Montsalvat artists' colony at Eltham, Victoria. In 1951 she legally changed her name to Betty Roland, and the following year moved to London with Gilda, where she wrote for television and women's magazines, as well as children's books and comic strips for Girl and Swift. She returned to Australia in the early 1960s, continuing to write radio plays and children's books, and was a founding member of the Australian Society of Authors in 1963, serving on its management committee and becoming an honorary life member in 1993. She moved back into Montsalvat from 1973 to 1979, and wrote her second volume of autobiography, The Eye of the Beholder, about her time there. She published two more volumes of autobiography, An Improbable Life (1989) and The Devious Being (1990). She died in Sydney in 1996.

Lozano, Jr. and Arizona-born Marta Navarro.Interview of Monica Lozano by Shirley Biagi, Pg.1, Washington Press Club Foundation, 13 December 1993 Her paternal grandfather, Ignacio E. Lozano, Sr., a famous Mexican journalist was born on the border of Mexico and Texas. In 1913 founded La Prensa in San Antonio which became the largest Spanish daily publication in the United States.Hernandez, Sandra: \\"Stuck in Translation,\\" LA Weekly, 17 June 1999 La Prensa sold copies in New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. In 1926, with much help from his wife, Lozano's grandfather founded La Opini√≥n in Los Angeles, where La Prensa had had a particularly large following. Lozano's father studied journalism at Notre Dame University and, in 1953, took over La Opini√≥n after the death of her grandfather. Meanwhile, her grandmother, Alicia Elizondo de Lozano, returned to Texas to keep La Prensa in business.  Early life and education  Lozano was raised with her siblings in Newport Beach, Orange County, California. Although Marta Lozano had studied literature for about three years at UCLA before marriage, she was a stay-at-home mom to Lozano and her siblings, while their father commuted to L.A. to work on the paper. In 1976, Ignacio E. Lozano, Jr. was appointed US Ambassador to El Salvador by President Gerald Ford. Lozano first attended school in Corona del Mar, but graduated from Santa Catalina School in Monterey in 1974. She then studied sociology and political science at the University of Oregon. While there, she became interested in the new field of women's studies and worked for the Eugene, Oregon-based feminist newspaper Women's Press. Leaving the university in 1976, Lozano traveled with a friend through Mexico and South America. She lived in San Francisco, where she earned a degree in printing technology at the City College.Telgen, Diane and Jim Kamp: Notable Hispanic American women, Issue 68, 1998Ruiz, Vicki and Virginia Sanchez Korrol: Latinas in the United States: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1, Indiana University Press, 2006, She also worked on a couple of bilingual newspapers. Then in November 1985, she went to work with her family as managing editor of La Opini√≥n. Early in the following year, her brother, Jos√© I.

The couple eventually divorced. Lozano began to work at La Opini√≥n at a time when AIDS was still a taboo issue, especially among the predominantly Catholic Latino communities, and she fought hard against prejudice and fear to address the disease. She was also alarmed by the high rates of infant mortality among Hispanic women and she worked on stories covering prenatal care. Lozano also oversaw an increase of what she called \\"proactive\\" political journalism. California Governor Pete Wilson and Senator Barbara Boxer were interviewed in its pages. She became publisher of El Eco del Valle (in the San Fernando Valley) in 1990. Her husband, previously working in the circulation department of La Opini√≥n, went to organize the distribution of El Eco del Valle. Around the same time, Lozano was promoted to Associate Publisher, under her brother, at La Opini√≥n.  Board seats  Lozano has been on the board of directors at the Walt Disney Company since 2000.

Life Lyttelton was the third son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet, by his wife Christian, daughter of Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet of Stowe, Buckinghamshire. He was born at Hagley, Worcestershire, and educated at Eton College and University College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 10 October 1732, and graduated B.C.L. March 1745, D.C.L. June 1745. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1738, but soon abandoned it for the church, being ordained in 1742. Almost immediately (13 August 1743) he was instituted to the rectory of Alvechurch, Worcestershire. Through his family influence he was made chaplain to George II in December 1747, installed as Dean of Exeter on 4 June 1748, and collated to a prebendal stall in Exeter Cathedral on 5 May 1748. In 1761 the Dean describes the cathedral library as having over 6,000 books and some good manuscripts. He describes the work which has been done to repair and list the contents of the manuscripts. At the same time the muniments and records had been cleaned and moved to a suitable muniment room. George Grenville, a cousin, pressed for Lyttelton's advancement. He was promoted to the see of Carlisle, and was consecrated in Whitehall Chapel on 21 March 1762, but his health was not good. He died unmarried in Clifford Street, London, on 22 December 1768, and was buried at St John the Baptist Church, Hagley, on 30 December. The chancel of that church had been ornamented in 1764 at his expense with shields of arms of his paternal ancestors. Works Lyttelton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1743, and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1746; and in 1765 he was promoted to be President of the Society of Antiquaries. He contributed to the Philosophical Transactions, and wrote for Archaeologia (vols. 1-3.). Rosemary Sweet writes: Legacy William Borlase addressed to him his volume on Scilly (1758), Andrew Coltee Ducarel inscribed to him a work on Anglo-Norman antiquities (1767), and Samuel Pegge wrote to him an essay on the coins of Cunobelin (1766). Lyttelton bequeathed his manuscripts to the Society of Antiquaries. They formed the basis of Treadway Russell Nash's History of Worcestershire, and of the works of later writers on the county. Stebbing Shaw's History of Staffordshire was partly compiled from them, and from the same source many improvements were made in Sampson Erdeswicke's Survey of Staffordshire (1820 and 1844). Not the least of his impact was in his encouragement of his ward Samuel Hellier to study at Exeter College, Oxford, where he developed a passion for music.Catherine Frew and Arnold Myers, \\"Sir Samuel Hellier's 'Musicall Instruments'\\", Galpin Society Journal, vol. 56, June 2003.

It was formerly known as Mimulus moschatus. Distribution It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California to the Rocky Mountains, where it grows in moist, partially shaded habitat in mountains, woodlands, chaparral, and other areas. It also occurs in eastern North America where it may be native or introduced.Ewing, B. C. (2001). New England Plant Conservation Program Conservation and Research Plan: Mimulus moschatus It is known from Chile and parts of Europe, including England and Finland, where it grows wild after having escaped cultivation.Hear.org Reports Description This is a rhizomatous perennial herb which is hairless to hairy, sometimes slimy in texture, and generally musky in scent. It is variable in appearance. The prostrate or upright stem grows up to 30 centimeters long. The oppositely arranged leaves are mostly oval in shape and may reach 6 centimeters long. The tubular flower is yellow in color, its tube just a few millimeters wide and widening at the lobed mouth. It may be up to 2.6 centimeters long. Loss of scent Erythranthe moschata was widely grown and sold commercially in Victorian times for its fragrance, and is well known for the story that all cultivated and known wild specimens simultaneously lost their previous strong musk scent around the year 1913.See correspondence in The Gardeners' Chronicle vols. 75: 78 (1924), 88: 259, 349, 399, 457, 520 ( 1930), and 89: 17, 36, 116, 190, 202, 207 (1931) Writing in 1934 in the journal Nature, E. Hardy described a Lancashire nurseryman, Thomas Wilkinson, who in 1898 found that his plants developed a \\"rank, leafy smell\\"; five years later, after leaving the trade, he noticed that plants then on sale were scentless.Hardy, \\"Lost Fragrance of Musk\\", Nature, v 134 (1934), 3383, 327 While it was sometimes claimed that strongly scented plants could still be found in the wild, Arthur William Hill, in a 1930 article in The Gardeners' Chronicle, presented evidence from British Columbia claiming that wild populations had also lost their scent. A variety of suggestions were put forward for a solution to the mystery, such as that the scent of the original cultivated form had been a rare recessive feature, which later disappeared as a result of uncontrolled pollination or the introduction of other genes from the wild population. Other explanations were given based on changes in climate, that humans had lost the ability to detect the smell, that the scent had been produced by a parasite, or that the loss of scent was a myth. W.B. Gourlay (1947) suggested that the phenomenon could be explained if the highly scented cultivated form had been reproduced vegetatively from a single aberrant plant, first raised in England from the original batch of seed, and later replaced by unscented plants grown from other sources of seed.Gourlay, W. B. \\"The lost scent of Mimulus moschatus\\". J R. Hort. Soc. 72, 285-287 David Douglas first described the species and in 1826 near Fort Vancouver collected seed from which the first examples in England were raised; it is notable that he made no reference to a strong musk scent in his field notes.Gardening Illustrated, v.65, (1948), 6 Moreover, there are references as early as 1917 to plants in the wild having a wide range of characteristics between scentless and strongly scented, with the latter being \\"very much the exception\\".See Journal of Botany, British and Foreign, v.55 (1917), 260-261 During the 1920s and 1930s, at the height of botanists' interest in the 'lost scent' phenomenon, there were several reports of strongly-scented moschatus specimens being discovered in the wild, such as in 1931 on Texada Island, British Columbia.

It may cover vehicles with electrical means of propulsion, such as an electric car, as well as electricity playing a role in their functionality. Voltages vary widely between applications. In general, vehicle electrification refers to efforts to design mild to full hybrid vehicle to full electric vehicles as well as converting some of the non-electrical vehicle systems like hydraulic suspension-systems to smart electro-magnetic suspensions, or All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) to eAWD where AWD is automatically engaged only under certain conditions (like certain low vehicle speed range) to leave more juice for full electric vehicle range as opposed to AWD all the time which sips more juices from battery. Aviation Fixed-wing, and rotor- wing aircraft can be found in either 12 volt or 24 volt configurations, however most modern aircraft are strictly 24 volt, direct current. This electrical power is generated by engine driven generators. A wet-cell lead acid battery, or Ni-cad (nickel cadmium) battery is used for starting or powering systems without engines running. On board, this DC power is changed via inverters to 115 v, 400 Hz AC power for different aircraft systems. Land vehicles This section will cover common voltages for different vehicle applications. 6 volt Automobiles engineered prior to the 1940s had 6-volt systems in them. However, 6-volts is a common voltage for single 3-cell deep-cycle lead-acid batteries for applications such as golf carts, though they have 24 volts or 36 volts for their electric motors. 12 volt 12 volt systems are by far the most common voltage system for vehicles in general. Primarily the voltage was devised to overcome limitations of old 6-volt systems as, by the 1950s starting motors needed to become more powerful, but needed more power with less current as well as a way to cut down on wire gauge as more equipment came along and put a greater load on the system. Over time, 12 volt systems evolved to have mainstream niche fields like car audio which has spanned across 24 volt 24 volt systems are common in military and commercial truck applications. It is also a secondary voltage system for switch-mode power supplies with parallel-to-series relays for facilitating engine starting on diesel engines as they require more compression than regular gas. 48 volt Rail transport References See also *Car audio *Car battery *Cigar lighter receptacle *Electrification Category:Electrification ","title":"Vehicle electrification"},{"id":"24691188","title":"Daisy Tahan"},{"id":"24691189","text":"The Ellerslie Depot was originally built in 1891.

During a professional career of over 43 years he has worked on book jacket covers, film posters, advertising, and games, as well as contributing to many BBC TV and commercial TV programs and projects.  Early life  Peter Andrew Jones was born into the relative poverty of post-war Britain in Islington, north London, the son of Reginald and Catherine Jones, his father an engineer. Showing interest in the visual arts from an early age, he describes the London of his early boyhood as 'smog-ridden and grey' with little for children to do, and took to painting to fill time and \\"colour his world\\". He also began to develop a lifelong love of aviation and space technology encouraged by commercial Airfix kits and drawing fighter aircraft at RAF Leuchers in Scotland when visiting his mother's relatives in Fifeshire, Scotcland. At school he continued to pursue his interest in art, and won numerous school prizes for his work. Many Sunday visits with his parents to London's National and Tate Galleries even before the age of twelve further fixed his interest in a future career in the field. With the encouragement of his art tutor, Bob Spearman, Jones attended Saint Martins School of Art in London in 1970, where he studied graphic design, graduating in 1974. At the college, a visiting lecturer suggested Jones combine his interest in realism with imaginative skills, drawing Jones into the Fantasy and Science Fiction fields. Whilst at St. Martins Jones took the decision to \\"become an illustrator\\". Within a month he was producing his first commercial work for Puffin Books, the cover for Penelope Farmer's A Castle of Bone.  Career  The Complete Enchanter, cover for an edition of The Compleat Enchanter collection of fantasy tales by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, later appearing on the cover of White Dwarf magazine issue 54. He commenced several decades of producing cover art for science fiction and fantasy publications. During his career he has provided book covers for science fiction and fantasy authors including Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Greg Bear, Larry Niven, Philip K. Dick, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Harry Harrison. An anthology of Jones' work was published under the title Peter Jones: Solar Wind by Paper Tiger in 1980, covering his science fiction and fantasy illustrations up to the year 1980. Since 1999 he has been publishing the book himself through his current company along with several other editions including further volumes of the book. He also produced images for film publicity, creating the movie posters for The Sword and The Sorcerer and Alligator, contributed during the early 1980s to television shows including BBC comedy The Two Ronnies Show and the BBC's '80s sci-fi adaptation of The Tripods, and has produced cover illustrations for video game publishers such as US Gold, Psygnosis and Virgin Interactive. Jones has worked for the Fighting Fantasy game books originated by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone in the 1980s, in particular providing the original cover for the first title in the series in 1982. It is often stated on the internet that the book's publishers were distressed at Jones' illustration for the cover of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain as he designed it with space for the title in the centre of the front cover, eschewing the publishing tradition of placing titles at the top of the page,; however, it was something he did after being called-in to rescue the book's launch being told by the publisher \\"we've no idea how to do this, we don't understand this new type of book\\" and was asked to 'go away, and come back with something revolutionary'. Inspired by the layouts of many American romance titles at the time, given to him by a Dutch editor in Rotterdam while en route to the Frankfurt Book Fair, he decided to break tradition in the UK market and use a similar layout. He provided several further pieces for the Puffin FF series, including covers for Starship Traveller, Talisman of Death, and The Riddling Reaver, as well as over twenty cover illustrations for Joe Dever's Lone Wolf game books and a number of covers for Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson's Falcon series. Also during this time, a number of Jones' fantasy images appeared on the covers of Games Workshop's White Dwarf magazine. From covers for the magazine, Jones went on to produce game art for GW's boardgame adaptation of the first Fighting Fantasy title The Warlock of Firetop Mountain; cover art for GW's edition of Chaosium's Stormbringer RPG followed. The processes involved in Jones' production of the cover for Stormbringer were detailed in an Illuminations expos√© in White Dwarf issue 90. During the 1990s Jones further pursued his interest in aviation-related art, becoming involved with the RAF Benevolent Fund, and a number of World War II pilots. His illustrations of aircraft and aerial combat can be found in a variety of books on the subject, and his work in the field has been commended by pilots, including one-time World War II pilot George H. W. Bush. During the late 1970s Jones set up his own design studio and licensing company, Solar Wind Ltd, based in London's Fulham Road then Wimbledon in 1980, London, to facilitate his ongoing illustration work and manage the licensing of his images. Solar Wind was closed down in the late 1990s, when he decided to develop the name for a wider remit, bringing together work in various fields. Solar Wind was transferred to Shropshire in late 1999 with Jones, from where he now operates his current company. Jones' current work includes ongoing genre and wildlife illustration, the production of handmade and self-published books, cards and prints, and occasional private commissions. He is also working on further self-published collections of his work, including Affetti, Rural Dreams, Simulacra, Tales from the wood, about the Faeries who inhabit his studio's garden, and an illustrated dark fantasy novel series titled Crux Millennium.  Style and technique  As a child Jones enjoyed the formative influence of popular media during the 1960s, including The Eagle's Dan Dare, DC's Superman and Batman comics, and television programmes like Thunderbirds, Doctor Who and Star Trek. Later he was exposed to the rash of alternative cultural phenomena of the decade, discovering underground artists like Robert Crumb, Mick English and Martin Sharp, and Pop art such as that of Peter Blake and David Hockney. Salvador Dal√≠, who he considered 'science fantasy', was also a guiding influence during his early years. Whilst at college, Jones was introduced to American artists and illustrators like Norman Rockwell, Andrew Wyeth and James Bama, frequent illustrator of the Doc Savage books. Bama in particular made a lasting impact, particularly his Western genre art, and Jones still considers him both a genius and the single most major influence on his work. Jones' science fiction and fantasy work tends to be predominated by images featuring central characters against the backdrop of other-worldly landscapes. Jones works primarily in hand-mixed oil paint and also acrylic, using a unique painting medium he invented that he calls \\"acryloil\\". In recent years he has also adopted the use of a Macintosh computer and drawing tablet, though primarily for editorial purposes and not the creation of paintings. Jones' handmade prints, sold via his website, are sometimes embellished with gold and rare pigments such as lapis lazuli. Cover illustrations such as that for the Stormbringer RPG are executed in alternating layers of oil and acrylic colour, including, at that time, the use of an airbrush, on an emulsion-primed hardboard support, in the case of Stormbringer, lightly dusted with plaster whilst wet and sealed with an oil wash. White Dwarf's art editor John Blanche said of Jones' take on Elric, \\"Peter's strong design sense and dramatic choice of colours have combined to produce the definitive image of Elric, as the battle-crazed albino, dominated by his demon sword, Stormbringer. . .\\"  References   External links  A page on Jones at Abandonart *A page on Jones at Sci-fi-o-rama *A page on Jones' Fighting Fantasy contributions at Gamebooks.org *A partial list of Jones' gaming credits on pen-paper.net HWGA 5000 Category:1951 births Category:English illustrators Category:British speculative fiction artists Category:Fantasy artists Category:Fighting Fantasy Category:Game artists Category:Games Workshop artists Category:Living people Category:Role-playing game artists Category:Science fiction artists ","title":"Peter Andrew Jones"},{"id":"24691448","text":"Vagabond Bones is a studio album by heavy metal band Helix, released on November 17, 2009.HELIX - Vagabond Bones To Receive US Release Via Perris Records It is Helix' 12th full-length studio album and 21st album released overall.

It is the oldest church of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. History The church, built by the Oratorians installed on the slopes, was completed in 1670, with the exception of the fa√ßade that was built in 1756 by architect Toussaint Loyer who also lengthened the nave. On 19 June 1791, the Oratory Church became a parish church and took the name of St. Polycarp, as a tribute to Polycarp of Smyrna, master of Saint Pothinus and Irenaeus, who were the first two bishops of Lyon. The heart of Pauline-Marie Jaricot, founder of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, currently remains in a chapel of the church. The church has a famous organ, built by Augustine Zeiger in 1841. Adrien Rougier was the titular organist of the church from 1932 to 1945. In 1982, the church was classified as monument historique. Architecture The church has a facade decorated with four Corinthian pilasters topped by a triangular pediment. Louis Janmot made the painting depicting the Last Supper which is placed in the apse.

He was bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Baoding.  Early Life  He was born in Siao Wang Ting (south of Beijing), China on December 29, 1907.  Priesthood  He was ordained a priest on December 22, 1934 in Rome and he shortly thereafter returned to China to work in the diocese of Baoding. He worked in parishes, schools, seminaries, and in the Catholic Relief Agency during 1937‚Äì1951. His work took him to several provinces in China.  Episcopate  He was appointed bishop of Baoding diocese on April 12, 1951 and ordained on June 24 of that year. He was consecrated by the archbishop of Hankou, Giuseppe Ferrucio Maurizio Ros√†.  Persecution  The Chinese government sought to control religious activities in the country and in 1957 it instituted the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), which is a government mandated organization to oversee the Roman Catholic Church in China. The organization required the church to disavow the authority of the pope and conform to the dictates of the government. Bishop Fan, as well as many other Catholics loyal to the successor of Peter, would not renounce the Pope's authority and he voiced criticism of the CCPA. In 1958, Bishop Fan was arrested and sent to a penal farm (a type of forced labour camp) until he was released in 1969. He was kept under continual surveillance until he was arrested again in 1978 for illegal religious activities. He was released in 1979, however, he was arrested again in 1982 for \\"colluding with foreign forces to jeopardize the sovereignty and security of the motherland\\"NY Times article https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/25/obituaries/peter-joseph- fan-84-a-bishop-imprisoned-by-china-for-beliefs.html (it was alleged he had had contacts with the Vatican and was secretly ordaining priests in his diocese). He was released in 1987, but placed under house arrest and continually moved around. In November 1990 he went missing and was assumed to have been dead.  Death  On April 16, 1992 police officers dumped a plastic bag holding his frozen body in front of his relatives home. The government claimed he had died on April 13 from pneumonia. His body was found to have had broken bones and other injuries that may have resulted from torture. He may have been the longest serving prisoner of conscience in the world. The government ordered that he should have a quiet funeral, but this was defied and a crowd of 30,000 people came to see the funeral. Local priests and bishops conducted novena prayers for the bishop. There have been calls to open up his case for canonization.

Saehan was born on the former General Motors Korea, which encountered difficulties when the South-Korean market collapsed, following the first round of oil rises in 1973. This joint-venture, 50-50 between GM and Shinjin, consisted on a car assembly plant in Bupyong, a truck assembly plant in Pusan and a foundry at Inchon. In November 1976, Shinjin Motors faced financial problems and sold its 50% stake in Saehan to the Korea Development Bank (KDB). In 1978, the Daewoo Group acquired the equity stake and management rights from KDB. The company was renamed Daewoo Motor Co. in January 1983.  History  The company was first established as National Motor in 1937 in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon, South Korea. The name was changed to Saenara Motor in November 1962. Saenara was assembling and selling Datsun Bluebird P310s.Short-lived Saenara sedan earned a place in history books http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2907920 Very first automobile company in Korea, Saenara was equipped with modern assembly facilities, and was established after the Automobile Industry Promotion Policy was announced by the South Korean government in 1962. Saenara Motor was then bought by Shinjin Industrial in 1965, which changed its name to Shinjin Motor after establishing collaborations with Toyota. Shinjin range included various Toyota models, such as the Publica, T40 Corona and Crown. After Toyota's withdrawal in 1972, Shinjin Motor started a joint venture with General Motors under the name General Motors Korea (GMK), but was renamed again in November 1976 to Saehan Motor. GMK shortly sold their Rekord under the GMK marque, together with the Holden Torana based Chevrolet 1700. When GMK was renamed to Saehan, the 1700 became Saehan Camina. Saehan's range was composed of diverse GM models: the Saehan Gemini was based on 1974 Isuzu's Bellett Gemini, then replaced by the Maepsy (known under the Saehan Bird name in export versions), which was a development of the Gemini. Its pickup derivate, the Saehan Max, is now a part of Korean automobile history.

BAI Communications. The Flitplane was designed as a low-cost aircraft with the look of an antique aircraft design for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category with its maximum empty weight requirement. In late 2019 the company website had been taken down and it is likely that production had ended. Development The Flitplane was designed in 1995 by Ed Fisher who also designed the Skylite ultralight and the Micro-Mong home-built aircraft. The design was acquired by Joe Naylor and Mark W. Klotz who formed Wings of Freedom Aviation Inc. in 1996 to develop the design and market it. Naylor and Klotz made many changes to the design but retained the antique look of the aircraft and its distinctive large triangular windshield. The Flitplane's fuselage is fabricated from a welded truss of 4130 steel tubing. The wings are of aluminum \\"ladder-type\\" construction, are strut-braced and utilize jury struts. The fuel tank is integrated into the wing centre-section. The wings and tail are covered in doped aircraft fabric. The engine is mounted in front of the high wing, above the cockpit. The original powerplant was a Cuyuna 460 engine, with a Rotax 447 optional. Later engine options added included the Hirth F-33, the Zanzottera MZ 201 and the Kawasaki 440 engine. The conventional landing gear is suspended using fibreglass axles. The tailwheel is steerable. The controls are conventional three-axis and include full-span ailerons. The large, flat-plate triangular windshield protects the pilot from the propeller blast and has distinctive cut-outs for the rudder pedals. The Flitplane is available as plans, a complete kit, partial kits or as a finished and ready-to-fly aircraft. The company claims that the aircraft can be built from the kit in 100 hours or 500 hours from plans.

Abd al-Malek won over his rival at the battle of ar-Rukn, also er-Roken. Mulay Muhammed fled to Marrakesh and would continue resisting Abd al-Malek for a long time. Abd al- Malek entered Fez victoriously in March 1576. Abd al-Malek recognized the Ottoman sultan Murad III as Caliph, and reorganized his army along Ottoman lines and adopted Ottoman customs, but negotiated for the Ottoman troops to leave his country in exchange for a large payment in gold. Meanwhile, Mulay Muhammed fled to Spain and then Portugal, when Sebastian of Portugal promised to help him regain his throne. This led to an expedition and the Battle of Ksar El Kebir in 1578,also known as the Battle of Three Kings which was a considerable defeat for the Portuguese and having lost their childless monarch Portugal passed into the hands of Spanish throne.

It was built in approximately 1450, partly replacing an older (probably 14th-century) structure‚Äîalthough part of this survives behind the present street frontage. It has been expanded, altered and renovated many times since, and fell into such disrepair by the 1930s that demolition was considered. It has since been refurbished and is now a restaurant, although it has been put to various uses during its existence. Secret rooms, whose purpose has never been confirmed for certain, were discovered in the 19th century. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance, and it has been described as Crawley's \\"most prestigious medieval building\\" and \\"the finest timber-framed house between London and Brighton\\". History Crawley's development as a permanent settlement dates from the early 13th century, when a charter was granted for a market to be held; a church was founded by 1267. The area, on the edge of the High Weald, probably gained its name‚Äîreferring to a crow-infested forest clearing‚Äîby the 10th century. Some sources assert that a building stood on the site of the Ancient Priors by this time, claiming that it was built between 1150 and 1250 and was used as a chantry-house or priest's house associated with St John the Baptist's Church. Extensive archaeological investigation in the 1990s determined that although the possibility of an older building on the site could not be ruled out, the oldest part of the present structure is 14th-century and the main part (fronting the east side of the High Street) dates from about 1450 and incorporates no older fabric. Crawley's oldest buildings surrounded the High Street, a north‚Äìsouth route which straddled the boundary of Crawley and Ifield parishes and formed part of the main road from London to Brighton and Shoreham on the English Channel coast. Burgage plots‚Äîmedieval land divisions with houses or other buildings which were rented from the Lord of the Manor‚Äîwere particularly clearly defined on the east side of the High Street; the buildings within them usually faced the High Street, but plots were sometimes subdivided. This is believed to have happened at the site of the Ancient Priors, where the main (15th-century) part of the building faces west on to the High Street, and the older section faces south and is hidden from view. The latter is known to be the oldest structure remaining on Crawley High Street. The building was originally used as a dwelling house, and the accompanying burgage plot was used for small-scale agriculture. The first confirmed owners were a family of colliers, who acquired it in 1608. It passed through many owners throughout the 17th century, some of whom rented the building to others; furthermore, in many cases the two parts of the building were occupied by different families or tenants. By 1668, when it was owned by a resident of Worth, the whole building had become an inn. Known at first as The Whyte Harte, its spelling was later standardised to The White Hart. Around this time, the entire messuage consisted of the inn itself, some barns, an orchard and a garden. In the early 18th century, the prominent local ironmaster Leonard Gale‚Äîholder of much property in the Crawley area‚Äîowned the building, and is believed to have lived there. By 1753, when the Brett family (who had held the property for 26 years) sold the messuage for ¬£473 (¬£ as of ), it also had stables, and covered about . Within a decade of this sale, the building was no longer used as an inn and was renamed Old White Hart Farm. (A new, larger White Hart Inn was built nearby and opened in 1790.) By the 19th century it became two separate entities again: according to the United Kingdom Census 1841, two families lived in the main building and a woman and seven children occupied the older section. They were tenants, and the owner had added large amounts of farmland to the estate: as well as the original , another lay outside the old burgage boundaries. In 1881, the building was converted into a single entity again and became a Temperance Hotel for a few years. During the renovation work, hidden rooms were discovered. Visitors to the hotel included Lord Kitchener, but the venture failed and a shop unit with residential accommodation above was established instead. Various shopkeepers passed through until an antiques dealer, Mr Parkhurst, took the tenancy in 1911. He changed the name to The Ancient Priest's House (and later The Ancient Prior's House, which evolved into Ancient Priors) and used it as a showroom for his antique furniture, further enhancing the ancient appearance by removing plaster to reveal the internal timberwork and replacing modern windows with medieval-style diamond- mullioned equivalents. During this period, the owner tried unsuccessfully to auction the property, and the associated landholding reverted to the original because the rest of the estate had been acquired by the railway, the local council and other parties who wanted to build on it. After Parkhurst's death, the Ancient Priors stood empty and went into decline. By the late 1930s, the local council wanted to demolish it to allow for redevelopment of the High Street. Harry Charman, who owned a clothing shop nearby, bought it in 1937 and renovated it, converting it into three self-contained units. The main part of the fa√ßade became a tearoom; the old southern section was used as a sweet shop; and the northernmost part of the main building had various uses, including for many years a hairdressing salon. During the 1940s John George Haigh the acid-bath murderer, used on the occasion of their visits to his workshop in nearby Leopold Road to entertain his victim Mrs Olive Durand- Deacon to tea at the Ancient Priors. By the 1970s, the tearoom was upgraded to a fully licensed restaurant. Crawley-born boxer Alan Minter, who won a bronze medal at the 1972 Olympic Games and became Middleweight champion of the world in 1979, bought the restaurant in 1977 together with his manager. It was renamed \\"Minter's Restaurant & Wine Bar\\" and had an inn sign depicting a bare- knuckle prizefighter outside it. Minter ran it himself until 1980, when new management took over. They bought the premises in 1983 and renamed it \\"Solomon's Restaurant\\", but stopped trading on 27 February 1988 and sold the building to an estate agency. The owners said they could not compete with the popularity of fast-food outlets, and claimed that a poor atmosphere in the town at night discouraged people from eating out. Since then, it has become a restaurant again, operating as the Crawley outlet of the ASK restaurant chain. The Ancient Priors was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 21 June 1948; this defines it as a \\"particularly important building of more than special interest\\" and of national importance. As of February 2001, it was one of 12 Grade II* structures, and 100 listed buildings and structures of all grades, in the Borough of Crawley. Architecture The roof of the building has a prominent chimney-stack. The Ancient Priors is a \\"complete and well- preserved example\\" of a Wealden hall-house, and is more elaborate than most of the other hall-houses in the north of Sussex. It has a roughly L-shaped plan, formed by the south-facing 14th-century section and the west-facing structure built in about 1450. In the late 19th century, a small eastward-projecting extension was built at the rear of the northern side, making the building more U-shaped; this part is of brick, but the rest of the structure is timber- framed with some plasterwork. The roof uses \\"Horsham slab\\" tiles made of locally dug clay. Earlier sources asserted that the southern wing of the building was a later addition to the main part: the early 16th century was suggested as the likely construction date. The work undertaken in 1993 disproved this, and instead found that this part, with two bays, was older and originally had three bays. Although it is now joined to the main part of the building, it was a separate hall-house with a two-bay open hall (one bay of which survives) and discrete bays at the west and east ends. The internal timber work includes crown posts, arch-braces and some decorative panelling. There is also a chimney-stack and fireplace at the east end. The main frontage, facing the High Street, is about long from north to south. An open hall, formed of two bays of about each, forms the main part of the interior. The exterior has gabled cross-wings at the north and south ends flanking a recessed central section. The cross-wings were jettied, but this has been partly filled in. The northern wing, forming the northwest corner of the present building, shares the same roofline and framing as the main hall, but the southern wing (adjacent to the 14th-century part of the building) is framed separately. Crown posts, arched braces, purlins, open trusses and tie- beams can be seen inside; their quality has been described as \\"very superior\\" and \\"remarkable\\", and the roof structure as a whole is described as unusual for the area. No original windows remain, but traces of an oriel window have been found; another is believed to have existed near the present window in the eastern face. A large chimney-stack was added in the 16th century when the upper storey was added and the building ceased to be an open hall-house. Cellars existed until the 1960s, when they were filled in after they flooded. Hidden rooms The discovery of secret rooms during the renovations of 1881 led to much speculation. Evidence suggests that they were used first by Roman Catholic priests during the Reformation‚Äîeither as a safe hiding place or as a venue for secret services during the time when public Roman Catholic worship was banned. The locally popular allegation that the building was also used by smugglers is also believed to be true: smugglers from nearby Copthorne‚Äîa notorious centre of such activity‚Äîare thought to have based themselves there in the 18th and early 19th centuries. There were three secret rooms: one on the upper storey between two of the bedrooms, another behind a fireplace in the kitchen of the 14th-century part of the building, and a third under the floor by another fireplace. The first of these rooms, which measured , was accessed through a trapdoor in the floor. A meat hook hanging from the ceiling of a passageway near the main kitchen had to be pulled in a certain direction to unlock the trapdoor. The room under the floor was reached in a similarly awkward way: if a carving above the mantelpiece was twisted in a certain way, the fireplace would move outwards to reveal a set of steps leading down to the hiding place. All of the hidden rooms have now been removed or filled in.

It includes annuals and procumbent perennials which occur primarily in Mexico and Central America, with one species extending as far north as the state of Texas in the United States and another species widely distributed across the West Indies, South America, Africa, and Asia.Feddema, C. 1966. Systematic Studies in the Genus Sclerocarpus and the Genus Aldama (Compositae). Ph.D. dissertation. University of Michigan. The genus is distinguished morphologically by the pales, which are modified to completely and tightly enclose the mature cypsela (achene) and often have a tuberculate surface. Some species of Aldama have a somewhat similar modification of the pales but in those the pale surface is irregularly wrinkled and pitted rather than tuberculate. Sclerocarpus is a member of the sunflower subtribe, Helianthinae, and is placed by molecular data as a relatively basal member of the group.Schilling, E, E. and J. L. Panero 2002. A revised classification of subtribe Helianthinae (Asteraceae: Heliantheae). I. Basal lineages. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 140: 65-76. The plant Sclerocarpus africanus (Jacq), locally known in Igbo dialect (Nigeria) as ‚Äúnli-atulu‚Äù and Manding language (Senegal) as Bambara-goni, is used for treating gonorrhea and other venereal diseases in Nigerian ethno- medicine.Ayo,R. G.;Ndiombueze, J. A. and Tor-Anyiin, T. A. 2014. Phytochemical and Anti-microbial Screening of the Leaves and Twigs of Sclerocarpus africanus (Jacq). European Journal of Medicinal Plants 4(4): 473-482. Phytochemical screening showed presence of carbohydrates, tannins and saponins. Flavonoids and anthraquinone glycosides were found only in the ethanol and methanol extracts. Anti-microbial screening of methanol and ethanol extracts showed activity against the following human pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus pyogenes, Shigella dysenteriae, Candida albicans and Candida thrusei, with MIC value of 2.5 mg/ml; while Neisseria gonorrhoeae was inhibited at MIC 1.25 mg/ml.which had an observered MBC of 5 mg/ ml for ethanol extract. Similar MBC/MFC values were obtained for methanol extract except Shigella dysenteriae which had MBC of 5 mg/ml. Petroleum ether extract was active against S. aureus, S. typhi, S. dysenteriae and N. gonorrhoeae with MIC value of 5 mg/ml and MBC/MFC value 10 mg/ml; no activity was observed for S. pyogenes, C. albicans and C. thrusei; N. gonorrhoeae was most inhibited. Results obtained justify the ethno-medicinal use of this plant in treatment of gonorrhea and other venereal diseases caused by the test micro organisms.Ayo,R. G.;Ndiombueze, J. A. and Tor-Anyiin, T.

Synopsis Plantarum 2: 478-479 in Latin It includes annuals, herbaceous perennials, and shrubs. They range from the western United States south through Central and South America to Argentina, with the center of diversity occurring in Mexico. The genus is named for British physician and botanist John Sims (1749‚Äì1831). Although some species are relatively rare, others have become common weeds that line the roadsides and fields of Mexico, often forming dense stands mixed with Tithonia and other Asteraceae. Some species are known by the common name bushsunflower. Description and systematics A feature that characterizes many of the species of the genus and helps to distinguish them from related genera is the extremely flattened cypsela (achene). There are, however, several species in which the cypsela is biconvex, and these are recognized as belonging to Simsia by a group of other, mostly technical features, including nodal disks (stipule-like appendages at the base of the petioles), relatively long and narrow ray ovaries, and long and tapering style branches that lack a pronounced apical appendage. The genus was thoroughly studied by SpoonerSpooner, D. M. 1990. Systematics of Simsia (Compositae-Heliantheae). Systematic Botany Monographs 30: 1-90. using comparative morphology, chromosome counts, and crossing experiments, and based on samples from wide- ranging field work. Subsequently two new species have been documented, and additional species are being transferred into the genus. Although at one time, Simsia was considered to be related to other genera with flattened cypselae, such as Encelia, it is now firmly established that Simsia is part of subtribe Helianthinae (the taxonomic group which includes the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus), and is a close relative of Tithonia All of the species for which chromosome counts have been made are diploid (x = 17), and crossing experiments suggest that there are few barriers to hybridization between species of the genus. Natural hybridization appears to occur and may complicate identification of some specimens, particularly involving the weedy species such as S. foetida, S. amplexicaulis, and S. lagascaeformis. ; SpeciesFlann, C (ed) 2009+ Global Compositae Checklist The Plant List search for SimsiaBiota of North America Program 2013 county distribution maps * Simsia amplexicaulis (Cav.)

This was done in 1667. In 1668 Riquet built a loading basin, near Revel, on the rigole de la plaine between Pont Crouzet, on the river Sor, and Naurouze, called Port Louis. The feeder between this point and Naurouze was expanded in order for boats to ferry stones. Fourteen locks were put in place. In 1669 Riquet widened the rigole de la plaine enough to support navigation. It was opened to traffic in 1670 from Revel, to Naurouze. Pierre Borel had the original idea for this feature.

The initiator of creation of the party was Raman Skirmunt (he called himself \\"Belarusian\\"). In November 1905 he published a manifest of the Regional party of Lithuania and Ruthenia that in fact was a party program which demanded introduction of democratic freedoms and especially the freedom of national life and equality of nationalities as well as regional autonomy for the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania and protection of private property.

The programme called for regional autonomy, equality of all nations, introduction of education native languages, and considered alienation of estates as unacceptable. Eduard Vaynilovich (he called himself \\"Belarusian\\") was elected chairman of the party. The party had its newspaper called Glos Polski (\\"Polish voice\\", 1907). Representatives of the Kaunas province and Skirmunt did not join the party because of its being too Poland-oriented and ignoring the interests of Lithuanian minority and Belarusians. The party dissolved in 1908 and came back to life for a short time during World War I. With the revival of Poland as an independent state the krajowcy movement disappeared completely.

He has also represented the Philippines at international level. De Jong has played professionally in the Netherlands, Belgium, Indonesia and the Philippines. Formerly a winger, he was later converted to a defensive midfielder and has been likened to his namesake Nigel de Jong. Club career Youth Born in Breda, Netherlands, De Jong began his career with Gloria UC and moved to NAC Breda in 2004 after he was scouted. Turnhout In August 2009, De Jong moved abroad and signed a one-year deal for newly promoted Belgian Second Division club Turnhout. On 16 August 2009, he made his first-team debut in the 1‚Äì0 defeat against Royal Antwerp in the Belgian Cup. Three days later, he made his league debut in the 1‚Äì1 draw against Tienen. Veendam After his stint in Belgium, he returned to the Netherlands to find a new club. On 28 June 2010, it was reported that De Jong, along with number of other new players, would be joining Veendam at the start of their pre-season training as trialists. He would also feature regularly in their friendly matches and by mid July, he was one of the players that was in contention to earn a contract. He eventually signed a one-year deal with the option of a one-year extension. However, he would miss the start of the season due to his transfer papers not being ready. On 27 August 2010, De Jong was involved with the team for the first time as he was part of the matchday squad against Zwolle. He would be an unused substitute as Veendam lost 2‚Äì0. It would be one of five times he would be a part of Veendam's matchday squad until the winter break, all as an unused substitute. Having failed to secure a spot in the first team, the club announced on 4 January 2011 that they and De Jong have jointly decided to terminate his contract. Persiba Balikpapan On 17 February 2011, it was reported that De Jong began trials with Indonesia Super League club Sriwijaya. The club didn't have much time to assess him due to the transfer deadline for foreign players on 23 February but the club management moved it forward for themselves to the 21st. By 20 February, he was released from his trials as he wasn't up to the standard the club was looking for. However, a news report in the Philippines said that De Jong revealed on his Facebook page that he was offered a contract by Sriwijaya but didn't sign due to disagreements on the terms of the deal. De Jong was able to get another trial with another Indonesia Super League club, Persiba Balikpapan, after his agent Jules Onana found out they were looking to sign foreign players. He started training with the team on 21 February and after two days, he was able to impress the club and Onana successfully negotiated a deal. The deal would keep him at the club for the remainder of the 2010‚Äì11 Indonesia Super League season and cost Persiba Rp 706 million ($80,000). He made his debut on 13 March 2011, playing the full 90 minutes in the 5‚Äì1 defeat to Sriwijaya. It was a debut where he was criticized by his coach for having an unsatisfactory performance and said De Jong needed more time to adapt. In their following fixture, De Jong played 58 minutes as Persiba Balikpapan drew 2‚Äì2 with PSPS Pekanbaru. In his third successive game, Balikpapan got a goalless draw with Arema FC while De Jong only managed to play the first 28 minutes before being replaced. It would prove to be his last match with the club as he was sacked in early May 2011 due to breach of contract, citing indiscipline and failure to consistently attend training. Dordrecht In June 2011, De Jong was due to join RBC Roosendaal in the Eerste Divisie. The club attempted to avoid bankruptcy by contracting players with an amateur contract to be able to play in lower divisions. However, De Jong's move wouldn't materialize as the club was declared bankrupt after failure to pay its outstanding debts. On 10 August 2011, it was reported that De Jong began training with Dordrecht, another Eerste Divisie club. He featured in a friendly match against ADO Den Haag in which he encountered fellow Philippine international Paul Mulders. The match ended 2‚Äì0 to Den Haag. He was eventually accepted to the youth reserve squad at the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season. On 19 September 2011, De Jong made his first appearance in a match against the youth team of the Eredivisie club VVV- Venlo. De Jong gained a yellow card following a tackle to an opponent. The match ended 6‚Äì2 in favor of Dordrecht. Stallion In March 2012, De Jong was offered to play in the Philippines for Stallion in the United Football League. However, he was able to get a three-day trial with Scottish First Division side Ayr United. It was initially reported that he was set to sign for the club but Ayr United manager Brian Reid revealed that de Jong had not signed for Ayr due to financial constraints at the club. In August 2012, it was announced that De Jong eventually signed with the UFL side for the 2012‚Äì13 season. He made his first league appearance for the club in a 4‚Äì0 win against Pasargad. In March 2013, at the middle season of the 2013 United Football League, de Jong joins Global on loan until the end of season. Global After having loan spell, De Jong finally joins Global permanently. Bornem On 11 January 2015, De Jong signs for 3rd division club KSV Bornem in a 1-year deal. Global De Jong returns to Global after a short spell in K.S.V. Bornem.

De Jong was selected as vice-captain for the national under-23 team in time for the 2011 Southeast Asian Games, alongside captain Matthew Hartmann. He made his first appearance in the 3‚Äì1 loss against Vietnam in the opening match. After Hartmann quit the team on 10 November, De Jong was named captain with Manny Ott as vice-captain.

The Zheng family clan legacy began during the Southern Song dynasty (1127) and carried through the Ming dynasty (1487); over 360 years. During that time the family had 173 career officials and the family was recognized by the Ming dynasty emperor as jiangnan di yi jia, the first family of Southern China.‚Äù On both sides of the Zheng Ancestral Hall are ten characters: loyalty, faith, family, fraternity, propriety, justice, honesty, shame, farming and reading. From these words we can see that the family advocates loyalty to the country, being a person of integrity, having filial piety, humility towards neighbors and to have a clean and simple principled life. Over generations the family accumulated and refined a set of 168 house rules or norms offering guidance on ethnics and interpersonal relationships, as well as rules on managing a communal clan. The rules are essentially detailed instructions on various clan affairs and can be grouped into five categories: memorial ceremonies, organizational structure of the clan, weddings and funerals, the clan and local people, and personal conduct. Clan members are obliged to show obedience and piety to parents, to show brotherly love to siblings, and to show respect for spouse, describing this as the basis on which prosperity of the clan is built. The aforementioned instructions for men and women are like a kind of code of conduct. According to the Zheng family an in-corrupt government culture means using morality to cultivate the character, etiquette to develop one's personality, rules to balance the family relationship and using the self-sacrificing spirit to help the rest of the world; the main thoughts of Confucius. The family rules state that the offspring who desire to be an official are supposed to be given considerable financial assistance and encouragement. To those who have become a government official, they should abide by the laws and make every effort to deal with those laws earnestly. Rule 88, specifically addresses corruption. If a family member abuses their position they will bring about shame onto themselves. The rules specifically state that their names will be crossed out of the family tree, their remains will not be kept in the family mausoleum and they will not have a chance to return to the family even after their death. Other rules speak to social responsibility. Rule 97 states that if neighbors or relatives are short of food, Zheng descendants would better lend them some food and get the food back after the harvest season without asking for interest. Then in Rule 99, it states that if a Zheng descendant has extra money, they are expected to donate some to repair a collapsed bridge or a muddy road. In a simpler sense, help the community and infrastructure. In Rule 100, if a neighbor becomes seriously ill, Zheng descendants should care for them. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the state emphasized village society control, encouraging families throughout the kingdom to set norms upon family members and vested family elders with the power to enforce these norms. It was in this period that the family rules achieved rapid development, having increasingly mature content and form and general support from authorities; therefore, the Ming and Qing Dynasties became a typical time for the development of ancient family rules. Family is the most basic unit of traditional Chinese society. Individuals are inseparable from their families. People in ancient times wrote about their successful ways of managing a large family, i.e., the so-called family disciplines, to be followed by future generations. The writings pass down not only experience in managing a large family, but also Confucian values followed by many Chinese people, and exercise profound impact on individuals.

Folklore The Legend of Baozhang Valley There is a temple situated on Baozhang Mountain, east of Pujiang Xinhua Mountain, known as the Baozhang Temple. Behind the temple is a mountain hill that resembles an ‚ÄúEmperor‚Äôs Umbrella‚Äù (in Chinese called ‚ÄúHuangluo Gaisan‚Äù, which translates to yellow dragon umbrella cover - an ancient umbrella cover used as the emperor's shelter on his travels). There is a famous legend associated with the above mountain. Once upon a time, there was a small village located at the foot of Baozhang Mountain. The inhabitants of the village was a closely knit community. Amongst them lived a married couple, with two black dogs. The husband was a farmer. The couple unfortunately had no luck in bearing a child for years. One night the farmer's wife dreamt of a dragon flying to their house and landing on their roof. Having inspected no trail of a dragon on their roof and realising it was only a dream, the couple paid no serious attention to this dream. A couple of days later, their dogs started taking turns climbing up the roof and stood by, no matter rain or shine. Soon after, the farmer's wife found out that she was pregnant. The couple was puzzled why their dogs were climbing up their roof everyday and were frustrated since the dogs refused to listen and stay off the roof no matter what the couple did. The farmer, frustrated by the dogs, killed one of the dogs on the ground as a lesson to the other dog on the roof. Despite this, the dog on the roof remained persistent and stayed on the roof for couple of weeks before succumbing to death from hunger and fell off the roof. On the same day, a fortune teller passing through the village and by the farmer's house, paid the couple a visit and spoke to them, ‚ÄúYour house is filled with the omen of luck, although suppressed by an evil force....‚Ä¶‚Äù. After talking to the couple and learning of what had happened during the last few weeks, the fortune teller explained to the farmer, ‚ÄúYour wife is pregnant with an emperor son - the son of heaven - and the two black dogs were here to protect your family. They climbed up to the roof to protect your wife's pregnancy and your child's identity. Now that the dogs are dead, the incumbent emperor has become aware of your wife's pregnancy and to secure his throne, he will despatch his soldiers to kill the two of you.‚Äù The farmer, panicked and desperate, begged for a solution to escape. Unknown to the couple, the fortune teller is actually a deity and come to their rescue. He gave the farmer a handful of sand and a chopstick, and explained carefully, ‚ÄúWhen you are running away from the soldiers, throw a handful of sand behind you and the chopstick in front of you. The sand will turn into a mountain and the chopstick will open up a road path for you. The soldiers will not be able to pursue you further.‚Äù He then disappeared into the thin air. On that night itself, as predicted by the deity, soldiers invaded the village and the couple knew it must be the soldiers searching for them, and thus they escaped from the house. The soldiers saw them and gave chase to them. Just when the soldiers were gaining on them, the farmer, reminded of the deity's words, threw the chopstick behind him and a handful of sand in front of him. Immediately, a mountain blocked the couple's way ahead whilst a wide road path extended behind him. They were hunted down by the soldiers without much effort, and they and the unborn child killed at the site. Subsequently, the mountain hill behind the Baozhang Temple took the shape of the Emperor's Umbrella (Huangluo Gaisan) and it is said that it was probably formed as a memorial for the unborn son of the heaven......

History Yunhe hosted the Provincial government of Zhejiang from the summer of 1942 till Japan's surrender in 1945 as part of the chain effect of the Pacific War situation. To retaliate the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the US navy launched the Doolittle Raid against Japan's homeland on April 18, 1942. Sixteen bombers took off from the carrier Hornet 700 miles away from Tokyo, and planned to fly to Chuchow airfield (now spelled as Quzhou, about 110 miles from Yunhe) in the Zhejiang Province after the raid. The raid was of little military consequence, but boosted American morale and showed that Japan was more open to air attack than had been supposed. Both as a revenge for the raid and to capture the local airfields to prevent another, the following month the Japanese launched a 100,000-strong offensive into the Chekiang and Kiangsi (now spelled as Zhejiang and Jiangxi) provinces where they also employed biological warfare, slaughtering no fewer than 250,000 Chinese before the Japanese withdrew in September.

Early life She was born on July 1939 in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina to Volga German parents. She became a successful fashion model in the 1960s, and acted in a number of minor roles in Argentine cinema and television, where one of her closest friends was Susana Gim√©nez (later a ratings leader on Argentine television). She studied at the University of Buenos Aires, enrolling at the schools of Medicine and Sociology, and obtaining a degree in the latter discipline, following which she met a prominent local businessman. She became Naty Petrosino and settled into married life, having two children and living as a well-to-do housewife. At the age of 28, however, an operation resulted in her being declared clinically dead, leading to a mystical experience from which she awakened resolved to devote herself to the poor, leaving her upscale life and donating her estate to assisting the indigent. She became interested, in particular, in the area's marginalized native peoples.  Work as a humanitarian  Argentina, a country with a white majority and with a strong European influence, is also home to numerous communities of Aborigines who, for the most part, live in very poor conditions. She began her humanitarian labour among them providing shelter, and nutritional, medical, educational and other assistance with her own funds and through donations, living in a small recreational vehicle received as a gift. She established the Saint Francis of Assisi Home for Pilgrims in 1978, extending the reach of her efforts to the mentally handicapped and homeless AIDS victims, and growing to serve an average of 7,000 hot meals daily. An encounter with the Argentine Ambassador in Russia also led to a stay in that country during the early 1990s, helping build housing during the turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. She left the daily operation of the home to the local archdiocese in the mid 1990s, becoming an itinerant charity worker. Her travels took her impoverished communities of Mapuches in Patagonia and Mendoza Province, Wich√≠s in Chaco Province, and to Tucum√°n and Formosa Provinces (among the country's poorest), where she spent a decade. Followed by her mobile clinic, she and her assistants combated trypanosomiasis and completed numerous clinics, schools, wells, and homes, establishing a number of villages, outright. Petrosino became known also for her animal rights advocacy, keeping scores of abandoned dogs and cats.Natty Petrosino news Her itinerant efforts nearly cost Petrosino her life. She was hospitalized for a life-threatening fever on at least one occasion, and during her travels, her Toyota pickup turned over in an accident. She and her companions survived, though hospitalization forced Petrosino to suspend her activities for the first time since their outset in 1978. Ultimately, she recovered and her vehicle was replaced by a donation.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Cruise Room is a hotel bar with historic art deco interior, that was operated as an illicit speakeasy. History The Oxford Hotel was built in 1891. In February 1908, Bill Haywood and two other officers of the Western Federation of Miners were secretly held overnight in adjacent rooms in the Oxford, by the Denver police. Their stay at the Oxford was kept secret so their supporters could not try to block their extradition early the next morning by a special train to Idaho, to be tried for conspiracy in the assassination of a former governor of Idaho.J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble: A Murder in a Small Western Town Sets Off a Struggle for the Soul of America. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1997; pg.260. In the 1950s, the Oxford Hotel was considered a flophouse. In the 1980s a new owner improved the hotel. The hotel restaurant was operated by McCormick's Fish House from when they signed a lease with the Oxford Hotel in 1987 until 2016. Today, Urban Farmer Steakhouse operates as The Oxford Hotel's restaurant partner. The Cruise Room The Cruise Room is a bar located within the Oxford Hotel, considered a historic, upscale cocktail lounge, and known for its preserved Art Deco interior. It officially opened the day after prohibition ended. The bar is a single, windowless room, on the ground floor of The Oxford Hotel, located between the Corner Bar at McCormick's Fish House and the hotel lobby. History The bar opened as part of the Oxford Hotel in 1891, and was known for its martinis, though not originally named the Cruise Room. During prohibition, The Cruise Room operated as an illicit speakeasy. Employees know of secret paneling and tunnels. The Cruise Room was officially opened (with its full interior and full bar) the day after Prohibition ended. As an extension of the hotel and its restaurant, this bar has operated continually since its official opening. The Cruise Room has remained an independent establishment, managed in a partnership between the operator of the restaurant (now Urban Farmer, owned by Sage Restaurant Collection) and the Oxford Hotel. In 2012, the Cruise Room was restored, including historically accurate paint and light-pumpkin color. The marble floor was also replaced. This restoration was initiated by owner/developer Dana Crawford, who became a partner in the Oxford Hotel in 1980. The drinks menu was also updated, emphasizing contemporary \\"mixology\\", and includes drinks like \\"Pineapple Julep\\", \\"Whiskey Clover Smash\\", and \\"Pomegranate Sling\\".http://www.theoxfordhotel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Cruise- Mixology-List.pdf The bar also offers more than a dozen martinis, served from oversized martini shakers. Wait staff wear flapper girl attire. Interior design The interior was modeled after a lounge on the ocean liner . The design was by Denver architect Charles Jaka, and featured Art Deco bas-relief wall panels that stretch from floor to ceiling, created by Denver artist Alley Henson. Each panel depicts a \\"toast\\" from a different culture around the world. The interior has an unusual color juxtaposition, with red lighting shining down on chrome trim and historically accurate light-pumpkin-colored walls. The entire room is subtly shaped like a wine bottle. One of the wall panel depicts Germans toasting, and features Hitler. This panel was taken down during World War II, and was replaced by one depicting Ireland.

The original name was Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de la Universidad (University's Symphonic University) and was conducted by Jos√© F. V√°squez and Jos√© Rocabruna. The orchestra was based at Anfiteatro Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. In 1966, a new base was assigned: Auditorio Justo Sierra at the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature. In 1966, the assignment of a new art director, Eduardo Mata, established the start of a new period, when UNAM's Symphonic Orchestra became UNAM's Philharmonic Orchestra (OFUNAM). During this period the orchestra‚Äôs name was changed and became Orquesta Filamonica de la UNAM. Hector Quintanar was appointed artistic director in 1975. The following year, the orchestra moved to its actual home, the Sala Nezahualc√≥yotl. From 1981 until 1984, the artistic responsibilities were in the hands of a tandem of associate conductors: Enrique Diemecke and Eduardo Diazmu√±oz. From 1985 until 1989, it was Jorge Velzaco‚Äôs turn to be artistic director. He was followed by Jes√∫s Medina, from 1989 until 1993. In 1994, Ronald Zollmhan became the new artistic director, a post he held during eight years, until 2002. Zuohuang Chen was the conductor from 2002 to 2006. In 2006, OFUNAM celebrated its 70th anniversary, Sala Nezahualc√≥yotl's 30th anniversary, as well as Mozart's 250th birth anniversary and Shostakovich's 100th birth anniversary. The Welsh Alun Francis followed Chen in 2007, assisted by the Mexican Rodrigo Macias. Presently, Massimo Quarta is the OFUNAM's artistic conductor.

He was born in Columbus, Ohio, and moved to Paris to study art. He befriended Claude Monet in Giverny, and married his stepdaughter, Suzanne Hosched√©. After her death he married her sister, Marthe Hosched√©. Butler was a founding member of the Society of Independent Artists. Butler's chosen subjects were domestic scenes of family and friends and the French landscape. Although his Impressionistic approach to painting sometimes reflected the influence of his father-in-law, his work also suggests Post-Impressionist tendencies. Biography Butler studied at Marietta College in Ohio and graduated in 1882. He studied at the Art Students League with James Carroll Beckwith, Kenyon Cox and J. Alden Weir, and under William Merritt Chase from 1884 to 1886. One of Butler's first paintings is a copy of Menippus by Diego Vel√°zquez(1639‚Äì1641)Museum Del Prado Spain Standing Bearded Man, 1885. Butler then moved to study in Paris. In Paris, Butler enrolled at La Grande- Chaumi√®re, Acad√©mie Colarossi and at Acad√©mie Julian. Butler studied under Emile Carolus Duran. Carolus opened an art studio in 1873 on Boulevard Montparnasse, called the \\"81\\". Carolus, who was also known to have given free private lessons to some painters, introduced his students to the work of Claude Monet. Monet had moved to Giverny on April 29, 1883. Butler stayed for some time in the same building as Carolus, and Butler won an honorable mention in 1888 at the Paris Salon for a painting entitled \\"La Veuve\\", (the Widow). Butler at Giverny Butler signed the register under number 11 at Hotel Baudy in 1888 (May 20 ‚Äì September 1888) along with Theodore Wendel, an Ohioan who also studied at Academy Julian. Butler stayed again at Hotel Baudy from October 1891 until July 21, 1892. Besides himself, other American painters who spent time in Giverny included John Leslie Breck, Frederick Carl Frieseke, Edmund Greacen, Philip Leslie Hale, Willard Metcalf, Lilla Cabot Perry, Theodore Robinson and Guy Rose. On July 3 Butler and Robinson had dinner at Monet's house. Angelina and Lucien Baudy opened Hotel Baudy in June 1887. The hotel became the hub for many American expatriates. At Hotel Baudy, artists could buy canvases from Lefevre Foinet and American food celebrating Thanksgiving was served. The village began to attract a great deal of attention. According to Terra Museum historians Katherine M. Bourguignon and Vanessa Lecomte, over 350 painters from eighteen countries painted in Giverny. An exhibition of foreign artists including Butler, Meteyard, Fox, Dice, Stasburg and Dawson Watson was organized from January 31, 1892 to February 1892. Theodore Robinson, The Wedding March, 1892. The wedding procession of Suzanne Hosched√© and Theodore Earl Butler. After becoming close friends with Claude Monet, Butler married Monet's stepdaughter, Suzanne Hosched√© in 1892. Suzanne is known as The woman with a Parasol and she was Claude Monet's favorite model. The event of their marriage is described by Theodore Robinson in his diaries as a great day - The marriage of Butler and Mlle.

Butler became a key player and link between the American Colony and Claude Monet. The Butler family organized many dinners such as one held October 25, 1892 with Robinson, Hale, Hart and Marthe Hosched√©. \\"I'm making great culinary preparations for the winter.\\" Butler decided to buy an orchard and built a new house. \\"We, Suzanne and Jimmy and I wish that you were here we'd like to see you first rate.

He did the cover and illustrated many pages. Butler painted a series of his own family: son Jimmy Butler born in 1893, and daughter Lilly Butler born in 1894. Those paintings included series' entitled The Bath, After the Bath, and Playing with Jimmy. Butler developed his own impressionist style with light palettes and loose brushstrokes, reminiscent of works done by √âdouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard. From his garden he painted landscapes showing the church of Giverny, The Demoiselles (small haystacks) and the grain stacks. After a lingering illness, Suzanne Hoschede died in 1899. Thereafter most of Butler's paintings were landscapes. Marthe Hoschede, Suzanne's sister helped Butler raise Jimmy and Lilly. In 1899 Theodore Earl Butler decided to go back to the United States. A letter from Henry Prellwitz to Philip Leslie Hale indicated that Hart told him that Butler will sail on the 16th of September on La Touraine [1899]. \\"Dear Phil- Are you going to New York to meet Hart and Butler ?

Lasting Impressions: American painters in France 1865-1915, 172. Terra Foundation for the Arts, Evanston, Illinois, 1992. Monet's influence on American expatriate painters in Giverny was important, and a similarity between Butler's palette and that of Monet has been noted in the paintings of the 1890s.Wierich, 172 Equally noticeable in Butler's brushwork are qualities that align him with the work of Paul Gauguin and the Nabis artists. In his later work Butler experimented further with Fauve principles, painting landscapes in Giverny and on the Normandy coast, sometimes applying color directly from the tube to decorative ends.Wierich, 172-175 Ancestry Theodore Earl Butler was the son of Courtland Philip Livingston Butler (1813‚Äì1891) and Elizabeth Slade Pierce (1822‚Äì1901).

The steady presence of an unchanging customer base guarantees their business and steady income. The steady presence of suppliers means low costs for the firms as well.

He went to the United States on a scholarship in 1982 graduated with a BA (magna cum laude) from Hamilton College, New York and Doctor of Jurisprudence (Juris Doctor, or JD, approximately equivalent to LLB) degree from New York University School of Law. He is currently employed as a special advisor to the South African Minister of Defence and Veteran Affairs. He was previously employed by the University of Cape Town as a Deputy Registrar, Legal Services.Cape Argus, 21 November 2007 In 2007 Mr Ngobeni was appointed to serve on a task team advising the African National Congress on constitutional law matters where he assisted in designing its legal strategy for defending South African President Jacob Zuma against corruption charges. He has also served as a consultant for the South African Ministry of Housing on various legal matters, including transformation.  Legal career  Paul Ngobeni was admitted to practise law in the State of Connecticut December 1989 The Connecticut Law Tribune, 27 October 2006 and to the State of Massachusetts on 14 June 1990 During his practice in the United States, Mr Ngobeni litigated many cases which have been published and were for the most part cases of first impression, such as the case of Scott v. Robert Jamison, et al., where he (unsuccessfully) defended Robert Jamison against complaints from Juliet Scott that she was physically and verbally assaulted and harassed, denied equal services, and threatened with eviction on the basis of her race and colour and of her children's race and colour in violation of General Statutes ¬ß 46a-64c(a) and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq. In July 2002, Kweku Hanson, a fellow Connecticut attorney, initiated a class-action suit against Ocwen Federal FSB of West Palm Beach, Florida, and he was represented in this by Paul Ngobeni. The 123-page lawsuit in Hanson v. Ocwen Federal Bank outlines a six-year running battle over late charges and fees. \\"It is clear that this is a pattern and practice of sheer piracy,\\" Mr. Hanson said in an interview. He was joined in the suit by 57 individuals who claimed to have been injured by Ocwen. The lawsuit sought $1.5 billion in punitive and exemplary damages, but was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. During 2003, he, along with Kweku Hanson, his associate from the Ocwen class action suit, represented three plaintiffs who claimed to represent \\"all persons who lived in South Africa between 1948 and the present and who suffered damages as a result of apartheid.\\" Punitive and compensatory damages in excess $400 billion were claimed from a \\"slew\\" of multinational corporations (including IBM, Citigroup, GE, DuPont and many others) that did business in apartheid South Africa for violations of international law subject to suit in United States federal district court under the Alien Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1350 (\\"ATCA\\"), and other jurisdictional provisions. The Southern District Court of New York under Judge John E. Sprizzo found for defendants‚Äô motion to dismiss the complaint. That finding was partially vacated by the US Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) in an appeal first lodged in January 2006 and decided in October 2007 but by then Mr Ngobeni was no longer representing the claimants, and Kweku Hanson was facing some legal difficulties‚Äîhe pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault in the second degree; two counts of risk of injury to a minor child; one charge of possession of child pornography in the first degree; and two counts of tampering with a witness. He received a total effective sentence of twenty- five years execution suspended after he served six years incarceration followed by thirty years of probation.  Accusations of malpractice and disbarment in the US On 27 September 2005, the Connecticut Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel filed an application for the interim suspension of Paul Ngobeni, alleging that he \\"pose[d] a substantial threat of irreparable harm to his clients or to prospective clients.\\" On 19 December 2005, after he failed to appear for a hearing on this application, a judge in the Superior Court for the Hartford Judicial District in Connecticut ordered that he be placed on interim suspension. On 20 January 2006, bar counsel filed a petition in Massachusetts for reciprocal discipline based on the interim suspension order entered in Connecticut. On 16 March 2006, the court issued an order of immediate temporary suspension, after Ngobeni had failed to respond. In a presentment filed in the Connecticut Superior Court on 25 September 2006, disciplinary counsel in Connecticut alleged seventeen counts of misconduct involving sixteen separate clients. The presentment, as amended, included allegations that the respondent took fees without providing services, was incompetent, lacked diligence, failed to communicate with clients, engaged in misrepresentation and deceit, failed to explain an overdraft in his clients' funds account, failed to safeguard clients' funds, and failed to respond to requests for information from the Connecticut bar discipline authorities. On 14 August 2007, Ngobeni returned to South Africa, his country of origin. On 17 October 2007, a judge in the Connecticut Superior Court held a hearing on the presentment, which Ngobeni did not attend, and on that day, the judge entered an order disbarring Ngobeni for a period of thirteen years. The order conditioned reinstatement on Ngobeni's presenting a practice plan acceptable to the court, on his not practicing as a solo practitioner, on his maintaining malpractice insurance, and on his paying restitution to affected clients. On 29 November 2007, Ngobeni and Connecticut disciplinary counsel attended a hearing in the Connecticut Superior Court to consider Ngobeni's resignation from the Connecticut bar. Without abandoning his previously filed jurisdictional challenge to the disbarment proceeding, Paul Ngobeni acknowledged that the court had jurisdiction to open that proceeding to consider the submission of his resignation. He further acknowledged that he was freely and voluntarily submitting his resignation, that he understood that he was entitled to be represented by counsel but chose not to be, and that he was giving up his right to reapply for admission to the Connecticut bar at any time in the future. At the hearing, Paul Ngobeni stated that he was resigning because he intended never to practice law in the United States again, that he intended to return to South Africa the following day, and that he wished to avoid returning to the United States to pursue \\"lengthy appeals or prolonged proceedings\\" related to his disbarment. He also stated that \\"[his] resignation does not in any way constitute any admission of liability of wrongdoing or misconduct on [his] part\\" and that he was conceding nothing with respect to his jurisdictional challenges to his disbarment proceedings. The assistant disciplinary counsel made clear that she was not \\"conceding in any way any of the issues that have been raised by [Ngobeni] in opposition to the presentment\\" and was prepared to prosecute the charges of misconduct set forth in the presentment if the respondent did not resign. She further stated: \\"[A]s Mr. Ngobeni commented, he talked to [disciplinary counsel] [who] I think informed him that this resignation will be reported. There's a national databank. . . . And we have made no representations to Mr. Ngobeni . . . as to how other jurisdictions may handle this particular resignation. We do agree to the opening of the judgment for the sole purpose of Mr. Ngobeni submitting his resignation and waiver because it does in the end meet the goals of attorney discipline inasmuch as Mr. Ngobeni will never be allowed to practice in Connecticut again [and] . . . [s]o the profession is protected and the public is protected.\\" The judge then vacated the order of disbarment and accepted the respondent's resignation and waiver of future reinstatement conditional only on the receipt of a report from the Statewide Grievance Committee required under Connecticut Practice Book ¬ß 2- 52 (2008). Paul Ngobeni did not report his disbarment or subsequent resignation to bar counsel in Massachusetts, as required by S.J.C. Rule 4:01, ¬ß 16 (6). On 29 November 2007, having been apprised of the disbarment through other sources, bar counsel filed a petition for reciprocal discipline in the county court seeking a reciprocal order of disbarment in Massachusetts pursuant to ¬ß 16. On 19 December, after learning from a source other than Mr Ngobeni that he had resigned from the bar in Connecticut, bar counsel filed an amended petition for reciprocal discipline, requesting that the respondent's resignation in Massachusetts pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 4:01, ¬ß 15, as appearing in 425 Mass. 1319 (1997), and ¬ß 16 (1), be accepted effective 5 June 2006, the date of the respondent's compliance with the order of temporary suspension. A copy of this pleading was sent to Paul Ngobeni in South Africa. On 21 December 2007, the court issued an order of notice requiring the respondent to show cause within thirty days of service why the \\"imposition of the identical discipline\\" would not be warranted. On 24 March 2008, Paul Ngobeni filed a \\"verified opposition to the amended petition for reciprocal discipline\\" and a memorandum of law. Because he resided in South Africa, a telephonic hearing before the single justice on the amended petition for reciprocal discipline was scheduled for 3 April 2008, but attempts to contact Ngobeni at the telephone number he provided were unsuccessful at that time. The court therefore considered the matter on the briefs of the parties, and reserved and reported the case. The single justice indicated that in his view, under S.J.C. Rule 4:01, ¬ß 16 (1), (3), and (5), it appeared that he did not \\"have authority to disbar the respondent or deem that he has resigned from the bar of the Commonwealth.\\" Finally, the Supreme Judicial Court found that a reciprocal sanction under Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01, ¬ß 16, may be imposed on an attorney who, with disciplinary charges pending in another jurisdiction, resigned from practice there without making admissions or having a finding made of misconduct, and, accordingly, disbarred Paul Ngobeni from practicing as an attorney in the state of Massachusetts. In so holding, the Court relied in part on a similar decision it had made the previous year, Anusavice v. Board of Registration in Dentistry, 451 Mass. 786, 797 (2008), indicating that the Massachusetts dentistry board could consider a dentist's agreement to a Rhode Island consent order restricting his practice in Rhode Island as \\"discipline\\" warranting reciprocal discipline in Commonwealth. The Court in Ngobeni emphasized the policy concerns underlying the decision, stating that: \\"If an attorney like [Ngobeni] may permanently resign in another State in the face of serious allegations of misconduct‚Äîhere involving multiple clients‚Äîbut do so without admission of misconduct, and then practice in Massachusetts without restriction unless bar counsel undertakes the burdensome and expensive task of investigating and proving the other State's charges, it would \\"tend to undermine public confidence in the effectiveness of attorney disciplinary procedures and threaten harm to the administration of justice and to innocent clients.\\" On 16 May 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States issued an order disbarring him from practice in that court.http://www.politicsweb.co.za/party/paul-ngobeni-a- fugitive-from-justice-after-all--da References Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lydenburg Category:South African lawyers Category:Connecticut lawyers Category:Disbarred lawyers Category:Hamilton College (New York) alumni Category:New York University School of Law alumni Category:Class action lawsuits Category:Jacob Zuma ","title":"Paul Ngobeni"},{"id":"24693421","text":"The principal cast. In pool (clockwise from bottom left): Shanelle, Nikki, Buck, Switchboard, Jillian, Radley. In back seat (clockwise from bottom left): Chester, Jett, Gig, Tara. In front seat: Larke, Troy. Not shown: Bianca, Blaze, Empress, Pierce, Tiara, Wilshire. This is a list of the characters from the animated television series Beverly Hills Teens. Characters *Bianca Dupree - A scheming, raven-haired beauty who believes she comes first above all things. This arrogant diva can often be seen riding around in her long pink limo, with her dog Empress and her chauffeur Wilshire Brentwood. She dislikes nature in favor of the clean house and conditioned air, although in one episode she was excited about a camping trip - if for no other reason than the shopping required. She is very jealous of Larke Tanner's relationship with Troy Jeffries and is constantly scheming to ruin it, since Bianca has a major crush on him as well. Bianca is not above sabotaging her other peers, either; she once tried to ruin Tara's entry into a beauty pageant. However, when on one occasion she learned her latest scheme might lead to Larke's death, she risked her own life to rescue her, and later withdrew from the competition. Wilshire is desperately in love with Bianca, but she steps all over him, despite the gang's efforts to match them up. Oddly, while Bianca sees nothing wrong with her own habit of mistreating Wilshire, she does not allow anybody else to do the same. Voiced by Tracey Moore and Terri Hawkes (in some episodes). *Blaze Summers - A dark blonde cowgirl who could pass for Larke Tanner's sister, both in looks and in personality. Blaze is folksy, laid-back and friendly to everyone - even Pierce Thorndyke III. She has a horse names Stardust. Ultimately, her charming nature attracts the attentions of a prince, with whom she falls in love. Voiced by Tracey Moore and Terri Hawkes (in some episodes). *Buck Huckster - As his name implies, he is a slick shyster always looking to make a fast buck. Ultimately, Buck's obsession with money and wealth is derailed by a nightmare which shows him what his future will be like if he does not change. Voiced by Michael Beattie. *Chester McTech - A prodigy's prodigy, Chester has skipped several grades to become a 10-year-old freshman and honor student at Beverly Hills High School. He's got his own science lab at home, complete with a dress-designing machine. He can, and does, assist many upperclassmen with their various dilemmas; nobody is ever more grateful for his help than Larke Tanner. Because of Chester's great intelligence and ingenuity, he is often pressed into service by Pierce Thorndyke III or Bianca Dupree to further their own (typically separate) agendas. Brenda \\"Switchboard\\" McTech is his elder sister. Nothing makes Chester's day like a big hug and kiss from Larke, which is often his reward for getting her out of a jam. Voiced by Sean Roberge. *Empress - Bianca Dupree's small pink poodle, whose nasty bark is comparable to Bianca's attitude. She often helps Bianca make Larke Tanner's life harder, such as destroying the floppy discs containing Larke's homework. Empress's archenemy is none other than Larke's cat, Tiara. Empress also hates Wilshire Brentwood. According to one episode, Empress hates water so much Bianca dry cleans her. *Fifi (full name unknown) - This hair-salon owner is the most sought-after stylist in Beverly Hills. *Gig (full name unknown) - A brown-haired male rocker who plays alongside Jett. He is outspoken, with a distinct British/Aussie accent. A real ladies' man, Gig once dated both Larke Tanner and Tara Belle at the same time, until Jett revealed his secret. He and Jett have agreed not to date each other, despite this, Gig has feelings for her. He often becomes jealous if she expresses interest in someone else or vice versa. Voiced by Mark Saunders. *Jett (full name unknown) - A blonde female rocker with extremely big hair and an exaggerated Valley girl accent. She disapproves of Gig's womanizing, despite being a flirt in her own right; it turns out she herself is smitten with him. Ultimately (in the series' next-to-last episode) both she and Gig earn a recording contract from Vic Vinyl of Starstruck Music. Voiced by Karen Bernstein. *Jillian Thorndyke - Pierce's annoying younger sister, who tries to be much more adult than she is. Jillian, like most of the gang, isn't nearly as impressed with her brother as he is with himself. She ultimately falls in love with Chester McTech, in part because she's far too young to date Troy Jeffries. Voiced by Tracey Moore and Terri Hawkes (in some episodes). *Larke Tanner - The blonde-haired, blue-eyed teen queen of Beverly Hills. She is (mutually) head-over-heels in love with resident jock Troy Jeffries. She drives a bright pink Ferrari, usually accompanied by her pet cat Tiara. A part-time model, Larke wins many of the contests that she enters, although Bianca Dupree tries hard to sabotage her. A straight-A student. Kind- hearted and sweet to the core, Larke is basically the anti-Bianca; she's also a proud surrogate sister to Chester McTech, who has bailed her out of numerous fixes. Voiced by Mary Long. *Nikki Darling - An aspiring model/actress with a very dramatic demeanor, especially against unfairness (perceived and otherwise) in the fashion/entertainment world. Voiced by Corrine Koslo. *Pierce Thorndyke III - Pierce is egotistical, girl-crazy, snobbish and blissfully unaware that he is not the Casanova which he believes himself to be. He often teams up with Bianca Dupree in her ultimately-unsuccessful schemes to come between Larke Tanner and Troy Jeffries, because, while Bianca wants Troy, Pierce wants Larke - although he also woos Tara Belle on occasion. Despite the aforementioned personality issues, Pierce does have his endearing moments. He carries around a wisecracking pocket-computer named C.A.D. (that is, Computer Assistant and Datemaker) which holds all of his most embarrassing secrets. He is the elder brother of Jillian. Voiced by Stephen McMulkin. *Radley (full name unknown) - A surfer dude who is fluent in the lingo, and who has raised tanning to an art-form. Anywhere a wave can be had, Radley is there. His credo; \\"to surf is to live; to quit is to die\\". Was seen to have studying problems due to this single-mindedness. He is close friends with Troy Jeffries and Gig. Voiced by Hadley Kay. *Shanelle Spencer - Intelligent and level-headed, with a wry sense of humor, she is the voice of reason among her peers. She is also president of the local country club for teenagers. A natural born leader, she sticks to the rules and never misuses her prestige. Voiced by Michelle St. John. *Brenda \\"Switchboard\\" McTech - The self-dubbed \\"Guru of Gossip\\". There's nothing Switchboard won't do, and very little she hasn't done, to find the latest \\"dirt\\" and dish it out at the teen country club. However, she is very reluctant to spread \\"false\\" gossip. Her younger brother is ultra-precocious Chester. Voiced by Joanna Schellenberg. *Tara Belle - She possesses a pronounced Deep Southern accent (al least once, she referred to \\"folks back home on the bayou\\") and sports a more demure look than most of her peers, showcasing pearls, ruffles and the like. Polite and ladylike to a fault, Tara's demeanor sometimes is mistaken for naivete. Voiced by Karen Bernstein. *Tiara - Larke Tanner‚Äôs fluffy Persian cat. Like her owner, Tiara is playful and well-mannered. However, she is easily intimidated by Empress. *Troy Jeffries - A jock's jock, Troy is the most popular boy in Beverly Hills, for all the right reasons. He is adored by every girl at Beverly Hills High School - particularly his female counterpart Larke Tanner, with whom he often seems to be in an official relationship (although, according to him, they are \\"not going steady\\") Troy is also the apple of Bianca Dupree's eye, but he (understandably) takes her in stride. Voiced by Jonathan Potts. *Wilshire Brentwood - Bianca Dupree's chauffeur and doormat. He is deeply in love with her, but she ignores him until he gets into danger, after which Bianca kisses him. His favorite color is white. Wilshire is always kind to Bianca's peers; he is the only member of the gang who (genuinely) likes Bianca despite her scheming, \\"me-first\\" attitude. She temporarily \\"made herself over\\" to become considerate - taking after her nemesis Larke Tanner - but Wilshire didn't like the \\"new\\" Bianca. In one episode, he insisted on serving Pierce (due to him saving Wilshire's life) instead of Bianca, with disastrous results. Voiced by Michael Beattie.

In 2006, Time Out termed it \\"the best source of Jamaican music in Europe\\". History Founded by John MacGillivray and Chris Lane, Dub Vendor began life in 1976 as a market stall in London's Clapham Junction in response to the considerable lack of West Indian music at the time. Clapham Junction at that time was a poor inner suburb, and the surging population of immigrants from the West Indies made Battersea and nearby Brixton their new homes. The stall, and the shop that followed, were instant successes, and the second Dub Vendor store (or 'record shack' as it's known) opened four years later in Ladbroke Grove right next to the Underground station. In response to London's reggae scene flourishing in the early 1980s, larger premises were required to cater for the increasing demand for reggae, ska, and allied genres. Subsequently, 274 Lavender Hill became Dub Vendor's flagship store and also the home of its home-brew recording studio label, Fashion Records. The Ladbroke Grove shack continued to operate alongside the Lavender Hill store until 1991, when it was moved down the road to 150 Ladbroke Grove, due to the lack of space in the shack to accommodate the ever-increasing patronage. The future for the Ladbroke Grove branch began to look bleak, however, as sales fell and the rent increased. The final nail in the coffin came in 2007 in the form of the introduction of the Western Extension of London's congestion charge, which resulted in the store closing its doors to the public just over a year later on 28 June 2008. Dub Vendor today As of September 2015, Dub Vendor now have a shop on Portobello Road in the Mau Mau Bar and a live music venue in Ladbroke Grove.

Education and career DenDekker was born in Jackson Heights, attending Our Lady of Fatima Grammar School and Monsignor McClancy Memorial High School. He attended the State University of New York at Farmingdale, majoring in automotive technology. After college he worked as a banquet manager for a caterer and an account representative for MetLife. He joined the New York City Department of Sanitation in 1995, where he was promoted to supervisor in March 2001. Later that year he was assigned to the New York City Office of Emergency Management as a public information officer and in 2003 he also became a special projects coordinator. He retired from the Sanitation Department and his assignment at OEM in 2006, after which he was a facilities manager for the New York City Council.

After longtime Assemblyman Ivan Lafayette decided not to run for reelection, DenDekker ran for the seat. He won uncontested general elections in 2008 and 2010. Legislative Career DenDekker attracted public attention with two bills he proposed in February 2011 that would have required all bicycles in New York to be registered, inspected, and given license plates for a mandatory US $25 fee. DenDekker proposed the idea as an attempt to draw attention to bicyclists who violate existing state laws and to generate revenue for the state. After significant objections from his colleagues, constituents and local clerks, DenDekker withdrew the bill. In May 2010, DenDekker introduced a bill to develop a cigarette butt recycling program and require a minimum deposit of one cent per cigarette. In 2020, he was defeated in the Democratic primary by democratic socialist opponent Jessica Gonz√°lez-Rojas.

It was formerly known as Mimulus parishii. It is native to the mountains and hills of the southern half of California, far western Nevada, and northern Baja California, where it grows in wet, sandy habitat such as streambanks. The flowers primarily self-pollinate, but the species evolved from an out-crossing ancestor similar to E. lewisii. The flower size greatly reduced as the species transitioned to self-pollination through changes in a number of genes that each have a small effect on the size. Description Erythranthe parishii is an annual herb growing up to 50 centimeters in maximum height with a stout, hairy stem. The oppositely arranged oval or widely lance-shaped leaves are up to 7.5 centimeters long. The narrow, tubular base of the flower is encapsulated in a ribbed calyx of sepals with pointed lobes.

In the 1830s, it was a primarily German neighborhood. With later demographic changes and immigration from southern and eastern Europe, it became a neighborhood of Italians. In the 20th century, African Americans and Hispanics moved in as well. The most recent 21st-century arrivals have been Arab and Asian, reflecting changing immigration patterns. The neighborhood is still dominated numerically by Italian Americans. Schools PS #43 is the primary school in the East Lovejoy area, which many student-age children attend. It has architectural and significant history. Started in 1831 by Joseph Churchyard, the man who owned the land, the school created an annex on East Lovejoy and Benzinger streets. This is the current school #43. Built to accommodate 600 ethnic German children living in the area, the school had 49 classrooms, two gymnasiums, a cafeteria, and other features. In 1926, the number of students attending was 1,662. Recently, the school underwent a $56 million construction project; another building was constructed on the former parking lot and connected to the old one.

The body also sat in judgment of judicial appeals cases. History The General Court of the Colony of New Plymouth was founded in 1620 when the Pilgrims came to New England, and the General Court served as the colony's legislature and judicial court. In 1636 the Court created North America's first written legal code with a set of statutes including a rudimentary bill of rights protecting traditional liberties such as the right to a jury trial. The early law of the colony was based roughly on English common law and Mosaic law, but the judicial structure resembled local manor and borough courts in England rather than the higher King's Court, which created the common law. The early Plymouth General Court met within the fort on Burial Hill near Cole's Hill in downtown Plymouth.Haskins, George L., 1965 Reception of the Common Law in Seventeenth Century Massachusetts: A Case Study.

Jr.1966 Pilgrim Colony: A History of New Plymouth, 1620-1691. New Haven: Yale University Press. The Plymouth colony was officially incorporated by charter into the Province of Massachusetts Bay on October 7, 1691, although the General Court of the Plymouth Colony remained in effective government until the new charter arrived on May 14, 1692, carried by William Phips. The last official meeting of the Plymouth General Court occurred on June 8, 1692. pp 17‚Äì18 pp 64‚Äì65 The Plymouth General Court was officially disestablished in 1692 when the Massachusetts Colony with its Massachusetts General Court and Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court took over Plymouth's former jurisdiction.Records of the Colony of New Plymouth, in New England: Laws, 1623-1682 (Press of W. White, 1861) Initially the General Court consisted of the Governor of the colony, the Council of Assistants (an advice and consent body), and all the colony's Freemen. Unlike other New England colonies which used a more representative system, such as the Massachusetts Bay Colony, all the officers of the General Court were directly elected by the Freemen. At this early stage of the Colony's history the body of Freemen consisted of only the signatories to the Mayflower Compact. The Governor and Assistants acted as magistrates with legislative function being reserved for the Freemen in an open assembly. This form of direct democracy was similar to the open town meeting system still in place in many New England towns. However this method of governance did not last due to the inconvenience and cost of travel that colonists would have to endure to meet at the General Court. In 1639 changes were made which allowed Freemen of each town of the colony to elect from themselves 2 magistrates/delegates (the town of Plymouth was allowed 4). These delegates would act as local magistrates who could hear local cases and would also serves as delegates to the General Court. There were provisions which allowed these delegates to be removed from office if they were found to be \\"troublesome\\". Some elements of direct democracy remained, such as the officers continuing to be elected from the whole body of freemen and not the by delegates of the Court.{Davis 1900, p.7-8) Who counted as a Freemen changed over the history of the Plymouth Colony. The original restrictions, limiting the freemen to those original Compact signatories, was amended to include additional signatories. Some exclusions to this included groups such as Quakers and Ranters. Signing of the compact required an oath of fidelity, and since groups such as Quakers are not permitted to take oaths they were to be excluded from Plymouth political life. In 1671 the qualifications for Freemen liberalized again allowing any Puritan man over 21 years old who possessed property worth over ¬£20 to be considered.(Davis 1900, p.8-9  See also  *Governor of Massachusetts *Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court *Massachusetts General Court  References   Bibliography  External links *The Book of the General Laws of the Inhabitants of the Jurisdiction of New-Plimouth (1685) *Court Houses of Plymouth Category:1620 establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:1691 disestablishments in the Thirteen Colonies Plymouth General Court General Court Category:Plymouth, Massachusetts Category:Massachusetts culture ","title":"Plymouth General Court"},{"id":"24693659","text":"Campbell in 1895.

Pius XII's statements have been scrutinized as much, if not more, than his actions during the same period. Pius XII's statements, both public and private, are quite well documented in the Vatican Secret Archives; eleven volumes of documents from his papacy were published between 1965 and 1981 in Actes et documents du Saint Si√®ge relatifs √† la Seconde Guerre Mondiale. Many of Pope Pius XII's critics have alleged \\"silence\\" by the pontiff during The Holocaust. Some of Pius XII's defenders have contested whether he was silent, while others have instead argued that to speak out would have been useless or counterproductive. According to Prof. Michael Phayer, \\"the question of the pope's silence has become the focus of intense historical debate and analysis\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 70. Background Terminology The term \\"Holocaust\\" had been used since the Middle Ages, and was used by contemporaries during World War II, although it did not come to refer exclusively to the genocide of the Jews in scholarly writing until the 1960s. Pius XII used the term \\"holocaust\\" twice in his encyclicals, but used it in its religious meaning, not referring to the historical event.Text of Sacra Virginitas.Text of Mystici corporis Christi. The term \\"genocide\\" was not coined until 1944 by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish legal scholar.Raphael Lemkin. 1944. Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation - Analysis of Government - Proposals for Redress, Chapter IX: \\"Genocide a new term and new conception for destruction of nations\\". Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. pp. 79-95. Much scrutiny has focused on whether Pius XII specifically identified the perpetrators or victims; many of his more ambiguous statements, which make no reference to Nazi Germany or the Jews, have been argued to apply to the Holocaust by some of his supporters.Phayer, 2008, pp. 42-64. Many of Pius XII's more important writings and speeches were not given in English, and some of his words have roughly been translated as \\"race\\", \\"creed\\", and \\"blood\\". A far wider range of his speeches referred generally to \\"violence\\", \\"suffering\\" or the victims of war. Appeals for a statement Appeals for the pope to speak out against the Holocaust, along with information on its extent and nature, came from members of his own diplomatic corps, Catholic bishops and priests throughout Europe, ordinary lay Catholics, foreign governments and governments-in-exile, and various prominent Jews and Jewish organizations.Phayer, 2008, pp. 44-45. By 1942, appeals had turned to open criticism, and messages to the effect that the pope was losing his \\"moral authority\\" due to his failure to condemn Nazi atrocities from reports which were coming in from diplomats accredited to the Vatican from the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, Belgium, and Poland.Phayer, 2008, pp. 48-49. Moreover, the Allied governments condemned the genocide of the Jews on December 17, 1942.Phayer, 2008, p. 50. However, Pius XII refused requests to endorse the United Nations's (not yet an officially chartered body) declaration; one such request came from Harold Tittmann, his US ambassador.Phayer, 2008, pp. 51-53. Types of statements Encyclicals Mit brennender Sorge Mit brennender Sorge, a 1937 encyclical by Pope Pius XI, written mostly by German Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, is sometimes included in debates about Pius XII. As Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli doubtlessly contributed in some way to the drafting of the document, mostly its introduction dealing with the history of the Reichskonkordat. The Reichskonkordat was a treaty negotiated and signed by Pacelli as Secretary (and, in a general sense, as nuncio to Germany), and Mit brennender Sorge was primarily focused on the specific violations of that treaty. The encyclical was issued along with its sister document, Divini Redemptoris (also 1937), which levied similar criticisms against communism. Pius XI also commissioned a successor encyclical to Mit brennender Sorge in 1938, Humani generis unitas, which Pius XII controversially did not promulgate upon his election as pope in 1939. The most relevant passage of Mit brennender Sorge is as follows: > Whoever exalts race, or the people, or the state, or a particular form of > state, or the depositories of power, or any other fundamental value of the > human community‚Äîhowever necessary and honorable be their function in worldly > things‚Äîwhoever raises these notions above their standard value and divinizes > them to an idolatrous level, distorts and perverts an order of the world > planned and created by God.\\"The Holocaust: What Was Not Said\\", First Thing > Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 30 June 2009 Summi pontificatus Summi pontificatus was the first encyclical of Pius XII, promulgated in 1939. The bulk of the document deals with general and abstracted themes, but the situation in Poland (which had been invaded shortly before the encyclical's promulgation) is referred to with specificity once: > The blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants, raises a piteous > dirge over a nation such as Our dear Poland, which, for its fidelity to the > Church, for its services in the defense of Christian civilization, written > in indelible characters in the annals of history, has a right to the > generous and brotherly sympathy of the whole world, while it awaits, relying > on the powerful intercession of Mary, Help of Christians, the hour of a > resurrection in harmony with the principles of justice and true peace.Text > of Summi Pontificatus. Mystici corporis Christi In 1943, Pius issued the Mystici corporis Christi encyclical, in which he condemned the practice of killing the disabled and reiterated Catholic teaching on the unity of the human race. He stated his \\"profound grief\\" at the murder of the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from hereditary disease... as though they were a useless burden to Society\\", in condemnation of the ongoing Nazi euthanasia program.Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; 2008 pp.529-30 The program was prelude to the Holocaust, and involved the killing of the senile, the mentally handicapped and mentally ill, epileptics, cripples, children with Down's Syndrome and people with similar afflictions.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.60 The program involved the systematic murder of more than 70,000 people.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Blessed Clemens August, Graf von Galen; web Apr 2013 The encyclical also reiterated Catholic teaching on the equality of races - speaking of \\"divinely-given unity - by which all men of every race are united to Christ in the bond of brotherhood\\".Mystici corporis Christi - Para 5; Encyclical of Pope Pius XII The Encyclical was followed, on 26 September 1943, by an open condemnation by the German Bishops which, from every German pulpit, denounced the killing of \\"innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped, incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages, and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent\\". Communium Interpretes The remainder of Pius XII's wartime encyclicals addressed theological issues or the anniversary of historical events within the church. Pius XII next addressed the situation in Europe in April 1945 with Communium Interpretes. The short document, written when the war was near conclusion, turned to the themes of peace and reconciliation, emphasizing the need for charity on the part of the victors.Text of Communium Interpretes. Radio addresses Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address measured 26 pages and over 45 minutes.Ritner and Roth, 2002, p. 3. The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society, focusing on principles rather than particular facts.Phayer, 2008, p. 53. Pius XII, however, did not address the perpetrators or victims by name,Phayer, 2008, pp. 52-53. nor did he mention Jews or antisemitism. The \\"pivotal words that remain one of the key flashpoints in the Holocaust-related controversy that continues to swirl around him\\" came near the end of the speech. Pius XII stated: > Humanity owes this vow to those hundreds of thousands who, without any fault > on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have > been consigned to death or to a slow decline [also translated: \\"marked down > for death or gradual extinction\\"] Some contemporaries, particularly the hierarchy of the Dutch Catholic Church, did interpret the speech to refer to the Holocaust.Phayer, 2008, p. 59. However, Catholic Poles believed that the address referred to them alone and wished that the pope had identified the Germans as the perpetrators.Phayer, 2008, pp. 58-59. After the speech, Pius XII also assured his German ambassador, Diego von Bergen, by pulling him aside and reassuring him that his remarks were intended for the Soviets and Stalin rather than the Germans.Phayer, 2008, p. 63. Historians are divided on the speech, which remains a \\"lightning rod in debates\\" with its interpretation \\"unsettled and unsettling\\".Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 4. One of Pius XII's main critics, Michael Phayer, did change his interpretation of the speech between his 2000 and 2008 books, acknowledging in his later work that historians (himself included) have been \\"too dismissive of the 1942 address\\" although he agrees that \\"Pius never spoke out again\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 43. Speeches Pius XII gave many speeches on the subject of the war in Europe, generally urging peace; according to S√°nchez, \\"he was most circumspect, not naming names and avoiding any hint that one power was worse than another or that the Germans were bent on unjustified aggression\\".S√°nchez, 2000, p. 47. Additionally, \\"most of Pius' words are bound up in papal rhetoric and scriptural allusions rather than formulated as direct statements\\".S√°nchez, 2000, p. 48. S√°nchez identifies the few public speeches of Pius XII which he believes constitute \\"his few direct statements\\". However, S√°nchez's list pertains to the war, not the Holocaust; in S√°nchez's view, Pius XII was indeed silent on the Holocaust, but justifiably so (see below).S√°nchez, 2000, p. 48-63. S√°nchez summarizes his view as follows: > Popes have seldom spoken in direct simple sentences. Pius, a trained > diplomat, was even less direct than most. Reading encyclicals and other > papal statements often requires interpretive skills to determine just > exactly what is said. As a result, people can read into some papal words > what they want to hear. And looked at in hindsight, Pius' words of protest > fall short when measured against the horror of Nazi machinery of > destruction.S√°nchez, 2000, p. 66. Private correspondence S√°nchez also analyzes Pius XII's private correspondence, most of which is to various diplomats either accredited to or from the pope.S√°nchez, 2000, pp. 63-68. He mentions none that pertain to the Holocaust directly, although he does produce examples of concern for non- combatant victims. Statements of his diplomats Much has been said about the statements and correspondents of Pius XII's nuncios, placed throughout Europe, in no small part because these statements comprise the bulk of the Actes et documents du Saint Si√®ge relatifs √† la Seconde Guerre Mondiale (ADSS), the only documents from Pius XII's papacy which have been made available for researchers from the Vatican Secret Archives. Perhaps the most comprehensive study is that of Morley, Vatican Diplomacy and the Jews During the Holocaust, 1939-1943 (1980), . Morley's central conclusion is: > This study of the Vatican and Jewish sources has revealed little evidence > that the nuncios manifested any consistent humanitarian concern about the > sufferings of the Jews during the years 1939 to 1943. This research has > indicated that the Vatican diplomats only rarely acted on behalf of the Jews > as Jews, and this usually only for specific individuals. They sometimes had > words of sympathy for the Jews, but little action followed from these > words.Morley, 1980, p. 196. By the count of Australian historian Paul O'Shea, volume eight of the ADSS contains 107 references to Jews in the period prior to December 1942; various other historians have analyzed these, statement by statement.Phayer, 2008, p. 45. Post-war statements Pius XII lived and reigned as pope until his death in October 1958. Evaluations by scholarly sources Sources criticizing silence Carlo Falconi's The Silence of Pius XII (first published in 1965, in Italian) is devoted almost entirely to the analysis of the public statements, and lack thereof, of the pope. Falconi argues: that the pope was silent,Falconi, 1970, pp. 31-45. that the pope had specific and extensive knowledge of the Holocaust,Falconi, 1970, pp. 46-65. and that the pope was frequently implored to speak out.Falconi, 1970, pp. 66-73. Falconi advances this argument generally, and then specifically in the cases of PolandFalconi, 1970, pp. 109-243. and Croatia.Falconi, 1970, pp. 259-351. Falconi examines the various justifications and explanations for Pius XII's silence, offering his opinion on their plausibility; he himself settles on a combination of pessimism, fear of Communism, and securing the future survival and influence of the church.Falconi, 1970, pp. 74-98. Falconi summarizes Pius XII's public statements as follows: > Pius XII never promulgated an explicit and direct condemnation of the war > and aggression, and still less of the unspeakable acts of violence carried > out by the Germans and their accomplices under cover of war.Falconi, 1970, > p. 29. Falconi's work examines not only the Holocaust, but also the war as a whole; specifically with respect to genocide, Falconi concludes: > Not a single document dealt with it explicitly or exclusively, and the rare > and limited hints were made in summary allusions. Moreover these were > drafted not in a language of outrage but consistently in a cold and > juridical style. We look in vain among the hundreds of pages of Pius XII's > allocutions, messages, and writings for the angry, fiery words that would > brand such horrible acts for ever.Falconi, 1970, pp. 39-40. Yad Vashem's caption affixed to two photos of Pius XII in its Jerusalem Holocaust memorial focuses in large part on Pius XII's lack of public protest: > In 1933, when he was Secretary of the Vatican State, he was active in > obtaining a Concordat with the German regime to preserve the Church's rights > in Germany, even if this meant recognizing the Nazi racist regime. When he > was elected Pope in 1939, he shelved a letter against racism and anti- > Semitism that his predecessor had prepared. Even when reports about the > murder of Jews reached the Vatican, the Pope did not protest either verbally > or in writing. In December 1942, he abstained from signing the Allied > declaration condemning the extermination of the Jews. When Jews were > deported from Rome to Auschwitz, the Pope did not intervene. The Pope > maintained his neutral position throughout the war, with the exception of > appeals to the rulers of Hungary and Slovakia towards its end. His silence > and the absence of guidelines obliged Churchmen throughout Europe to decide > on their own how to react. In a review of Michael Phayer's book \\"Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War for the Catholic journal Commonweal John Connelly wrote > We know that Pius never openly condemned Nazi genocide of the Jews. But what > did he say when fellow Catholics became victims of mass murder? The answer > is: not much. From the fall of 1939 the Nazi regime began a slaughter of > Polish Catholics without precedent. Priests were arrested and incarcerated > by the thousands. Men, women, and children died by the hundreds of > thousands, victims of calculated policies of extermination that can be > called genocidal. Pius was supplied with reports of Nazi crimes in Poland, > but to the chagrin of Polish church officials he issued no public protest. > During 1942 reports poured into the Vatican detailing Nazi mass murder, not > only of Poles but of Jews. Poles and non-Poles wondered in disbelief at the > Vatican's silence. In September 1942 the governments of Brazil, Uruguay, > Peru, Cuba, and Belgium sent demarches to the Holy See asking for the pope > to speak out against the atrocities. American and British representatives to > the Vatican also urged the pope to protest. Phayer surmises that Pius must > have felt upstaged by virtually every non-Nazi voice of opinion on earth, > and therefore released his Christmas message in 1942, which mentioned the > \\"hundreds of thousands of persons who, without any fault on their part, > sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to > death or to a slow decline.\\"The First Cold Warrior?\\": Review of Pius XII, > the Holocaust and the Cold War by Michael Phayer\\" Commonweal, 26 September > 2008, 20-24 Sources defending silence The bulk of S√°nchez's work is dedicated to examining the motives of Pius XII for (what S√°nchez deems to be) his silence.S√°nchez, 2000, pp. 69-113. S√°nchez proceeds to argue at length that a papal protest would have made matters worse.S√°nchez, 2000, pp. 114-120, 131-136. He argues that the pope himself held this view; according to S√°nchez, Pius XII only expressed this view once publicly, but repeated it more often privately; in a June 2, 1943 address to the College of Cardinals the pope said: > Every single word in Our statements addressed to the competent authorities, > and every one of Our public utterances, has had to be weighed and pondered > by Us with deep gravity, in the very interest of those who are suffering, so > as not to render their position even more difficult and unbearable than > before, be it unwittingly and unintentionally.S√°nchez, 2000, p. 114. Albrecht von Kessel, who during the war was an official at the German Embassy to the Holy See, wrote in 1963: > We were convinced that a fiery protest by Pius XII against the persecution > of the Jews ... would certainly not have saved the life of a single Jew. > Hitler, like a trapped beast, would react to any menace that he felt > directed at him, with cruel violence. Commenting on the counter productiveness of religious condemnation of Nazism, Mgr Jean Bernard, who was interned at Dachau, recounted that: > The detained priests trembled every time news reached us of some protest by > a religious authority, but particularly by the Vatican. We all had the > impression that our warders made us atone heavily for the fury these > protests evoked ... whenever the way we were treated became more brutal, the > Protestant pastors among the prisoners used to vent their indignation on the > Catholic priests: 'Again your big naive Pope and those simpletons, your > bishops, are shooting their mouths off .. why don't they get the idea once > and for all, and shut up. They play the heroes and we have to pay the bill. A similar sentiment was echoed by Jewish historian Pinchas Lapide who noted that: > The saddest and most thought provoking conclusion is that whilst the > Catholic clergy of Holland protested more loudly, expressly and frequently > against Jewish persecutions than the religious hierarchy of any other Nazi- > occupied country, more Jews - some 107,000 or 79% of the total - were > deported from Holland; more than anywhere else in the West. Lapide concludes that: > When armed force ruled well-nigh omnipotent, and morality was at its lowest > ebb, Pius XII commanded none of the former and could only appeal to the > latter, in confronting, with bare hands, the full might of evil. A sounding > protest, which might turn out to be self-thwarting - or quiet, piecemeal > rescue? Loud words - or prudent deeds? The dilemma must have been sheer > agony, for which ever course he chose, horrible consequences were > inevitable. Unable to cure the sickness of an entire civilization, and > unwilling to bear the brunt of Hitler's fury, the Pope, unlike many far > mightier than he, alleviated, relieved, retrieved, appealed, petitioned - > and saved as best he could by his own lights. Who, but a prophet or a martyr > could have done much more?. Sources claiming non-silence Margherita Marchione, a Catholic nun who has written several books responding the critics of Pius XII, disputes whether Pius XII was silent. She states: > In view of the evidence, now apparent and accessible, the charge of modern > critics that Pius XII was \\"silent\\" is unfair. His secret diplomatic > initiatives, solemn warnings, and appeals to peoples and governments were > not heeded. Apparently critics have failed to do their research or have > refused to acknowledge the evidence regarding the alleged \\"silence\\" of Pius > XII.Margherita Marchione. 2000. Pope Pius XII: architect for peace. Paulist > Press. p. 88. Marchione seemingly argues both that Pius XII spoke out and that speaking out would have been counterproductive, proceeding to argue: > Voices in hindsight are judging the \\"Popes\\" silence without considering the > consequences of \\"speaking out.\\" Those critics do not recall that the Pope > had been advised by Jewish leaders and by the bishops in occupied countries > not to protest publicly against Nazi atrocities. However, Pius XII > frequently invoked \\"God's vengeance\\" on the persecutors. His words were the > brave words of a diplomat who put focus on \\"those who are responsible.\\" Marchione's book reproduces an article originally published by Pierre Blet, a Jesuit priest who served as one of the editors of the ADSS, in La Civilt√† Cattolica on the topic; Blet's article does not quote any particular statements of Pius XII, although it does include numerous quotes of praise of Pius XII by contemporaries and a lengthy explanation of the contents of the ADSS, criticizing historians who requested that the full archives be opened.Marchione, 2000, pp. 178-189. Marchione prefaces Blet's article with an exchange where a reporter asks Pope John Paul II about Pius XII's \\"silence\\" and the pope replies: \\"Read Father Blet's article\\".Marchione, 2000, p. 178. In a later book, Marchione states: > Whenever Pius XII spoke out, there was immediate retaliation by the Nazis. > There were more than sixty protests! The so-called \\"silence\\" of Pope Pius > XII is a myth.Margherita Marchione. 2007. Did Pope Pius XII help the Jews?. > Paulist Press. p. 9. In popular culture The \\"silence\\" of Pius XII is the primary subject matter of Rolf Hochhuth's 1963 play The Deputy, which was adapted into the 2002 film Amen. by Costa Gavras.

Biography Thomas Gilbert and John Marshall were the captains of two East India Company vessels, the Charlotte and the Scarborough, returning from carrying convicts to Botany Bay in 1788, when they sailed through the Gilbert Islands and described Aranuka, Kuria, Abaiang and Tarawa. The vessels had been part of the First Fleet carrying convicts to Australia. They had sailed in a convoy under the command of post-captain Arthur Phillip, New South Wales' first Governor. The two vessels encountered their first island in the Gilberts on 17 June 1788. In a 1941 article in Life Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that this Island was told to be Abemama, but might have been Aranuka. by Henry Evans Maude, Jps. Gilbert visited Tarawa on 20 June 1788.

After the battalion was organized it was sent to Southern California, three companies being stationed at Camp Latham, near Los Angeles, and two at Camp Carleton, near San Bernardino. November 20‚Äì29, 1861, a detachment under Second Lt. C. R. Wellman was stationed at Camp Wright, and pursued and captured Dan Showalter's party west of the San Jose Valley and Warner's Ranch. The battalion remained in Southern California until the spring of 1862, when it became part of the California Column, and formed the advance force of that Column during the march to New Mexico Territory and Texas. In 1863, the Regiment was brought to full strength when seven more companies were raised to bring it to a full strength of twelve companies. The five companies first organized were mustered out August 31, 1864, the terms of service of most of the men having expired. Two new companies, B and C, were organized in New Mexico, by consolidation of the few men whose terms had not expired, and by new enlistments, and two new companies were enlisted in California, A and E, which, upon the completion of their organization, were sent to Arizona.

In 1790 he took control of the family business Jacob Kielland & S√∏n and soon became one of the wealthiest and most distinguished figures in the city. Around 1800, he commissioned the building of the large country house Ledaal, which would later become a royal residence in Stavanger. In 1815, he was elected to the Parliament of Norway, though was unable to assume office. His personal success also facilitated the rise to prominence of other members of the Kielland dynasty, who became influential in the commercial, cultural and public life of Stavanger and of Norway for more than a century. Career Gabriel Schanche Kielland was born in Stavanger as the only son of captain and businessman Jacob Jansen Kielland (1727‚Äì1788) and Elisabeth Schanche (1733‚Äì1784). He originally intended to be a teacher, and studied Classics for seven years with private tuition. In practice, due to his father's declining health and his being the only son, he took over his father's business. He acquired burghership in Stavanger in 1783, and after four years in his own trade company, he became a partner in his father's company in 1787. He also conducted several travels to the Nordic countries, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, in order to study trade and to build a business network. After the death of his father in 1788, he bought shares from his sisters. In 1790 he merged the trade company and his inherited properties, creating the company Jacob Kielland & S√∏n. The properties included a brickworks in Sandnes. The building of the country- house, Ledaal, was finished in 1803. As well as being a base for leisure and social gatherings, it also functioned as a small, private museum and library. Ledaal was acquired by Stavanger Museum in 1936, and opened as a royal residence in 1949. Jacob Kielland & S√∏n was also heavily involved in shipping. In 1801 the company owned one fregate, one barque, six brigs and one galeas. The company had benefitted from the French Revolutionary Wars, both from trade, since Denmark-Norway was neutral, and also because Kielland was engaged in insurance and, in this capacity, often made a good return when identifiable flotsam was auctioned. As the local vice consul for Great Britain from 1787, his intervention was able to secure respect for the neutrality of Denmark- Norway in 1793 and 1796 from British warships. He held several posts among the notable citizens of Stavanger: he became town lieutenant at a young age and, in 1784, was promoted to command the town vigilantes. In 1801, following the Battle of Copenhagen, the United Kingdom and Denmark-Norway became belligerents and it was the vigilantes of Stavanger who set up the city's coastal batteries. In the same year, failed crops led to lack of grain in Stavanger Amt. Jacob Kielland & S√∏n managed, for a good part, to uphold the grain supply. The same thing happened in 1807, when the Gunboat War broke out, an open war between the United Kingdom and Denmark-Norway. Kielland organized grain storage in an initial phase, although others took over. Kielland also contributed personally to funding the standing defence of Norway. The company experienced hardships during the war as many ships were taken by privateers, and trade became difficult. It survived the Gunboat War partly due to \\"pliable circumvention of taxes\\". In 1809, Kielland's work during this very difficult time received recognition with the award of: Knight of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog. He resumed his role as British vice consul in 1816, but was now also consular agent for Prussia, from 1813, plus, from 1817, vice consul for the city-state of Hamburg. In 1815 he was elected to the Parliament of Norway, but illness prevented him from actually assuming office. When he died in March 1821, in Stavanger, he was one of the wealthiest people in the city. Family In April 1783 he married Johanna Margaretha Bull (1758‚Äì1818), daughter of Jens Bull, himself a former son-in-law of Vincent Stoltenberg (1694‚Äì1763), ancestor of the Stoltenberg family.Genealogy for Jens Bull (in Norwegian). Retrieved 17 October 2009. Gabriel and Johanna Kielland had six children: four sons and two daughters.Genealogy for Gabriel Schanche Kielland (in Norwegian). Retrieved 17 October 2009.

Through his second surviving son, Jacob Kielland (1788-1863), he became paterfamilias of two distinguished lines of descent. Confusingly, there is a Jacob Kielland in almost every generation of this families and sometimes within different branches of the same generation, so middle names are often used in reference, though even then many of the family names are still not unique.

Born a prince of Great Britain and Ireland as the great-grandson of Queen Victoria, Hubertus lost this title during the First World War. He became heir apparent to the headship of his house in 1932, and he never married. Hubertus joined the Nazi Party upon the outbreak of the Second World War despite his opposition to Adolf Hitler and Nazism. He served in the German Army on the Eastern Front until he was killed in action. He is the maternal uncle of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. Family Sibylla in 1917 Prince Hubertus was born on 24 August 1909 at Reinhardsbrunn Castle, German Empire. A 72-gun salute took place at Friedenstein Palace 40 minutes after the Prince's birth. The third child and second son of Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, he was christened Dietmar Hubertus Friedrich Wilhelm Philipp on 21 September with his maternal grandfather, Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, serving as godfather. Besides ruling a state of the German Empire, Charles Edward was a British peer and a British prince as the grandson of Queen Victoria. Charles Edward lost his Coburg and Gotha throne during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, and then was stripped of his British titles in 1919 for siding with Germany in the First World War. Hubertus had an older brother, Hereditary Prince Johann Leopold, who was heir apparent to their father, and three more siblings: Princess Sibylla, Princess Caroline Mathilde, and Prince Friedrich Josias. Though Charles Edward was brought up as an Englishman and the family mainly spoke English at home, Hubertus spoke German fluently, as did his siblings. He was hindered by timidity but was nevertheless the favourite of the family. He was especially close to his sister Sibylla and remained her confidant in adulthood. The children lived in fear of their father, who ran his family \\"like a military unit\\".  Youth  Little is known about the career of Prince Hubertus. He received a private education before enrolling at the Gymnasium Casimirianum in Coburg. He then studied law. According to Harald Sandner, biographer of Duke Charles Edward, it became evident during the studies that Prince Hubertus was homosexual, but his sexual orientation remained secret. When his brother Hereditary Johann Leopold renounced his succession rights in order to marry a commoner in 1932, Hubertus became the new heir apparent to the defunct throne of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The same year, Hubertus attended the wedding of his sister Sibylla and Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, Duke of V√§sterbotten, staying close to the bride during the ceremony. Hubertus himself was not willing to marry.  Second World War  The father of Prince Hubertus, Duke Charles Edward, was an ardent supporter of Adolf Hitler. The entire family enthusiastically welcomed the rise of German nationalism. Soon, however, Hubertus and his mother, Duchess Victoria Adelaide, grew to despise the rising Nazi Party. After witnessing the torture of Jews, Prince Hubertus was forbidden to discuss it at home. The Second World War broke out in September 1939, and all of Charles Edward's sons were enlisted in the German Army (Wehrmacht). Prince Hubertus formally became a member of the Nazi Party on 19 October 1939, but remained opposed to Hitler for the rest of his life. In 1940, Hitler issued the Prinzenerlass, a decree prohibiting members of Germany's formerly reigning families from actively serving in the Wehrmacht, fearing that this would increase the public's sympathy for the deposed dynasties and threaten his grip on power. Such was Charles Edward's loyalty to Hitler, however, that the decree did not apply to the Duke's sons. During the war it was even reported that Hitler considered making Hubertus his Gauleiter for the United Kingdom. The graves of Hubertus and his siblings at Callenberg Castle Prince Hubertus was an accomplished aviator. Serving in the Luftwaffe as a courier pilot in the Eastern Front, Hubertus obtained the rank of Oberleutnant (senior pilot). He was killed in action when his plane was shot down by the Soviet Air Forces on 26 November 1943 in Mosty, modern-day Ukraine. It was his last flight before he was to be relocated. News of his death spread on 3 December. Hubertus was buried the following day at the Coburg family cemetery at Callenberg Castle. The Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha announced the death of their son and heir in Gothaer Beobachter with a very short obituary on 11 December. The ducal couple's youngest son, Prince Friedrich Josias, became heir apparent in his stead. Princess Sibylla was distraught by the death of her favourite brother. In 1946, she had a son, the long-awaited heir to the Swedish throne, and named him Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus; he later became King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. When King Carl XVI Gustaf's grandson was christened Alexander Erik Hubertus Bertil, the choice of the name Hubertus was criticized by journalist Henrik Arnstad due to Prince Hubertus' membership of the Nazi Party. Arnstad was rebuked for his comments by political analyst Ivar Arpi.  Titles and honours  Hubertus was styled as \\"His Highness Prince Hubertus of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\\". Being a member of the House of Wettin, he also held the title Duke of Saxony. As a male-line great-grandson of a British monarch, Hubertus was Prince of Great Britain and Ireland until the use of the title was restricted to the children and grandchildren of a monarch by letters patent of 1917. He was a knight of the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim.

Billy Joe When she was seventeen, Cassie bought an \\"ugly necklace\\" from a pawn shop and discovered that it was haunted by a ghost named Billy Joe. Now Billy serves as a spy and ally for Cassie, because practically none of the supernatural community can see him. Tomas Tomas was born in Peru during the conquest, the bastard son of a priestess of Inti and a Spanish conquistador. His father didn't stay around long enough to impart his surname‚Äîor much of anything else‚Äîbut Tomas could have taken his master's name once a life-challenged Spanish nobleman took a liking to him. But after being forcibly changed into a vampire and treated as a slave for four hundred years, he wasn't feeling too chummy. Now, all he wants is his hated master dead‚Äîpermanently. He'll figure out the rest later. Rafe Raphael was a vampire under Tony's control, who acted somewhat as a father figure to Cassie. Mircea Basarab Mircea Basarab is a bridge character, playing an important role in both the Cassandra Palmer and Dorina Basarab novels. He also has his own book, Masks, describing some of his history. And he has a lot of it, being a five-hundred-year-old master vampire and a member of the powerful Vampire Senate. The Senate is currently vying with the Silver Circle, the world's chief magical organization, for control of the new Pythia‚Äîand the power she commands. That puts Cassie in a bad position (as if she's ever in anything else). She's personally drawn to Mircea, but sometimes suspects that his interest might have more to do with her power than with her person. Other times, she's not sure she cares. Francoise Francoise doesn't have a last name because she was born a poor village girl in seventeenth century France. She doesn't have much of anything else, either, after being transported to the twenty-first century through a series of alarming events. Well, that's not entirely true. She still has her magic‚Äîand while it's seriously outdated, at least the Inquisition isn't after her anymore. And she has a new boyfriend who would be perfect if he wasn't possessed by an ancient demon. But Francoise has learned the hard way‚Äîyou have to take what you can get out of life. And she's busy taking everything she can. Tony A vampire mob boss and Cassie's former guardian. The Consul The Consul is featured in both the Cassie Palmer and Dorina Basarab series, something she would say is only her right as the leader of the dreaded North American Vampire Senate. And no one is likely to argue with her, since she is as powerful as she is beautiful, and as deadly as the snakes that serve as her emblem. And speaking of power, she wants Cassie's under the control of the senate and no one else. It is needed because the consul is currently involved in a struggle with the leaders of the other five senates for control of the vampire world. That world is at war and must unite or perish. But unity implies a single ruler, something that has never happened in all of vampire history. And the other leaders also want the top spot. So whether Cassie likes it or not, she has just become the consul's ace in the hole.

The building is located at 22 Karl Johans gate in central Oslo, Norway. It was taken into use on 5 March 1866 and was designed by the Swedish architect Emil Victor Langlet.Official video from the Plenary Chamber www.visitoslo.com History Following the establishment of the Parliament of Norway in 1814, which had happened at a private home belonging to Carsten Anker in Eidsvoll, the newly established legislature started meeting at Christiania l√¶rde Skole at Tollbodgaten and Dronningsgate. From 1854, the legislature started using the grand hall at the Royal Frederick University. However, proposals of an own parliament building had arisen. The parliament voted down a government proposal to create such a building in 1833, but in 1836, the work to establish a permanent building started. Twelve lots in central Oslo, located between the Royal Palace and Oslo East Station. The government decided to build in the Palace Park, and this was passed by the parliament. However, instead the government chose to purchase the current lot instead. This was approved by parliament in 1857. The next discussion was related to the architecture. Several proposals were made, and twelve of these have been preserved. A design competition was initiated in 1856, and this was won by the architects Heinrich Ernst Schirmer and Wilhelm von Hanno. However, the Storting decided to reject the proposal because it looked too much like a church. Instead, a proposal from the Swedish architect Emil Victor Langlet was chosen with 59 against 47 votes on 18 May 1860. Construction started on 3 August 1860, and the cornerstone was laid on 10 October 1861. The building cost . The parliament moved in on 5 March 1866. Initially, the building was too large for the needs of the legislature, and several other government agencies, including the Office of the Auditor General of Norway, the National Archival Services, the Mapping and Cadastre Authority and the Director of Canals were also housed there. As the parliament has expanded, these various agencies have moved out. During the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, the Storting relocated and held two meetings, once in a cinema in Hamar and once at Elverum Folk High School (Elverum folkeh√∏gskole). The remaining meetings during World War II were held abroad. During the war, the building was taken over by the German forces, and at first used as barracks. Later, Reichskommissar Josef Terboven with administration moved into the building. The Lagting Chamber was refurnished, with the ceiling lowered and the interior redecorated with mahogany panels and funkis style. From 1951 to 1959, a four- story office building was built at the back of the building. The courtyard was filled in, and the chamber expanded. This work was led by architect Nils Holter (1899-1995). In 1872, parliament bought Prinsens gate 26, in 1988 they bought Akersgata 21, in 1993 Nedre Vollgate 20, in 1997 Nedre Vollgate 18 and in 1999 Tollbugaten 31. The parliament also rents offices in Akersgata 18. Architecture The building is built in yellow brick with details and basement in light gray granite. It is a combination of several styles, including inspirations from France and Italy. A characteristic feature of Stortingsbygningen is the way the plenary chamber is located in the semi- circular section in the front of the building, as opposed to the building's centre. The back side of the building mirrors the facade of the front, with the meeting chamber of the now-abolished Lagting legislative chamber. The interior of the building is also designed by Langlet.

He then received his B.S. from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 1956 and his doctorate in physics from Harvard University in 1964. At Harvard, Adler started a dissertation on quantum field theory advised by Julian Schwinger at a time when Prof. Schwinger was revolutionizing theoretical physics. But Schwinger, who has been criticized for ignoring his graduate students,See, e.g., Abraham Klein, ‚ÄúRecollections of Julian Schwinger,‚Äù in Y. Jack Ng (ed.), Julian Schwinger: The Physicist, the Teacher, and the Man (World Scientific Publishing 1996) , pp. 5-7. lost Adler‚Äôs thesis draft, and Adler changed his research direction, completing his Ph.D. on the theory of semiconductor-to-metal transitions with Harvey Brooks. Next, Dr. Adler worked for a year as a research associate at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) in Harwell, United Kingdom. He then became a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1965, advancing to full professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1975. During his relatively short career, Adler published almost 300 papers in technical journals and presented over 80 invited papers at scientific meetings throughout the world. Prof. Adler played a key role in the development and operation of MIT‚Äôs Concourse, a small, interdisciplinary program of studies for undergraduates. Since Adler was ‚Äúregarded as one of his department‚Äôs most outstanding teachers of undergraduates‚Äù Tech Talk (MIT), Apr. 7, 1987, p. 8. and headed up its undergraduate thesis program, MIT established in his honor the yearly David Adler Memorial Thesis Prize for Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis. Adler was a Fellow of the American Physical Society, which also created an annual award in his honor, the David Adler Lectureship Award in the Field of Materials Physics. He served as a regional editor of the Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, an associate editor of Materials Research Bulletin, and an editorial board member of the publication Semiconductors & Insulators. Adler was also well known in the physics community for his love and knowledge of fine food and world travel.See, e.g., Hoddeson & Garrett, pp. 156, 327 n.22. Adler was married to biochemist Alice J.

The film was described by Rupert Smith in The Guardian as \\"...television drama in excelsis, hitting all the right buttons ‚Äì action, comedy, pathos, satire ‚Äì as well as having shedloads of righteous political anger...\\",Rupert Smith, https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/mar/18/broadcasting.tvandradio though Mark Lawson criticised its portrayal of Tony Blair strumming a guitar while \\"sending men to their deaths on the telephone\\". Aukin responded by insisting that the scene had been misinterpreted. The film went on to win the 2005 BAFTA Award for Best Single Drama. At the 2007 BAFTA awards, two of Aukin's works were nominated: The Trial of Tony Blair for Best Single Drama and Britz which won Best Drama Serial. He also produced or executive produced Endgame, The Promise, The Hamburg Cell, A Very Social Secretary, and Mrs Henderson Presents.

Distribution  This species occurs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, from Canada to Baja California, Mexico. Crepidula is usually found in semi-permanent stacks of 2 Crepidula adunca individuals (usually more females than males). They do not reproduce well in the mid-intertidal zone, (20-30 meters). They live in epizootic associations, where the adults are inactive and the C. adunca‚Äôs shell grows to fit the shape of its host's shell. Mobile juveniles must choose long-term hosts, other animals, that minimize their chances of death. However, they cannot voluntarily remove themselves from their host once they reach a certain size. They prefer warm weather, and climate change has caused increase in population of C. adunca.  Characteristics  The Crepidula adunca is a mollusk that relies on suspension feeding (filters food out of the water) and are hermaphrodites that brood their young. They live in long-term epizootic associations. Females are usually larger than males. C. adunca have dense patches of cilia around the mouth, near the head, located on the side between the tentacles, and on the foot, which develops before anything else. There can be a size overlap between males and females of stacking species (and non- stacking). A stacking species is when the organisms attach to one another creating a stack of them. The young are kept in capsules in the mantle cavity (where other organs are kept) of the parent. The mollusks leave the parent when they are adult size and have all organs except for the reproductive organs. When they are young, they experience a male phase, and later in life change into a female phase, a process known as sequential hermaphroditism. It was disproved, with C. adunca, that males in solitary and males surrounded by females sex change at different time, instead there is little difference.  Reproduction  The longer the female the greater average of gamete abundance. Females typically reproduce the same amount of eggs in a capsule no matter where they are in development. C. adunca embryos are born as crawling juveniles. Development for embryos happens in capsules. C. adunca reproduce in eggs, where multiple eggs are contained in capsules. Growth and development in the capsules happens at the same time at the same speed. Before all the features, the eyes are developed and seen first, then kidney cells are formed near the side of the ciliated mouth. C. adunca juveniles are able to filter feed right after birth. The C. adunca hatchling develops multiple embryonic kidneys, where other Crepidula only develop one, meaning it is a direct developer and also cannot develop the operculum. For Crepidula species, the phallus of the organism usually becomes reaches full size when there is enough sperm to fill the spermatic vesicles, then it begins to outgrow its juvenile shell. However C. adunca is an exception, where the phallus immediately begins growth at the time of hatching. C. adunca broods to reproduce, all year. It does not differ between stacking and non stacking females. C. adunca are oviparous, meaning they develop in eggs. In the beginning of mitosis (the first two cell divisions) a polar lobe forms, which takes roughly 42 hours. Once the cells are clear and the head and foot of the mollusc are not fully developed, a shell begins to grow over the embryo. The shell develops color pigments before it fully grown. C. adunca hatch when all the yolk has been absorbed. Development of the C. adunca in the eggs takes around four months. When hatched, the gills and radula are fully grown, and no longer need to develop; the only signs of larvae growth are the embryonic kidneys and head vesicle grown in the eggs. The shell is not yet fully developed into an adult size, but is bilaterally proportional to the new hatchling.  Nervous system  The Crepidula adunca nervous system begins at the neck. There are two main nerves in the head, that give rise to other nerves. The pedal ganglia (supplies nerves to the foot of the snail) gives rise to four other nerves leading to the foot and back to the neck. The visceral loop is made up of three different types of ganglia - the sub-intestinal, the supra-intestinal and the visceral. The visceral loop has a nerve in the mantle of the C. adunca, which goes to the back of the head when it is contracted. After the foot begins growth, a tentacle begins to form. Finally, when the yolk in egg is absorbed, the embryo flattens and the nervous system finalizes, meaning the C. adunca is ready to hatch.  Nutrition  Because C. adunca filter feeds, it uses cilia to bring the small organisms over its gills where it filters out the bacteria from the water using mucus made by the gill cells. Once caught by the mucus, the cilia, known as ciliary action, carries the organisms to the mouth along the dorsal surface. The organisms that C. adunca filters for are diatoms, dinoflagellates, phytoplankton, bacteria, etc. References Category:Calyptraeidae Category:Gastropods described in 1825 ","title":"Crepidula adunca"},{"id":"24694390","text":"Stewart Home & School is a residential school in Franklin County, Kentucky serving individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities.

After his wife was arrested by the secret police during the Great Terror (1937-1938), Zack became a vehement Anti-Communist and testified before the Dies Committee (1939) and Canwell Committee (1948). Background Joseph Zack Kornfeder was born on March 20, 1898, in Trenƒç√≠n, Austria-Hungary (now Slovakia). His parents were ethnic Austrians, who raised their son Roman Catholic. In 1914, Zack traveled to Spain to join the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 230. (Knowledge of Spanish would serve later when the Comintern stationed him in Central America.) In 1915, the Kornfeder family emigrated to the United States in 1915, landing in New York City, where they made a home. Zack took a job as a garment worker and joined the Socialist Party of America within a year.Harvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 131. Career Communist activities In 1919, Zack became a founding member of the Communist Party of America (CPA). In April 1920, he may have left the CPA along with C.E. Ruthenberg to join the rival Communist Labor Party of America (CLP) in establishing the United Communist Party (UCP). Pseudonyms he used include \\"A.C. Griffith\\" and \\"J.P. Collins\\" during the underground period. Occasionally, he contributed articles to the Party press on trade union-related matters. In May 1921, Zack was elected a member of the unified Communist Party of America following its formation at a unity convention held at the Overlook Mountain House near Woodstock, New York.\\"Communist Party of America Officials,\\" Early American Marxism website. Retrieved October 14, 2009. He emerged as an outspoken advocate of elimination of the underground form of political organization. In 1922, Zack went as a delegate to the 1922 Bridgman Convention of the CPA, raided by police on August 22. Zack was arrested in the Justice Department-directed operation and was held for about four months, finally released in early 1923 on $5,000 bail. Zack was involved in the Communist Party's activities among the trade unions, conducted by William Z. Foster's Trade Union Educational League (TUEL). Zack was chosen as the head of TUEL's National Committee of the Needle Trades Section, which was organized November 22, 1922. During the bitter internecine factional struggle which swept the American Communist movement during the 1920s, Zack was a loyal partisan of the faction headed by Foster and James P. Cannon. On April 17, 1923, Zack resigned from the CEC of the CPA, which helped make way for Earl Browder, Robert Minor, and Alfred Wagenknecht, coopted to the 10-member body at that time. In 1926, Zack married a Russian woman, with whom he had one son. Zack attended the Comintern's International Lenin School (ILS) and sat as an American representative to the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), where he was made a member of ECCI's Anglo- American Secretariat, charged with Communist affairs in the English-speaking countries. According to Zack, the ILS included courses on Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Trade Union Organization, Party Organization, Military Organization, and the Agrarian Problem.Canwell, et al., First Report, Un- American Activities in Washington State, 1948, pp. 461-462. In 1930, Zack was dispatched as a Comintern Rep to South America, where he remained until the fall of 1931. While Zack was at the Comintern's disposal abroad, his wife and son remained in Moscow. In the fall of 1931, Zack was jailed in Venezuela, only gaining his release through the efforts of the United States Department of State. Home in the United States with his American citizen wife and New York City-born son still in the USSR,Albert F. Canwell, et al., First Report, Un-American Activities in Washington State, 1948. Olympia, WA: Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, 1948; pg. 453. Zack was named the Secretary for the Eastern District of the Trade Union Unity League (TUUL), successor to TUEL. Following his return from Central America, Zack made multiple appeals to CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder, without success to allow his wife and son to return to the United States.Canwell, et al., First Report, Un-American Activities in Washington State, 1948, pg. 454. Zack later claimed that Browder coerced him into signing receipts for $1,500 in Comintern funds that were supposed to have been sent to support Zack's efforts in Central America but never sent as a quid pro quo for the return of his wife and son ‚Äî a promise upon which Browder never delivered. Break In the Fall of 1934, Zack abruptly quit the CPUSA, ostensibly over the party's departure from the ultra-radicalism of the so-called \\"Third Period.\\" Zack briefly joined the Workers Party of the United States (WPUS), formed in 1934 by two small political organizations, headed by pacifist A.J. Muste and Trotskyist James P. Cannon, respectively. Zack then renounced Marxism completely, and founded a new group called the \\"One Big Union Club.\\"Max Shachtman, \\"Footnote for Historians,\\" New International, Vol. 4, No. 12, December 1938. Shachtman refers to it as an \\"Oehlerite stooge group\\". In 1936, Zack made an appeal to the US State Department in an attempt to persuade the USSR to allow his wife and child out of the country.Max Shachtman, \\"The Case of Joseph Zack,\\" The Socialist Appeal [New York], vol.3 no. 30 (July 23, 1938). His effort proved unsuccessful. In 1937, his wife ran afoul of the secret police during the Great Terror. Apparently, she was arrested as a relative of an enemy of the people: she served 18 years in Gulag labor camps, while their son grew up in a special home.Morris Childs, \\"Last Days in Moscow,\\" August 21, 1958, pp. 2-3 in \\"FBI SOLO Files - March 1958 to August 1960.\\" Washington, DC: Federal Bureau of Investigation, August 2011; pdf pages 285-286. The arrest of his wife turned Zack into an opponent of Joseph Stalin and the USSR. Anti-Communist activities On September 30, 1939, Zack testified before the Dies Committee extensively as a friendly witness. In succeeding years, he established himself as an outspoken anti-communist, addressing conservative gatherings and writing on the dangers of Stalin's dictatorship. On February 3, 1948, Zack testified to the Canwell Committee of the Washington state legislature.The testimony appears in Albert F. Canwell, et al., First Report, Un-American Activities in Washington State, 1948. Olympia, WA: Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, 1948; pp. 446-498. He gave a lengthy account of his career in the communist movement, including details about his activities as a party organizer in the American labor movement and of his break with the Communist International. On May 1, 1950, in Mosinee, Wisconsin, a local American Legion outpost staged a mock Communist takeover to illustrate what life under Soviet conquest might be like. Benjamin Gitlow, twice CPUSA vice-presidential candidate (1924, 1928), played the role of General Secretary of the \\"United Soviet States of America\\", while Zack played the new commissar of the newly renamed town of \\"Moskva.\\" A Soviet flag flew in front of the American Legion outpost.\\"Mosinee in Hands of 'Reds' After a Make Believe Coup\\", Milwaukee Journal, May 1, 1950\\"Mayor, Pastor Die at Mosinee\\", Milwaukee Journal, May 8, 1950, p3; \\"D-Day in Mosinee\\" , by Carl Weinberg, OAH Magazine of History (October 2010) In May 1951, Gitlow told the Senate's Subversive Activities Control Board that he had \\"repeatedly discussed\\" the board with its research director Benjamin Mandel as well as Zack. Gitlow said, \\"I discussed the conduct of this case. I discussed the attorneys in the case. I discussed the members of the panel.\\" Personal life and death Zack was married and had at least one child. His wife's imprisonment in the USSR and son's upbringing there caused him to become an anti-communist. Joseph Zack Kornfeder died age 65 of a heart attack while checking into a Washington, D.C., hotel on May Day, May 1, 1963. Works * \\"What Shall We Do in the Unions?\\" (as \\"J.P.

It won two top French awards, the Prix Goncourt and the Prix M√©dicis. The novel is told from the first- person perspective and tells the fictional story of a boy's memories and experiences with his French grandmother in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and '70s. Characters Charlotte Lemonnier, also known in Russian as Sharlota Norbertovna, is the heroine of the story, born in France in the early 1900s in the village of Neuilly-sur-Seine. She is a calm and dreamy Frenchwoman living in the town of Saranza by the Russian steppe, who teaches her grandchildren, a young boy and girl, of her French and Russian life through memories and newspaper clippings. The Narrator is the young boy of the story who grows up in the 1960s and '70s. He remains nameless except in the very end of the book. (He is only called Alyosha once by his grandmother.) His nickname by his Russian classmates is \\"Frantsuz\\" - the Russian word for Frenchman. He admires his grandmother more than anyone and is confused by his conflicting French and Russian heritages. This conflict is the main theme of the novel. The Narrator's Sister is another nameless character, like her brother. She is also Charlotte's granddaughter. Although she is present in the beginning of the novel accompanying her brother in their visits to Charlotte, she later goes to study in Moscow and is no longer mentioned. Pashka is a peer of the narrator who is also a loner. He is rejected by his classmates and wants nothing to do with them. He avoids society and conformity because he is more interested in nature and the outside world. Although he and the narrator never officially become \\"friends,\\" their mutual solitude brings them closer together. Norbert is Charlotte's father. Little is known of him other than he was a doctor who died at age 48, leaving Charlotte and her mother without much money. Albertine is Charlotte's mother and Norbert's wife, 26 years his junior. After Norbert's death she traveled several times between Siberia and France, taking Charlotte with her. She eventually settled in Siberia with Charlotte, battling severe depression and a morphine addiction. After returning to France one last time, she leaves Charlotte with her brother, Vincent, and leaves for Siberia, never to come back. She dies 2 years after reuniting with Charlotte, now in her 20s. Vincent is Charlotte's uncle and a reporter for the French newspaper Excelsior. He took photos of the flood of 1910, and ultimately inspired Charlotte to collect newspaper clippings. He dies in World War I. Fyodor is Charlotte's Russian husband, who marries her roughly a year after Albertine's death. It is unknown how he and Charlotte met. He works as a judge. He is arrested on a New Year's Eve in the beginning of World War II. He is later sent to fight in the war and is reported dead twice, yet he returns to Charlotte after the war, only to die less than a year later of his wounds. Sergei is Charlotte's son, the product of her rape by an unknown Uzbek man. Even though he is not Fyodor's true son, he is accepted and loved by him and Charlotte. Mother is the nameless mother of the narrator and Charlotte's daughter. When her son is 14 or 15, she dies suddenly of an illness that she kept secret from her family. Nikolai is the narrator's father and the nameless mother's husband. Little is said of him except that he dies of a heart attack only months after his wife's death. Aunt is the nameless aunt of the narrator who moves in to care for him and his sister after their parents' death. She is strong, resourceful, and instrumental in showing the young boy the \\"true\\" Russia - bitter, violent, and proud. Alex Bond is a Russian businessman employed by the narrator (now in his thirties) to see if Charlotte is still alive. Plot The book opens with the narrator leafing through photographs of old relatives in his grandmother's house in Saranza, a fictional Russian town on the border of the steppeNot to be confused with the village of Saranza in Iran.. His grandmother, Charlotte Lemonnier, comes in and starts talking about the photographs and her memories to the boy and his sister. The novel is characterized by stories like this: a collection of Charlotte's memories and the narrator's memories, intertwining so that the text moves seamlessly through their lives in a dreamlike fashion. The movement between Charlotte's French past and the Soviet present causes conflict in the boy's identity as the novel explores both sides of his heritage. Charlotte begins the novel by transporting her grandchildren to the French 'Atlantis' during the flooding of Paris in 1910. So begins the narrator's desire to learn all about this mysterious French past. He describes the town of Saranza in-between these stories. It is a quiet town bordering the Russian steppe that is lined with old izbas, traditional Russian houses made of logs. The town is a strange mixture of these old relics and the new regime's style that discards any excess or superfluous design, showcasing the theme of the clash between past and present. At the return of autumn, the boy narrator and his sister return to their hometown, an unnamed industrial, Stalinist-style city on the banks of the Volga. He quickly falls back into the pace of Russian life with its schooling and paramilitary exercises. He becomes confused by the conflicting images with which he has been presented: his grandmother's romanticized French image of Tsar Nicholas II versus \\"Nicholas the Bloody\\" as taught at his Soviet school. The narration reveals more of Charlotte's early life. After the death of her father Norbert, her widowed mother Albertine becomes unstable, making visits to Paris only to insist on returning to Russia. It is the grave of her husband that keeps bringing her back to the Siberian town of Boyarsk. Young Charlotte, roughly age nine, begins to give French lessons to the Governor of Boyarsk's daughter. She becomes caretaker to her mother, who is revealed as a morphine addict. After several relapses, Albertine takes Charlotte with her back to France. But in July 1914, when Charlotte is eleven, Albertine temporarily goes back to Siberia, to put an end to her Siberian life. She never returns to France. Then war breaks out and Charlotte's only caretaker, her uncle Vincent, is killed in battle. Time jumps ahead to 1921, when Charlotte, now a young woman, is chosen to go to Russia as a Red Cross nurse, because she can speak both French and Russian. Years pass with only the description of wartime hardship and the images of the countless mutilated soldiers that fall under Charlotte's care. Charlotte decides to return to the town of her childhood, Boyarsk, to see the fate of the izba where she and her mother once lived. She comes across an old grizzled woman living there only to find that it is her mother. When Charlotte tries to take her and leave Russia, the authorities of Boyarsk seize her papers and refuse to return them. Mother and daughter barely survive the winter. In May, fearing starvation, Albertine and Charlotte flee the town and begin working on a Siberian farm. Albertine dies two years later. Soon after that, Charlotte marries a Russian man named Fyodor and they settle in the Uzbek town of Bukhara. Coming back to the present, the children listen to more of Charlotte's dreamy stories of France through her \\"Siberian suitcase\\" filled with newspaper clippings. She talks of royalty, of President F√©lix Faure dying in the arms of his mistress, of restaurants, revolutions, etc. Back in his house, the narrator overhears his parents and other relatives talking of Charlotte. Because he is fourteen years old now, they tolerate his presence as they plunge into the details of Fyodor's arrest. Fyodor was dressed in the red outfit of Father Christmas to entertain his children on New Year's Eve when he was arrested. Although the reason is fuzzy, it is implied that it was partially because of Charlotte's \\"crime\\" of being French. Thus, Fyodor was suspected of spying for the French. He is eventually released and forced to move across the country, in a small city in the annexed Poland. One week later, he goes to Moscow supposedly temporarily, in order to be reinstated into the Party, however Charlotte never sees him again until four years later, after the war. A short time after Fyodor's disappearance, Germans bomb the city where Charlotte and her children are staying. As they manage to flee on the last train out of the city, Charlotte realizes that she brought with her the \\"Siberian suitcase\\" rather than the suitcase of warm clothes and food she had packed that morning. By chance, this suitcase becomes the last physical link between Charlotte and her life in France. She and the children settle in a town 100 km away from the front line. She works again as a nurse, caring for the wounded soldiers fourteen hours a day. In the midst of this constant presence of dying soldiers, Charlotte receives a letter informing her of Fyodor's death on the front. Soon after, she receives a second note of death, which ironically gives her hope that her husband is actually alive. Fyodor indeed returns to her after Japan's defeat in September 1945. Less than a year later, he dies of his wounds. Back to the present, the young narrator searches hungrily for all the information in his city about France. His obsession with France and the past alienates him from his classmates, making him a loner. Taunted and teased by his peers, he bonds with another loner nicknamed Pashka. The next summer, the narrator returns alone to Saranza, because his sister is now studying in Moscow. His fifteenth year marks the deterioration of his relationship with Charlotte. He is no longer that innocent little boy who felt the \\"magic\\" of Charlotte's stories. He becomes angry at Charlotte's retelling of the past, confused between this past and the harsh Russia he lives in. At the very end of August, only a few days before his departure from Saranza, he mends his bond with Charlotte. All of a sudden he realizes the beauty of this French past, and he and Charlotte understand each other again. Back in his hometown, the narrator's mother goes to the hospital for some tests. The teenage boy is reveling in the freedom of his mother's absence, only to be struck by her sudden death. In February, only a few months later, his father Nikolai dies too, of a heart attack. It is not his parents' deaths, but his aunt's arrival that changes his outlook on life. His aunt is a tough, no-nonsense, resourceful woman who teaches him to love Russia. Through her, he sees the harshness, the violence, and the darkness of Russia, yet he loves it still. As he says on page 144, \\"The blacker the Russia I was discovering turned out to be, the more violent my attachment became.\\" As he moves closer to his Russian heritage, he pushes away the French. As soon as he embraces his Russian identity, he becomes accepted by the peers that once scorned him. His \\"Frenchness\\" now turns into a gift, as he entertains his classmates with anecdotes about France. However, this alienates him from Pashka. In the cruel world of teenagers, he now openly scorns Pashka to gain the others' acceptance. It is on the Mountain of Joy, the mountain hideaway where all the teenagers go to dance and flirt, that the narrator has his first experience of \\"physical love.\\" It is a very awkward encounter, and he is further humiliated when his classmates make fun of him for not knowing \\"how to make love\\". It seems to the narrator that his \\"French implant\\" has made him an outcast, even among women. Without warning he takes a train to Saranza to put an end to this French nuisance. Despite the boy's anger, when he abruptly arrives at Saranza, Charlotte is calm and undisturbed. She starts talking about the things she saw during the war. On a walk outside the town, she addresses the narrator as \\"Alyosha\\" and tells him that even after all of her years in Russia, she still can't seem to understand her adopted country; its harshness still seems foreign. Yet at the same time, she understands it more than the Russians, for she has seen the solitude of that country and its people. As the narrator walks back to Saranza with his grandmother, he feels as though the Russian and French within him now live in peace, put to rest by Charlotte's words. Charlotte and her grandson spend their last summer together in peace. They walk down to the banks of the Sumra every day and read underneath the shade, speaking in French, talking about everything. Charlotte tells him how she was raped in her youth. She was in the desert when a young Uzbek man forced her down. After the rape, he tried to shoot her in the head, but it only grazed her temple. Left to die out in the desert, she survived thanks to a saiga, a desert antelope, which warmed her with its body heat and led her to a lake, where unknown travelers found her the next day. It was the rape that produced the narrator's Uncle Sergei, but Charlotte explains that she and Fyodor loved and accepted him as their first-born son. Ten years later, the narrator, now aged twenty-five, briefly visits Charlotte again. He is about to go abroad for two weeks, and it is implied he plans to use this trip in order to defect to Europe. He jokingly asks Charlotte to come to France with him. Despite France meaning the world to her, she calmly refuses. From the sadness in her voice, the narrator understands \\"what France meant to her\\" (page 204). Now it is twenty years after his last summer in Saranza, and the narrator is roughly thirty-five. As the Soviet Union is falling, his career as a Russian broadcaster at Radio Free Europe comes to an end, and he begins to wander aimlessly throughout Europe. As soon as he becomes used to the routine of a place, its sights, smells, and sounds, he is compelled to leave it. He begins to have fleeting thoughts of suicide, as a way out of routine. Amidst this mental distress he settles in a small apartment in Paris. One day, he comes down with a fever and drifts in and out of reality, eventually making a temporary home inside a family tomb in a cemetery. After feverishly wondering like a madman through Paris, he collapses by the river and sees a plaque inscribed with the words \\"Flood Level - January 1910\\". This plaque brings back a flood of memories of France and his Russian summers, but most importantly, it reminds him of Charlotte. He is struck by the desire to write about her and begins a book titled \\"Charlotte Lemonnier: Biographical Notes\\". He also starts nursing the hope of bringing Charlotte back to France one day. Three years later, he has published several books. His first works sat unsold because he wrote them in French, which prompted the critics to reject them as a Russian immigrant's attempt to use their language. However, once he claimed that he wrote them in Russian and had them translated into French, the critics hailed his novels. Thus, the narrator has written himself out of poverty and is now prepared to find Charlotte and bring her back to France. Alex Bond, a Russian businessman that he sent to Saranza, returns and tells him that his grandmother is alive and well. The only thing preventing him from going to Russia to get her is the lack of a French passport. As soon as he applies for the passport, he decides that in order to welcome Charlotte to France he must decorate his apartment with antiques that might make her feel more at home. He moves into a larger apartment with a lovely view, and buys her books that may remind her of the Paris of the past. Soon he has overspent his income, yet he is happily anticipating her arrival. As he finishes these preparations, he is eagerly waiting for the passport, in order to leave for Saranza. However, the Pr√©fecture de Police sends him a letter of rejection. He writes for an appeal, but the months slip by until it is August. By this time it has been a year since Alex Bond's trip to Saranza. A man named Val Grig travels to Paris to deliver a package to the narrator. He informs him that Charlotte Lemonnier died on September 9 of the previous year. His grandmother had actually died only a few short weeks after Alex Bond had visited her, meaning that everything the narrator did, everything he bought was in vain. The narrator sadly realizes that it was not the rejection of the passport that annulled his reunion with Charlotte, it was time. He begins reading the letter his grandmother sent him. It is the story of a woman from the Stalinist period who was accused of anti-communist propaganda and placed in a women's camp. In the camp, the woman is raped and gives birth to a boy. However, when the child is very young she is crushed by a tractor and dies in a hospital where Charlotte received permission to see her. Then, confused, the narrator reads the last sentence. Charlotte wrote that this woman was his mother, Maria Stepanovna Dolina. This woman, the narrator's biological mother, wanted to keep this secret from him for as long as possible. In two days time, the narrator leaves his apartment and all of the items he had bought for Charlotte behind. As he walks through the dusty Paris streets he thinks of another memory to add to his Notes. It is that of him and Charlotte wandering through a forest full of rusting weaponry. In the middle of a clearing grew a grapevine, which caused Charlotte unimaginable joy: it was a reminder of her France. The novel ends with the narrator looking at the picture of his real mother that Charlotte gave him and trying to get used to the idea that she was his mother. His thoughts drift to Charlotte's presence filling the streets of Paris as he searches for the words to tell her story. Critical reception Emer Duff of The Dublin Quarterly International Literary Review said that the novel, \\"reads like an autobiography and one suspects that many of the beautifully drawn characters are perhaps people from Makine's own life.\\"Duff, Emer. Dreams of My Russian Summers by Andrei Makine. The Dublin Quarterly International Literary Review.12 Oct. 2009. Evidence for the author using parts of his own life in the novel is how both he and the narrator published their books. As Victor Brombert said in the New York Times, \\"It is therefore ironic that in order to have his first books published in Paris he had to pretend they were translations from Russian manuscripts. French publishers simply could not believe that a recently arrived emigr√© could write so well in their language.\\"Brombert, Victor. \\"Torn Between Two Languages.\\" New York Times 17 Apr. 1997. The New York Times On the Web: Books. 14 Oct. 2009. It is no coincidence that the same thing happened to the narrator of the story. Notes References * Makine, Andrei.

Print. p. 93 In April 1942 he flew a B-25 on the Royce Mission to the Philippines, a mission that was originally intended to bring relief to US forces on Bataan. General George C. Kenney, the new commander of the Allied air forces in the Southwest Pacific Theater, arrived in Australia in the summer of 1942. He found Gunn converting the A-20s of the 3d Bombardment Group (Light) into strafers by adding four .50-caliber machine guns to the Havocs' noses.http://www.atomagazine.com/extras/Man_Behind_the_Gun.pdf When Gen Kenney learned that Gunn was using weapons from wrecked fighters, he was impressed by Gunn's innovative abilities and immediately made him a member of his personal staff, placing the old naval aviator in charge of special projects. When the A-20s proved highly successful in low-level strikes against Japanese shipping and ground targets, Gen Kenney gave Gunn the go-ahead to convert a squadron of B-25s into similar strafers. Gunn's converted A-20s and B-25s played the major role in the Allied victory in the 1943 Battle of the Bismarck Sea. North American Aviation eventually began to incorporate variations of Gunn's armament innovations into later models of the B-25. These later model aircraft, including the heavily armed B-25G, B-25H, and some Js, with the gun version of the B-25J being equipped with no less than 18 .50-caliber machine guns. These aircraft continued to wreak devastation on Japanese targets in New Guinea, the Philippines, and Okinawa until the end of the war. In addition to the DFC and eventual second award, Gunn was also awarded the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Air Medal, 9 Purple Hearts, and WWII Victory Medal.Gunn, Nathaniel. Pappy Gunn. Bloomington, Indiana: AuthorHouse, 2004. Print. p. 453 After Japan's surrender in World War II, Gunn turned to rebuilding his Philippine Air Lines. The company provided flights across the south Paciific Ocean. Gunn died when his plane crashed in a storm over the Philippines on October 11, 1957. There were no survivors.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1971 to 1986. During his time in provincial office he served in the Executive Council as the Minister of Public Lands and Wildlife from 1975 to 1982. Early life James Edgar Miller was born in Kitscoty, Alberta. He grew up on his family farm and later attended the University of Saskatchewan where he earned a degree in Agriculture. Political career Miller ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1948 Alberta general election in the electoral district of Alexandra. He ran under the Liberal banner while he was still attending the University of Saskatchewan. The election would see him finish in last place in the field of three candidates losing to Anders Aalborg of Social Credit. Miller ran for a second attempt at office in the 1971 Alberta general election. He won the new electoral district of Lloydminster under the Progressive Conservative banner. The race was hotly contested with Miller just barely edging out Campbell Hancock to pick up the district. He ran for a second term in the 1975 Alberta general election. In that election Miller more than doubled his popular vote defeating New Democrat challenger Dave Listoe in a straight fight. He ran for a third term in office this time defeating three other candidates with a landslide margin to hold his seat. After the election Premier Peter Lougheed appointed Miller to the Executive Council of Alberta to serve as the Minister of Minister of Public Lands and Wildlife. He ran for a fourth term in office in the 1982 general election and won the biggest plurality of his career. Miller did not return to cabinet after the 1982 election. After his term was over he retired from provincial politics at the dissolution of the legislature in 1986. Late life After leaving the provincial legislature Miller continued to serve on provincial and federal boards. He later became a council for the Kitscoty town council. He died at the Grey Nuns Hospital in Edmonton at the age of 91 on January 23, 2015.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/edmontonjournal/obituary.aspx?pid=173979561 Bud Miller All Seasons Park a 90-acre (360,000 m2) park in the city of Lloydminster is named in his honor.

Band I. \\"Sachsen-Coburg u. Gotha\\". Verlag des Deutschen Adelsarchivs, Marburg, 2015, pp. 259, 635-636. . Background Hubertus was born at Herrenberg, West Germany, during the Cold War when part of his family's hereditary lands, located in West Germany, were retained by the Coburgs, while other portions were behind the Iron Curtain. His paternal grandfather, the Hereditary Prince Johann Leopold (1906-1972), had been heir- apparent to the sovereign Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, but Johann Leopold's father, Duke Charles Edward, was the last prince of the House of Wettin to reign, abdicating on 14 November 1918 amidst the collapse of the German Empire at the end of World War I. Johann Leopold renounced his claim as the deposed dynasty's heir on 27 February 1932, 15 days prior to his non-dynastic marriage to Baroness Feodora von der Horst (1905-1991). The Headship of the Coburg Wettins would thus pass to Johann Leopold's younger brother, Prince Friedrich Josias, who dynastically married a countess of a mediatized family. Before his death in 1954, Duke Charles Edward re-allocated the family's remaining fortune as an inheritance for their son and heir Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.Be√©che, Arturo E. The Coburgs of Europe. Eurohistory. 2013. pp. 129, 339, 354-355. Divorced from the baroness, Johann Leopold lived with his second wife, Maria Theresia Reindl, in Greinburg Castle, a Coburg property in Grein, Austria. Ernst-Leopold had been born in Hirschberg in Silesia, but Hubertus's parents' marriage and his birth took place in Herrenberg in Wurttemberg. His father's children by his second marriage were born in Regensburg, while Hubertus and his mother lived mostly in Bavaria following his parents' 1963 divorce. Hubertus administers family properties and lives in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. He has five half-siblings: Princess Viktoria, Prince Ernst-Josias, Prince Charles Edward, Prince Ferdinand-Christian and Princess Alice-Sybilla. Marriage On 9 March 1993 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Hubertus married Barbara Weissmann (b. Kaiserslautern, 21 May 1959), daughter of Eugen Weissmann and wife Renate Spettel. They were divorced in the same city 12 September 2012.

Life Maxence, of delicate health, came from a relatively well off family ‚Äî his father was an accountant. On 27 October 1918, he lost his sister, Sarah, who was just 19 years old, to tuberculosis, the disease that would eventually kill him too. His parents' marriage broke up. Marguerite, his mother, became an alcoholic, and his father, Benjamin, lived a life considered dissolute by the standards of the times. In 1927, Maxence fell in love with Th√©r√®ze Denis, a poor working class girl, with whom he lived in Wasquehal, against the wishes of his father, who dreamt of a more prestigious union for his son. In 1929, from this union that was only regularised in 1934, a daughter, Sarah, was born, named in memory of his sister. Th√©r√®ze was the only love of Maxence's life and is the key to an understanding of his work. She was the inspiration for the protagonist of his trilogy La Fille pauvre (The Poor Girl).Maxence Van der Meersch et la vie ouvri√®re dans le Nord de 1914 √† 1939 , p. 7 (in French). A lawyer by training, he in fact practiced this profession very little, preferring to devote himself to writing. His work, replete with a spirit of realism, is essentially concerned with the life of the people of the Nord, his native region.Invasion, by Maxence van der Meersch, The Neglected Books Page, February 26th, 2012 In 1936 he was awarded the Prix Goncourt for L'Empreinte du dieu (Hath Not the Potter). In 1943 he published Corps et √¢mes (Bodies and Souls), which was awarded the grand prix de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise for that year. The novel was an international success ‚Äî it was translated into 13 languages. It centred round the ideas of a celebrated doctor, Dr. Paul Carton (1875-1947), for whom Van der Meersch had a profound admiration.Matthew Ramsey (1999). \\"Alternative Medicine in Modern France\\" , Medical History, 43: 286‚Äì322. Carton is discussed on pages 311‚Äì315. Carton emphasised the importance of cleanliness and good day-to-day living, work environment, nutrition etc.: \\"Le microbe n'est rien. Le terrain est tout.\\" (\\"The germ is nothing. The terrain is everything.\\") The protagonists of the novel are followers of Carton. Van der Meersch came from a family of freethinkers ‚Äî his father was a Nietzschean atheist ‚Äî but he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1936.Maxence Van der Meersch et la vie ouvri√®re, p. 47. He wrote two religious biographies, one of the Cur√© d'Ars and the other of Th√©r√®se of Lisieux. Van der Meersch experienced great success in his lifetime, but today he has a far lower profile. Nevertheless, in 2010 some half a dozen of his books were still in print in France. In 1998 La soci√©t√© des Amis de Van der Meersch was created by a group of his admirers. In 1988 his first novel, La Maison dans la dune (1932), was made into a film by Michel Mees, with Tch√©ky Karyo in the principal role. Criticism Historian Richard Cobb called van der Meersch \\"a regionalist who had written almost exclusively about Roubaix and who had brought honour to the town by winning the Prix Goncourt.\\" In Cobb's opinion, \\"He was, in fact, a clumsy stylist, a Christian-Socialist Zola, who wrote off an accumulated stock of fiches [files].\\"Richard Cobb (Author), Julian Barnes (Preface). Paris and Elsewhere (New York Review Books Classic), 2004, (Fiches meaning dossiers of people taken from real sources). Death He died in Le Touquet in 1951.

A species is regarded as invasive if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a native species), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a pest in the new location, directly threatening agriculture and/or the local biodiversity. The term invasive species refers to a subset of those species defined as introduced species. If a species has been introduced but remains local, and is not problematic to agriculture or to the local biodiversity, then it cannot be considered to be an invasive species and does not belong on this list.

region of West Papua. The film was shot undercover, and includes interviews with human rights victims and political prisoners, as well as footage of separatist guerrillas at their jungle stronghold. Production Brown travelled and filmed in West Papua without the permission of the Indonesian authorities, putting himself in great danger. Brown reflected that on West Papua the situation was \\"like apartheid\\", and likened the transmigration program and anti-secession policies to \\"genocide\\".Daily Telegraph interview https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/8119922/West-Papuan- rebels-struggle-for-freedom.html Content The documentary features an interview conducted with Yusak Pakage, a high-profile West Papuan political prisoner recognised by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience. He is currently serving a ten-year prison sentence for raising the West Papuan flag during a ceremony in 2004. The interview was recorded in secret by Brown during a hospital visit where Pakage was receiving treatment for torture. There is also footage from an TPN camp led by one of the armed resistance leaders, General Goliath Tabuni. In addition, the documentary provides viewers with an insight into recent developments on the international arena towards West Papuan self-determination, including the launch of the International Parliamentarians for West Papua.

Its Governor, Lieutenant Colonel John Baylor, later gathered soldiers in his own regiments to form an Arizona Ranger Company, one of three planned. Only one, Company A, Arizona Rangers was formed before the Confederacy lost control of the territory in 1862. All these units were then formed into Herbert's Battalion of Arizona Cavalry. They went on to fight together in this unit until May 1863 when the Arizona Battalion had been reduced by losses and it was broken up.

It is native to Europe and western Asia, where it grows in upland meadows, grasslands, road verges and open woodland.Altervista Flora Italiana, Cardo con foglie variabili, Melancholy Thistle, Cirsium heterophyllum (L.) Hill includes photos and European distribution map Description Cirsium heterophyllum (Illustration) Cirsium heterophyllum is a perennial herb. Unusually for a thistle, it lacks spines. The plant grows 45 to 120 cm tall, and forms creeping runners. The stem is grooved but unwinged, more-or-less branchless, and cottony. The leaves are green and hairless above, thick white-felted underneath. The basal leaves are lanceolate with petioles and softly prickly edges, and grow from 20 to 40 cm long, and from 4 to 8 cm wide. The upper leaves do not have petioles, clasping the stem with cordate (heart-shaped) bases. The flower heads are 3 to 5 cm long and wide, the flowers red-purple, and appear from July to August. Distribution Cirsium heterophyllum is a species of northern Europe and Central Asia. It is native in upland areas of Scotland and northern England and north Wales, but is rare in other parts of Great Britain and Ireland. It is present throughout Scandinavia, in north central Europe and Russia to about 100 degrees East and in the high mountains of southern Europe. It grows in upland grassland and scrub, open woodland and river valleys. Similar species Cirsium dissectum (meadow thistle) is a more slender species. Medical use The plant was considered a possible cure for sadness. Nicholas Culpepper in 1669 said that it \\"makes a man as merry as a cricket\\".Wildflowers of the British Isles References heterophyllum Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of Asia Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Cirsium heterophyllum"},{"id":"24694977","text":"Salem Abdullah Awadh Saeed (born 1 January 1984) is a Yemeni international footballer who plays for Al-Ahli Club Sana'a as a goalkeeper.

A species is regarded as invasive if it has become introduced to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a native species) and becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location. An invasive species will be one that thrives in its new environment and negatively influences the ecology and biodiversity of that ecosystem. Negative effects can affect also humans, by compromising human health (e.g. vectors of diseases) or socioeconomic systems (e.g. damages to agriculture or forestry). The term invasive species refers to a subset of those species defined as introduced species. If a species has been introduced but remains local, and is not problematic to human systems or to the local biodiversity, then it cannot be considered to be invasive, and does not belong on this list.

A species is regarded as invasive if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a native species), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a pest in the new location, directly threatening human industry, such as agriculture, or the local biodiversity. The term invasive species refers to a subset of those species defined as introduced species. If a species has been introduced, but remains local, and is not problematic for human industry or the local biodiversity, then it is not considered invasive, and does not belong on this list.

The church originally belonged to the Convent of Santo Ni√±o Perdido which was founded in 1573. This would then become a Conceptionist convent in the 17th century, when the church and convent were rebuilt in 1667. It also gained its current name at that time. Due to the Reform Laws in 1861, the nuns were required to vacate the convent portion and the cloister and other buildings associated with the church were demolished. Its main altar was nearly destroyed during the political struggles of the 19th century but the oil of the Black Virgin of Valvanera (or Balvanera) remains. This church was declared a historic monument on August 30, 1932.[Cat√°logo nacional de monumentos hist√≥ricos inmuebles Centro Hist√≥rico (Per√≠metro A) Tomo III, D.F. M√©xico: Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia. 1992. p. 1400.] Nowadays this church is the Cathedral of the Maronite Catholic Eparchy of Our Lady of the Martyrs of Lebanon in Mexico. The church is of Baroque style with its main entrance at the side of the church, as was common with convents in Mexico. The bell tower is covered in tile from Puebla. Only this church and the church of La Encarnaci√≥n have Puebla tile on the bell towers. The church facade is of tezontle divided by five buttresses and topped by an entablature with a frieze with anagrams of the names of Jesus and Mary. Both portals have two levels of decoration on them. Inside, the main altar is Neoclassical and made of stone. The oil of Nuestra Se√±ora de Balvanera is from the 17th century. It and the sculptures here were donated by a Maronite church. The sacristy has paintings by Carlos Clemente Lopez that date from 1750.

It would have required newspapers to print \\"clarifications\\" of stories that a committee of Social Credit legislators deemed inaccurate, and to reveal their sources on demand. The act was a result of the stormy relationship between Aberhart and the press, dating to before the 1935 election, in which the Social Credit League was elected to government. Virtually all of Alberta's newspapers‚Äîespecially the Calgary Herald‚Äîwere critical of Social Credit, as were a number of publications from elsewhere in Canada. Even the American media had greeted Aberhart's election with derision. Though the act won easy passage through the Social Credit- dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen reserved royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's Reference re Alberta Statutes, the court found that it was unconstitutional, and it never became law. Aberhart and the press Before the 1935 election William Aberhart's Social Credit League, running candidates for the first time, won a large majority in the 1935 Alberta election on the strength of promises to use a new economic theory called social credit to end depression conditions in the province. It did so against the almost uniform opposition of the news media. Some of the province's major newspapers were loyal to one of the traditional parties: the Edmonton Bulletin, for example, had supported the Liberals since its inception.Barr 33 Aberhart initially laid out his economic agenda in only vague terms, and by early 1935 his opponents, including Premier Richard Gavin Reid of the United Farmers of Alberta, were trying to force him to commit to a specific plan. The Calgary Herald took up this call, going so far as to offer Aberhart a full page to lay out his approach in detail. Aberhart refused, on the grounds that he considered the Herald's coverage of him to be unfair.Elliott 172 He frequently attacked the newspaper in speeches around the province,Elliott 174 and on April 28 suggested that his followers boycott it and other unfriendly newspapers. The boycott was successful to the extent that it drove at least one newspaper out of business.Elliott 182 The Herald responded to the boycott by asking \\"Is everyone opposed to the political opinions and plans of Mr. Aberhart to be boycotted? He has invoked a most dangerous precedent and has given the people of this province a foretaste of the Hitlerism which will prevail if he ever secures control of the provincial administration.\\" Shortly before the election, the Herald began to run cartoons by Stewart Cameron, a virulently anti-Aberhart cartoonist. The day before the election, it ran one featuring a car, labelled \\"the people\\", travelling along \\"Aberhart Highway No. 1\\" and arriving at a railway crossing. A train, labelled \\"common sense\\", was approaching from around the bend, along tracks labelled \\"fundamental facts\\". Aberhart leans out the \\"S.C. Signal Tower\\" advising the car \\"All's clear. Don't stop, look or listen.\\"Elliott 197 Though the Herald was the most strident in its opposition to Aberhart and Social Credit, the Bulletin, the Edmonton Journal, the Medicine Hat News, the Lethbridge Herald, and many smaller papers all, in the words of Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel, \\"attacked Social Credit viciously as a chimera which, if placed in power, would wreck Alberta's chances for economic recovery.\\"Finkel 36 Of the province's major papers, only the Calgary Albertan provided even lukewarm support.Byrne 101 So frustrated were the Social Crediters with the newspapers' hostility that in 1934 they founded their own, the Alberta Social Credit Chronicle, to spread their views.Elliott 147‚Äì148 The Chronicle, in addition to acting as Aberhart's mouthpiece, carried guest editorials by such figures as British fascist leader Oswald Mosley and anti-semitic priest Charles Coughlin.Brennan 23 Post-election Media reaction to Social Credit's 1935 victory, in which it won 56 of 63 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, was almost uniformly negative. The Herald opined that \\"the people of Alberta have made a most unfortunate decision and may soon see the folly of it.\\"Brennan 24‚Äì25 Even the Albertan expressed its wish that social credit be first tried in \\"Scotland, or Ethiopia or anywhere but Alberta.\\"Elliott 203 Reaction across Canada was also negative; the St. Catharines Standard called the results \\"a nightmare that passeth all understanding\\" and the Montreal Star accused Albertans of voting for \\"an untried man and a policy whose workings he ostentatiously refused to explain before polling day.\\"Elliott 202 American newspapers were less restrained: the Chicago Tribune asked \\"Greetings to the Canadians. Who's loony now?\\" and the Boston Herald's headline screamed \\"Alberta goes crazy\\". The relationship did not improve once Aberhart took office. In January 1935, H. Napier Moore wrote two articles for Maclean's casting doubt on Aberhart's honesty and his ability to follow through on his election promises. The American Collier's Weekly ran a profile that mocked Aberhart's appearance, taking note of his \\"vast colorless face\\" and his \\"narrow, left slanted mouth with soft, extra-heavy, bloodless lips which don't quite meet and through which he breathes wetly.\\"Elliott 230‚Äì231 Finkel, finding fault with both sides of the Aberhart-press feud, states > The major newspapers of the province opposed virtually everything the > government did.

He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales.Elliott 232 The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests.Elliott 247 Even so, the Albertan became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation. Aberhart reacted bitterly to the media's hostility. In a September 20, 1937, radio broadcast, he said of the press \\"these creatures with mental hydrophobia will be taken in hand and their biting and barking will cease.\\"Barr 108 Four days later, a special session of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta opened, with the Accurate News and Information Act figuring prominently on its order paper.Barr 108‚Äì109 The bill would be introduced October 1, 1937 by Solon Earl Low and three days later would be passed by the legislature on October 4, 1937, during a marathon session which lasted until 12:30 the next morning. Statute reservation The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt had forced Aberhart to abdicate a portion of his power to the newly created Social Credit Board, which consisted of five Social Credit backbenchers charged with supervising a commission of experts. While the initial plan was to have this commission headed by C. H. Douglas, social credit's British founder, Douglas did not like Aberhart and did not view his approach to social credit as consistent with its true form. He refused to come. Instead, he sent two subordinates, L. D. Byrne and G. F. Powell. These surrogates were charged with recommending legislation to implement social credit in Alberta. Their first round of proposals, which included measures imposing government control on banks and prohibiting any person from challenging the constitutionality of any Alberta law in court without receiving the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, was disallowed by the federal government. The second round included the Accurate News and Information Act.Elliott 272‚Äì273 The act empowered the chair of the Social Credit Board to require a newspaper to reveal the names and addresses of its sources, as well as the names and addresses of any writers, including of unsigned pieces. Non-compliance would result in fines of up to $1,000 per day, and prohibitions on the publishing of the offending newspaper, of stories by offending writers, or of information emanating from offending sources. The act also required newspapers to print, at the instruction of the chair of the Social Credit Board, any statement \\"which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the Government of the Province.\\"Elliott 272 The act was attacked by opposition politicians as evidence of the government's supposed fascism, and alienated even the Albertan.Elliott 273 The international press was also cutting: one British paper referred to Aberhart as \\"a little Hitler\\".Barr 109 Later commentators have been no more favourable: Finkel calls the act evidence of the \\"increasingly authoritarian nature of the Aberhart regime\\", and even Barr, generally sympathetic to Social Credit, calls it \\"a harsh blow to free speech\\". Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, mindful of the federal government's disallowance of the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, reserved royal assent of the act and its companions until their legality could be tested at the Supreme Court of Canada. This was the first use of the power of reservation in Alberta history, and in the summer of 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's official residence, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and Ernest Manning biographer Brian Brennan attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.Elliott 278Brennan 54 Aftermath Bowen put a stop to the Accurate News and Information Act, at least temporarily, but Aberhart's fight against the press continued: on March 25, 1938, a resolution of the Social Credit-dominated legislature ordered that Don Brown, a reporter for the Edmonton Journal, be jailed \\"during the pleasure of the assembly\\" for allegedly misquoting Social Credit backbencher John Lyle Robinson on the inclusion of chiropractors in the Workman's Compensation Act. Brown was never actually jailed; the next day, in response to negative publicity from across Canada, the legislature passed another resolution, ordering \\"the release of Mr. Don C. Brown from custody.\\" In Barr's view, \\"the government was made to look less ominous than silly.\\"Barr 112‚Äì113 Around the same time, the Supreme Court ruled on the Reference re Alberta Statutes. It found that the Accurate News and Information Act, along with the others submitted to it for evaluation, was ultra vires (beyond the powers of) the Alberta government.Barr 112 In the case of the Accurate News and Information Act, the court found that the Canadian constitution included an \\"implied bill of rights\\" that protected freedom of speech as being critical to a parliamentary democracy.Morton 481‚Äì482 For its leadership in the fight against the act, the Pulitzer Prize committee awarded the Edmonton Journal a bronze plaque, the first time it honoured a non-American newspaper.Byrne 125 Ninety- five other newspapers, including the Calgary Albertan, Edmonton Bulletin, Calgary Herald, Lethbridge Herald, and Medicine Hat News, were presented with engraved certificates.

As a result, levoglucosan is often used as a chemical tracer for biomass burning in atmospheric chemistry studies, particularly with respect to airborne particulate matter. Along with other tracers such as potassium, oxalate, and gaseous acetonitrile, levoglucosan has been shown to be highly correlated with regional fires. This is because the gas emitted by the pyrolysis of wood (biomass) contains significant amounts of levoglucosan. Levoglucosan has been described as \\"an unequivocal biomass burning tracer\\" in the context of forest and brush fires. But the anhydrosugar has only been found detectable in low temperature samples (150-350 ¬∞C), meaning that its value as an indicator for smoke from controlled biomass combustion in, for instance, modern domestic wood stoves which operate at temperatures above 500 ¬∞C, is \\"very doubtful\\". Levoglucosan is a marker for coal combustion as well as wood. The hydrolysis of levoglucosan generates the fermentable sugar glucose. Levoglucosan can be utilized in the synthesis of chiral polymers such as unhydrolysable glucose polymers.

Rainey's housemate, Judd Winick, who is Jewish, was also offended at Rainey's wearing of a T-shirt that depicted four guns arranged in the shape of a swastika, and his refusal to accede to Winick's request not to wear the shirt (though this confrontation was only revealed in The Real World Diaries, a book published by MTV, and depicted in the 2009 film Pedro, not the series itself).The Real World Diaries. Page 137. One of Rainey's closest relationships in the house was with Rachel Campos. Although their relationship became romantic when they kissed on three occasions, it eventually dissolved when, during a heated argument, he revealed this to the other housemates, despite having promised her he would not. Although the others were not surprised at this revelation, Campos saw this as a betrayal of trust. Rainey's most contentious relationship was with Zamora. Rainey denigrated Zamora's career as an AIDS educator and mocked his Cuban accent. Winick described Rainey as \\"obnoxious and homophobic.\\" Zamora, who had AIDS himself, distanced himself from Rainey, and thereby from the other housemates, fearing the stress of his relationship with Rainey was affecting his health.Winick; 2000. p. 114. When Zamora threatened to move out, the other housemates voted to evict Rainey instead. Rainey later appeared in subsequent episodes in which he encountered former housemates Cory Murphy, Campos, and Winick, but their meetings typically ended in conflict. In the season finale, he phoned Campos just before she left the house and accused his ex-roommates of harboring ill feelings towards him, calling them \\"judases'\\". During The Real World Reunion in 1995, which assembled the casts of the first four seasons of The Real World, Rainey resumed his conflict with his former housemates, including Bilal and Winick, as well as cast members from other seasons. Following Winick's encouragement to the audience to get involved in fighting the AIDS epidemic, and his statement that Zamora's recent death made his decision to attend the reunion difficult, Rainey claimed that he too used his time to help AIDS patients. Winick countered by stating that Rainey had reacted to Zamora's death with the remark \\"Good riddance\\". Rainey denied this, and cast various aspersions on Winick and cast members present before temporarily leaving the taping.The Real World Reunion 1995. MTV.

A pill organiser, pill container, dosette box, pillcase or pillbox is a multicompartment compliance aid for storing scheduled doses of medications. Pill organisers usually have square-shaped compartments for each day of the week, although other more compact and discreet versions have come to market, including cylindrical and pen-shaped cases. Some organisers have multiple sections, corresponding with different times of the day. Pill organisers are viewed as a way to prevent or reduce medication errors on the part of the patient, though evidence of effectiveness is not strong, and they have been linked to medication errors. Usage Pill organisers are useful for all types of patients, including the elderly, those who have memory deficiencies, and those taking multiple medications, as an aid in remembering to take proper doses of their medications thereby complying with their doctor's recommended dose. See (compliance (medicine)). They allow a patient to know whether or not they have taken a particular dose of their medication; if a pill still remains in its compartment, it is apparent that it has not yet been taken, whereas if it is missing, it has already been taken. Pill organisers often have various features to make them easier for special- needs patients to use, such as color-coding, Braille for the blind, or a locking mechanism to prevent double dosing. Some organisers used for diabetes patients have sections for insulin and hypodermic syringes. Some pharmacists will pre-load pills into pill organisers for their patients, as a convenient service. Electronic pill organisers Electronic pill organisers, pill dispensers, and pill reminders have been developed that alert patients when their prescription medication, OTC medication, or daily food supplements must be taken. These devices have been credited with saving lives and saving money in the health care system. Advanced models can be linked via the Internet to a medical facility, to aid in monitoring and reminding a patient to take his/her medications. Legality In some jurisdictions in the United States possession of prescription drugs in a pill organiser is a crime, and people have been prosecuted for it. The legal theory is that since the drug is not in the package it was dispensed in by the pharmacy, and since it is not \\"in use\\" (e.g., swallowed), it is unlawfully possessed. The affirmative defence, that the possessor has a valid prescription for the drug in question, is not always accepted by the court.

This route was previously served by the Baltimore & Ohio's (B&O;) train of the same name, and was the first of several services in the state of West Virginia established at the behest of US Representative Harley Orrin Staggers (D-West Virginia), the powerful chair of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. This patronage earned the train the derisive sobriquets \\"Harley's Hornet\\" and the \\"Staggers Special\\".  History   West Virginian  On its startup on May 1, 1971, Amtrak did not retain any of the three B&O; intercity trains then operating west of Cumberland, Maryland. Commuter services between Washington, D.C. and Martinsburg, West Virginia continued unaffected. The situation displeased Staggers, through whose district the B&O; route ran. Responding to pressure from Staggers, Amtrak introduced the West Virginian on September 8, 1971, between Washington and Parkersburg, West Virginia. It was Amtrak's first train on the B&O.; The train operated with ex-Chesapeake and Ohio Railway equipment: a 52-seat coach and a snack-bar coach.  Potomac Turbo  The UAC TurboTrain, seen here at Transpo '72, spent three months on the West Virginian route under the Potomac Turbo name. On February 7, 1972, Amtrak transferred one of its two UAC TurboTrain trainsets, then on the Turboservice between New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, to the Parkersburg run. Amtrak characterized this as an experiment to see how well the TurboTrain could run on a mountainous route and whether new equipment could reinvigorate ridership on a poor-performing route. Amtrak dubbed the re-equipped train the Potomac Turbo. Critics questioned the wisdom of running the train in a region where mountains and curves limited the train to a top speed of . Staggers was widely suspected of pressuring Amtrak to introduce the service; he denied that he had brought any pressure on Amtrak, although fellow representative Dan Kuykendall acknowledged suggesting to Amtrak officials that they \\"fix up West Virginia.\\" Amtrak withdrew the equipment on May 13 to replace the other TurboTrain on the New York‚ÄìBoston run. That train had, in turn, been sent to Washington for the Transpo '72 exposition.  Potomac Special  With the withdrawal of the TurboTrain conventional equipment returned to the Washington‚ÄìParkersburg run. Amtrak named this train the Potomac Special. Amtrak discontinued this train on May 5, 1973. In its place Amtrak introduced the Blue Ridge, which terminated at Martinsburg, West Virginia. A later train, the Shenandoah, operated through Parkersburg to Cincinnati, Ohio. This train was introduced in 1976 and withdrawn in 1981. The Blue Ridge was transferred to MARC and continues presently as the Brunswick Line. Amtrak's Capitol Limited, a Chicago- Washington service begun in 1981, operates over the Washington-Cumberland, Maryland portion of the line.

The community was a mining town, formed in 1860 following the discovery of gold in the nearby Pinos Altos Mountains. The town site is located about five to ten miles north of the present day Silver City, New Mexico. Although once abandoned, the town is now a place for summer homes and caters to tourists. Its population was 198 as of the 2010 census. Originally named Birchville, after prospector and former outlaw, Robert H. Birch, one of three people who found the first gold, it later took the Spanish name Pinos Altos, meaning tall pines, because there were tall trees growing in the area. These were cut down as the town grew to a population of about 9,000 during the 1880s and 1890s before slowly being abandoned during the early 1900s. Today, many of the original buildings remain.Pinos Altos or Birchville, Retrieved from Ghosttowns.com on 14 January 2011. From the discovery of gold in 1860 until late 1861, miners were harassed by Apache Indians opposed to American and Mexican settlers occupying their lands. On September 27, 1861, it was the site of the Battle of Pinos Altos between the Arizona Guards of Pinos Altos, a Confederate Arizona Territorial militia company, and Apache warriors led by Mangas Coloradas and Cochise. This battle did not end the conflict between settlers and Native Americans, which continued for several years, with neither side particularly willing to see the dispute resolved peacefully. Even when a treaty was eventually negotiated between the settlers and Indians, a settler hosting a dinner to celebrate the signing opened fire on 60 unarmed Indians, killing and injuring many of those assembled. Indian hostility continued until the military built permanent forts in the area, most significant of which was Fort Bayard, established a few miles to the southeast in 1866. Senator George Hearst invested in several Pinos Altos mines, including the Mina Grande and the Pacific Mine. He built a stamp mill in Pinos Altos in 1889, and incorporated the Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon Railroad to connect these properties to his Silver City smelter.

It was created in 1981 by Yo Sakakibara, who had been researching language acquisition for over 30 years prior to his death. The Hippo Family Club is a transnational network of community-based language clubs in which both children and adults engage in various activities with the purpose of acquiring multiple languages simultaneously. Yo Sakakibara has since expanded the organization to the US, Korea, Japan and Mexico. In the United States, the organization is known as LEX America and the language clubs as LEX Language Project. Concept The activities carried out at Hippo Family Club meetings are based on language acquisition research projects and studies and supported by language researchers such as Suzanne Flynn, Kuniyoshi Sakai and Noam Chomski. The underlying concept is that anyone, at any age, can acquire new languages, given a conducive setting for language acquisition. Though languages are superficially different, some linguists argue for an underlying universality among all human languages, and this is demonstrated in the speed with which an already multilingual person acquires a new language. According to Hippo materials and methodology, the way most people usually attempt to learn a language ‚Äî in a traditional classroom ‚Äî does not provide a conducive setting for language acquisition. When infants acquire their native language, they don't do it by breaking the language down into little pieces of grammar and vocabulary, or by looking in a dictionary, so this is seen as the most unnatural way to learn a language. It is believed that children acquiring their language learn by listening to and mimicking the broadest and most basic outline of the language. Any infant with the physical capability can acquire the language spoken around them by the age of two or three. As they advance, they begin to speak in phrases, but may only pronounce the sounds at the beginning and end of a phrase while humming through the rest. Eventually, they become more precise in their sounds and phrases, until they become a mature speaker. Even as adult native speakers they are always making new language discoveries. Adults who are exposed to new languages in a similar way will go through the same natural process. Children learn by listening, mimicking and making human interactions with other speakers of the language. Therefore, Hippo works by trying to create a natural, relaxed learning environment in which children and adults are exposed to, and interact with the sounds of other languages. One of the advantages of learning this way would be to break with serial monolingualism, a condition in which multilingualism doesn't happen on a thorough and smooth manner throughout the speaker's routine. Hippo Methodology and Learning Environment Hippo has its work and activities based on certain group practices and its audio materials. Usually these are referred to as \\"Audio Tapes\\", which can be the ones used in metakatsu (the act of repeating sounds and words) or the SADA's (acronym for Sing Along, Dance Along). The clubs follow a very flexible structure, although there is routine and tradition involving certain practices (such as the zai jian \\"goodbye\\" song). It consists on regular members who pay a relatively small subscription fee and \\"fellows\\", individuals who run each club. On an extensive thesis written after experiencing both Hippo Japan and LEX America, sociocultural linguist Chad Nilep noted that a feeling of identification with a cosmopolitan identity exists among members, and this occurs possibly through fractal recursivity.  Metakatsu  As noted by Chad Nilep (2009), the metakatsu (a combination of the Greek prefix meta-, meaning among, after; and the Japanese katsudou, meaning activity) is one of Hippo's core activities. It consists on the mimicking and babbling of sounds in any given language. Initially, it is very similar to a baby's process of language acquisition ‚Äî one is not required to pronounce the words with perfection, only to repeat what was heard as best as one can. This differs greatly to the traditional approach of non-native language learning  SADA's  The SADA's are usually folklore music from around the world, to which some choreography/dance either already exist or is created by club members. The aim of the activity is mainly to establish a playful and friendly setting. Some members note it draws near to psychomotricity, although scientific analysis was not yet established. Activities In addition to listening to recordings of speeches, conversations and songs in different languages, Hippo Family Club members get together in community-based clubs at least once a week for interactive activities. Members that feel confident recite what they feel they can from the recordings, even if the sounds are not accurate, and even if they don't exactly know what they are saying; the first step is to get a feel for the sounds, rhythm and melody of the languages. Members play games, sing songs, dance, and speak with each other in the various languages they are learning. Through interaction with friends and family of all ages that participate, members absorb both new sounds and important context. The aim of HIPPO activities is not necessarily to \\"master\\" the languages, but to enjoy what Hippo founders call the \\"process of self-discovery,\\" as members make new friends, strengthen family ties, and create new international connections through language. Hippo members can attend other Hippo Clubs, including clubs established internationally. They are encouraged to widen their horizons through participation with Hippo club members in other countries. In this way they create opportunities to make friends with speakers of other native languages, and thus come in contact with many languages. Currently, there are Hippo activities in French, Mandarin, German, Korean, Spanish, Japanese, English, Italian, Russian, Thai, Malaysian, Portuguese, Indonesian, Cantonese, Arabic, Hindi, Swedish, Vietnamese, Swahili, Turkish, and Taiwanese. Hippo Family Club establishments can choose to focus on a few, or all of these languages. Homestay programs Hippo members can choose to participate in homestay programs, in which they visit a Hippo Family Club, or other non- profit or community group in another country. Participating countries include the United States, Mexico, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Tunisia, Russia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and India. In Korea, Japan and Mexico, the homestay is completely overseen by Hippo, and in the United States it is co-developed with 4-H Youth. There are currently 5 types of homestay programs available: the Summer Program (USA, Thailand, Japan or China) the Spring Program (Japan), the Winter Program (Japan or Russian), the World Internship Program and the Yearlong High School Program.  World Internship Program (WIP)  The World Internship Program allows for people all over the world to be an intern at Hippo in Mexico, Japan or Korea. It reaches out with the support of volunteering organizations such as AIESEC, or Hippo's own institutional propaganda.  Yearlong High School Program  Through the Yearlong High School program, young students can experience High School in most of the countries Hippo has interchange relations with. Transnational College of LEX The Transnational College of LEX (TCL) is a private non-profit education institute focusing on the development of learning using immersion techniques which broadly follow the way in which babies learn multiple languages in a muli-linguistic environment. The TCL has published many books, most notably a series of three books on Natural Science: Who is Fourier? A Mathematical Adventure, What is Quantum Mechanics? A Physics Adventure, and What is DNA? A Biology Adventure. The nature of the books is such that they allow accessible introductions to traditionally difficult subjects. Nobel Prize-winning Physicist, Professor Yoichiro Nambu served as senior adviser for the second book in the series \\"What is Quantum Mechanics?

He was the son of Private Account, who in turn was the son of the great Damascus. Bred in Kentucky by Stuart Janney, Jr., he finished racing with a record of 13-0-0 in 17 starts with career earnings of $1,243,947. Private Terms was best known for his wins in the grade one Wood Memorial Stakes and the grade two General George Handicap.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;.  Three-year-old season  At age three, Private Terms began to show great promise as he won one race after another. In his fifth start, he won the grade two Gotham Stakes at 1 1/16 miles at Aqueduct Racetrack, beating Seeking the Gold and Perfect Spy under jockey Chris Antley. Then he won the $500,000 grade one Wood Memorial Stakes, where he defeated Seeking the Gold again and began a heated rivalry with his foe that lasted two years. He went into the gate in the 1988 Kentucky Derby unbeaten in seven starts and the second favorite in the race behind Winning Colors. Private Terms finished ninth behind Winning Colors, Forty Niner and Risen Star, beaten just under six lengths. He returned in the $500,000 grade one Preakness Stakes as a 3-1 third choice in a field of ten graded stakes winners. In the \\"Run for the Black-Eyed Susan,\\" he stalked the pace and moved from seventh to fourth at the top of the stretch. Lacking a strong close, Private Terms finished fourth, four lengths behind Risen Star, Brian's Time and Winning Colors. He did not contest the Belmont, which Risen Star won, but won the listed Governor‚Äôs Handicap at Pimlico Race Course. He then ran fourth behind Forty Niner and Seeking the Gold in the grade one Haskell Invitational Handicap. Later that year, it looked like Private Term might be a threat in the grade one Super Derby when after he won the preparatory Prelude Stakes, but he ran fourth behind Seeking the Gold, Happyasalark Tomas and Lively One. That event marked the end of his sophomore year as finished with a record of 9-0-0 in 13 starts. Reines-de-Course  Four-year-old season  Private Terms ran successfully at age four, winning three of four starts. One of those wins was the grade two Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs. His other two wins came in listed stakes: the Damascus Handicap at Laurel Park Racecourse named after his grandsire and set a new track record the Never Bend Handicap for nine furlongs at Pimlico, 1:47.10. The almost black colt retired with 13 wins in 17 starts and earnings of $1,243,947. He was only off the board two times in his career (Kentucky Derby and 4 year-old debut).  Retirement  Private Terms produced 16 crops containing a total of 623 foals for an average of 39 foals per year. Of those crops, he had 75% starters, 54% winners and 14% stakes winners. He has also sired 3% graded stakes placed horses. Soul of the Matter and Afternoon Deelites were his two best runners. Soul of the Matter avenged his sire‚Äôs loss in the Super Derby of 1994 and won or placed in eight other graded races, including a second in the Dubai World Cup. He was exported to Japan where he did not do well at stud, and then went California. Afternoon Deelites is now at stud in Louisiana. He previously stood at Airdrie Stud in the Bluegrass State. He has sired 4% stakes winners and has consistently led the sire list in his new home state. La Reine‚Äôs Terms has done most of his racing in Maryland-bred events, where he has won 16 of 40 starts and $804,591. Private Lap, out of the Dynaformer mare Just Like Jill, has won almost $700,000 and is a listed stakes winner.

Carrying out complete C4 photosynthesis within individual cells, these plants instead are known as single‚Äêcell C4 system or SCC4 plants. This makes them distinct from typical C4 plants, which require the collaboration of 2 types of photosynthetic cells. SCC4 plants have features that make them potentially valuable in engineering higher photosynthetic efficiencies in agriculturally important C3 carbon fixation species such as rice. To address this the 467 Mb genome of S. aralocaspica has been sequenced to help understanding of the evolution of SCC4 photosynthesis and contribute to the engineering of C4 photosynthesis into other economically important crops. It is monoecious, annual and grows to a height of between 20 cm and 50 cm. It flowers in August, producing seeds of two different sizes that differ in their morphology, dormancy and germination characteristics.

Friends of the Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge The Friends of the Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge (FARNWR) is a non-profit organization formed in 2000, nearly a full year prior to the transfer of the annex to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Since that time, the Friends Group has provided the refuge invaluable assistance in preparing to open the refuge for wildlife-dependent recreational activities by removing physical safety hazards; conducting biological surveys of vernal pools, raptors, bats, invasive plant species; and conducting numerous public outreach and education programs. History One of the former World War II bunkers on refuge land The land on which the wildlife refuge sits was originally occupied by Native Americans and then became farmland for early colonists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. During the Revolutionary War, ammunition wagons traveled along Old Marlborough Road (part of which is now a path in the refuge) from Concord to Marlborough to provide George Washington arms for his defense of Trenton. In 1851 transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, who lived in Concord, wrote about his walk along the Assabet River in what is now the refuge in Maynard in his famous journal,Thoreau's walk to Boon's Pond (pages 452-462) and he wrote a poem entitled \\"Old Marlborough Road\\" about the road which ran from Concord to Marlborough, parts of which are in the ARNWR and now known as Winterberry Way and Powerline Trail.Thoreau's \\"The Old Marlborough Road\\" Origins of the refuge date back to the 1942 World War II-era seizure of land spanning Maynard, Sudbury, Hudson, and Stow by federal eminent domain as the Fort Devens-Sudbury Training Annex. Landowners were given about ten days to pack up and leave, and by their own accounts received around ten cents on the dollar of what the land was actually worth. One of the most interesting features of the refuge is the World War II-era ammunition bunkers. The site was chosen as it had convenient railroad shipping to the Boston Navy Yard, yet was far enough inland that a German battleship could not shell the area. Each of the 50 bunkers, officially referred to as \\"igloos\\", has inside dimensions of by by , and a curved roof. Sides and roofs were mounded with dirt for extra protection and camouflage from aerial view. Bunker #303 is sometimes open for tours. After World War II the site served as a troop training ground, ordnance testing, and laboratory disposal area for Natick Labs, otherwise known as the United States Army Soldier Systems Center. A 1980s assessment led to the area's categorization as an EPA Superfund clean-up site in 1990, as it was contaminated with arsenic, pesticides, and other chemicals, which were removed.Mandel, Toby, Fort Devens Sudbury Training Annex Presentation Extensive Army clean-up efforts continued for years, ending with the site being turned over to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in 2000.

It was later covered by Puerto Rican singer Chayanne with production by Ronnie Foster. It was released as the third single from the Grammy nominated studio album Chayanne II (1988) and became the first number-one single for the singer in the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart in late 1989 and the first number-one single by a Puerto Rican musician. Song history The lyrics for \\"Fuiste un Trozo de Hielo en la Escarcha\\" deal with the end of a romantic relationship, and the singer tells the story of a girl who leaves him with a cruel farewell to her departure. As the song progresses he acknowledges the good things about the relationship and his surprise that it is finished. The author of the song, J. M.

The Refuge encompasses in Plymouth, Massachusetts. It is made up of two parcels; the Crooked Pond parcel abuts the Myles Standish State Forest, the second largest State forest in Massachusetts, and the smaller parcel is located on the shoreline of Island Pond. Massasoit National Wildlife Refuge is located within a area designated as critical habitat for the Plymouth Red-bellied Turtle. Wildlife and habitat The Plymouth redbelly turtle subsists primarily on submergent vegetation, and requires good water quality and suitable basking, nesting, and overwintering sites free from disturbance. The turtles spend most of their lives in these freshwater coastal ponds in Plymouth and Carver, coming on land to bask (sun themselves) and breed in sandy soils. In addition to providing habitat for this endangered species, Massasoit NWR also provides habitat to a variety of birds that nest in the uplands and amphibians, reptiles, and fish that utilize the ponds. In addition, a variety of invertebrate species, many of which are rare, are found on nearby Myles Standish State Forest and may be present on the Refuge as well. Crooked Pond is a typical coastal plain pond occupying a depression connected hydrologically to an underground aquifer; hence, the water level of the pond changes with the water table. The water level is usually high in winter and spring, and generally much lower by late summer, exposing the shoreline. Three other ponds, Island, Gunners Exchange and Hoyts, are within of Crooked Pond. The southeastern corner of Gunners Exchange Pond and parcels on Island Pond are part of the Refuge. The upland habitat surrounding ponds on the Refuge is a mix of pitch pine ‚Äî scrub oak and coastal oak/heath forest. Common species include: red maple, pitch pine, white pine, and scrub oak. The under-story consists of highbush blueberry, low sweet blueberry, bearberry and greenbrier. Pitch pine scrub oak communities need fire to maintain the community structure and diversity. The resinous, waxy cutins in the leaves of many of the plant species found in this community are highly flammable and easily ignite during dry periods. Today the area is generally protected from fire, resulting in a closed-canopy pine forest.

Its common names include pink purslane, kiss-me-quick and hairy pigweed. Its range extends from the southern United States and the Caribbean as far south as Brazil. It is a succulent with linear leaves and pink flowers. Description The name is derived from pilose, which means to be covered with long soft hairs. Portulaca pilosa is a highly variable species. It exhibits morphological variability during development with the immature plants having a wider, longer and flatter leaves than its mature counterparts. The mature leaves are narrower, shorter and more hemispheric in cross section. Physical differences may also occur due to the variable habitat that this species can be found in. Plants that grow in an arid environment tend to the greatest density of hairs. Plants that grow in a moister environment tend to have less hairs. Plants with very dense hair under a certain condition will produce growth with fewer hairs under a moist condition, showing its variability of growth. Habit is also governed by its habitat. Plants growing in moist, warm environments tend to branch rather quickly into a spreading habit, with a secondary growth which is erect. Plants in dry and cool environment do the opposite in that they grow erect first and then branch more slowly. This type has a more compact habit. Specimens from Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and New Mexico exhibit all morphologic conditions. Those from Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma usually tend to occur in shallow, sandy soils, often on rocky outcrops, and are often highly branched, compact, short, and not very pilose (hairy).

The trichomes are rather obvious at the nodes and are in inflorescence. The branch size range from 3-25 centimeters. The leaf blades are linear to oblong-lanceolate, which is intermediate of the two. They can also be terete to hemispheric, with a range of size (5-20 x 1‚Äì3 mm). The plant has an acute apex with involucre-like bract of about six to nine. Flowers range from .5 to 1.2 centimeters in diameter. The color of the petals can range from darkish pink to purple. The flower shape is obovate with 3-5 x 1.5-3 millimeters in size. The stamens in size of 5-12 millimeters but can reach up to 37 millimeters. The stigmas can be of the size of between 3-6 millimeters. The capsules are oval with a 1.5 to 4.3 millimeters in diameter. The seeds are black or leaden with a nearly circular shape. The size ranges from .4 to .6 millimeters in diameter. The surface cells are loosely arranged. The number of chromosomes is 16, which is 2n = 8. Uses It has been said that the species of Portulaca pilosa in Brazil has been used as a traditional remedy to cause diuresis, antipyresis and analgesia. Studies have shown that its extracts have renal effects. It has also been seen that in rats, such extracts cause an increase in potassium excretion without a concomitant change in water diuresis or sodium excretion..

It was founded in 1974. Description The Refuge is located in north-central Massachusetts, approximately northwest of Boston, Massachusetts. The Refuge lies within the towns of Ayer and Shirley in Middlesex County and the towns of Harvard and Lancaster in Worcester County. The Refuge consists of approximately of upland, southern New England floodplain forest, and wetland communities along nearly of the Nashua River corridor. Origins Oxbow National Wildlife Refuge was formed by three land transfers from the U.S. Army's Fort Devens military installation, and a recent purchase of private land in Harvard. Two of the transfers from the Army (May 1974 and February 1988) formed the original portion of the Refuge located south of Massachusetts Route 2. The third Army transfer occurred in May 1999, and added the portion of the Refuge that is located north of Route 2. Finally, approximately were added to the Refuge in April, 2001, with the acquisition of the former Watt Farm property along Still River Depot Road in Harvard. Wildlife and habitat The primary purpose for which the Refuge was created is its \\"...particular value in carrying out the national migratory bird management program.\\" The Refuge's interspersion of wetland, forested upland and old field habitats is ideally suited for this purpose. The Refuge supports a diverse mix of migratory birds including waterfowl, wading birds, raptors, shorebirds, passerines, as well as resident mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates. The extensive and regionally significant wetlands occurring on and adjacent to the Oxbow Refuge, including their associated tributary drainages and headwaters, have been listed as a priority for protection under both the North American Waterfowl Management Plan and the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986. The portion of the Oxbow NWR south of Route 2 lies within the 12,900-acre Central Nashua River Valley Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) designated by the Massachusetts Secretary of Environmental Affairs, and the portions of the Refuge north of Route 2 are included in the Squannassit ACEC due to the unique environmental characteristics and values of these wildlife habitats. Friends group The Refuge has an active friends group, The Friends of the Oxbow National Wildlife Refuge, which helps notify people about U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service activities in the Refuge, and also sponsors its own activities in and around the Refuge.

The uprising, also called the Kasuke Uprising (the leader of the peasant uprising was Tada Kasuke), is portrayed by the museum to be a struggle for the right to life. Thus the founders of the memorial museum erected two plaques at the front entrance of the building. The one on the left is inscribed with the 11th and 12th articles of the Constitution of Japan. The one on the right is inscribed with the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those inscribed articles clearly state the fundamental rights global citizens are entitled to: Exactly the cause which the leaders of the uprising had given their lives for.Tada Kasuke and his followers decided to appeal to the magistrate's office in Matsumoto even though they knew that they were risking their lives. Goals After the 300th anniversary of the J≈çky≈ç Uprising, the local people decided to build a memorial museum to commemorate the uprising, and to preserve historic archives of the uprising. To that end they selected a building site of the museum right across the street from J≈çky≈ç Gimin-sha (J≈çky≈ç Gimin shrine), a Shinto shrine dedicated to twenty-eight executed farmers and the Mizuno clan (who were the local daimy≈çs at the time of the uprising), and the former Tada family homestead (a cultural asset of Nagano Prefecture). It is located in the former village of Nakagaya (in the Matsumoto Domain during the Edo period), where Tada Kasuke was village headman in the late 17th century. Building The memorial museum's building is structured with two wings spread wide apart, which are intended to symbolize the open arms of Kasuke and other farmers who were executed after the uprising. The main hall in the center that connects the two wings has a roof designed to look like a conical hat. Farmers who had taken part in the uprising wore one as part of their uniform. Also, there is an artificial stream in the front garden. The clear water of the stream symbolizes the purity of the Gimin's heart. The water is designed to remind visitors that a part of the reason for the farmers' sufferings of the time came from water shortage. It was before the time of Jikka-segi, the irrigation network this region is famed for. Theater The J≈çky≈ç Gimin Story is presented at the theater, Yume-d≈çj≈ç (dream hall). The story is about the J≈çky≈ç Uprising told by Oshun, the sixteen-year-old daughter of Oana Zembei, Tada Kasuke's assistant. She is said to have worked as a messenger carrying invitations to secret meetings at a local Kumano Shrine and was the only female farmer who was executed after the uprising.It was rare for a girl to be executed for such a crime. The seventeen-minute performance covers the development of the J≈çky≈ç Uprising: From the exorbitant tax rise against the backdrop of crop failure, to the letter of appeal of five articles presented by Tada Kasuke and others, to the deception on the part of the executives of the domain government, and finally to the executions of twenty-eight farmers, Tada Kasuke among them. Exhibition Items and records concerning the uprising are displayed. Highlights include: *The letter of appeal of five articles (prepared by Tada Kasuke and others) *The response document signed by executives of the Matsumoto Domain (turned out to be an evasive tactic) *The copy of Shimpu-t≈çki, the official record of the Matsumoto Domain compiled by the Mizuno clan forty years after the uprising *Tada Kasuke's statue (replica; the original sits in J≈çky≈ç Gimin-sha) *A scale model of Azumino at the time of the uprising featuring spots and areas involved in the incident Gallery File:Plate2.JPG|The 11th and 12th articles of the Constitution of Japan File:Plaque of the UDHR in front of the Joukyou Gimin Memorial Museum.JPG|The first article of the U.D.H.R.

Located along the Atlantic Flyway, the refuge is of vital stopover significance to waterfowl, shorebirds, and songbirds during migratory periods. In 1985, The Trust for Public Land added an additional 12 acres to the refuge. Besides providing habitat for birds and wildlife, this pristine coastal habitat is also enjoyed by visitors who come to swim, hike, surf, fish, and birdwatch. Features and location The refuge includes the mouth of the Parker River, which drains the mainland on the other side of Plum Island Sound. The refuge also includes the southern three-quarters of Plum Island, an long barrier island in Newburyport, Massachusetts, Newbury, Massachusetts, Rowley, Massachusetts and Ipswich, Massachusetts. The southern tip of the island, however, belongs to Sandy Point State Reservation. Trails and observation stations are scattered throughout the refuge. Included in the refuge is Plum Island Sound and all the smaller islands within it, and the mouth of the Plum Island River on the Plum Island Sound side only. The marsh in and around the winding channels of the rivers is known as Great Marsh, which has a much greater area than the refuge. Hiking, jogging and cycling along Plum Island Drive only is permitted any time the refuge is open. Photography is permitted from any location open to the public. Beach locations may be visited over boardwalks out of nesting season. Trailers and licensed fishing are permitted on the beach in the autumn. Access is via roads through the dunes. Licensed deer hunting is permitted for one day of the year up to a maximum limit of kills. The process is controlled by the park employees and volunteers. Seasonal licensed commercial shellfishing is permitted at one location where a stream through the marsh bends close to the island. Licensed seasonal wildfowl hunting is permitted in a special area on the right bank of the Parker River. It must be accessed from the mainland side. New visitor facilities offering exhibits and programs are located on the mainland bordering Plum Island Airport. Any other activities within the refuge are strictly forbidden; the brochure presents a long list. The refuge consists of of diverse habitats including sandy beach and dune, shrub/thicket, bog, swamp, freshwater marsh, saltwater marsh and associated creek, river, mudflat, and newly created salt pannes. These and other refuge habitats support varied and abundant populations of resident and migratory wildlife including more than 300 species of birds and additional species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and plants. The ecology of the island, however, is not in its original state, due to earlier draining of Great Marsh by parallel channels and destabilization of the dunes by overuse. Much of the inland side of the island was cleared for farming. The farmers also used the marsh grass for haying and pasturing animals. In the waters, the chemical pollution of the Merrimack River and the damming of its stream at a number of locations totally changed the character of the fish and the bird species that fed on them. Even today coastal currents from the Merrimack in flood deposit unacceptable levels of debris on the beach, which are typically removed in public campaigns. The creation of the reservation involved the purchase and evacuation of the farmland, the stabilization of the dunes by planting Black Pine, an intrusive Alpine species, and the enhancement of biodiversity by the creation of artificial fresh-water pools on the inland side. More recently heavy equipment was used to replace the parallel channels with unconnected pools in some places, recreating the original marsh. Since the prohibition of the public from the beach in the summer, seals from the Atlantic have been basking there.

Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 14 Oct. 2009.  Concept and design The challenge for the developers was to make a very light weight model, which was accomplished. After that, an autopilot had to be installed so a non-stop autonomous flight for 24 hours could be achieved. All this was tested with a scale model in a wind tunnel. Two major challenges for small autonomous aircraft for Mars are to keep the weight down, such as batteries and electronics and the other is designing the autonomous control systems for directing the flight. Some design considerations is the amount of solar power available over the course of a Martian day, and another is the battery storage capacity, and the efficiency and weight of the solar cells. One reason for a small size, was to facilitate its transport to planet Mars from Earth. The Sky-Sailor concept has a wingspan of about 3.2 meters and it weighs approximately 2.5 kilograms. Aerodynamic studies suggest the power needed for the aircraft to fly at a low altitude is about 13.2 watts.Noth, A, et al. \\"SKY-SAILORDESIGN OF AN AUTONOMOUS SOLAR POWERED MARTIAN AIRPLANE.\\" Sky-Sailor.

Once the spacecraft has reached Mars, the aeroshell would be directly released into the Martian atmosphere. In 12 hours it could cover about 1,700 km (1,050 miles) over Mars, with the flight culminating in a crash landing.

It has a compressed body and short snout; coloration varies from blue-greenish silver on the dorsal areas and silver to yellow on the body and fins. It can be found along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean, depending on the season, and is popular for both sport and commercial fishing. Most Florida pompano caught weigh less than and are less than long, though the largest individuals weigh and reach lengths up to . Because it is fast-growing and desirable for food, the pompano is one of the many fish that is currently being farmed through aquaculture. The Florida city of Pompano Beach is named after the Florida pompano. Description The different kinds of pompano include African, Cayenne, and Florida. The Florida pompano (T. carolinus) is part of the jack family. It is very similar to the permit (Trachinotus falcatus). It has a deeply forked tail and is blue-greenish silver with yellow on the throat, belly, and pelvic and anal fins. The first dorsal fins are low, with about six separate spines. The first spine may be reabsorbed in a larger fish. The second lobes on the dorsal and anal fins have a lower anterior.Smith, C. Lavett, National Audubon Society Field Guide to Tropical Marine Fishes of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. Chanticleer Press, 1997, , color plate 268, p. 490 There are 20-24 anal fin rays. It is a compressed fish with a deep body and a blunt snout. Trachinotus carolinus, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil  Size  thumb Juvenile pompano grow between per month, depending on the population. Pompano grow quickly and attain a length of about and a weight of about after the first year. The relationship between total length (L, in inches) and total weight (W, in pounds) for nearly all fish can be expressed by an equation of the form: W = cL^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant that varies among species.R. O. Anderson and R. M. Neumann, Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, in Fisheries Techniques, second edition, B.E. Murphy and D.W. Willis, eds., American Fisheries Society, 1996. A weight-length relationship was determined for a sample of 1,984 Florida pompano collected along the Gulf Coast of Florida between 2000 and 2002.Murphy, M.D., Muller, R.G., Guindon, K. A stock assessment for pompano, Trachinotus carolinus, in Florida waters through 2005. Report to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries Management. In-house report 2008-004, 2008. The fish sampled ranged in length from 79‚Äì481 mm (3.16-19.24 in). For this sample of Florida pompano, b = 2.9342 and c = 0.00076. This relationship predicts that a pompano will weigh about a pound. Most are less than three pounds when caught, though the largest pompano recorded have weighed 8-9 lb and were 23-25 in long. Lifespan The Florida pompano usually survives for only about three to four years,ESPN page on Florida pompano although individuals as old as 6-7 yr have been caught. Range and habitat The adult Florida pompano is typically found in more saline areas and relatively warm waters (70-89 ¬∞F), so it migrates northward in the summer, and toward the south in the fall. Despite its name, the range of the Florida pompano extends from Massachusetts to Brazil, but it is more common in areas near Florida. During the summer, it can be found near Sebastian, Cape Hatteras, and the Gulf of Mexico. It is more common near oil rigs, Palm Beach, and Hobe Sound during the winter. It can also be found near the Virgin Islands year round. Its habitat is surf flats, and it tends to stay away from clear water regions, such as the Bahamas.Smithsonian Marine Station page on Florida pompano Pompanos are very fast swimmers and live in schools. They are bottom feeders. They have very short teeth and feed on zoobenthos and small clams. Ecology Food The pompano is a popular food fish. Chefs like it because the fillets are of even thickness, which aids in cooking. A popular dish created in New Orleans, called \\"pompano en papillote,\\" is wrapped in parchment paper with a white sauce of wine, shrimp, and crabmeat, and then steamed.Ristori, Al. The Saltwater Fish Identifier. New York: Mallard Press, 1992, , pp. 44 The pompano's flesh is oily and looks white and opaque. Its diet yields a rich but mild flavor. Fresh fillets can cost $17 or more. Demand has encouraged the use of aquaculture to increase supply. Aquaculture The Florida pompano is a popular choice for aquaculture because it is such a popular food and sport fish and is in high demand, and at the same time it has a fast growth rate, high dockside prices, and a tolerance for low-salinity waters. The typical market size of farm-raised pompano is .Southern Regional Aquacultural Center (Texas A&M;) Species Profile on Florida pompano 2007  Fishing  The pompano supports an important commercial and recreational fishery. Florida pompano are commercially fished in all states on the East Coast from Virginia to Texas, with Florida producing over 90% of the annual harvest. Harvesting occurs mostly along Florida's western coast, with some harvesting on the eastern coast and in the Banana and Indian Rivers. Between 1994 and 2006, it commanded dockside prices of more than $3 per pound of whole fish weight. Individually, Florida pompano are caught on light jigs and popping corks. They are very active on the line, testing light tackle beyond what their weight would suggest. They bite near oil rigs in the winter. From 1997-2000, the fishing mortality rates increased sharply. However, an extensive study by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission concluded, as of 2005, the population of Florida pompano was healthy and the fishery was sustainable with current practices.

Wan Chai District It was originally built in 1863, during the Qing dynasty, and was reconstructed in 1986 and 1999. The original use of the temple was a worship place for Guanyin (also known as \\"Kwun Yam\\" in Cantonese), the goddess of mercy.Travel in Causeway Bay on thaiworldview.com Nowadays, it is a tourist attraction as well as a place for local people to celebrate traditional festivals including the Mid-autumn Festival, when the traditional Tai Hang Fire Dragon Dance is held. Previously listed as a Grade I historic building, the Lin Fa Temple has been declared a monument.Antiquities Advisory Board: List of the 1,444 Historic Buildings with Assessment Results History Lin Fa Temple was originally built in 1863, during the Qing dynasty. It is said that Kwun Yam, the goddess of mercy, once appeared on the Lotus Rock to help people avert disasters and bring them good luck. Since then, the local people built a temple which looks like a lotus flower on the Lotus Rock to house Kwun Yam, hoping that she could bring them peace and serenity. Every year on the 19th day of February, June, September and November in lunar calendar, worshippers will go to Lin Fa Temple to pay tribute to Kwun Yam and celebrate the important days such as her birthday, the day when she became a nun and the Goddess of Mercy. On Mid-Autumn festival, the traditional Tai Hang Fire Dragon Dance is held. Other events are celebrated on different special festivals. Apart from Kwun Yam, the temple also houses other deities including Tai Sui ‚Äì Sixty Gods of Time (), Wai Tor ‚Äì Buddhist Temple Guardian () and Choi Sun ‚Äì God of Wealth (). The Chinese Temples Committee has taken over the temple since 1975. The temple was renovated by the committee in 1986. Architecture and features Interior of the temple Interior of the temple Although it is not big in size, Lin Fa Temple is specially structured. The front section of the terrace is supported by 10‚Äì12 feet high pillars, while the back section is situated on a boulder, which is also called the \\"Lotus Rock\\". Nowadays, part of the boulder is hidden by the exterior wall, and the rest of it is exposed and still can be seen.Chinese Temples Committee: Lin Fa Kung, Tai Hang Roof The roof of the temple is another special feature. On the roof and the upper part of the internal wall, there are murals of flying dragons, phoenixes and arrangement of lotus flowers. The murals of flying dragons are said to be set up because of the annual performance of fire dragon dance, an important event which takes place in Tai Hang district during the Mid-autumn festival. Lotus flower lamps Lotus flower lamps can be seen everywhere in the temple. There is also a chamber which collects hundreds of lotus flower lamps. The lotus flower lamps are expected to bless the safety and prosperity of the worshippers and their families. Windows The design of windows in Lin Fa Temple is unique. There are three windows in total, all of which are made of wood and delicately carved. Around every window there are one or two pairs of Dui Lian (), a traditional form of Chinese literature. The contents of Dui Lian hanging on the walls are mostly the expressions of praising nature and worshipping Kwun Yam. Legend Deities Statue of the Goddess of Mercy in Lin Fa Temple In Lin Fa Temple, the main deity is Kwun Yum, the Goddess of Mercy. Besides, other deities can also be found in the temple. Worshippers pay accolade to deities including Wai Tor, Yum Choi Sun and Tai Sui as well. These deities are respectively known as Buddhist Temple Guardian, the Wealth God (of the nether side) and the Sixty Gods of Time among Chinese. Kwun Yum and Lin Fa Kung The divinity Kwum Yam (also referred to as Guan Yin) has a long history in Chinese culture. The legend has different forms but she is commonly recognised as the goddess of mercy, kindness and clemency. It had been said that Kwun Yam was a male god at first but eventually evolved to be a female holy being. There are also myths saying that Kwun Yam was originally a princess and turned out to be a goddess. However, deliverance of the heaps and spiritual salvation are the typical perceptions that Kwun Yam delivers. Obviously, the foundation of Lin Fa Temple (the Lotus Temple) in Hong Kong is based on the legend of Kwan Yum. Stories and myths have been spreading around, saying that Kwan Yum was once seen presenting herself on the Lotus Rock. Therefore, worshippers and parishioners then built up a temple to praise Kwam Yum near the rock, and this gave rise to the construction of the temple. Traditions The long history of Lin Fa Temple is accompanied by a variety of traditions, such as the Kwun Yum Festival, Kwun Yum Open Treasury and Tai Hang Dragon Dance. Kwun Yum Festival Lin Fa Temple provides a place for the followers of Kwun Yum to celebrate the four Kwun Yum festivals, including Kwun Yum's birthday, the day when she was ordained, the day of her deification and the day when she became the sea-goddess on the 19th day of the second, sixth, ninth and eleventh lunar month respectively. Kwun Yum Open Treasury Worshippers of Kwun Yum will go to Lin Fa Temple on the 26th day of the lunar calendar to \\"borrow\\" prosperity from Kwun Yum as a kind of blessing.

Establishment The call to open a college in West Texas began shortly after the arrival of settlers in the area in the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of Texas A&M; to be located in Abilene. However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered that Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas went so far as to recommend that West Texas secede from the state. In 1923, the legislature decided that, rather than a branch campus, an entirely new university would better serve the needs of the region. On February 10, 1923, Neff signed the legislation creating Texas Technological College, and in July of that year a committee began searching for a site. When the members of the committee visited Lubbock, they were overwhelmed to find residents lining the streets to show support for the idea of hosting the institution. That August, Lubbock was chosen on the first ballot over other area towns, including Floydada, Plainview, and Sweetwater. Early years Original Double T Construction of the college campus began on November 1, 1924. Ten days later, the cornerstone of the Administration Building was laid in front of a crowd of twenty thousand people. Governor Pat Neff, Amon G. Carter, Reverend E. E. Robinson, Colonel Ernest O. Thompson, and Representative R. M. Chitwood spoke at the event. With an enrollment of 914 students‚Äîboth men and women‚ÄîTexas Technological College opened for classes on October 1, 1925. It was originally composed of four schools‚ÄîAgriculture, Engineering, Home Economics, and Liberal Arts. During the 1926 football season, head football coach, E. Y. Freeland, and assistant coach, Grady Higginbotham unveiled the first version of the Double T logo. It was first used on the football players sweaters for the inaugural season. Texas Tech grew slowly in the early years. Military training was conducted at the college as early as 1925, but formal Reserve Officers' Training Corps training did not commence until 1936. By 1939, the school's enrollment had grown to 3,890. Though enrollment declined during World War II, Texas Tech trained 4,747 men in its armed forces training detachments. Following the war, in 1946, the college saw its enrollment leap to 5,366 from a low of 1,696 in 1943. Expansion and growth By the 1960s, the school had expanded its offerings to more than just technical subjects. The Faculty Advisory Committee suggested changing the name to \\"Texas State University\\", feeling the phrase \\"Technological College\\" was insufficient to define the scope of the institution. While most students supported this change, the Board of Directors and many alumni, wanting to preserve the Double T logo, opposed it. Other names‚ÄîUniversity of the Southwest, Texas Technological College and State University, and The Texas University of Art, Science and Technology‚Äîwere considered, but the Board of Directors chose Texas Tech University, submitting it to the state legislature in 1964. A failed move by Governor John Connally to have the school placed into the Texas A&M; University System, as well as continued disagreement and heated debate regarding the school's new name, kept the name change from being approved. In spite of objections by many students and faculty, the Board of Directors again submitted the change in 1969. It finally received the legislature's approval on June 6 and the name Texas Tech University went into effect that September. All of the institution's schools, except Law, became colleges. The university was integrated in 1961 when three African-American students were admitted. After its initial rejection of the students' enrollment and the threat of a subsequent lawsuit, the university enacted a policy to admit \\"all qualified applicants regardless of color\\". The university offered its first athletic scholarship to a black student in 1967, when Danny Hardaway was recruited to play for the Red Raiders football team. In 1970, Hortense W. Dixon became the first African-American student to earn a doctorate from the university. In the 1960s and 1970s, the university invested US$150 million in the campus to construct buildings for the library, foreign languages, social sciences, communications, philosophy, electrical and petroleum engineering, art, and architecture. Some other buildings were significantly expanded. On May 29, 1969, the 61st Texas Legislature created the Texas Tech University School of Medicine. The Texas Legislature expanded the medical school charter in 1979, creating the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. TTUHSC, which is now part of the Texas Tech University System, includes Schools of Allied Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. It has locations in four Texas cities in addition to the main campus in Lubbock. Recent history English and Philosophy Building In 1996, the Texas Tech Board of Regents created the Texas Tech University System. John Montford was selected as the first chancellor to lead the combined academic enterprise. Regents Chair Edward Whitacre, Jr., stated that the move was made due to the size and complexity of the institution. \\"It's time\\", he said, \\"to take the university into the 21st century...\\" The Texas Tech University system originally included Texas Tech University and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. On November 6, 2007, the Texas Legislature ratified an amendment to the Texas Constitution re-aligning Angelo State University with the Texas Tech University System. Kent Hance, a former United States Congressman and Texas Tech University graduate, assumed the duties of chancellor on December 1, 2006. Even though growth continued at Texas Tech, the university was not immune to controversy. In 2003, a third- year student at the Texas Tech School of Law filed suit against the university over its policy on free speech zones, which restricted student speech to a single \\"free speech gazebo\\". The following year, a federal judge declared the policy unconstitutional. To meet the demands of its increased enrollment and expanding research, the university has invested more than $548 million in new construction since 2000. It has also received more than $65.9 million in private donations. In April 2009, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill that will increase state funding for seven public universities. Texas Tech University is classified by the state as an \\"Emerging Research University\\" and is among the universities that will receive additional state funding for advancement toward \\"Tier 1\\" status. Three funds‚Äîthe Research University Development Fund, the Texas Research Incentive Program, and the National Research University Benchmark Fund‚Äîhave been established and will provide $500 million in grants and matching funds during fiscal years 2010 and 2011. On September 2, 2009, the university announced that it had received private gifts totaling $24.3 million. Of these, $21.5 million are eligible for match under the Texas Research Incentive Program. With the 2012 resignation of Guy Bailey as president to assume the presidency of his alma mater University of Alabama, Texas Tech immediately set about to select Bailey's successor.

The refuge serves as a stopover site for songbirds and other migrants to rest and feed during their seasonal migration. Off-shore habitats are used by seals, waterfowl, loons, grebes, cormorants, and alcids. Historically, the island served as nesting grounds for several species of terns, but over the years it has been overrun by the gulls. Still, Thacher Island has the potential to be re-established as a prime nesting area. The habitat remains ideal for tern breeding. Nesting terns are currently supported on islands strategically located to the north and south of the Thacher Island, and could be attracted to re-establish nesting colonies on the island.

Background Bruneau graduated from Brother Martin High School, then known as St. Aloysius High School, in New Orleans. He received his law degree from Loyola University College of Law in New Orleans, and was a member of Alpha Delta Gamma National Fraternity. In 1991, he was named as a distinguished fellow of the Government Leadership of the University of New Orleans. He is a retired lieutenant colonel in the Louisiana Air National Guard. Bruneau is a member of the New Orleans Bar Association, Lakeview Civic Improvement Association, and is active in promoting the New Orleans Audubon Zoo, Aquarium of the Americas, and City Park. He is Roman Catholic. He was married to the former Brenda Vines until her death in 2001 they have two grown sons.House District 94, Encyclopedia Louisiana at enlou.org (1999) Political biography Representative Bruneau wrote landmark sunshine laws to open government meetings and records to the public. He sponsored the controversial law that legalized video poker in the state. He procured passage of another law that clarifies the right of a victim to shoot a carjacker. However, he fought efforts to halt excessive alcohol consumption. He mastered the art of redistricting as a House parliamentarian. Rarely was he seriously challenged in his own Lakeview district. He also pushed without success for both vouchers for families of private school pupils and for merit selection of state court judges. Bruneau left the legislature with nine months remaining in his eighth term, having even accelerated his original departure date by two weeks. A special election was therefore held to choose his successor. His son, Jeb E. Bruneau, ran unsuccessfully for the seat, having lost a March 31, 2007, runoff to fellow Republican Nicholas Lorusso, a New Orleans attorney. Also in the race in the spring was Democratic activist Deborah Langhoff. Thereafter, Bruneau's other son, Adrian Lee Bruneau (born ca. 1972), failed in the regular nonpartisan blanket primary, or jungle primary, held on October 20, 2007, to select a full-term successor to the term-limited Bruneau. Lorusso again prevailed, having defeated Adrian Bruneau and, again, the Democrat Deborah Langhoff. In addition to Lakeview, the 94th District includes Mid-City, City Park, and the Lake areas of Orleans Parish. It was redistricted in 2011 for the 2012 legislative session. Bruneau, known for his flamboyance, wit, humor, and theatrics in the House, was originally elected as an Independent in the first ever nonpartisan primary held in the fall of 1975. He switched to Republican affiliation in 1984 and was thereafter elected as a Republican in 1987, 1991, 1995, 1999, and 2003. During Hurricane Katrina, Bruneau lost his home, law offices, and certain business interests. He sent dozens of updates and newsletters to constituents advising them of their options after Katrina. Bruneau is a former Speaker Pro Tempore of the Louisiana House. In 1984, he was chairman of the House Republican delegation. The conservative Alliance for Good Government named him \\"Legislator of the Year\\" in 1978, 1980, 1981, and 1986. The Louisiana Conservative Union cited him for service as well in 1981. The National Republican Legislators Association named him \\"National Legislator of the Year\\" in 1986. In 1992, he received the Monte M. Lemann Award from Louisiana Civil Service. In 1995, he was honored by the interest group Victims and Citizens against Crime. Bruneau attributed his early resignation to the desire that his successor serve prior to the implementation of term limits with the 2008 legislative session. Though Bruneau had originally supported term limits for legislators, he changed his mind on the matter as his time of departure neared. As early as 2005, Bruneau had expressed opposition to term limits, even having quipped the Richard M. Nixon line: \\"You won't have Peppi to kick around any more.\\" Bruneau, meanwhile holds the District 94 seat on the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee. In February 2015, Bruneau, along with Attorney General Buddy Caldwell, were among the new inductees into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

Formerly known as Ningeokuluk, as of March 2017 she uses Ningiukulu, to reflect the modern orthography on her government issued identification. Ningiukulu Teevee, is recognized as one of Kinngait studios' leading artists. Teevee is a self-taught artist, who began her career in the 1990s.Jasmine Inglis, Acquisition Proposal for Ningiukulu Teevee‚Äôs Raven and Owl, accession #48515, Curatorial File, National Gallery of Canada She uses ink and coloured pencils as her primary mediums but is adept in a multitude of drawing media, including black fibre-tip pen, coloured pencil, oil sticks, and watercolour. Her subject matter is diverse and creative. She is known for constructing imagery that is built from her knowledge of Inuit folklore, combined with the humorous aspects of contemporary life in Nunavut. The wealth of these Inuit stories depict, in her flattened 2D style (an abstraction of representation, referencing patterns found in nature), relationships between the land and animals that are used for sustenance, and the familial histories that define a wealth of cultural storytelling. As a modern day Inuk, raised in an urban community, the artist explores contemporary themes but also retains an interest in her cultural heritage including the Inuit oral tradition. While her interpretation of the stories heard from Elders are true to the telling, they are nonetheless interpreted through her own imagination and presented from her personal perspective. In addition to her talent as an artist, she is also an accomplished children's author. Her first children's book, Alego, is an authentic introduction to Inuit Tradition and lifestyle - a nominee for the 2009 Governor General's Award for children's literature illustration. Alego is an autobiographical tale (written and illustrated by Teevee) about adventure and discovery along the seashore; for the first time, a young girl goes clam-digging with her grandmother.  Solo exhibitions  Teevee's work has been exhibited extensively across Canada and internationally. In 2006, her first solo exhibition was held at the Feheley Fine Arts Gallery in Toronto, titled \\"Ningeokuluk Teevee.\\" In 2009 she had her second solo exhibition at Feely Fine Arts Gallery in Toronto, titled \\"Drawings by Ningeokuluk Teevee,\\" which included a public presentation of Alego.

It is similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and infects cattle. The cells primarily infected are lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Discovery BIV was discovered in the late 1960s in the search for the infectious agent causing bovine leukemia/lymphosarcoma. This search led to the isolation and identification of three distinct classes of bovine retroviruses. BIV was specifically identified by Dr. Cameron Seger, a veterinarian of the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, while he was studying dairy cattle at the Southeast Louisiana Experiment Station at Franklinton, Louisiana. The cows presented with high white blood cell counts, referred to as persistent lymphocytosis (PL) which is associated with the development of bovine leukemia/lymphosarcoma. The first animal studied was an eight-year-old Holstein cow (R-29), her white blood cell count was elevated and her physical condition was steadily declining; after delivering a calf she weakened and became severely emaciated. She had to be euthanized and necropsy was performed. The diagnosis was lymphosarcoma, however, none of the tumors usually associated with the diseases were present in the postmortem gross examination. Tissue samples were sent to Dr. Van Der Maaten at the National Animal Disease Center; Dr. Van Der Maaten was able to isolate the BIV. When the isolated BIV was inoculated into colostrum deprived young calves, they developed elevated leukocyte counts. The lymphocytosis persisted for several months and lymphadenopathy was apparent in the subcutaneous lymph nodes. This was similar to cow R-29. These calves, however, did not decline as R-29 did, which led researchers to believe that the isolated BIV was not the causative agent of the bovine leukemia/lymphosarcoma. It was put into storage and went unstudied until the discovery that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was caused by HIV. Replication One of the identifying characteristics of lentiviruses is being able to infect non-dividing cells. BIV, being a lentivirus has this characteristic. BIV, like HIV, has two phases to its replication cycle. The first phase is the entry phase; it is initiated by high affinity of the virus envelope glycoprotein with a specific cell receptor. The attached virus enters the cell by one of two ways, receptor mediated endocytosis or viral envelope-cell membrane fusion. Once in the cell, the virus is uncoated and the RNA genome is reverse-transcribed into DNA. Some studies have found that reverse transcriptase has a higher activity at low concentrations of Mn2+ ions when compared to Mg2+ ions; this finding is helpful in classifying the virus. The DNA (provirus) is then transported into the nucleus where it integrates into the host cell genome. The second phase of the replication cycle is virus expression. During this phase the provirus is transcribed. The transcript is spliced and the viral mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm where it is then translated. After translation, the viral structural proteins assemble the virus particle at the plasma membrane and form a complex with the viral RNA as the virus buds and is released from the cell. The virus matures after proteolytic processing by the viral protease (PR). The virus is then ready to infect another cell and repeat the process. Structure The mature virus is about 110‚Äì130 nm in size, with the genome being 8.4kb. The genome contains the usual retroviral structural genes including gag, pol, and env. These genes are surrounded by and 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô LTR. It also contains at least five non-structural accessory gene open reading frames (ORF). These are in the region between the pol and env ORF. Other accessory genes include vif (viral infectivity factor), tat (transcription activator), and rev (protein expression regulator). In primate lentiviruses there is usually an ORF for nef (negative factor); this is not present in BIV. BIV has a structure like all retroviruses, and contains two copies of its positive sense single stranded RNA genome. It has two compartments: the envelope and the core. The envelope comes from the host cell plasma membrane, the virus takes the membrane as it buds and then inserts viral glycoproteins into its envelope. The core of the virus contains Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. These polyproteins are cleaved in the mature virus to their functional forms. Pathogenesis As mentioned before, leukocytosis and lymphadenopathy are associated with early infection. Researchers do now know how long cow R-29 was infected with BIV so some of the pathogenesis is not known. Eventually the symptoms resemble those of AIDS in humans. Transmission Like other retroviruses, BIV is spread through exchange of bodily fluids. When looking at prevalence of BIV infection, it was found that BIV is more prevalent in the southern United States and most prevalent in South America. When an animal tests positive, many of the animals within the herd are also positive. Some of the spread is attributed to reuse of contaminated needles used in vaccinations, communal sharing of colostrum by calves, and failure to completely sterilize instruments after invasive treatments.

Both viral types are confirmed to be the causative agents of the neoplastic condition in the freshwater fish species, the North American Walleye (Sander vitreus). The specific association of retroviral infection with proliferative lesions in fish is based on the presence of retrovirus-like particles (observed via electron microscopy) and reverse transcriptase activity (using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques) from neoplastic tissue. Although both virus types have been observed in lesions of diseased fish, each cell of the infected tissue is host to a specific virus. Transmission studies have also shown that WEHV-2 has been the more proliferative agent of the condition as compared to WEHV-1. Phylogeny Phylogenetic analysis of the three confirmed Epsilonretroviruses shows they are related. After cloning techniques, sequence analysis determined that WEHV-1 and WEHV-2 are similar in size and share 95% amino acid identity in the pol region of reverse transcriptase. This finding suggests that they are different strains of the same virus or likely distinct species. The two types of WEHV also share over 80% of their amino acid sequence with the third member of the epsilonretrovirus genus. Included in this analysis was the observation of a homologous genomic organization in all three Epsilonretroviruses. Condition Walleye epidermal hyperplasia lesions are characteristically broad, flat, translucent plaques that range in size (2‚Äì50 mm in diameter). Lesions are most often observed in sexually mature fish although transmission studies have shown that fingerling fish can be infected using cell-free virus components extracted from lesions. Multiple growths are also known to coalesce into larger lesions. Seasonal observations of the fish by scientists and sportsmen show a high incidence of the condition during the late fall, winter, and early spring months. Mortality in the host fish is hypothesized to be less related to the virus and more to secondary infections that invade necrotic tissue. These viruses have evolved a means to maintain a fine balance between its own proliferation and leaving behind a fit and reproductive host. Transmission and epidemiology As with other skin lesion retroviruses, the in-lake transmission of the WEHV particles appears to be the result of contact with water harboring released infectious viral particles or close contact with other fish. The infection proliferates in temperatures between 0‚Äì5 ¬∞C (32‚Äì41 ¬∞F), and this may be why it occurs primarily in the fall and spring. With this seasonal prevalence, it is suggested that an inverse relationship exists between water temperature and skin lesion size/abundance. This is especially evident in the fact that few walleye show signs of the condition during the summer months. The nature of the seasonality of this condition is linked to a couple possible hypotheses: (1) low water temperatures and immune suppression, and (2) the physiological stress associated with spring spawning It is important to note that this disease is not classified as zoonotic and is not known to infect humans. Molecular biology and oncogenesis studies Molecular studies of retroviruses have been partly responsible for elucidating the mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis. The Epsilonretroviruses provide a unique model for understanding the development and regression of tumors due to its seasonal prevalence and genetic evolutionary baggage. Proteins encoded by these viruses function in cell cycle regulation, alteration of cell-signaling pathways to promote proliferation and suppression of host cell apoptosis, and induction of apoptosis. The genetic and transcriptional similarities of the three classified Epsilonrertovirus suggest that these viruses share homologous mechanisms to replicate and proliferate.

Currently, waterfowl, shorebirds, neotropical migratory songbirds, and birds of prey rely on the shallow water and prairie habitat that has been restored on the refuge. Refuge habitat restorations have resulted in an increase in shorebird and prairie songbird populations. This has generated opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation and serves as an educational model for land and watershed stewardship. Approximately 50% of the private property within the refuge's future boundary has been acquired from willing sellers.

Wilson (n√©e Goddard),Christian County Republican (July 6, 1967), p. 1 who had come to Missouri in a covered wagon from the hills of Tennessee. He was the family's first son after six daughters: Cassie, Carrie, Edna, Bertha, Myrtle, and Vancie Martha. The entire family was known for being musical. Wilson attended schools in Harmony, Rosedale and Line, then rode horseback to high school in Nixa. About 1930, his father rented a house on the family's ranch to the Hancock family from South Dakota. A year later, Wilson married Ada Hancock. By 1934, he was raising dairy and beef cattle on 150 acres (60.7 hectares) north of Bolivar, Missouri on the Pomme de Terre River. His father bought the adjoining parcel.Jamboree magazine (November 1948) Western Song Club, Ventura, Calif. The Wilson family‚Äôs musicians would sometimes perform ‚Äútogether\\" using a telephone party line. Ten to 15 families could listen in, and neighbors would eavesdrop on the sessions for entertainment, often placing the earpiece in a bucket for amplification.Gage, Allen (ed) \\"Old-time Fiddling: A Traditional Folk Art With Four Ozark Musicians\\" (Spring 1982), Bittersweet, Vol. IX, No. 3 Wilson soon won second place in a local fiddle competition. Radio career Wilson formed The Goodwill Trio as \\"Uncle Slim\\" with his sister Vancie as \\"Aunt Martha\\" and her son, Herschel \\"Junior\\" Haworth. The trio first appeared on KGBX in Springfield in 1932; but moved to co-owned KWTO, the more powerful station, soon after it signed on in 1933. The group made its first public appearance in 1936 at the county courthouse in Galena as a fundraiser to treat their father's broken leg. The trio later became The Goodwill Family when Guy Smith joined them as \\"Uncle George.\\" Unable to afford a car, Wilson hitchhiked to KWTO to appear with Zed Tennis; and later, with Si Perkins and Smokey Lohman. He was a part of many artist combinations on the station, including Slim and Shorty (a Nixa neighbor); and The Tall Timber Trio, with Haworth on guitar and Bob White on bass fiddle. He was also \\"Whistler\\" of Flash and Whistler (with Floyd \\"Goo Goo\\" Rutledge), a music-comedy duo. The station, heard across the Ozarks, was a stepping-stone during Wilson's years for such musicians as Porter Wagoner, Les Paul, Chet Atkins and The Browns. Wilson was responsible for giving Wesley West his nickname: he introduced West to the audience as \\"Speedy\\" West at a pie social and jam session sponsored by KWTO. He worked briefly at radio stations in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Denver, Colorado before returning to the Ozarks. By the early 1950s, Wilson was among the top performers on KWTO, hosting the morning show sponsored by Martha White Flour (one advertiser created a Goodwill Family Flour brand). By 1954, he had done his 25,000th broadcast on the station. He also appeared on Red Foley‚Äôs network radio programs.Ozark Jubilee Souvenir Picture Album (first edition, 1955) Recording career Wilson recorded numerous transcriptions in the 1940s and 1950s but few commercial cuts. He recorded songs on Universal in 1948; and Cattle Records released an LP, Slim Pickens Wilson-The Idol Of The Ozarks (Cattle 121), featuring Rutledge. The Goodwill Family recorded 250 transcriptions for airing on KWTO when they toured. Wilson appeared on such RadiOzark Transcriptions as The Red Foley Show. Rocket Records released a Wilson 45 single, \\"The Shepherd Of The Hills\\" b/w \\"God Walk These Ozark Hills\\" (Rocket 103). He also appeared on the albums Christmas RFD (Sony 1991) and Christmas in the Country (United Multimedia, 1994). TV career In 1955, Wilson became a featured cast member on Ozark Jubilee for its nearly six-year run on ABC-TV, and was also a fill-in host for Red Foley. He was a versatile performer on the show, serving as the front man for both the Tall Timber Trio (sometimes known as the Tall Timber Boys), then made up of Herschel \\"Speedy\\" Haworth, White, and \\"Doc\\" Martin (steel guitar); and the Jubilee Band, composed of Haworth, Martin, White, Johnny Gailey (drums), Paul Mitchell (piano) and Zed Tennis (fiddle).

On 15 June he destroyed an Albatros D.III west of Houthem, and sent down another in flames on 28 July, east of Roeselare, but was then himself also shot down and wounded. Luke was awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 24 August 1917. His citation read: :Temporary Second Lieutenant Thomas Carlyon Luke, RE and RFC. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in aerial combats. On several occasions he attacked hostile formations and dispersed them, although they were in superior numbers, showing great dash and fearlessness in engaging them at close range. He has taken part in thirty-five offensive patrols, at all times setting a fine example of courage and devotion to duty.\\" He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 October 1917. Luke returned to active duty, being posted to No. 209 Squadron RAF, flying a Sopwith Camel, in mid-1918. On 8 August he shared in the shooting down in flames of a Halberstadt C reconnaissance aircraft over Harbonni√®res with Captain Robert Foster, and Lieutenants Cedric Edwards, Kenneth M. Walker and M.

Early life Alexander Forrest Harper, always known to his family as Alec, was born in Freshford in Somerset and educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and then at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Military career Harper was commissioned onto the Unattached List for Indian Army on 28 August 1930, arrived in India on 29 September 1930 and was attached to the 2nd Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers on 25 October 1930. After one year he was posted to his permanent Indian Army unit and joined the 9th Royal Deccan Horse on 26 October 1931. Stationed at Poona. Harper learned to hunt big game and was promoted from zero handicap to a two- goal player by the end of his first regimental polo tournament. In 1936 Harper attended the Equitation School at Saugor, after which he was appointed Quarter Master of his regiment until October 1938, when he was appointed Commandant of the Governor's Bodyguard to the Governor of Bengal. He retained the position he retained until 1940, after which he returned to his regiment. After the outbreak of World War II, keen to see action, volunteered for the 2nd Chindit expedition, which was to drop long range penetration groups into Burma. The objective was to cut the lines of communication serving the Japanese Army operating against the American-led Chinese forces advancing from the north through the Hukawng Valley. Harper took command of the 3rd/9th Gurkha Rifles after their CO became seriously ill and he led a three-day trek north-west through the Gangaw Range to rejoin Brigadier Mike Calvert's 77th Brigade south of Hopin. At the end of the Burma campaign, Harper accompanied the 3rd/9th to Java as part of the 5th Indian Division where Indonesian nationalists had proclaimed independence from Dutch rule, and the withdrawal of the Japanese to their barracks had created a breakdown of law and order. Harper led his battalion in an advance through Surabaya in East Java, which took two weeks of fighting to restore order and free the Europeans who were being held in internment camps or as hostages. He was awarded an immediate DSO. After attending Staff College at Quetta in 1947 Harper retired from the Army and after a period in India helping to run his father-in-law's distillery business in Calcutta, he returned to England and settled on the Cowdray Estate in 1955. Polo and later life During his playing years Harper represented England, when it inflicted a rare defeat on Argentina in a 23-goal match in 1951, and again in 1953. Harper also played for a number of other teams, including The Mariners, which included Prince Philip, and for which he had to be made an honorary naval officer. He appeared in the British Open final eight times, mainly for his club, Cowdray Park, and finally gave up at aged 77 after playing 20 chukkas during his final season. Between 1971 and 1989 Harper was a key figure in the sport, as honorary secretary of its governing body, the Hurlingham Polo Association. Harper had a long-held theory that in order to play really well, sex was essential before a match. Harper made his living by buying young horses and turning them into polo ponies. He was assisted by his Indian orderly, Bachan Singh, who had also been the regimental rough rider in the Deccan Horse. Harper also became a steward with the Greyhound Racing Association.

Tai Po Lookout was built in the early twentieth century by Lawrence Gibbs, a British engineer, as his residence. The Lookout had many different owners throughout the years, and was circulated around very frequently. During the Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong, the Lookout was used as a torture chamber by the Japanese.Brief Information on Proposed Grade I Items: Historic Building Appraisal, pp. 352‚Äì353 After World War II, the land became government property. It was used by government officials such as the Tai Po District Officers and the Head of Police Secret Service as their private residences. In 1996, the government leased the Lookout to the Society for AIDS Care (SAC). The SAC launched the Lookout Project to provide hospice care for AIDS patients. The service was first operated in June 1997 and officially closed on the first of June 2000Council for the AIDS Trust Fund due to drying up of funds.ACA Newsfile Since then, the Lookout has been leased by the Government Property Agency to private owners and reverted to its original residential purpose.Introduction to 1444 Historical Building The Lookout is a colonial-style building with a watch tower. Standing on top of a small hill, it overlooks Tai Po District and Tolo Harbour. In 1985, the building was accorded as a Grade II Historic Building by the Antiquities Advisory Board (). Recently, it is proposed that the status of the Lookout to be regarded as Grade I.  History  Tai Po Lookout is situated on former Tai Po Inland Lot No. 5 (now at No. 11 Lookout Link, Tai Po Kau, Tai Po, New Territories, Hong Kong). In 1904, Lawrence Gibbs bought the piece of land and built the Lookout as his residence. He was a British civil engineer who worked at the Public Works Department then also 'Denison, Ram & Gibbs' in 1900. The Lookout was designed and built by Gibbs in the early 1900s and he used it as his own residence. The Lookout's location was a remote area in Tai Po on top of a small hill and it is believed that the beautiful views there is the reason for choosing that particular place to build the Lookout. It remains to be a difficult place to get to even in present time. As an engineer, Gibbs was able to get water supply from the hillside, the tower found in the Lookout was also used as a water tower. Throughout the years, the Lookout was sold to different owners. In 1929, the Lookout was sold to Herbert Austin Rogers. After 4 years, August 1933, it was sold to Michael Howard Turner as the leaseholder of the house. Immediately after, the November of the same year, the Lookout was sold to John Alexander Fraser, a judge in Hong Kong as his living quarter. During the time of World War II, Fraser was kept in the Stanley Internment Camp during the Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong where he died. The Lookout was then occupied by the Japanese and was used as a torture chamber. After the war, in December 1947, the land became government property. Since then it served as the living quarters of government officials. Many officers of the Tai Po District and the head of the Police Secret Service lived in the Lookout. In 1996, it was leased to the Society of AIDs CareThe Society for AIDS Care http://www.aidscare.com.hk as a residential centre for AIDS patients. Until the year 2000, the Lookout returned to being a private residence.  The Lookout Project  Dedicated to promote the wellbeing of people living with HIV/AIDS and their care givers, Sister Maureen McGinley MBE established the Society for AIDS Care () in 1994 with the support from the government. The SAC is community-based non-profit charity organization aiming at running sustainable HIV/AIDS programmes on care and prevention. The SAC is a professional team of nurses, counselors, social workers and physiotherapists who provide both centered-based and external services for AIDS patients and their families. In 1996, the Tai Po Lookout was leased to the SAC. The organization planned to implement the Lookout Project as a measure to tackle with the lack of hospice facilities when AIDS treatment was not mature.South China Morning Post 2000-05-21 Funds dry up for HK's Aids hospice The Project officially started in May 1997. It admitted and served 73 patients until it stopped operating on 1 June 2000. The project received funding from the Council for the AIDS Trust Fund () in Hong Kong, which provided $30 million to cover the running cost of the hospice. The implementation of the Lookout Project faced strong objection from the Department of Health (Hong Kong) from 1995 to 1996, shortly before the Lookout's opening though. Health officials argued that the Lookout was deemed to be short-living as \\"cocktail therapy\\", treatment by taking a combination of several antiretroviral drugs, was already available in Hong Kong and was expected to be used extensively. They also claimed that isolation of AIDS patients from the urban area would hinder the integration of patients into the community. The Lookout, situated at a remote area in Tai Po, functioned as a 24-hour residential medical center that offered day-care as well as in-patient service, particularly for terminal patients. It was recognized as Asia's first and only 24-hour residential medical care centre at that time. The Lookout originally had five beds for in- patients and two more beds were added in 1999. Facilities were also set up for patients' families to stay overnight when they needed to. On top of these, the Lookout was a center for physiotherapy and counselling to help patient maintain good physical and psychological health. An integration of services was provided by a team of specifically trained doctors, nurses and social workers in palliative care. It was closely associated with other Hong Kong SAR medical bodies such as the Department of Health AIDS Unit and Queen Elizabeth Hospital Special Medical Unit to provide more comprehensive care to patients. http://www.csu.med.cuhk.edu.hk/hkaids/aidscare/index.htm In addition, the Lookout provided educational and experimental training for medical personnel in AIDS care. Most of the patients admitted when the Lookout first operated were kicked out by their families, who could not tolerate the notion of living under the same roof with relatives contracted with HIV. They had low chance of survival unless they had a high insurance premium or were able to afford treatment overseas. Two of the seventy-three patients died during their stay at the Lookout. The bungalow served as a quiet sanctuary for these patients. It was planned that 22 beds were to be made available within two years of operation. However, with the advancement of AIDS treatment, demand for hospice service for AIDS care declined drastically with the emergence of antiretroviral drugs, which profoundly lengthen the life span of AIDS patients. Taking a combination of several drugs, patients are expected to live as long as they remain on medication. The plan for expansion was eventually abandoned as dedicated hospice facilities were no longer widely needed as before. Access to medical care in public hospitals was much easier. Thereon, the Lookout put its focus on nursing care and counselling instead of medical services. It served as a \\"mid-way home\\" for patients to rebuild self-esteem and helped them integrate into the community by providing space and time for them to organize themselves. Funding for the Lookout ceased in the third year of the Project on the grounds that the Project performed overlapping functions as other hospice services provided by public hospitals. The SAC could not find sufficient financial support for keeping the running of the Lookout. Moreover, resorting to life in a remote part of the New Territories was unnecessary as AIDS patients under cocktail therapy were able to lead a more or less normal life at home. Falling short of demand, together with the drying up of funds, prompted the SAC's decision to put an end to the Project in February, 2000. The last two patients at the Lookout was transferred to other medical centers and marked the official closure of the Lookout at the end of May, 2000. Although the Lookout Project did not last long, it was a pioneering experiment to introduce hospice service into the existing medical system. It brought insights to other health projects as in the importance of considering medical development and patients needs.  Architectural and geographic features  The Lookout adapts the colonial style and is a one-storey flat-roofed building with an arched colonnaded verandah, a projecting portico (built at a later date) and a cylindrical watch tower at the top which gives the building its name. The watch tower is also a water tower. The walls stands on a low rubble plinth and are painted white, this remains to be unchanged till present time. There are several quarters for servants in a detached block set at a particular angle next to the main building of the Lookout located on another small hill. The Lookout also has a lawn that has views over Tolo Harbour to the Pat Sin Leng.Gwulo: Old Hong Kong http://gwulo.com/node/4247 The design of the house internally is quite symmetrical and had some walls and partitions removed over the years by comparing the current building with the original floor plan. The Lookout still contains its original design and appearance from a few infill windows to the rear verandah It also as a swimming pool, in the past, the water supplies from a nearby stream not only supplied water for the residence all year round, but also enough water for the swimming pool.Bray, Denis 'Hong Kong Metamorphosis' (2001) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press When the Lookout was first built it had no water mains and relied on a stream nearby which went strongly all year round. The stream supplied water to the house and the overflow went into the swimming pool of the garden. Water mains was later developed and supply fresh water to Lookout Link. It is known that the Lookout is able to view Island House (the former residence of government official, now property of the World Wide Fund for Nature) located next to the shore, a declared monument of Hong Kong.Declared Monuments in Hong Kong http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/en/monuments.php It now continues to oversee the Tai Po District and Tolo Harbour. The Lookout is situated in a remote area on top of a small hill and close to the Lookout are mansions such as Villa Costa and 'Tsung Tsai Yuen' (), a part of Tai Po Kau Natural Reserve.Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_wha/cou_wha_tra_13.html This particular area is famous for being the home of fireflies all year round. The area is also well known for the 'Ghostly Bridge' (), which is located at part of Tai Po Road ‚Äì Tai Po Kau section. The name came from an incident during the 1950s where many students were washed away in a storm under a bridge. Conservation Under the management of Government Property Agency (), Tai Po Lookout is a structure not open to public. It is being leased since 2000. Thus, the question of adaptive reuse is not a current concern as the Lookout serves as private residence once again. Because the Lookout is located in a remote part of Tai Po, it is not a popular landmark and is just of a local interest. As a colonial architectural building located in such a remote area in Tai Po, it is a rare and unique piece of heritage that still remains. In 1985, the Antiquities Advisory Board accorded the Lookout as Grade II Historic Building, meaning that the Lookout had \\"special merit and efforts should be made to selectively preserve\\".Antiquities and Monument Office Recently, it is proposed in the assessment on the 1,444 historic building completed in March, 2009http://sc.info.gov.hk/gb/www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200903/19/P200903190254.htm that the status to be raised to Grade I Historic Building to ascertain its outstanding merit.Antiquities and Monuments Office In vicinity to Tai Po Lookout in the same district, there is a range of Grade II Historic Buildings managed by different institutions at present time, including, the Old Tai Po Police Station, Old District Office North, Old Police Bungalow, and the Island House. These buildings share the same colonial style as the Lookout since they were built at roughly the same period of time.Leisure and Cultural Services Department  Transportation  Tai Po Lookout stands on the top of a small hill in Tai Po Kau and has always been a difficult place to reach amongst the area as it is still remotely far away from the central concentrated area of Tai Po. The only means of transportation would be bus 72, 72A of Kowloon Motor Bus and taxi. Minibus 28K would also lead to the area of Tai Po Kau. Five to ten minutes of walking is necessary after taking the bus or minibus as there are no direct transport leading to the Lookout.

She gave solo concerts in England, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Florida and Hong Kong. Most recently she performed in the prestigious Saturday Matinee series at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. Work with Amsterdam Sinfonietta Thompson has been 's artistic director and leader since 2003. This string orchestra of twenty-two players, founded in 1988, performs under her guidance with a strong conviction that similarly minded players are stronger as a group if each individual upholds the responsibility. In the recent past Amsterdam Sinfonietta has performed both in the Netherlands and abroad with soloists such as Murray Perahia, Thomas Hampson, Maxim Vengerov, , Martin Frost and Gidon Kremer. The orchestra also actively commissions composers such as HK Gruber, Thomas Larcher, John McCabe and Michel van der Aa. Recordings Thompson made a number of chamber music recordings. She released a CD \\"Dutch violin sonatas\\" together with the pianist David Kuyken. The Bohemian Album is Thompson's most recent recording with Amsterdam Sinfonietta. As soon as released, it has been chosen by Classic FM the CD of the week in the UK. This recording for Channel Classics combines Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's romantic Serenade with two surprising works from the nineteen twenties by Pavel Haas and Erwin Schulhoff. This repertoire combination is typical for the Amsterdam Sinfonietta's concept of programming. Their previous release of Beethoven's String Quartet, op. 135, and Walton‚Äôs Sonata for Strings under Thompson's leadership was much acclaimed and chosen CD of the month in Gramophone, BBC Recording of the Week and received a 10/10 from Luister Magazine. Another recording with Amsterdam Sinfonietta were new arrangements of String quartets No. 2 and No. 4 by Dmitri Shostakovich. This CD received an Opus d'or, a Best of the year disc by Audiophile Audition and 10/10 by Classics Today. As Amsterdam Simfonietta's leader, Thompson also recorded for Channel Classic the Piazzola seasons together with Ginestras Concerto for Strings. She is a member of the Hamlet Piano Trio together with Paolo Giacometti and Xenia jankovic, they have recorded discs of Mendelssohn and Beethoven Piano trios for Channel Classics.

They have cited as their influences early British Oi! bands such as Cockney Rejects and Business. History The original incarnation of the band was formed in 1982 by two friends who had first met in their junior high school's folk music club: Yosu-ko (on vocals and bass guitar) and Naoki (on guitar), and a mutual friend known as Mi-chan on drums. Their first recording was the EP Break Out, released from the independent label AA Records in 1984. Naoki left that same year. Cobra released several singles and EPs on AA Records, some of which were later collected on a CD entitled Indie Omnibus '82-'86. The band's debut LP, Stand the Pressure (1985) was also released on AA Records, and featured an eye-catching cover of a boot crushing a young man's face. The band went through several member changes. Then in 1989, Yosu- ko happened to meet Naoki and bassist Pon, who at the time were both members of the punk band Laughin' Nose but thinking of leaving. They joined Yosu-ko, and drummer Ki-yan completed this line-up. They were signed by a major record label, Pony Canyon, and released two full-length albums (Oi Oi Oi and Captain Nippon, both 1990) and a half-length album (Stand! Strong1 Straight!, 1991). Although this incarnation of Cobra was quite commercially successful (e.g. playing at Budokan in January 1991), it disbanded in December 1991 after only a year. Yosu-ko and Pon pursued their interest in house music under the moniker Cow Cow, while Naoki, his younger brother Taisho, and Ki-yan formed a rock band called Dog Fight, with Ken (currently of SA) on bass guitar. Cobra reformed in 1999 and released a new album, simply entitled Cobra. Yosu-ko and Naoki were the only members to return from the previous lineup; Yosu-ko handled the bass duties as well as vocals, and the two were joined by drummer Yoshiro. This album represented a departure in the band's sound compared to their 1980s/early 1990s work, with generally quieter guitars, less of an emphasis on sing-along choruses, and more of an overall alternative rock feel. Another album with the same lineup, OK Ride On, was released later that year on EMI Records, and marked something of a return to form for the band. After Voice, Naoki left Cobra to become the guitarist for the punk band SA. Yoshiro departed as well, so Yosu-ko recruited drummer Keigo (formerly The Stalin and The Star Club) and a rotating number of support musicians for the next album, On The Street (2002), which consisted largely of re-recorded versions of old Cobra songs and a cover of the Clash classic \\"White Riot\\". Reduced to a two- piece, Cobra recorded their following album, Reality Check (2003), in Los Angeles. In 2005, Cobra seemed to dissolve once again. However, Yosu-ko revived the band in 2007 with Yuichi on bass, Ryu on drums and Lina on guitar, and released Hello! This is Cobra in 2009. Ryu left in 2010, and was replaced by the return of Ki-yan the following year.

Legg, 68 Cal. 2d 728 (1968), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of California that established the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress. To date, it is the most persuasive decision of the most persuasive state supreme court in the United States during the latter half of the 20th century: Dillon has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision in the period from 1940 to 2005.Jake Dear and Edward W.

It was also favorably cited by the House of Lords in an important case on nervous shock, McLoughlin v O'Brian [1983]. Background A mother, Margery M. Dillon, and her daughter Cheryl witnessed the death of her other child in a car accident caused by a negligent driver, David Luther Legg. Two-year-old Erin Dillon was fatally struck by Legg's vehicle while crossing Bluegrass Road near its intersection with Clover Lane (near the Dillons' residence in the unincorporated area of Arden-Arcade in Sacramento County). The mother and daughter sued for emotional distress as a result of witnessing the accident. The trial court dismissed the claim under the prevailing zone of danger rule: the plaintiff needed to be in physical danger of the accident itself to recover for emotional distress.Henderson, J.A. et al. The Torts Process, Seventh Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, p. 305 Decision Majority opinion The court relied on foreseeability to establish whether or not a negligent defendant owed a duty of care to a bystander. The court urged a case-by-case analysis of several factors to determine if foreseeability would create a duty to a bystander: *Whether the plaintiff was near the scene of the accident, *Whether the plaintiff suffered an emotional shock from contemporaneously observing the accident, and *Whether the plaintiff is closely related to the victim Using these criteria, the court determined that it was foreseeable that the negligent operation of an automobile could cause emotional distress to a mother witnessing the injury of her child in an accident.Henderson, J.A. et al., p. 307 Traynor's dissent In his dissenting opinion, Justice Traynor asserted that the case should have been decided according to the zone of danger rule enunciated in the case Amaya v. Home Ice, Fuel & Supply Co.Dillon v. Legg, 68 Cal.2d 728, 748 (1968) Burke's dissent In dissent, Justice Burke asserted that the majority had adopted arguments that were previously rejected in Amaya. Burke criticized the guidelines offered by the majority as insufficient protection against possibly limitless liability. Burke viewed the limitations on liability inherent in the zone of danger rule as logical and necessary, and thought that such a pronounced change in liability rules should be adopted by the legislature and not the courts.Dillon, 68 Cal.2d at 749-52 References See also *Thing v.

They were responsible for the unusually good coverage that underground comix and underground papers got in the Michigan area in the early 1970s, when they could be found in most full-service newsstands there. At its height, shortly before it went bankrupt in 1980, Big Rapids was functioning as an alternative independent distributor in the central and southern Michigan areas, selling a full line of magazines and paperbacks, as well as mainstream comics.  Services  Among the periodicals distributed by Big Rapids were the Berkeley Barb, Fifth Estate, Creem, Rolling Stone, and High Times, in addition to a plethora of underground comix.  History   Origins  Big Rapids was founded as a Detroit-area cooperative circa 1970 as the Keep On Truckin' Coop. They eventually changed their name when they moved their headquarters to Big Rapids, Michigan, but retained their co-op structure. Jim Kennedy, Big Rapids' \\"first-among-equals,\\" described the company as an \\"alternative Independent Distributor.\\"  Rise to prominence  Big Rapids' entry into mainstream comics distribution came in early 1975, when Donahoe Brothers Inc. of Ann Arbor went under and Big Rapids purchased its assets. (Up to that point, Big Rapids had bought its mainstream comics from Donohoe Brothers.) Moving their headquarters back to Detroit, Big Rapids was aggressive, often taking over the businesses of customers who ran up large debts (ironic, given that their delivery vehicles carried pictures of Karl Marx on the inside doors). The 1978 lawsuit brought by East Coast distributor Irjax Enterprises ‚Äî against Sea Gate Distributors and all the major comics publishers ‚Äî opened up the distribution market, enabling Big Rapids to expand even further.Gearino, Dan.

A Tesla valve, called by Tesla a valvular conduit, is a fixed-geometry passive check valve. It allows a fluid to flow preferentially in one direction, without moving parts. The device is named after Nikola Tesla, who was awarded in 1920 for its invention. The patent application describes the invention as follows: > The interior of the conduit is provided with enlargements, recesses, > projections, baffles, or buckets which, while offering virtually no > resistance to the passage of the fluid in one direction, other than surface > friction, constitute an almost impassable barrier to its flow in the > opposite direction. Tesla illustrates this with the drawing, showing one possible construction with a series of eleven flow-control segments, although any other number of such segments could be used as desired to increase or decrease the flow regulation effect. One computational fluid dynamics simulation of Tesla valves with two and four segments showed that the flow resistance in the blocking (or reverse) direction was about 15 and 40 times greater, respectively, than the unimpeded (or forward) direction. This lends support to Tesla's patent assertion that in the valvular conduit in his diagram, a pressure ratio \\"approximating 200 can be obtained so that the device acts as a slightly leaking valve\\". The Tesla valve is used in microfluidic applications and offers advantages such as scalability, durability, and ease of fabrication in a variety of materials. Diodicity The valves are structures that have a higher pressure drop for the flow in one direction (reverse) than the other (forward). This difference in flow resistance causes a net directional flow rate in the forward direction in oscillating flows. The efficiency is often expressed in diodicity Di, being the ratio of pressure drops for identical flow rates: : Di = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Delta p_r}{\\\\Delta p_f} \\\\right)_Q, where \\\\Delta p_r is the reverse flow pressure drop, and \\\\Delta p_f the forward flow pressure drop for flow rate Q.

Early history Albert Spalding's team of All-Stars and the Chicago Club in 1888 is the first known baseball game played in New Zealand and perhaps in the Southern Hemisphere. During that tour, many New Zealand cricket players had small matches between the two touring sides. Since that time, various local competitions have existed, but it wasn't until 1989 that the New Zealand Baseball Association was formed, consisting of teams in the Auckland area. Ed Mason and Mike Reilly invited perspective players to register their interest. They then formed the New Zealand Baseball Association, with Ed Mason being President and Mike Rielly taking on the Vice President position. City Blues was the first Club under this umbrella and every year in commemoration of this, there is a \\"Ed Mason Classic\\" played. It would be 14 more years before baseball would venture out of Auckland with the creation of the Canterbury Baseball Club in 2003. 2006 saw the Northland Baseball Club and the Manawatu Baseball Club form.

Legg, the court refined the necessary elements of a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress first enunciated in Dillon into a bright-line rule:Henderson, J.A. et al. The Torts Process, Seventh Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, pp. 310-311 *The plaintiff must be closely related to the injury victim, *The plaintiff must be present at the scene at the time of the injury, and must be aware that the victim is being injured, and *The plaintiff must suffer emotional distress as a result Based on the strict formulation of the second element, the court ruled that the plaintiff could not recover because she was not present at the scene and not aware of the injury at the time of the accident.Henderson, et al. p. 312 Kaufman's concurrence Justice Kaufman's concurrence criticized both the rigid rules of the majority opinion and the flexible guidelines advocated by Justice Broussard's dissent. Kaufman bemoaned the guidelines of Dillon v. Legg as hopelessly arbitrary, and advocated a return to the zone of danger rule as enunciated in Amaya v. Home Ice, Fuel & Supply Co.Thing v. La Chusa, 48 Cal.3d 644, 676 (1989) Mosk's dissent Justice Mosk's dissent voiced substantial agreement with Broussard's dissent, but also made a point of criticizing the majority's perspective on precedent. Mosk noted that a long list of California cases, including Archibald v. Braverman, Krouse v. Graham, Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and State Rubbish Association v. Siliznoff evidenced an enduring theme of expanding tort liability for emotional distress.Thing, 48 Cal.3d at 677-80 Broussard's dissent Justice Broussard's dissent criticized the rigid rules imposed by the majority decision as arbitrary and something that can inevitably lead to under-compensation for real emotional distress injuries. Instead of bright line rules, Broussard advocated that liability be determined by the application of well developed tort principles of foreseeability and duty.Thing, 48 Cal.3d at 680-88 References External links *Text of opinion from Google Scholar Category:Negligence case law Category:1989 in United States case law Category:California state case law Category:United States tort case law Category:1989 in California ","title":"Thing v.

The attacks killed 38 and wounded at least 20. One group of militants attacked the Regional Headquarters of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), while a second group raided the Manawan Police Training School. The third team of militants attacked the Elite Police Academy.\\"Militants launch multiple attacks in Lahore, 14 dead\\" Dawn News, 15 October 2009  Background  The same Federal Investigation Agency regional headquarters was hit by a suicide car bomb in March 2008. Earlier in the day, a suicide car bomber blew himself up at a police station in Kohat. These and other events have led to Pakistan's preparation for a major operation in Waziristan.  Federal Investigation Agency: Regional Headquarters  According to Punjab Home Secretary Nadeem Hassan Asif, the Federal Investigation Agency's regional headquarters in Lahore was attacked by four individuals. Initial shots killed two attackers, including a suicide bomber. Hostages were taken, including FIA officials; the government responded with a siege lasting 90 minutes. In the end, four government employees, including three FIA agents, and a bystander were killed.  Elite Force Training Academy  The Elite Police Academy, situated at Bedian Road 5 kilometers from the Manawan Police Training School (which was also targeted) was attacked by six men in militia uniforms. Six policemen and five militants were killed. Only one militant was killed by the police; the three others were suicide bombers. The battle lasted until afternoon; in the aftermath, a family which was being held hostage was freed.  Manawan Police Training School  Four attackers were dropped off at the training center in a Suzuki van around 9:10 am local time. Two attackers shot and killed the guard at the gate, and then entered the center by scaling the main gate. The two other attackers followed, throwing grenades on their way. One went to the kitchen, another to the patients' barracks, and a third to the barber's salon. One was spotted and gunned down on the lawn. Nine policemen were killed and fifty were injured in the attack, which lasted until about 11:50 am. .  Responsibility  Many such attacks over the past year have been carried out by Taliban or Punjabi militant groups, or, as in the army headquarters attack on 10 October 2009, a combination of both. According to GEO News, the Tehrik- e-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack.  Investigations  At least 9 people having links with group behind the attack have been apprehend. A large amount of ammunitions, and maps of sensitive installations were recovered.  Pakistan reactions  *President Asif Ali Zardari said that this violence will not deter the government from eliminating the extremism. * Interior Minister Rehman Malik said, \\"The enemy has started a guerrilla war. The whole nation should be united against these handful of terrorists, and God willing we will defeat them.\\" * Punjab Provincial Law Minister Rana Sanaullah said that the police were trying to take some of the militants alive so information could be extracted from them.

With oral administration, it typically ranges anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour, depending on the drug in question. Other methods of ingestion such as smoking or injection can take as little as seconds to minutes to take effect. The determination of the onset of action, however, is not completely dependent upon route of administration. There are several other factors that determine the onset of action for a specific drug, including drug formulation, dosage, and the patient receiving the drug.  Effect of Administration Route on the Onset of Action A drug's pharmacological effects can only occur once it has been fully solubilized and has entered the blood stream. For most drugs administered orally, the drug must be ingested, pass through the stomach, and into the small intestine, where the drug molecules enter the blood stream through the villi and microvilli. Gastric emptying time can vary from 0 to 3 hours, and therefore plays a major role in onset of action for orally administered drugs. For intravenous administration, the pathway is much shorter because the drug is administered (usually already in solution) directly to the bloodstream.

In addition to having had many solo exhibitions, Roseman has produced a number of major commissioned public sculptures. In 1990, the artist was commissioned to produce a sculpture for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority‚Äôs Arts for Transit program. Under the auspices of this public/private cooperative, Harry Roseman produced a bronze sculptural relief titled ‚ÄúSubway Wall‚Äù. The piece is a depiction of a landscape integrated within the architecture of the corridor and references aspects of its ascending and descending structure, located directly under the J.P. Morgan Chase headquarters at 60 Wall Street in New York City. After four years in development, another sculpture titled ‚ÄúCurtain Wall‚Äù was installed in 2001 at the International Air Terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in NYC. The sculpture depicts cloth and curtains, suggesting wind movement, clouds, and the sky. One prominent area of Harry Roseman‚Äôs career involves photographic images later adapted as web-based projects including ‚ÄúSelf-Portraits‚Äù, ‚ÄúVisitors: a Journal‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGroups: a Web Project‚Äù. ‚ÄúVisitors: a Journal‚Äù is a visual and verbal record starting in 1971 of those who have visited where Roseman lives including friends, relatives, workers (plumbers, etc.), door-to-door solicitors (Jehovah‚Äôs witness, etc.). ‚ÄúGroups: Friends and Acquaintances‚Äù began in 1956 but did not develop into an organized project until 1985. For many years the work lacked form. When transposed to the Internet, the new form intersected with the work itself, engendering ‚ÄúGroups: Individual Pages‚Äù. The art work serves as a cultural and social document. Its patterns have been tracking the intersecting lives of some participants for as long as thirty-eight years. These web-based works consist of thousands of photographs and are contained on the artist‚Äôs website. Roseman is married to the painter Catherine Murphy.

The people in the previous hamlet had told him to keep walking until he found one. But he has been walking for hours and is starting to worry. He thinks about flagging down a car, but he has not seen one for hours. He thinks he would even flag one down going the opposite direction.

The truck driver is reluctant at first, but the two become fast friends. But then the truck breaks down again. Men on bikes arrive not to help but to pilfer the apples. The narrator tries to stop them, accusing them of robbing the driver. Instead of listening, the thieves beat him up. The driver does nothing. This happens again when more people come.

The episode includes a clash between glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) when she is named co-director of the glee club. As Sue tries to divide the club by turning the students against Will, his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) blackmails her OB/GYN into colluding with her over her fake pregnancy. The episode features covers of five songs. Studio recordings of four of the songs performed were released as singles, available for digital download, and were also included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1. \\"Throwdown\\" was watched by 7.65 million US viewers and received mixed reviews from critics. The pregnancy storyline was criticized by both Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly and Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal was unimpressed by Quinn's solo performance of The Supremes' \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\", though the group performance of \\"Keep Holding On\\" was generally better received by reviewers. Lynch as Sue in particular was widely praised, with Flandez and Zap2it's Liz Pardue both writing that Lynch gave an Emmy-worthy performance.

When cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is named co-director of the McKinley High glee club, she divides the group in two, hoping to turn the students against director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison). Sue takes the minority students--Santana (Naya Rivera), Artie (Kevin McHale), Kurt (Chris Colfer), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz), Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.), Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Matt (Dijon Talton)--for her group, leaving Will with only Finn (Cory Monteith), Rachel (Lea Michele), Quinn (Dianna Agron), Puck (Mark Salling) and Brittany (Heather Morris) in his group. Sue names her part of the club \\"Sue's Kids\\" and tries to convince them that Will is discriminating against the students by making them sing backup. Will retaliates by failing all of Sue's cheerleaders in Spanish, which only exacerbates their hostilities. Quinn and Finn go together for her ultrasound appointment, and they learn that she is expecting a girl. Finn, trying to be supportive, suggests they name the baby Drizzle, but Quinn is adamant she is having it adopted and is annoyed at his lack of understanding. Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so he can see their own baby on the ultrasound. With the help of her sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the sonogram using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant. Meanwhile, Quinn angrily confronts Rachel about her relationship with Finn and threatens her. Rachel confronts Quinn about being a spy in the glee club for Sue and tells her that she will be kicked of the Cheerios once Sue finds out about her pregnancy. School reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) uncovers news of Quinn's pregnancy. To protect Quinn and ensure Jacob will not release the story, Rachel agrees to give him her underwear. When both sections of the glee club stage a walkout in protest against Sue and Will's constant arguing, the two make amends and Sue steps down as co-director. Sue discovers the underwear in Jacob's locker and the reason for it, and makes him run the story about Quinn's pregnancy. She reveals her knowledge of the pregnancy to the club, and tells them that the whole school will soon know. Quinn breaks down in tears in the hallway, and New Directions does a performance of \\"Keep Holding On\\" to show their support for her. Production The episode was written by series creator Brad Falchuk and directed by co-creator Ryan Murphy. Recurring characters who appear in \\"Throwdown\\" are Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), Terri's sister Kendra Giardi, her OB/GYN Dr. Wu (Ken Choi), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel, and glee club members Santana Lopez, Brittany Pierce, Matt Rutherford and Mike Chang. Amy Hill guest stars as Dr. Wu's rival OB/GYN, Dr. Chin. \\"Throwdown\\" features cover versions of \\"Hate on Me\\" by Jill Scott, \\"No Air\\" by Jordin Sparks, \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\" by The Supremes, \\"Keep Holding On\\" by Avril Lavigne, and \\"Ride wit Me\\" by Nelly. Studio recordings of \\"Hate on Me\\", \\"No Air\\", \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\" and \\"Keep Holding On\\" were released as singles, available for digital download, and are also included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1. \\"No Air\\" charted at number 52 in Australia, and 65 in America and Canada, while \\"Keep Holding On\\" reached number 56 in Australia and America, and 58 in Canada. \\"Ride with Me\\" was recorded live in the episode, as, according to Shum, Jr., Murphy wanted to get the chill vibe, that spur-of-the-moment singing. Reception Dianna Agron's cover of \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\" was criticized by Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal. \\"Throwdown\\" was watched by 7.65 million US viewers and attained a 3.4/9 rating/share in the 18-49 demographic. It was the 26th most watched show of the week in Canada, with 1.4 million viewers. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.066 million viewers (1.674 million on E4, and 388,000 on E4+1), becoming the most-watched show on E4 and E4 +1 for the week, and the most- watched show on cable for the week, as well as the most-watched episode of the series at the time. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Mike Hale of the New York Times felt that \\"Throwdown\\": \\"emphasized the show's increasingly dual nature\\" whereby \\"the students are in a pretty good musical, and the adults are in a below-average dramedy.\\" Wendy Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly deemed the episode \\"welcome light relief\\", while Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"perhaps Glees sharpest episode yet\\", describing it as \\"chock-full of standout scenes\\". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 8.8/10, criticizing it for \\"overly earnest, saccharine moments\\" but commenting that it was a \\"great example\\" of Glee \\"just being damn funny\\". Lynch's performance as Sue attracted praise, with Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Liz Pardue of Zap2it both calling her portrayal Emmy-worthy. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker called her \\"the greatest Broadway-musical villain to ever co-star in a TV series\\", deeming \\"Throwdown\\" \\"possibly the best showcase yet for Jane Lynch\\", while Malcom praised the interaction between Lynch and Morrison, writing that their scenes \\"crackled with electric wit\\". The pregnancy storyline drew criticism, with Tucker opining that it \\"nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode\\" and writing: \\"there's got to be a better way to ground the series in a serious plot-line that doesn't make you wish the pregnancy plot was all just a non-musical dream sequence.\\" Malcom also criticized the storyline, asking if it could \\"please just go away already?\\" and writing that her patience with it was running out. Musical performances received mixed reviews. Flandez deemed the cover of \\"Keep Holding On\\" an \\"emotionally satisfying showstopper\\", however was critical of Quinn's cover of \\"You Keep Me Hangin On\\", which he called \\"thin and jarring\\". Mitchell enjoyed the \\"No Air\\" duet, however felt it would be nice to see characters besides Finn and Rachel take the lead on the majority of songs. Reviewing musical performances in the series so far on October 21, 2009, Denise Martin for the Los Angeles Times rated \\"Hate On Me\\" the fourth best performance to date, writing that Riley: \\"blew [her] away.\\" In December 2012, TV Guide also named the rendition one of Glee best performances, describing it as \\"a real Beyonc√© moment\\". Aly Semigran of MTV observed that Quinn spontaneously bursting into song brought Glee \\"dangerously close to High School Musical territory\\".

Plot The player is a scientific officer sent to investigate some strange phenomena. Using cartography orbs, the player must examine a variety of objects in space. Two rebound fields are located on the left and right side of the screen make certain the cartography orb is reflected back into the middle of the screen when it reaches the outermost edges of the current screen. The orbs require fuel as the player dives from the peak of orbit into the objects center-screen. The player garners points by striking an object with the orb. Pirates can steal fuel, and the player must maneuver the orb through the fueling pods to reach the service center itself. Gameplay Beyond the Black Hole is stereoscopic 3-D arcade game which comes with 3-D glasses. The player commands the \\"craft\\" through space using the keyboard, a joystick, or a mouse. The game is playable without the glasses, as the game uses motion, not color, to generate the 3-D effect. Reception Beyond the Black Hole was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #152 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Compute! was less positive, stating that the game \\"is heavy on packaging and special effects and light on gameplay\\".

Bioresource engineering is more general and encompasses a wider range of technologies and various elements such as biomass, biological waste treatment, bioenergy, biotransformations, bioresource systems analysis, bioremediation and technologies associated with Thermochemical conversion technologies such as combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, catalysis, etc. Bioresource engineering also contains biochemical conversion technologies such as aerobic methods, anaerobic digestion, microbial growth processes, enzymatic methods, and composting. Products include fibre, fuels, feedstocks, fertilisers, building materials, polymers and other industrial products, and management products e.g. modelling, systems analysis, decisions, and support systems. Bioresource engineering is a discipline that is usually very similar to environmental engineering. The impact of urbanization and increasing demand for food, water and land presents bioresource engineers with the task of bridging the gap between the biological world and traditional engineering. Agricultural and bioresource engineers attempt to develop efficient and environmentally sensitive methods of producing food, fiber, timber, bio-based products and renewable energy sources for an ever-increasing world population. Some of the research in bioresource engineering include machine vision, vehicle modification, wastewater irrigation, irrigation water management, stormwater management, inside natural environment for animals and plants, sensors, non- point source pollution and animal manure management.Goldberg, Lee. \\"Bioresources Engineering .\\" Welcome to the Department of Bioresources Engineering.

Description The Kodak Stereo Camera was a Realist Format camera released late in 1954. It used 35mm slide film to produce stereo pair images in the standard 5P Realist format. This allowed Kodak Stereo Camera owners to use most accessories and services originally designed for the Stereo Realist. It was the second best selling stereo camera of the 1950s era, eclipsed only by the Stereo Realist. Features Kodak Stereo camera from the bottom, note the manual shutter cocking lever. Kodak Stereo camera from the top Kodak Stereo camera with the back removed, showing the film chamber. Though it lacked a rangefinder the Kodak stereo camera is often considered to be easiest of the 50s stereo cameras to use. Unlike the Realist, the Kodak had a self-cocking shutter.Kodak Stereo Camera users manual, page 49 Like later model Realists it had built in double exposure prevention which could be overridden by the manual shutter cocking lever located on the bottom of the camera.Kodak Stereo Camera users manual, page 28 Releasing the shutter also released the wind mechanism, so once a picture was taken the user needed only to wind the film to be ready for the next one. The rewind knob has a crank, which most consider an improvement over the ordinary rewind knob on the Realist. The view finder lens was placed directly between the two taking lenses and placed at the same vertical level. This was made possible through the use of mirrors.Amazing 3D by Hal Morgan and Dan Symmes page 49 This made framing shots easy. A spirit level was visible in the view finder, making it easier to avoid camera tilt, one of the pitfalls of stereo photography. The film counter was the countdown type, which would be manually set when film was loaded according to how many pairs the roll could take. The number 20 was in red and there were red marks at 15 and 28, for use with standard 20 and 36 exposure rolls of film. A properly loaded 24 exposure roll of film will give 18 stereo pairs, but there is no special marking as 24 exposure rolls of film were not standard at the time the camera was produced. Opposite the counter was another manually set dial which indicated whether the cameras was loaded with \\"Daylight\\" film or \\"type A\\", though it had no film speed indicator. The shutter speed and aperture controls are located at the top of the camera. Shutter speed control is through a sliding bar which is marked B 25 50 100 and 200. The number 50 is red, the other numbers are black. The other side, next to the f stop numbers, has markings that say BRIGHT (in red), HAZY and CL'DY BRT (both black). These words have lines pointing to different f stops, depending on where the shutter speed is set. The Aperture lever has 9 positive clicks labeled 3.5, 4, (black dot), 5.6, (red dot), 8, 11, 16, 22. The red dot indicated f 6.3. These exposure suggestions are based on ASA 10 (not 100!) film which in 1954 was still the standard film for color slides just as it had been when the Realist was introduced. The recommended setting for bright sun was a shutter speed of 1/50th with an aperture of f 6.3. Focusing on the Kodak stereo camera is done by turning a dial located on the lens mount. The two dials are ganged so that they focus together and they can be focused by turning either dial. The right lens focus dial is marked with distances 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 25, 50, INF. Behind this dial is an arrow pointing at the point of focus and red marks showing the range of sharp focus for 3.5, 5.6, (red dot) and 8. The red dot corresponds to f 6.3. This is very similar to the depth of field scale on later model Realists. The left lens focus dial is marked \\"close ups\\", \\"groups\\" and \\"scenes\\". The flash connector was different from other 50s era stereo cameras; instead of the then-standard old style hot shoe (usually called an \\"accessory clip\\") it featured a bayonet type connector, which was an emerging standard in the later 50s. Unlike the hot shoe, it couldn't support a flash unit on its own. A separate L bracket was needed to physically hold the flash. File:Kodakcamsrip2.jpg|Image strip from Kodak stereo camera.

History Kodak had introduced its mounting service in 1953Amazing 3D by Hal Morgan and Dan Symmes page 45 and in the summer of 1954 began a huge advertising campaign for it. At about the same time they introduced their Kodaslide stereo viewers, but it wasn't until the end of 1954 that the Kodak stereo camera was introduced. When The Kodak stereo camera was finally released at the end of 1954 it was an instant hit. The price tag, $84.50, about half the price of a Realist, certainly helped, but so did the ease of use, especially the self-cocking shutter, rewind crank, and controls easily set from the top. When this was combined with the trusted Kodak name, it is not surprising that it was sold so well. For a while the Kodak Stereo camera was outselling the Stereo Realist and might have eclipsed the Realist in all time sales, had it been introduced sooner. But by the end of 1954 the public's fascination with stereo imaging was fading. Hollywood came out with only one 3D movie in 1955, and it was the last of the era. The stereo photography market was not hit as hard or as abruptly as some other stereoscopic industries, but the market slipped considerably after 1955, and the downward spiral continued over the next several years. The Kodak stereo camera was produced until 1959 and an estimated 100,000 were sold. Kodak continued its stereo slide processing service into the late 80s, but it may well be that over half the slides processed through it were taken with Stereo Realists, which were produced until 1971. Accessories The Kodak Stereo camera didn't have as wide a range of accessories as were offered for the Realist. Aside from the Kodaslide viewers already mentioned, Kodak also produced two flash units. There was no deluxe model as with the Realist and the design of the camera remained essentially unchanged throughout its run. Home mounting kits seemed to be against the philosophy of the Kodak stereo camera and by then third party support for stereo slide mounting and storage was pretty well established. There was no Kodak Stereo projector either. Post 1959 Kodak continued producing its Kodaslide stereo viewers for several years after it stopped producing the Kodak stereo camera. Kodak stereo camera users could continue to use the Kodak mounting service into the late 1980s. Most third party support which Realist users enjoyed, including accessories and supplies, could be used with the Kodak stereo camera. It is nearly impossible to determine which camera was used to produce a mounted stereo slide after the fact, but at least some of the stereo slides now eagerly sought by collectors were snapped with a Kodak, including many taken after 1959. Kodak has not produced a stereo camera since 1959 and it seems unlikely that any film stereo will ever again bear the Kodak name. But Kodak's involvement with stereo imaging may not yet be over. Several companies have announced digital stereo cameras which will hit the market soon. If history repeats itself Kodak will wait till another company proves the ground before introducing its own offering. This time it may even catch on and stick around a while. It may well be that the \\"Stereo Realist\\" of the 21st century will be a Kodak camera. File:Kodakmountold.jpg|Standard mount used by Kodak through 1957. Note older color scheme.

The airfield has a short grass runway, which is used primarily for light aircraft and gliders. There is a small terminal and a hangar at the facility.

It was used by dive bombers and fighter bombers, first with Henschel Hs 123s, then at the beginning of 1939, with Junkers Ju 87B \\"Stukas\\", Dornier Do 17Z light bombers and Junkers Ju 88A fighter-bombers which were assigned to combat units, being used first in the Invasion of Poland in 1939, the aircraft were then moved west prior to the Battle of France in 1940.The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 As the war progressed, Langensalza became a reserve support base. In 1944 it was used as a night interceptor fighter airfield as part of the Defense of the Reich campaign, with NJG 2, operating Ju 88C/R night fighters against RAF night bomber attacks during March-April of that year. American Army units moved into the area in early April 1945, seizing the airfield with little resistance.

Under the name Capital Comics, they also published comics from 1981 to 1984. During most of its years of operation, Capital City introduced many supply chain innovations and controlled much of the American Midwest's comics distribution market. More so than their rivals Diamond and Heroes World Distribution, Capital City supported independent publishers as much as big mainstream companies like DC Comics and Marvel Comics.MacDonald, Heidi. \\"The unbelievable world of 80s comics sales,\\" The Beat (12/01/2014). Capital City also published over 400 pages of printed material a month, including Internal Correspondence, which provided sales figures to their clients; and Advance Comics, their monthly catalog showcasing upcoming comic books, toys, and other pop-culture related items it distributed to comic book specialty shops.  Distributor   Origins  In the 1970s, Milton Griepp and John Davis were running a small Madison-based distributor called Wisconsin Independent News Distributors (WIND). Forced to sell their assets to Big Rapids Distribution, Griepp and Davis later turned the tables in 1980 when they took over much of Big Rapids' bankrupt business to form Capital City.Booker, M. Keith, editor. Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas (ABC-CLIO, 2014), p. 929. One of Capital City's first acts was to utilize the personnel of another former Big Rapids' acquisition, Well News Co. of Columbus, Ohio, to become the nucleus of an early distribution branch. In 1982, Capital City acquired the Berkeley, California-based Common Ground Distributors, which had been started by Robert Beerbohm in the late 1970s (and had been initially supplied by Big Rapids). Capital City's Wisconsin location was relatively near World Color Press's main printing plant in Sparta, Illinois. (During that period World Color printed most American comic books, including those of the two industry giants Marvel and DC.)Carlson, KC. \\"KC Column: Scaling Mount Baron,\\" Westfield Comics (Nov. 16, 2009). By 1982, Capital City operated out of a large warehouse in Madison that they shared with their largest account, mail-order retailer Westfield Comics.  1984 expansion and rise to prominence  Griepp became Capital City's CEO in 1984. That same year, with the demise of one of the larger independent publisher/distributors, Pacific Comics, Pacific's distribution centers and warehouses were purchased by Capital City and rival distributor Bud Plant Inc. Capital City also opened an expanded facility in Sparta, Illinois, in the old space of another defunct rival, Sea Gate Distributors, alongside the comic- book printing plant. By 1988, Capital City and its main surviving rival Diamond Comics Distributors had control of at least 70% of the comics distribution market between them. In 1994, Capital created controversy by announcing penalties for publishers who didn't deliver their products within promised deadlines; this move followed an industry-wide push for 30-day returnability, a practice formerly in use when comics were primarily distributed in newsstands.\\"Newswatch: Capital Announces Controversial Penalty Fees for Publishers: Move Follows Industry-wide Push for 30-day Returnability,\\" The Comics Journal #166 (February 1994), pp. 17‚Äì26.

He received the Pueblo African-American Concern Organization (PAACO) award in 1998, in recognition of help and support to the Black community, received the El Pomar Foundation Thayer Tutt Award in 1996, and received the Latin-American Education Foundation Annual Salute Award in 1995. In addition to these awards, he was also named the Greater Pueblo Chamber of Commerce Member of the Year in 1996, was named the Fiesta Day Parade Marshal in 1997, was named Latino Chamber Member of the Year in 1988, and became the United States Hispanic Chamber Government Advocate in 2007. Controversies Aguilera stirred some controversy in early 2011, when he joined conservative lawmakers across the country in giving support to an anti-union proposal in Pueblo. The measure would have weakened protections and bargaining rights for city workers. The attempt failed because it would have meant changing the city's charter. Aguilera commonly refers to himself as the \\"Mayor of Bessemer.\\" He was an opponent of two 2009 City ballot measures that would have created a strong- or weak-mayor/council form of city government.

The Interstate Bank of CIS holds 30% and SNG Holding holds 70% of shares. History Soyuzneftegaz was established in 2000. In early 2003, Soyuzneftegaz signed a contract with the Iraqi authorities for developing the Rafidein oil field in southern Iraq, with the production of 100,000 barrels per day. Soyuzneftegaz received 25.5 million barrels (4.05 million cubic metres) in the Oil-for-Food Programme, which allowed Iraq to export oil to some companies and then to resell it in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Most of the funds were reserved for humanitarian needs or infrastructure work in Iraq. After the arrival of American troops in Iraq and a sharp deterioration of the situation in the country in 2004, Russian firms and specialists were withdrawn, and all work was practically terminated. In 2004, Soyuzneftegaz held negotiations with UK and US companies regarding the possible joint development of the Rafidein oil field in southern Iraq. In 2004, Soyuzneftegaz gained control over UzPEC company, which since 2001 had a production-sharing agreement with Uzbekneftegaz for the Central Ustyurt and South-Western Gissar hydrocarbon deposits in Uzbekistan. In 2007, Uzbekneftegaz conducted the production-sharing agreement for these fields with Soyuzneftegaz Vostok, a wholly owned subsidiary of Soyuzneftegaz. In March 2008, Soyuzneftegaz Vostok was acquired by other Russian company Lukoil. The transaction cost was $580 million. In October 2004 Soyuzneftegaz won a tender in Syria for the onshore Blocks 12 and 14 near Iraqi border. In 2006, the company decided not to continue with the development of Block 14, but continued work on Block 12. In 2005, Soyuzneftegaz acquired a 50% working interest in Block 26 in the northeast of Syria through its wholly owned subsidiary SNG Overseas. On 25 December 2013, Soyuzneftegaz signed a 25-year agreement to prospect for more oil in Syria. The company stopped its operations in Syria in 2015 because of the Syrian conflict. In 2006, SNG Overseas was bought by the UK-based oil company Emerald Energy for exchange of US$7.3 million and 10% stake in Emerald Energy. In August 2009, Soyuzneftegaz sold its shares in Emerald Energy to Chinese petrochemical company Sinochem. The total deal value was estimated at $878 million. In 2013, Soyuzneftegaz agreed on a deal with Syria to jointly explore in the Mediterranean Sea, ostensibly for 25 years.
