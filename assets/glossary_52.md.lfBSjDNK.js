In nautical applications, the term is generally used with manual or visual techniques such as the use of intersecting visual or radio position lines rather than the use of more automated and accurate electronic methods such as GPS; in aviation, use of electronic navigation aids is more common. A visual fix can be made by using any sighting device with a bearing indicator. Two or more objects of known position are sighted, and the bearings recorded. Bearing lines are then plotted on a chart through the locations of the sighted items. The intersection of these lines is the current position of the vessel. Usually, a fix is where two or more position lines intersect at any given time. If three position lines can be obtained, the resulting \\"cocked hat\\", where the three lines do not intersect at the same point, but create a triangle, gives the navigator an indication of the accuracy. The most accurate fixes occur when the position lines are at right angles to each other. Fixes are a necessary part of navigation by dead reckoning because dead reckoning relies on estimates of speed and course. The fix confirms the actual position during a journey. The fix itself can introduce inaccuracies if the reference point is not correctly identified or is inaccurately measured.

He served as a minister in the Rudd and Gillard Governments. He resigned from the Senate in September 2016. He now works as a lobbyist and political commentator. Early life Conroy was born in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England, United Kingdom. His parents worked at an air force base, where his mother Jean monitored radar and his father Bill was a sergeant. In December 1973 the Conroys moved to Canberra, Australia, where he attended Daramalan College. He obtained a Bachelor of Economics at the Australian National University in Canberra. His involvement in student politics was minimal, although he helped organise a rally against student fees.Minister for the Future, smh.com.au, 12 December 2008; accessed 18 September 2014. Politics After university, Conroy worked as an advisor to Ros Kelly and Barry Jones. He moved to Melbourne to pursue a political career where he met Robert Ray, and served for a time as Superannuation Officer with the Transport Workers Union and as a City of Footscray councillor. He was appointed to the Senate in 1996 when Gareth Evans resigned to contest a seat in the Lower House. In October 1998, Conroy joined the Opposition Shadow Ministry and in 2001 became Deputy Opposition Leader in the Senate. He was Shadow Minister for Trade, Corporate Governance and Financial Services from 2003 to 2004, and became Shadow Minister for Communications and Information Technology in October 2004. Conroy is a leading member of the Labor Right and was criticised in early 2006 by members of the Labor Left and Simon Crean for working for the replacement of several long-serving MPs with new members, including Bill Shorten, Richard Marles, Mark Dreyfus, Nathan Murphy and Matt Carrick. After Simon Crean's win in the Hotham pre-selection, where Conroy supported Martin Pakula for the position, Crean attacked Conroy repeatedly, calling on him to resign his position as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. In April 2009, Conroy faced criticism after he made comments disparaging the ISP iiNet's defence in a Federal Court case against a number of film studios and Channel Seven. Opposition spokesmen described the comments as prejudicial. After iiNet won, Conroy said it was disappointing the two sides had ended up in court. In February 2010, he admitted using his influence to have a former Labor politician Mike Kaiser, take the position of Government Relations and External Affairs Executive with the National Broadband Network. Kaiser was previously forced to retire from the Labor party due to electoral fraud. Also in February 2010, he was reported to have spent some time while on holiday with Kerry Stokes weeks before cutting licence fees that are charged to free-to-air networks, including Stokes' broadcasting Seven Network. In June 2010, Conroy was criticised by SAGE-AU for \\"misinformation that verged on fear-mongering\\" when he suggested Google street view cars could have captured internet banking details in their recording of wireless network traffic, as these are generally exchanged over secure HTTPS connections. In March 2013, he introduced six media reform bills, one of which would have been the establishment of a Public Interest Media Advocate, a government organisation set up to regulate the previously self-regulated media in Australia. After announcing there would be no discussion over the bills, and that they would be passed or failed as a package, he backed down, allowing negotiation with parties who held the balance of power in the senate. The content of the bills were largely condemned by media. Ultimately, only two of the six bills passed, and at that the least controversial ones. Should he have introduced the 7 bills, the controversy may have been surpassed. =Portfolio= Conroy was Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in the First Rudd, First Gillard and Second Gillard Ministries. The NBN roll out was dogged with delay and cost blowouts in his time as minister. In that role, he was responsible for internet censorship,Conroy announces mandatory internet filters to protect children – ABC News, 31 December 2007 the National Broadband Network, and the proposed switch to digital television as a complete replacement for analogue.National Broadband Network In May 2010 he was appointed as a founding member to a new United Nations commission, the Broadband Commission for Digital Development.  Internet censorship  Conroy faced severe criticism over his Internet censorship policies from various groups. While initially promoted as a way to block child pornography, the censorship policy has been extended to include legal material traditionally refused classification by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (now known as the Australian Classification Board), including sites depicting drug use, crime, sex, cruelty, violence or \\"revolting and abhorrent phenomena\\" that \\"offend against the standards of morality\\". On 19 March 2009 it was reported that ACMA's blacklist of banned sites had been leaked online, and had been published by WikiLeaks. About half of the list was child-porn related; the remainder included sites dealing with legal porn, online gambling, euthanasia, Christianity and fringe religions; sites belonging to a tour operator, dentist and animal carers were also listed.Dentist, tuckshop cited on web blacklist, smh.com.au; accessed 18 September 2014. Conroy described the leak and publication of the blacklist as \\"grossly irresponsible\\" and that it undermined efforts to improve \\"cyber safety\\". In June 2009 he was named \\"Internet villain of the year\\" at the 11th annual Internet industry awards in the UK, for \\"individuals or organisations that have upset the Internet industry and hampered its development – those whom the industry loves to hate.\\"Conroy named Internet Villain of the Year, smh.com.au; accessed 18 September 2014. In December 2009 \\"Internet pranksters\\" registered the domain name stephenconroy.com.au which was swiftly removed by auDA raising concerns about auDA's political neutrality and the further potential for suppression of political speech after the proposed mandatory Internet filter is legislated. In May 2010, Conroy was accused of deliberately misrepresenting iiNet's position with regards to the new internet filter. His department could also not say where he obtained other figures from, such as how he believes that 85% of ISPs support the new filter. In September 2012 Conroy stated: Resignation from Parliament Stephen Conroy foreshadowed his resignation from parliament in a tabled speech on 15 September 2016; he resigned on 30 September 2016. On 25 October, a joint sitting of the Victorian Parliament appointed Kimberley Kitching as his replacement. Career after politics In December 2016 it was announced that Conroy would be head of a new industry body for the gambling industry, Responsible Wagering Australia, backed by bookmakers CrownBet, Sportsbet, Betfair, Unibet and Bet365.http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labor- powerbroker-stephen-conroy-joins-new-gambling-lobby-20161207-gt6391.html In 2017, he joined Sky News Australia as a political commentator. Personal life Senator Conroy is a Roman Catholic and socially conservative. While he voted against the abortion drug RU486 in a conscience vote, he has claimed not to have taken a conservative position on all issues: > \\"I think the point I made was that while I would prefer there to be a > parliamentary framework for the RU486, I think it was, debate, if the actual > issue was before Parliament I would probably vote for the distribution of > the pill.

Created by Peter Walsh and Natalie Jeremijenko, the original idea of showcasing both the arts (Natalie) and music (Peter) in the one event was standardised as late as October/early November from 1991 until 2003. While it has never been officially cancelled, no festivals have been held since 2003 and neither the organisers or promoters have announced any intention to restart Livid in the future. Headline artists for the festival's most recent dates included Linkin Park, The White Stripes and Yeah Yeah Yeahs in 2003, Powderfinger and Oasis in 2002, and Butthole Surfers, Billy Bragg and Ash in 2001. The festival began in 1989 with a 1500-strong audience at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. Its growing popularity saw it move to Davies Park in the Brisbane suburb of West End and later the RNA Showgrounds. Until the establishment of the Homebake festival in 1995, Livid was the only major Australian rock festival apart from the Big Day Out. In 1990, the Livid festival became the first of the recent \\"touring\\" festivals when it was held at Harold Park Paceway in Sydney's Glebe. This event was infamous for the non- appearance of Red Head King Pin, whom (it was said by the promoters) refused to come out of the toilet in his hotel to appear. An ad hoc band consisting of members of The Go-Betweens and other musicians reappeared to attempt to quell the crowd. In 2002, the festival attempted a national move and held events in Sydney and Melbourne. Despite the reasonable success of this move, Livid was now in direct competition with Sydney's Homebake festival and the nationwide Big Day Out, and citing a \\"scarcity of headline acts on this year’s international festival touring circuit\\", the event's promoters announced that the show would not he held in 2004. Livid has not been held since, despite initial promises that it would return in 2005.

In this volume, he offers droll, practical advice on how one might live (as opposed to just existing) within the confines of 24 hours a day. Philosophy In the book, Bennett addressed the large and growing number of white-collar workers that had accumulated since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. In his view, these workers put in eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, at jobs they did not enjoy, and at worst hated. They worked to make a living, but their daily existence consisted of waking up, getting ready for work, working as little as possible during the work day, going home, unwinding, going to sleep, and repeating the process the next day. In short, he didn't believe they were really living. Bennett addressed this problem by urging these \\"salarymen\\" to seize their extra time, and make the most of it to improve themselves. Extra time could be found at the beginning of the day, by waking up early, and on the ride to work, on the way home from work, in the evening hours, and especially during the weekends. During this time, he prescribed improvement measures such as reading great literature, taking an interest in the arts, reflecting on life, and learning self- discipline. Bennett wrote that time is the most precious of commodities. He said that many books have been written on how to live on a certain amount of money each day. And he added that the old adage \\"time is money\\" understates the matter, as time can often produce money, but money cannot produce more time. Time is extremely limited, and Bennett urged others to make the best of the time remaining in their lives. This book has seen increased appeal in recent years due to the explosion of the self-improvement phenomenon, and the book has much relevance in today's world.  Advice  In the book, Bennett offers the following advice: * View the 24-hour day as two separate days, one encompassing the 8-hour workday and the other a 16-hour personal day to be accounted for and utilized. * Train your mind daily to focus on a single thing continuously for an extended period, 50 minutes in his \\"average case\\" example. * Reflect on yourself. * Claim 90 minutes an evening for three evenings a week, to start with. More time can be found, but Bennett recommends starting small, instead of attempting a large enterprise and failing. * Those 90 minutes can be claimed in the evening, in the morning, on the train to and from work, or other time that isn't put to good use. He recommends evenings for most people, but it depends on your schedule. * Use that 90 minutes to improve yourself. Over the course of weeks and months, the knowledge gained in those chunks of time will add up to a significant amount. * Literature is not the only means of self-improvement. Other reading can be very beneficial, including learning more about your business, learning about the \\"causes and effects\\" of things, and learning about history and philosophy. * He doesn't recommend reading novels for self-improvement. He highly recommends poetry, especially verse novels such as Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\".  Warnings  Bennett also warns against: * Becoming a prig and insisting others follow the same improvement programme—he says that it is enough to worry about your own improvement. * Becoming a slave to your programme. You should be flexible enough to allow other things in your life. At the same time, it must be rigid enough to actually be called a programme. Finding that balance between rigidity and flexibility isn't easy, Bennett says. * Being rushed and constantly worrying about what one has to do next, which he said is like living in a prison. He says: \\"The evil springs not from persisting without elasticity in what one has attempted, but from originally attempting too much, from filling one's programme till it runs over. The only cure is to reconstitute the programme, and to attempt less.\\" * Failing at the beginning of the enterprise, which \\"may easily kill outright the newborn impulse towards a complete vitality, and therefore every precaution should be observed to avoid it. The impulse must not be over-taxed. Let the pace of the first lap be even absurdly slow, but let it be as regular as possible.\\" Chapters The book has the following chapters: * The Daily Miracle * The Desire to Exceed One's Programme * Precautions Before Beginning * The Cause of the Trouble * Tennis and the Immortal Soul * Remember Human Nature * Controlling the Mind * The Reflective Mood * Interest in the Arts * Nothing in Life is Humdrum * Serious Reading * Dangers to Avoid Quote External links  * Available for free from web-books.com *How to Live on 24 Hours a Day audiobook at Librivox.com Self-help books 1908 essays Books by Arnold Bennett ","title":"How to Live on 24 Hours a Day"},{"id":"995602","text":"Mahmoud Guinia (, and rarely or ; also spelled Gania, Guinea or Khania; 1951 – 2 August 2015) was a Moroccan Gnawa musician, singer and guembri player, who was traditionally regarded as a Maâllem (), i.e. master. He recorded for both domestic and foreign labels, and collaborated with numerous western musicians. Life Guinia was born in 1951 in the city Essaouira on the Atlantic coast. He was the second son of the master of Gnawa music, Maâllem Boubker Guinia (1927–2000) and the famous clairvoyant and \\"moqaddema\\" A'isha Qabral. His brothers Mokhtar Guinia and Abdellah Guinia are gnawa Maâllems too, and their sister Zaida is another moqqaddema. Mahmoud Guinia was married to a woman from Marrakech, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. His family of both the father's and mother's sides came from present day Mali. They were employed as soldiers in the sultan's army. They are regarded as the main representatives for the style of Essaouira, the Saouiri style. Guinia died after a lengthy illness on 2 August 2015. His sons continue the tradition both being Maâllem of the Saouiri style, notably Maallem Houssam Guinia. Works Mahmoud Guinia released numerous recordings, which have not all been well documented. In the 1970s Moroccan music label Fikriphone released records of both live Lila ceremonies and studio sessions. In the following decades it was followed by Tichkaphone, whose materials were distributed in France by Sonodisc, and Agadir's La Voix El Maarif. The most famous western release, The Trance Of Seven Colors, was co-produced by Bill Laswell and Eric Rosenzveig in 1994 and featured the American saxophone player Pharoah Sanders along with family members of Mahmoud's ensemble including his brothers Mohktar and Abdellah. The ensemble included Abdellah Ahkaraz. The Black Mluks was recorded and produced by Eric Rosenzveig in Montreal in 1992 at Radio Canada and released on P-Vine Records in Japan. Upon returning to Morocco with the master tapes, Mahmoud sold the Moroccan rights to the cassette label Le Voix El Maarif (LVEM) who released it as El Maaleem Mahmoud Gania - Soiree Au Canada. The recordings were part of the first trip Maleem Guinia and his ensemble made out of Morocco, to perform at the Festival Musiques et Traditions du Monde, the 350th Anniversary of the City of Montreal. Another release, The WELS Concert, with Peter Brötzmann and Hamid Drake, was recorded at Wels's 1996 Music Unlimited festival. The Shaman of the Sahara music recordings were released in 2001 with Maâllem Mahmoud Guinia in collaboration with Tata Guines, Victor Vidal Paz and various Indonesian musicians. In September 2017 his final studio recordings (recorded in 2013 at Plein Les Oreilles studios in Casablanca with producer Ali Faraoui) were released on double vinyl by UK record label, Hive Mind Records.

He was Speaker of the House of Commons between 1801 and 1802 and Lord Chancellor of Ireland between 1802 and 1806. Background Born in London, Mitford was the younger son of John Mitford (d. 1761) of Exbury, Hampshire, royalsociety.org Freeman-Mitford; John (1748–1830); 1st Baron Redesdale and Philadelphia, daughter of Willey Reveley of Newton Underwood, Northumberland. The historian William Mitford was his elder brother. He was educated at Cheam School and studied law at the Inner Temple from 1772, being called to the bar in 1777. Career Having become a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1777, Mitford wrote A Treatise on the Pleadings in Suits in the Court of Chancery by English Bill, a work reprinted several times in England and America. He was made a King's Counsel in 1789. In 1788, he became Member of Parliament for the borough of Bere Alston in Devon, and in 1791 he successfully introduced a bill for the relief of Roman Catholics, despite being himself a committed Anglican. In 1793 he succeeded Sir John Scott as Solicitor-General for England (receiving the customary knighthood at the same time), becoming Attorney General six years later, when he was returned to parliament as member for East Looe in Cornwall. In 1794, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In February 1801, Mitford was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons and sworn of the Privy Council. Exactly a year later, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland and raised to the peerage as Baron Redesdale, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland. Being an outspoken opponent of Catholic Emancipation, Redesdale was unpopular in Ireland. He had little support from his own colleagues: he was the subject of scurrilous attacks by \\"Juverna\\", who was later discovered to be a senior judge, Robert Johnson, who was convicted of seditious libel and forced to resign from the Bench as a result. In February 1806, Redesdale was dismissed on the formation of the Ministry of All the Talents. Although Lord Redesdale declined to return to official life, he was an active member of the House of Lords on its political and its judicial sides. In 1813, he secured the passing of acts for the relief of insolvent debtors, and became an opponent of the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts and other popular measures of reform. Family Lord Redesdale married Lady Frances Perceval, daughter of John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont, and sister of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, in 1803. He took the additional name of Freeman in 1809 by royal licence on succeeding to the estates of Thomas Edwards Freeman. Lady Redesdale died in August 1817.

It was founded in 1854. The historic campus is a national arboretum and one of the few four-year institutions in the southeastern United States founded before the American Civil War that still operates on its original campus. Wofford was founded with a bequest of $100,000 from the Rev. Benjamin Wofford (1780–1850), a Methodist minister and Spartanburg native who sought to create a college for \\"literary, classical, and scientific education in my native district of Spartanburg.\\"David Duncan Wallace, History of Wofford College (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1951) pp. 48-56 The college's Main Building is the oldest structure on campus and was designed by the noted Charleston architect Edward C. Jones.Wofford: Shining With Untarnished Honor, 1854-2004 (Spartanburg, SC: Hub City Writers Group, 2005), p. 14 In 1941, the college was awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's oldest academic honor society, and the Beta of South Carolina chapter was the first at a private college in South Carolina. Wofford's colors are old gold and black. The school mascot is the Boston Terrier. Wofford College Historic District The Wofford College Historic District consists of the Main Building, which was designed by Edward C. Jones in the Italianate style, and six two-story brick residences. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Construction of the Main Building began in 1852 and the first classes were held in the fall of 1854. During the Civil War, the endowment was invested in Confederate bonds and other securities, which became worthless by the end of the war. Academics The academic year consists of a four-month fall semester, a one-month January term called the Interim, and a four-month spring semester. =Faculty= 136 full-time faculty teach at the college, 92 percent of whom have earned a doctorate or equivalent terminal degree. The FTE faculty to student ratio is 1:11. =Majors and minors= Wofford offers academic majors in a variety of areas including 26 majors. The college also offers pre-professional programs in Teacher Education (secondary certification), Dentistry, Medicine, Law, Ministry, Engineering and Veterinary Science. The college's Army ROTC program was established in 1919.David Duncan Wallace, History of Wofford College (Vanderbilt University Press, 1951, p. 212. =International programs= The college's Office of International Programs helps students select from over 200 study abroad programs in 59 countries. Wofford consistently ranks in the nation's top ten in the Institute of International Education Open Doors Survey, which is based on a comparison of the number of students earning credits abroad in a given year to the number of students in the graduating class. Wofford's 2009 score was 93%, compared to the Lincoln Commission national average of 9% of graduates earning credits abroad. The college has had six Fulbright English Teaching assistantships in the past four years as well as two Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarships.Wofford Today, Summer 2011 In 2012, Rachel Woodlee was selected as Wofford's sixth Rhodes Scholar. Athletics Logo used to represent Wofford Athletics The Wofford Terriers compete in NCAA Division I in the Southern Conference. Wofford's colors are old gold and black. The school mascot is the Terrier. In the 2010 NCAA Division I graduation success report, 9 of 13 Wofford teams posted GRS scores of 100, the highest available mark. For the past 16 years, the Carolina Panthers have made their summer training camp home at Wofford. The Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas (a high school all-star football game) is played at Wofford's Gibbs Stadium. Boss is the mascot for Wofford Athletics. Wofford is represented by 18 men and women's varsity sports. Gibbs Stadium, opened in 1996, is the home field for Terrier football games. The baseball team plays its home games at Russell C. King Field. Men's and women's basketball and volleyball teams play in the Benjamin Johnson Arena of the Campus Life Building, opened in 1981. The inaugural men's basketball game was played in 3300-seat Jerry Richardson Indoor Stadium on 10 November 2017. Soccer teams play on Snyder Field, which was the college's football stadium through 1995. Wofford men's basketball has won the Southern Conference Championship and an NCAA bid five times since 2010, and in 2018/19 went a perfect 21-0 in Southern Conference play, and won an NCAA tournament game for the first time. Wofford football won the SoCon championship in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Student life Wofford offers a self-contained environment (93% of students live on campus). The Village apartment-style housing for the senior class was a 2008 \\"Dorm of Distinction\\" as chosen by University Business Magazine. Phase V of The Village, an $11 million project, opened in the fall of 2011. It added 80 beds in loft apartments, bringing the capacity of The Village to 428 students. It also houses The Space in the Mungo Center (formerly The Center for Professional Excellence), specialized classroom spaces, and a dining and market area called the \\"Grand Galleria.\\" =Student organizations= Students participate in a wide variety of service, pre- professional, religious, social, and other student organizations. Student publications at the college date to the first literary magazine, first published in 1889. The student newspaper, the Old Gold and Black, is published every other week, and the yearbook, The Bohemian, is published each spring. Delta Phi Alpha, the national German honorary society, was founded at Wofford, as was Beta Club, an honorary society prominent in American high schools. In 1941, the college was awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's oldest academic honor society. This was the first chapter at a private college in South Carolina. =Service learning= Wofford has a variety of student service organizations on campus, including the Bonner Scholars, Twin Towers, Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity, and ONE. Wofford was included on the 2010 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service. Washington Monthly compared 23 of 252 Top Liberal Arts Colleges contributions to the public good in three broad categories: Social Mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), Research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and Service (encouraging students to give something back to their country). In the magazine's 2010 ratings, Wofford finished 23rd among 252 Top Liberal Arts Colleges, and was number 1 in South Carolina. Newsweek identified Wofford as one of the most \\"service-minded\\" campuses in the country, ranking the college second in listings released in September 2010. Six recent Wofford graduates have been selected for the Teach For America Corps. =Student government= Student government rests in the Campus Union, with executive officers and an assembly elected by the student body. Students serve on various campus committees and represent the student body before various committees of the Board of Trustees. Student conduct is governed by the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, a document written by an Interim project in 1970-71. The code is enforced by a judicial commission consisting of elected and appointed members. An honor council enforces the student honor code in academic matters. =Fraternities and sororities= The college recognizes 14 chapters of national fraternities and sororities, with 42 percent of men and 53 percent of women participating. Fraternities include Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Kappa Alpha Order, Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Phi, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Nu, and Kappa Alpha Psi. The sororities of the National Panhellenic Council include Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, and Zeta Tau Alpha. =Diversity= In each of the years from 1901 through 1904, two women graduated from Wofford. In 1964, Wofford became the first private college in South Carolina to desegregate voluntarily with the admission of Albert Gray. In recent years Wofford has become one of the most racially and ethnically diverse colleges in the South.

A, B - Vessel's track. The path that a vessel follows over the ground is called a ground track, course made good or course over the ground. For an aircraft it is simply its track. The intended track is a route. For ships and aircraft, routes are typically straight-line segments between waypoints. A navigator determines the bearing (the compass direction from the craft's current position) of the next waypoint. Because water currents or wind can cause a craft to drift off course, a navigator sets a course to steer that compensates for drift. The helmsman or pilot points the craft on a heading that corresponds to the course to steer. If the predicted drift is correct, then the craft's track will correspond to the planned course to the next waypoint. Course directions are specified in degrees from north, either true or magnetic. In aviation, north is usually expressed as 360°. Navigators used ordinal directions, instead of compass degrees, e.g. \\"northeast\\" instead of 45° until the mid-20th century when the use of degrees became prevalent.

Frederick Street) is a major culture and shopping street in central Berlin, forming the core of the Friedrichstadt neighborhood and giving the name to Berlin Friedrichstraße station. It runs from the northern part of the old Mitte district (north of which it is called Chausseestraße) to the Hallesches Tor in the district of Kreuzberg. This downtown area is known for its posh real estate market and the campus of the Hertie School of Governance. Due to its north-southerly direction, it forms important junctions with the east-western axes, most notably with Leipziger Straße and Unter den Linden. The U6 U-Bahn line runs underneath. During the Cold War it was bisected by the Berlin Wall and was the location of Checkpoint Charlie. Overview As central Berlin's traditional shopping street, Friedrichstraße is three blocks east of the parallel Wilhelmstraße, the historic heart of the old government quarter (Regierungsviertel) until 1945. The Friedrichstraße was badly damaged during World War II and only partly rebuilt during the division of Berlin. The section in West Berlin was partly rebuilt as a residential street; in the late 1960s, the remains of the former Belle-Alliance-Platz at the end of the Friedrichstraße, renamed Mehringplatz, were completely demolished and replaced with a concrete housing and office development designed by Hans Scharoun. Despite its central location, this area remains relatively poor. In the East Berlin section, plans were put into place to widen the street to four lanes as was done to the Leipziger Straße; the Hotel Unter den Linden (demolished 2006) and the original Lindencorso (demolished 1991) were the only structures built during this time with the wider profile of the street in mind. The Grand Hotel Berlin, East Germany's top 5-star hotel, was built across from the Hotel Unter den Linden in 1987. Further plans were drawn up for a rebuilding of the street, and construction was well underway at the time of German reunification in 1990, when the East German Plattenbau-based construction was stopped and subsequently demolished; only a few buildings that were already complete and occupied were spared. The completed Berlin Casino building located at the corner of Leipziger Straße was torn down in 1994. The new Quartier 206 Friedrichstraße was rebuilt in the 1990s, and at the time it was the city's largest construction project; work continues north of Friedrichstraße station. From 1992 until 1996, construction works took place for a six-building, $800 million, multi-use complex developed by Tishman Speyer, among others.Ferdinand Protzman (February 8, 1994), Building Cranes Rule the Congested Sky of Berlin New York Times. The buildings have a city-imposed height limit of about 100 feet. A number of well-known architects contributed to the plans, including Jean Nouvel, who designed the Galeries Lafayette department store (Quartier 207); Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, who planned Quartier 206; and Oswald Mathias Ungers, who created Quartier 205.Ferdinand Protzman (February 8, 1994), Building Cranes Rule the Congested Sky of Berlin New York Times. Philip Johnson created parts of the American Business Center at Checkpoint Charlie, a $751 million five-building complex of offices, shops and apartments developed by Ronald Lauder and Central European Media Enterprises. The redevelopment received mixed reviews. During the Cold War and division of Berlin, the Friedrichstraße underground station, despite being located in East Berlin, was utilized by two intersecting West Berlin S-Bahn lines and the West Berlin subway line U6. The station served as a transfer point for these lines, and trains stopped there, although all other stations on these lines in East Berlin were sealed-off ghost stations (Geisterbahnhof), where trains passed through under guard without stopping. At Friedrichstraße station, West Berlin passengers could transfer from one platform to another but could not leave the station without the appropriate papers. The section of the station open to West Berlin lines was heavily guarded and was sealed off from the smaller part of it serving as a terminus of the East Berlin S-Bahn and as a station for long-distance trains. A View of Friedrichstraße Building on Friedrichstraße in Berlin In 2020, a section of Friedrichstraße was closed off for motorized traffic during a five-month trial period with the intent to revitalize urban space.

The hills were formed over 2 billion years ago with granite being forced to the surface, this has eroded to produce smooth \\"whaleback dwalas\\" and broken kopjes, strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation. Matopo/Matobo is a corruption of a Venda word, \\"matombo\\" which means stones in Tshivenda. It was named by the ancestors of Kalanga and Venda people who are the original natives of the land. The Hills cover an area of about 3100 km² (1200 sq mi), of which 424 km² (164 sq mi) is National Park, the remainder being largely communal land and a small proportion of commercial farmland. The park extends along the Thuli, Mtshelele, Maleme and Mpopoma river valleys. Part of the national park is set aside as a 100 km² (39 sq mi) game park, which has been stocked with game including the white rhinoceros. The highest point in the hills is the promontory named Gulati (1549 m; 5082 ft) just outside the north-eastern corner of the park. Administratively, Matobo National Park incorporates the Lake Matopos Recreational Park, being the area around Hazelside, Sandy Spruit and Lake Matopos. The national park is located within the southern Africa bushveld ecoregion. History The national park is the oldest in Zimbabwe, established in 1926 as Rhodes Matopos National Park, a bequest from Cecil Rhodes. The original park borders extended well to the south and east of the current park. These areas were redesignated for settlement as part of a compromise between the colonial authorities and the local people, creating the Khumalo and Matobo Communal Lands.Pitman, D. 1979. You must be new around here, Books of Rhodesia. The park area then increased with the acquisition of World's View and Hazelside farms to the north. The current name Matobo reflects the correct vernacular pronunciation of the area. The Matobo Hills were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003.

The granite weathers into fantastic shapes, such as the balancing rocks known as Mother and Child Kopje. Between the granite mountains, narrow valleys form. These are often swampy valleys known as dambos or vleis, due to runoff from the whaleback mountains. These valleys form the headwaters of the Maleme, Mpopoma and Mtsheleli rivers, and the source of the Thuli River is just east of the park. =Archaeological, historical and cultural Sites= Mt Effefe ca. 1900.

The grandeur and stillness of the hills has contributed to their hallowed reputation, especially to the Shona and Ndebele people. Many rituals and other religious activities are performed in the hills. Before the colonial era, it was the headquarters of the spiritualist oracle, the Mlimo. Cecil Rhodes tomb on Malindidzimu The hills were the scene of the famous indaba between white settlers and Ndebele leaders in 1896—the Second Matabele War, known in Zimbabwe as the First Chimurenga—which ended with the assassination of the Mlimo by Frederick Russell Burnham, the American scout, in one of the Matobo caves. Upon learning of the death of the Mlimo, Cecil Rhodes boldly walked alone and unarmed into this Ndebele stronghold and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms. During the indaba it was also in these hills that Robert Baden-Powell, the Founder of Scouting, first learned woodcraft, the fundamentals of scouting, from Burnham. Even today, a great deal of the pottery and artefacts found on cave floors and most of the clay grain bins in the hills are remnants from the 1896 rebellion era. There are other reminders too - bronze plaques dotted here and there in various hills mark the sites of armed forts or brief skirmishes. Shangani Patrol memorial at World's View Cecil Rhodes, Leander Starr Jameson, and several other leading early white settlers, including Allan Wilson and all the members of the Shangani Patrol killed in the First Matabele War, are buried on the summit of Malindidzimu, the 'hill of the spirits' -- this is a great source of controversy in modern Zimbabwe as this is considered a sacred place by nationalists and indigenous groups.Maylam, P. 2002.

This is a two-lane tarred road. A single lane tarred road continues to Maleme Dam and Rest Camp. The remaining roads in the park are gravel or earth, but suitable for most vehicles. However, access to Toghwana Dam during the rainy season may require four wheel drive. The park can also be reached from Gwanda: taking the Thuli- Makwe road towards Kezi and turning north on the main Kezi-Bulawayo road. =Game viewing= Some game can be seen throughout the park, with regular sightings of white rhino, sable antelope and impala. However, the best viewing is to be had in the 105 km2 Game Park, in the west of the national park. The game park, also known as Whovi or Hove Wild Area was established with animals translocated from the border areas of Hwange National Park.Davison, T. 1967. Wankie, the Story of a Great Game Reserve, Books of Africa. ASIN B0007JZPIQ It has been restocked with white and black rhinos.Rachlow, J.L., Kie, J.G. and Berger, J. 2001. Territoriality and spatial patterns of white rhinoceros in Matobo National Park, Zimbabwe. African Journal of Ecology, 37, 295 - 304 . Other animals to be seen include sable antelope, giraffe, zebra, impala, wildebeest and ostrich. On rare occasion in the late afternoon to early evening visitors, can be lucky enough to spot leopard, with many nights being disturbed by the ruckus of baboons screaming due to leopard attacks. There are two game viewing hides. A group of Boy Scouts hiking up Nyahwe mountain with Shumbashawa mountain in the background. =Hiking= With its scenery, climate and safe environment, Matobo has a number of hiking trails. Shorter hikes and walks include: * Lakeside walk, Maleme Dam, from Fish Eagle lodge * Mount Pomongwe, near Maleme Camp * Maleme Camp to Pomongwe Cave rock paintingsMatobo National Park Undated map, Zimbabwe Tourism Authority Longer hikes include: * Climbing mount Shumbashawa, near Gordon Park * Climbing Nyahwe mountain * Hike from Toghwana Dam to Inanke Cave and rock paintings. Accompanied hikes, with an armed game scout are available from Maleme Rest Camp =Running= The 33 miler road race is run annually in the park. Horse riding near Maleme Dam. =Trail riding/Horse riding= Supervised horse trails are arranged by the Parks and Wildlife staff. There are two routes: * From Maleme Camp and visiting scenic locations in the Maleme valley and environs. * From Whitewater Office into the game park for game viewing. =Fishing= The many dams in the park allow for pleasant fishing, notably for Tilapia and bass. Bass were stocked into seven of the parks dams from the research station at Maleme Dam. The park entry fee includes a fishing license. =Boating= Boating is possible on the larger dams, such as Maleme, Mtshelele, Toghwana and Lake Matopos. Privately owned boats are permitted subject to approval of the parks' officials. In popular culture A Zimbabwean cheese has been named Matopos, after the hills.Matopos Cheese Dairiboard Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd The name of the park has been used twice in films: According to director Stéphanie Machuret, the title and landscape in her 2007 film Matopos, about a traditional healer, were inspired by the park.Stéphanie Machuret Matopos International Museum of Women Matopos, listing at Internet movie database The name was also used for the fictional Democratic Republic of Matobo in the film The Interpreter.

National Gallery of Art. which had been the predominant place one stored clothes for many centuries. Details Whereas the chest of drawers in its familiar form contains three long and two short drawers, the highboy has five, six, or seven long drawers, and two short ones. It is a very late 17th-century development of the smaller chest. The early examples are walnut, but by far the largest portion of the many that have survived are mahogany, this being the wood most frequently employed in the 18th century for the construction of furniture, especially the more massive pieces. Occasionally the walnut at the beginning of the vogue was inlaid, just as satinwood varieties were inlaid, depending for relief upon carved cornice- mouldings or gadrooning, and upon handsome brass handles and escutcheons. The tallboy was the wardrobe of the 18th century, but it eventually gave place to the modern type of wardrobe, which, with its sliding doors, was speedily found to be not only capacious as its predecessor but more convenient of access. The topmost drawers of the tallboy could only be reached by the use of bed steps, and the disappearance of high beds and the consequent disuse of steps exercised a certain influence in displacing a characteristic piece of furniture which was popular for at least a century.  Philadelphia  In the mid-18th century, highboys in North America became very ornate. The most elaborate pieces came from Philadelphia.

It is most commonly caused by infection by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in a painful swollen area on the skin caused by an accumulation of pus and dead tissue. Boils which are expanded are basically pus-filled nodules. Individual boils clustered together are called carbuncles. Most human infections are caused by coagulase-positive S. aureus strains, notable for the bacteria's ability to produce coagulase, an enzyme that can clot blood. Almost any organ system can be infected by S. aureus. Signs and symptoms Boils are bumpy, red, pus-filled lumps around a hair follicle that are tender, warm, and painful. They range from pea-sized to golf ball-sized. A yellow or white point at the center of the lump can be seen when the boil is ready to drain or discharge pus. In a severe infection, an individual may experience fever, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. A recurring boil is called chronic furunculosis. Skin infections tend to be recurrent in many patients and often spread to other family members. Systemic factors that lower resistance commonly are detectable, including: diabetes, obesity, and hematologic disorders. Boils can be caused by other skin conditions that cause the person to scratch and damage the skin. Boils may appear on the buttocks or near the anus, the back, the neck, the stomach, the chest, the arms or legs, or even in the ear canal. Boils may also appear around the eye, where they are called styes. A boil on the gum is called intraoral dental sinus, or more commonly, a gumboil. =Complications= The most common complications of boils are scarring and infection or abscess of the skin, spinal cord, brain, kidneys, or other organs. Infections may also spread to the bloodstream (bacteremia) and become life-threatening. S. aureus strains first infect the skin and its structures (for example, sebaceous glands, hair follicles) or invade damaged skin (cuts, abrasions). Sometimes the infections are relatively limited (such as a stye, boil, furuncle, or carbuncle), but other times they may spread to other skin areas (causing cellulitis, folliculitis, or impetigo). Unfortunately, these bacteria can reach the bloodstream (bacteremia) and end up in many different body sites, causing infections (wound infections, abscesses, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia) that may severely harm or kill the infected person. S. aureus strains also produce enzymes and exotoxins that likely cause or increase the severity of certain diseases. Such diseases include food poisoning, septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, and scalded skin syndrome. Almost any organ system can be infected by S. aureus. Squeezing or cutting boils in the danger triangle of the face can be particularly dangerous if done outside a medical setting, as blood vessels in this area drain into the brain and can carry serious infections there. When burst, a seemingly solid, whitish colored pus initially appears then the pus and some blood follows. Causes =Bacteria= Naturally the cause is bacteria such as staphylococci that are present on the skin. Bacterial colonisation begins in the hair follicles and can cause local cellulitis and inflammation. Myiasis caused by the tumbu fly in Africa usually presents with cutaneous furuncles. Risk factors for furunculosis include bacterial carriage in the nostrils, diabetes mellitus, obesity, lymphoproliferative neoplasms, malnutrition, and use of immunosuppressive drugs. =Family history= People with recurrent boils are as well more likely to have a positive family history, take antibiotics, and to have been hospitalised, anemic, or diabetic; they are also more likely to have associated skin diseases and multiple lesions. =Other= Other causes include poor immune system function such as from HIV/AIDS, diabetes, malnutrition, or alcoholism. Poor hygiene and obesity have also been linked. It may occur following antibiotic use due to the development of resistance to the antibiotics used. An associated skin disease favors recurrence. This may be attributed to the persistent colonization of abnormal skin with S. aureus strains, such as is the case in persons with atopic dermatitis. Boils which recur under the arm, breast or in the groin area may be associated with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Diagnosis Diagnosis is made through clinical evaluation by a physician, which may include culturing of the lesion. Treatment A boil may clear up on its own without bursting, but more often it will need to be opened and drained. This will usually happen spontaneously within two weeks. Regular application of a warm moist compress, both before and after a boil opens, can help speed healing. The area must be kept clean, hands washed after touching it, and any dressings disposed of carefully, in order to avoid spreading the bacteria. A doctor may cut open or \\"lance\\" a boil to allow it to drain, but squeezing or cutting should not be attempted at home, as this may further spread the infection. Antibiotic therapy may be recommended for large or recurrent boils or those that occur in sensitive areas (such as the groin, breasts, armpits, around or in the nostrils, or in the ear). Antibiotics should not be used for longer than one month, with at least two months (preferably longer) between uses, otherwise it will lose its effectiveness.Mayo Clinic If the patient has chronic (more than two years) boils, removal by plastic surgery may be indicated. Furuncles at risk of leading to serious complications should be incised and drained if antibiotics or steroid injections are not effective. These include furuncles that are unusually large, last longer than two weeks, or occur in the middle of the face or near the spine. Fever and chills are signs of sepsis and indicate immediate treatment is needed. Staphylococcus aureus has the ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance easily, making treatment difficult. Knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus is important in the selection of antimicrobials for treatment.

It is a combination consisting of amoxicillin, a β-lactam antibiotic, and potassium clavulanate, a β-lactamase inhibitor. It is specifically used for otitis media, strep throat, pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, and animal bites. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, and allergic reactions. It also increases the risk of yeast infections, headaches, and blood clotting problems. It is not recommended in people with a history of a penicillin allergy. It is relatively safe for use during pregnancy. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 116th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than six million prescriptions. Medical uses Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is widely used to treat or prevent many infections caused by susceptible bacteria, such as: *urinary tract infections *respiratory tract infections *skin and soft tissue infections *sinus infections *tonsillitis *cat scratches *infections caused by the bacterial flora of the mouth, such as: **dental infections **infected animal bites **infected human bites (including uncomplicated \\"clenched-fist\\" or \\"reverse-bite\\" injuries) It is also used for tuberculosis that is resistant to other treatments. This combination results in an antibiotic with an increased spectrum of action and restored efficacy against amoxicillin-resistant bacteria that produce β-lactamase. Adverse effects Possible side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, thrush, and skin rash. These do not usually require medical attention. As with all antimicrobial agents, antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile infection—sometimes leading to pseudomembranous colitis—may occur during or after treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Rarely, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis, a form of liver toxicity) has been associated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and usually takes weeks to resolve. It is more frequent in men, older people, and those who have taken long courses of treatment; the estimated overall incidence is one in 100,000 exposures. In the United Kingdom, co-amoxiclav carries a warning from the Committee on Safety of Medicines to this effect. As all aminopenicillins, amoxicillin has been associated with Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, although these reactions are very rare. History British scientists working at Beecham (now part of GlaxoSmithKline), filed for US patent protection for the drug combination in 1979. They marketed it under the trade name Augmentin. A patent was granted in 1985. Preparations Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and co-amoxiclav is the British Approved Name (BAN). Many branded products indicate their strengths as the quantity of amoxicillin. Augmentin 250, for example, contains 250 mg of amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanic acid. An intravenous preparation has been available in the UK since 1985, but no parenteral preparation is available in the US; the nearest equivalent is ampicillin/sulbactam. Suspensions of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid are available for use in children. They must be refrigerated to maintain effectiveness. Veterinary use Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is used in numerous animals for a variety of conditions: * Dogs: periodontitis, kennel cough * Cats: urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections * Calves: enteritis, navel ill * Cattle: respiratory tract infections, soft tissue infections, metritis, mastitis * Pigs: respiratory tract infections, colibacillosis, mastitis, metritis, agalactia In combination with prednisolone, it is used for intramammary infusion for the treatment of mastitis in lactating cows. Trade names include Clavaseptin, Clavamox, and Synulox. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is banned from use in domestic-food animals (cattle, swine, etc.) in both the US and Europe; in the UK, Synulox can be used in domestic-food animals as long as a specified withdrawal period is observed. =Bacterial resistance= Bacterial antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in veterinary medicine. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is reported to be effective against clinical Klebsiella infections, but is not efficacious against Pseudomonas infections.Federation of Veterinarians in Europe Position Paper: \\"Antibiotic Resistance & Prudent Use of Antibiotics in Veterinary Medicine\\" References External links * Combination antibiotics Hepatotoxins GlaxoSmithKline brands Penicillins World Health Organization essential medicines Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid"},{"id":"995678","text":"Letter, letters, or literature may refer to: Characters typeface * Letter (alphabet), a written element of an alphabet * Letterform, a typographic term for alphabetical letter shapes * Rehearsal letter in an orchestral score Communication * Letter (message), a form of written communication ** Mail * Letters, the collected correspondence of a writer or historically significant person **Maktubat (disambiguation), the Arabic word for collected letters **Pauline epistles, addressed by St. Paul to various communities or congregations, such as \\"Letters to the Galatians\\" or \\"Letters to the Corinthians\\", and part of the canonical books of the Bible * The letter as a form of second-person literature; see Epistle ** Epistulae (Pliny) ** Epistolary novel, a long-form fiction composed of letters (epistles) * Open letter, a public letter as distinguished from private correspondence * Letter to the editor, a letter sent to a newspaper, magazine, or online publication by one of its readers and meant to be published * Encyclical letter in the Catholic Church *Letter (paper size), paper conventionally sized for letter- writing Education * Letters, an obsolete synecdoche for literacy; e.g. \\"He knows his letters\\" * Literature as in Letters, Arts and Sciences * Varsity letter, an award given in the U.S. for interscholastic or intercollegiate merit in a sport or other activity such as band or orchestra Music * Letters (Butch Walker album), 2004 * Letters (Jimmy Webb album), 1972 * Letters (Matt Cardle album), 2011 * \\"Letters\\" (song), by Utada Hikaru, 2002 Places * Letters, Ross-shire, a small village on the coast of Loch Broom, Scotland * Letter railway station in Germany * Letter, a townland in Kilcar, County Donegal, Ireland People * Douglas Letter, American lawyer and general counsel * Stephan Letter (born 1978), German serial killer Other uses * LETTERS, an 1979 novel by John Barth * John Letters, a Scottish manufacturer of golf clubs * Letters (sculpture), a 1915 work by Charles Keck See also * The Letter (disambiguation) * Letterer, a member of a team of comic book creators responsible for drawing the comic book's text * Letterman (disambiguation) * Lettering, and calligraphy ","title":"Letter"},{"id":"995679","text":"An autofocus (or AF) optical system uses a sensor, a control system and a motor to focus on an automatically or manually selected point or area. An electronic rangefinder has a display instead of the motor; the adjustment of the optical system has to be done manually until indication. Autofocus methods are distinguished by their type as being either active, passive or hybrid variants. Autofocus systems rely on one or more sensors to determine correct focus. Some AF systems rely on a single sensor, while others use an array of sensors. Most modern SLR cameras use through-the-lens optical sensors, with a separate sensor array providing light metering, although the latter can be programmed to prioritize its metering to the same area as one or more of the AF sensors. Through-the-lens optical autofocusing is now often speedier and more precise than can be achieved manually with an ordinary viewfinder, although more precise manual focus can be achieved with special accessories such as focusing magnifiers. Autofocus accuracy within 1/3 of the depth of field (DOF) at the widest aperture of the lens is common in professional AF SLR cameras. Most multi-sensor AF cameras allow manual selection of the active sensor, and many offer automatic selection of the sensor using algorithms which attempt to discern the location of the subject. Some AF cameras are able to detect whether the subject is moving towards or away from the camera, including speed and acceleration data, and keep focus on the subject — a function used mainly in sports and other action photography; on Canon cameras this is known as AI servo, while on Nikon cameras it is known as \\"continuous focus\\". The data collected from AF sensors is used to control an electromechanical system that adjusts the focus of the optical system. A variation of autofocus is an electronic rangefinder, a system in which focus data are provided to the operator, but adjustment of the optical system is still performed manually. The speed of the AF system is highly dependent on the widest aperture offered by the lens at the current focal length. F-stops of around 2 to 2.8 are generally considered optimal in terms of focusing speed and accuracy. Faster lenses than this (e.g.: 1.4 or 1.8) typically have very low depth of field, meaning that it takes longer to achieve correct focus, despite the increased amount of light. Most consumer camera systems will only autofocus reliably with lenses that have a widest aperture of at least 5.6, while professional models can often cope with lenses that have a widest aperture of 8, which is particularly useful for lenses used in conjunction with teleconverters. History Between 1960 and 1973, Leitz (Leica) patented an array of autofocus and corresponding sensor technologies. At photokina 1976, Leica had presented a camera based on their previous development, named Correfot, and in 1978 they displayed an SLR camera with fully operational autofocus. The first mass-produced autofocus camera was the Konica C35 AF, a simple point and shoot model released in 1977. The Polaroid SX-70 Sonar OneStep was the first autofocus single-lens reflex camera, released in 1978. The Pentax ME-F, which used focus sensors in the camera body coupled with a motorized lens, became the first autofocus 35 mm SLR in 1981. In 1983 Nikon released the F3AF, their first autofocus camera, which was based on a similar concept to the ME-F. The Minolta 7000, released in 1985, was the first SLR with an integrated autofocus system, meaning both the AF sensors and the drive motor were housed in the camera body, as well as an integrated film advance winder — which was to become the standard configuration for SLR cameras from this manufacturer, and also Nikon abandoned their F3AF system and integrated the autofocus-motor and sensors in the body. Canon, however, elected to develop their EOS system with motorised lenses instead. In 1992, Nikon changed back to lens integrated motors with their AF-I and AF-S range of lenses; today their entry-level DSLRs do not have a focus motor in the body due to a broad range of available lenses with internal focus motors. Active Active AF systems measure distance to the subject independently of the optical system, and subsequently adjust the optical system for correct focus. There are various ways to measure distance, including ultrasonic sound waves and infrared light. In the first case, sound waves are emitted from the camera, and by measuring the delay in their reflection, distance to the subject is calculated. Polaroid cameras including the Spectra and SX-70 were known for successfully applying this system. In the latter case, infrared light is usually used to triangulate the distance to the subject. Compact cameras including the Nikon 35TiQD and 28TiQD, the Canon AF35M, and the Contax T2 and T3, as well as early video cameras, used this system. A newer approach included in some consumer electronic devices, like mobile phones, is based on the time-of-flight principle, which involves shining a laser or LED light to the subject and calculating the distance based on the time it takes for the light to travel to the subject and back. This technique is sometimes called laser autofocus, and is present in many mobile phone models from several vendors. It is also present in industrial and medical devices. An exception to the two-step approach is the mechanical autofocus provided in some enlargers, which adjust the lens directly. Passive Passive AF systems determine correct focus by performing passive analysis of the image that is entering the optical system. They generally do not direct any energy, such as ultrasonic sound or infrared light waves, toward the subject. (However, an autofocus assist beam of usually infrared light is required when there is not enough light to take passive measurements.) Passive autofocusing can be achieved by phase detection or contrast measurement. =Phase detection= Phase detection: In each figure (not to scale), the area within the purple circle represents the object to be focused on, the red and green lines represent light rays passing through apertures at the opposite sides of the lens, the yellow rectangle represents sensor arrays (one for each aperture), and the graph represents the intensity profile as seen by each sensor array. Figures 1 to 4 represent conditions where the lens is focused (1) too near, (2) correctly, (3) too far and (4) much too far. The phase difference between the two profiles can be used to determine in which direction and how much to move the lens to achieve optimal focus. Phase detection (PD) is achieved by dividing the incoming light into pairs of images and comparing them. Through- the-lens secondary image registration (TTL SIR) passive phase detection is often used in film and digital SLR cameras. The system uses a beam splitter (implemented as a small semi-transparent area of the main reflex mirror, coupled with a small secondary mirror) to direct light to an AF sensor at the bottom of the camera. Two micro-lenses capture the light rays coming from the opposite sides of the lens and divert it to the AF sensor, creating a simple rangefinder with a base within the lens's diameter. The two images are then analysed for similar light intensity patterns (peaks and valleys) and the separation error is calculated in order to find whether the object is in front focus or back focus position. This gives the direction and an estimate of the required amount of focus-ring movement. PD AF in a continuously focusing mode (e.g. \\"AI Servo\\" for Canon, \\"AF-C\\" for Nikon, Pentax and Sony) is a closed- loop control process. PD AF in a focus-locking mode (e.g. \\"One-Shot\\" for Canon, \\"AF-S\\" for Nikon and Sony) is widely believed to be a \\"one measurement, one movement\\" open-loop control process, but focus is confirmed only when the AF sensor sees an in-focus subject. The only apparent differences between the two modes are that a focus-locking mode halts on focus confirmation, and a continuously focusing mode has predictive elements to work with moving targets, which suggests they are the same closed-loop process. Although AF sensors are typically one-dimensional photosensitive strips (only a few pixels high and a few dozen wide), some modern cameras (Canon EOS-1V, Canon EOS-1D, Nikon D2X) feature TTL area SIR sensors that are rectangular in shape and provide two-dimensional intensity patterns for a finer-grain analysis. Cross- type focus points have a pair of sensors oriented at 90° to one another, although one sensor typically requires a larger aperture to operate than the other. Some cameras (Minolta 7, Canon EOS-1V, 1D, 30D/40D, Sony DSLR-A700, DSLR-A850, DSLR-A900) also have a few \\"high-precision\\" focus points with an additional set of prisms and sensors; they are only active with \\"fast lenses\\" with certain geometrical apertures (typically f-number 2.8 and faster). Extended precision comes from the wider effective measurement base of the \\"range finder\\". none|thumb|320px|Phase detection system: 7 – Optical system for focus detection; 8 – Image sensor; 30 – Plane of the vicinity of the exit pupil of the optical system for photography; 31, 32 – Pair of regions; 70 – Window; 71 – Visual field mask; 72 – Condenser lens; 73, 74 – Pair of apertures; 75 – Aperture mask; 76, 77 – Pair of reconverging lenses; 80, 81 – Pair of light receiving sections =Contrast detection= Contrast-detection autofocus is achieved by measuring Contrast (vision) within a sensor field through the lens. The intensity difference between adjacent pixels of the sensor naturally increases with correct image focus. The optical system can thereby be adjusted until the maximal contrast is detected. In this method, AF does not involve actual distance measurement at all. This creates significant challenges when tracking moving subjects, since a loss of contrast gives no indication of the direction of motion towards or away from the camera. Contrast-detect autofocus is a common method in digital cameras that lack shutters and reflex mirrors. Most DSLRs use this method (or a hybrid of both contrast and phase-detection autofocus) when focusing in their live-view modes. A notable exception is Canon digital cameras with Dual Pixel CMOS AF. Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras typically used contrast-measurement autofocus, although phase detection has become the norm on most mirrorless cameras giving them significantly better AF tracking performance compared to contrast detection. Contrast detection places different constraints on lens design when compared with phase detection. While phase detection requires the lens to move its focus point quickly and directly to a new position, contrast- detection autofocus instead employs lenses that can quickly sweep through the focal range, stopping precisely at the point where maximal contrast is detected. This means that lenses designed for phase detection often perform poorly on camera bodies that use contrast detection. =Assist lamp= The assist light (also known as AF illuminator) \\"activates\\" passive autofocus systems in low-light and low-contrast situations in some cameras. The lamp projects visible or IR light onto the subject, which the camera's autofocus system uses to achieve focus. Many cameras that do not have a dedicated autofocus assist lamp instead use their built-in flash, illuminating the subject with stroboscopic bursts of light. The strobe bursts aid the autofocus system in the same fashion as a dedicated assist light, but have the disadvantage of startling or annoying living subjects. Another disadvantage is that if the camera uses flash focus assist and is set to an operation mode that overrides the flash, it may also disable the focus assist and autofocus may fail to acquire the subject. Similar stroboscopic flashing is sometimes used to reduce the red-eye effect, but this method is only intended to constrict the subject's eye pupils prior to the actual shot being taken, and thus reduce retinal reflections. In some cases, external flash guns have integrated autofocus assist lamps that replace the stroboscopic on-camera flash. Another way to assist contrast based AF systems in low light is to beam a laser pattern on to the subject. The laser method is commercially called Hologram AF Laser and was used in Sony Cybershot cameras around the year 2003, including Sony's F707, F717 and F828 models. Hybrid autofocus In a hybrid autofocus system, focus is achieved by combining two or more methods, such as: * Active and passive methods * Phase detection and contrast measurement The double effort is typically used to mutually compensate for the intrinsical weaknesses of the various methods in order to increase the overall reliability and accuracy or to speed up AF function. A rare example of an early hybrid system is the combination of an active IR or ultrasonic auto-focus system with a passive phase-detection system. An IR or ultrasonic system based on reflection will work regardless of the light conditions, but can be easily fooled by obstacles like window glasses, and the accuracy is typically restricted to a rather limited number of steps. Phase-detection autofocus \\"sees\\" through window glasses without problems and is much more accurate, but it does not work in low-light conditions or on surfaces without contrasts or with repeating patterns. A very common example of combined usage is the phase- detection auto-focus system used in single-lens reflex cameras since the 1985s. The passive phase-detection auto-focus needs some contrast to work with, making it difficult to use in low-light scenarios or on even surfaces. An AF illuminator will illuminate the scene and project contrast patterns onto even surfaces, so that phase-detection auto-focus can work under these conditions as well. A newer form of a hybrid system is the combination of passive phase-detection auto-focus and passive contrast auto-focus, sometimes assisted by active methods, as both methods need some visible contrast to work with. Under their operational conditions, phase-detection auto-focusing is very fast, since the measurement method provides both information, the amount of offset and the direction, so that the focusing motor can move the lens right into (or close to) focus without additional measurements. Additional measurements on the fly, however, can improve accuracy or help keep track of moving objects. However, the accuracy of phase-detection auto-focus depends on its effective measurement basis. If the measurement basis is large, measurements are very accurate, but can only work with lenses with a large geometrical aperture (e.g. 1:2.8 or larger). Even with high contrasty objects, phase-detection AF cannot work at all with lenses slower than its effective measurement basis. In order to work with most lenses, the effective measurement basis is typically set to between 1:5.6 and 1:6.7, so that AF continues to work with slow lenses (at least for as long as they are not stopped down). This, however, reduces the intrinsical accuracy of the autofocus system, even if fast lenses are used. Since the effective measurement basis is an optical property of the actual implementation, it cannot be changed easily. Very few cameras provide multi-PD-AF systems with several switchable measurement bases depending on the lens used in order to allow normal auto-focusing with most lenses, and more accurate focusing with fast lenses. Contrast AF does not have this inherit design limitation on accuracy as it only needs a minimal object contrast to work with. Once this is available, it can work with high accuracy regardless of the speed of a lens; in fact, for as long as this condition is met, it can even work with the lens stopped down. Also, since contrast AF continues to work in stopped-down mode rather than only in open-aperture mode, it is immune to aperture-based focus shift errors phase-detection AF systems suffer since they cannot work in stopped-down mode. Thereby, contrast AF makes arbitrary fine-focus adjustments by the user unnecessary. Also, contrast AF is immune to focusing errors due to surfaces with repeating patterns and they can work over the whole frame, not just near the center of the frame, as phase-detection AF does. The down-side, however, is that contrast AF is a closed-loop iterative process of shifting the focus back and forth in rapid succession. Compared to phase-detection AF, contrast AF is slow, since the speed of the focus iteration process is mechanically limited and this measurement method does not provide any directional information. Combining both measurement methods, the phase- detection AF can assist a contrast AF system to be fast and accurate at the same time, to compensate aperture-based focus-shift errors, and to continue to work with lenses stopped down, as, for example, in stopped-down measuring or video mode. Recent developments towards mirrorless cameras seek to integrate the phase-detection AF sensors into the image sensor itself. Typically, these phase-detection sensors are not as accurate as the more sophisticated stand- alone sensors, but since the fine focusing is now carried out through contrast focusing, the phase-detection AF sensors are only need to provide coarse directional information in order to speed up the contrast auto-focusing process. In July, 2010, Fujifilm announced a compact camera, the F300EXR, which included a hybrid autofocus system consisting of both phase-detection and contrast-based elements. The sensors implementing the phase-detection AF in this camera are integrated into the camera's Super CCD EXR.Fujifilm Launches Powerhouse 15X Long Zoom Point and shoot Digital Camera: The FinePix F300EXR, Fujifilm, USA Currently it is used by Fujifilm FinePix Series, Fujifilm X100S, Ricoh, Nikon 1 series, Canon EOS 650D/Rebel T4i and Samsung NX300. Comparison of active and passive systems Active systems will typically not focus through windows, since sound waves and infrared light are reflected by the glass. With passive systems this will generally not be a problem, unless the window is stained. Accuracy of active autofocus systems is often considerably less than that of passive systems. Active systems may also fail to focus a subject that is very close to the camera (e.g., macro photography). Passive systems may not find focus when the contrast is low, notably on large single-colored surfaces (walls, blue sky, etc.) or in low- light conditions. Passive systems are dependent on a certain degree of illumination to the subject (whether natural or otherwise), while active systems may focus correctly even in total darkness when necessary. Some cameras and external flash units have a special low-level illumination mode (usually orange/red light) which can be activated during auto-focus operation to allow the camera to focus.

This is done by using AF to detect but not set focus – using manual focus to set focus (or switching to manual after focus has been set) but then using focus priority to detect focus and only release the shutter when an object is in focus. The technique works by choosing the focus adjustment (turning AF off), then setting the shooting mode to \\"Single\\" (AF-S), or more specifically focus priority, then depressing the shutter – when the subject moves into focus, the AF detects this (though it does not change the focus), and a shot is taken.Trap Focus for Nikon Users, by Kenneth William Caleno, January 28, 2009How to shoot sport, Ken Rockwell, 2006Focus Trap or Catch In Focus, April 4, 2009 The first SLR to implement trap focusing was the Yashica 230 AF. Trap focus is also possible on some Pentax (e.g. K-x and K-5), Nikon, and Canon EOS cameras. The EOS 1D can do it using software on an attached computer, whereas cameras like the EOS 40D and 7D have a custom function (III-1 and III-4 respectively) which can stop the camera trying to focus after it fails. On EOS cameras without genuine trap focus, a hack called \\"almost trap focus\\" can be used, which achieves some of the effects of trap focus.EOS Documentation Project: Almost Trap Focus , by Julian Loke By using the custom firmware Magic Lantern, some Canon DSLRs can perform trap focus. =AI Servo= AI Servo is an autofocus mode found on Canon SLR cameras. The same principle is used by other brands such as Nikon, Sony, and Pentax, called \\"continuous focus\\" (AF-C). Also referred to as focus tracking, it is used to track a subject as it moves around the frame, or toward and away from the camera. When in use, the lens will constantly maintain its focus on the subject, hence it is commonly used for sports and action photography. AI refers to artificial intelligence: algorithms that constantly predict where a subject is about to be based on its speed and acceleration data from the autofocus sensor.  Focus motors  Modern autofocus is done through one of two mechanisms; either a motor in the camera body and gears in the lens (\\"screw drive\\") or through electronic transmission of the drive instruction through contacts in the mount plate to a motor in the lens. Lens-based motors can be of a number of different types, but are often ultrasonic motors or stepper motors. Some camera bodies, including all Canon EOS bodies and the more budget-oriented among Nikon's DX models, do not include an autofocus motor and therefore cannot autofocus with lenses that lack an inbuilt motor. Some lenses, such as Pentax' DA* designated models, although normally using an inbuilt motor, can fall back to screwdrive operation when the camera body does not support the necessary contact pins.

Character overview Wealhþēow is of the Wulfing clan,Wealhþēow is identified as a Helming in the poem, i.e. belonging to the clan of Helm, the chief of the Wulfings (Widsith, 21) Queen of the Danes. She is married to Hrōðgār, the Danish king and is the mother of sons, Hreðric and Hroðmund, and a daughter Freawaru. The meaning of her name is disputed. One possible translation is \\"foreign slave\\" (Hill, 1990). In her marriage to Hrōðgār she is described as friðusibb folcaHeaney, Seamus. Beowulf: A New Verse Translation. 136 (l. 2017), 'the kindred pledge of peace between peoples', signifying interdynastic allegiance between Wulfing and Scylding achieved with her marriage to Hrōðgār. She is both 'Lady of the Helmings' (l. 620) (by descent, of the Wulfing clan of Helm) and 'Lady of the Scyldings' (l. 1168), by marriage and maternity. Two northern sources associate the wife of Hrōðgār with England. The Skjöldunga saga, in Arngrímur Jónsson's abstract, chapter 3, tells that Hrōðgār (Roas) married the daughter of an English king. The Hrolfs saga kraka, chapter 5, tells that Hrōðgār (Hróarr) married Ögn who was the daughter of a king of Northumbria (Norðhymbraland) called Norðri. The argument was advanced in 1897 that the Wulfing name may have been synonymous with the East Anglian Wuffing dynasty, and the family name Helmingas with the place-names 'Helmingham' in Norfolk and Suffolk, both of which lie in areas of 5th–6th century migrant occupation.Gregor Sarrazin 1897, Neue Beowulf-studien, Englische Studien 23, 221–267, at p. 228-230. See also Fr. Klaeber (Ed.), Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburgh (Boston 1950), xxxiii, note 2. Although the theory was not favoured by some,e.g. G. Jones, Kings, Beasts and Heroes (Oxford 1972), 132–134. it has more recently resurfaced in a discussion of the identity of Hroðmund.S. Newton, The Origins of Beowulf and the pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia (D.S. Brewer, Woodbridge 1993), esp. p. 122-128. Role in the poem A mention of Wealhþeow in the poem Wealhþēow (like Hygd) fulfills the important role of hostess in the poem. The importance of this cup carrying practice is emphasized in lines 1161-1231. Here Wealhþēow, anxious that Hrōðgār secures the succession for her own offspring, gives a speech and recompenses Beowulf for slaying Grendel with three horses and a necklace. The necklace is called Brosinga mene, and the name is held to be either a corruption or a misspelling of OE Breosinga mene, ON Brisingamen,Old English edition edited by James Albert Harrison and Robert Sharp. Freyja's necklace. Richard North compares the gift of the necklace to Brosing, Freyja's BrisingamenRichard North, \\"The King's Soul: Danish Mythology in Beowulf\\" in the Origins of Beowulf: From Vergil to Wiglaf, (New York: Oxford University, 2006), 194 and he comments that, :The wider Old Norse-Icelandic tradition attributes the Brisinga men or giroli Brisings (Brisinger's girdle c.900) to Freya who is at once the sister of Ingvi-freyr of the vanir, the leading Norse goddess of love, and a witch with the power to revive the dead. Freya's acquisition of this necklace and its theft by Loki are the central incidents in Sorlaþattr. Helen Damico (1984/1990) further suggests that Wealhþēow and Grendel's mother each represent different aspects of a goddess from Norse mythology, possibly the myth of the Valkyries. Wealhþēow has also been examined as a representative of Hrōðgār's kingdom and prestige and a fundamental component to the functioning of his court. According to Stacy Klein, Wealhþēow wore “elaborate garb” to demonstrate the “wealth and power” of the kingdom.Klein, Stacy S. “Reading Queenship in Cynewulf’s Elene.” Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies. 33.1 (2003): 47-89. Project Muse. As queen, Wealhþēow represents the “female’s duty to maintain peace between two warring tribes” and to “signify the status of the court.”Gardner, Jennifer. The Peace Weaver: Wealhþēow in Beowulf. Diss. Western Carolina University. March 2006. While her position may appear ritualistic, she also maintains “the cohesiveness of the unity of the warriors.” The role of queens in the early Germania was to foster “social harmony through active diplomacy and conciliation.”Butler, Francis. “A Woman of Words: Pagan Ol’ga in the Mirror of Germanic Europe.” Slavic Review. 63.4 (Winter 2004): 771-793. JSTOR. Wealhþēow inhabits this role by constantly speaking to each of the men in her hall and reminding them of their obligations – obligations to their country, their family, or their king. In a grimly ironic passage that would not be lost on the Anglo-Saxon audience of BeowulfWright, David. Beowulf. Panther Books, 1970. . page 14 Wealhþēow commends her sons to Hroðulf's generosity and protection, not suspecting that he will murder her sons to claim the throne for himself. In other adaptations *1998: Wealhþēow is an important NPC in Grendel's Cave, an online, browser-based role-playing video game, based on Beowulf. Players in the game ask Wealhþēow for favors, which are essential for completing quests and winning the game. *1999: In The 13th Warrior, a loose adaptation of the legend mixed with the accounts of Ahmad ibn Fadlan, Queen Wealhþēow (here spelled \\"Weilew\\") is portrayed by Diane Venora and plays a vital part in directing the warriors to their enemy's cave. *2005: Steinunn Ólína Þorsteinsdóttir portrays Queen Wealhþēow in the film Beowulf & Grendel. *2007: Robin Wright Penn portrays Queen Wealhþēow in the Robert Zemeckis film, Beowulf. Queen Wealhþēow plays a substantial part in this adaptation. In addition to being the dutiful and well-composed queen, Wealhþēow is portrayed as a quietly unhappy wife, one who is fraught with the knowledge of her husband's unfaithfulness with Grendel's mother. She has the same experience with Beowulf after they are married, and out of disgust refuses to give either her first or second husband children. Despite that she is angry at Beowulf's unfaithfulness, she hints to having strong feelings for him. *In \\"Return of the Valkyrie\\" of the 6th season of Xena, Xena loses her memory, travels to Denmark, and marries Hrōðgār to become \\"Wealthea\\". *2016: In the TV series, Beowulf: Return to the Shieldlands, Hrothgar's wife is named Rheda, portrayed by Joanne Whalley.

Dane helped formulate the Northwest Ordinance while in Congress, and introduced an amendment to the ordinance prohibiting slavery in the Northwest Territory. During his career, he served in both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Massachusetts Senate. He also wrote a multi- volume treatise that covered the entire subject of American law, which enabled him to help fund the development of Harvard Law School. Early life and education Dane was born at Ipswich in Essex County, Massachusetts. His father Daniel Dane was a farmer, and his mother's name was Abigail. Ancestor John Dane Sr. had immigrated to Massachusetts from England (not Denmark) in 1636.Hurd, Duane. History of Essex County, Massachusetts, Volume 2, Part 1, page 1208 (1887). Dane worked on the family farm in Ipswich until he turned twenty. Moving on to college at Harvard, his major interest was in mathematics, and he graduated in 1778. Then he taught school and read for the law. In 1779 he married Mary Brown (they would have no children). Dane was admitted to the bar and set up a legal practice in Beverly in 1782. That same year, he entered elective office in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he served until 1785. Dane's hearing was poor throughout his career, and steadily got worse. Continental Congress In 1785, Dane became a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress, where he helped draft the Northwest Ordinance, which was enacted on July 13, 1787. The Ordinance encouraged American settlers into the Northwest Territory and formed the basis of the constitutions of the five states there: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Ordinance also banned slavery in the Northwest Territory. Dane's amendment banning slavery was offered at the last minute, and was quickly accepted without much discussion, to the surprise of Dane himself, who \\"had no idea the States would agree to the sixth article, prohibiting slavery....\\"Finkelman, Paul. Slavery and the Founders: Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson, page 44 (2001). In February 1787, Dane proposed a resolution authorizing the Philadelphia Convention to amend the Articles of Confederation, and that resolution was adopted.Eastman, W. Dean. “Nathan Dane” in The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law edited by Roger K. Newman, pages 147-148 (2009).Resolution of Congress of February 21, 1787, The Founders' Constitution, Volume 4, Article 7, Document 1. Out of that Philadelphia Convention came the proposed United States Constitution. But Dane had reservations about supporting its ratification. In July 1788, he finally wrote a pivotal letter of support to Melancton Smith of New York. Dane said that he feared violence and social upheaval if the Constitution were not ratified, and he supported ratification with the understanding that there would be later amendments, which eventually came to be known as the United States Bill of Rights.Wakelyn, John. Birth of the Bill of Rights: Biographies, page 58 (2004).Wakelyn, Jon. Birth of the Bill of Rights: Major Writings, Volume 2, page 151 (2004). Later career Dane was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate from 1790 to 1791 and again from 1794 to 1797. In 1794 he served on a commission that reviewed and codified the laws of Massachusetts. Later, while practicing law, he remained an active reformer, on behalf of vocational education and humane treatment of prisoners. He also helped establish the American Temperance Society to discourage use and abuse of alcoholic beverages. He was a member of the Federalist Party and its Essex Junto.Syrett, Harold. The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, v. 24, page 575, n. 7 (1976). The Massachusetts legislature appointed him as a delegate to the Hartford Convention during the War of 1812, which damaged his reputation, although Dane saw himself as a voice of moderation at the Convention and maintained that he did not have any secessionist intentions: \\"Someone must go to prevent mischief,\\" he said. Dane was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory =\\"Father of American Jurisprudence\\"= By 1820, Dane was almost totally deaf, but he continued working long hours in his library, writing two major legal treatises. The first of these was published in 1823, titled A General Abridgement and Digest of American Law. Its eight volumes were supplemented by a ninth in 1829. The Abridgment was very successful,Friedman, Lawrence. A History of American Law, page 321 (2005). and was the \\"first systematic treatise covering the entire field of American law.\\"Wiecek, William. The Lost World of Classical Legal Thought: Law and Ideology in America, 1886-1937, page 40 (2001). It became a standard work, and every lawyer of distinction bought a copy.Warren, Charles. History of the Harvard Law School and of early legal conditions in America, Volume 1, page 414 (1908). Dane used the substantial proceeds from the Abridgement to provide an endowment for a law school at Harvard University, specifying that the first Dane Professorship of Law would go to his old friend Joseph Story. For a while, Harvard Law School was called \\"Dane Law School.\\"\\"Law School Has Fine Portrait Collection”, Harvard Crimson(1930-01-23). On account of the Abridgement and his generosity to the law school at Harvard, together with his co-authorship of the Northwest Ordinance, Dane has been called the \\"Father of American Jurisprudence.\\"Chaney, Henry. “Nathan Dane”, The Green Bag, Volume 3, page 548 (1891). The Abridgment was often cited in later years; for example, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips argued against abolitionist Lysander Spooner's notion that judges have an obligation to disregard any law that the judges deem wrong, Philips citedPhillips, Wendell. Review of Spooner's Essay on the Unconstitutionality of Slavery (1847). the following legal maxim in which Dane assigned that obligation to legislators instead of judges: > Municipal or civil law ... is the rule of municipal or civil conduct, > prescribed by the superior power in the state commanding what the > legislature deems right, and prohibiting what it deems wrong.Dane, Nathan. > Abridgment, Volume 6, page 430. Dane's other treatise was titled a Moral and Political Survey of America. It has been described as \\"arguably the first broad-based national history from English and Spanish colonization through the War of Independence\\". Marker erected by the Dane County Historical Society Death and posthumous honors Dane died at home in Beverly and was buried in the Central Cemetery there. Dane Street in Beverly borders the cemetery. Dane County, Wisconsin, which was formed in 1836, was named in his honor. Within Dane County, there is a Town of Dane, and within the Town of Dane is a village called Dane, Wisconsin. In 2015 Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker and Beverly Mayor Michael P. Cahill, in accordance with the anniversary of the passage of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, declared July 13–19 \\"Nathan Dane Week\\" in the state of Massachusetts and the City of Beverly, Massachusetts.

More fairly, though, it should be known as the Burton- Humphreys process, since both men played key roles in its development. This issue was settled in court, although the decision gave primary recognition to Burton.Paul H. Giddens, Standard Oil Company (Indiana): Oil Pioneer of the Middle West,1955; pp. 167-8. The process uses the destructive distillation of crude oil heated in a still under pressure. In this revolutionary still, different products emerging from a bubble tower at different temperatures and pressures. Of critical importance, the use of these stills more than doubled the production of gasoline from most kinds of oil. The first large-scale use of these towers began with the decision by Standard Oil of Indiana to build 120 stills for an appropriation of $709,000, authorized in 1911.Giddens, op. cit. p. 149 This decision was taken just as the US Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the Standard Oil Trust. This thermal cracking process was patented on January 7, 1913 (Patent No. 1,049,667). The first thermal cracking method, the Shukhov cracking process, was invented by Vladimir Shukhov (Patent of Russian Empire No. 12926 on November 27, 1891). While the Russians contended that the Burton process was essentially a slight modification of the Shukhov process, Americans refused to concede and the Burton-Humphreys patent remained in use. Ultimately, it contributed to the development of petrochemicals.Giddens, op. cit., pp. vi-vii In 1937 the Burton process was superseded by catalytic cracking, but it is still in use today to produce diesel.

The eastern slope is generally considered to reside in the unincorporated town of Amissville, Virginia while the western slope is generally considered to be within Castleton, Virginia. The entire mountain including the summit lies within private property at an elevation of 1,162 ft (354.2 m).

It is a unit of the Robertson River Igneous Suite and is located within the Blue Ridge anticlinorium. This volcanic formation was a result of crustal extensional rifting of the eastern Laurentian margin of the supercontinent Rodinia. This was the beginning of a chain of events that ultimately gave birth to the precursor Atlantic, the Iapetus Ocean at 550 Ma during the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition.

Fe). =Paleaogeographic reconstruction= A unique geological feature of Battle Mountain is that the western slope outcrops are composed entirely of alkalai feldspar granite, while the eastern slope up to and including the summit is entirely rhyolitic. This provides strong evidence of a theorized lateral explosive eruption event centered on the eastern slope at approximately 704 Ma as proposed by Woolman (2016). Further mathematical geology evidence which supports this theory includes a paleaogeographic reconstruction of the mountain by Woolman utilizing artificial neural networks and Markov chain geostatistical models including period climate condition- based soil erosion rates, Kirkby's hillslope movement evolution equations and recursive biogeochemical soil erosion rates in felsic granitic conditions. The result was the digital reconstruction image shown on the left, indicating what Battle Mountain may have looked like 704 million years ago on the western slope.

White quartz boulders and smaller fragments are common on and around Battle Mountain, a result of molten silica that was contained in the rhyolite lava and granitic magma that formed the volcano. As quartz is extremely hard relative to feldspar granite and rhyolite, it tends to remain present on the surface while the softer granite it was embedded in wears away into the soil. Access The nearest unincorporated town is Amissville, Virginia at approximately 4 miles away. Access to the mountain and the summit must be negotiated with local landowners first as the mountain, including all portions of the July 1863 battlefield exists entirely on private property. Agriculture The various slopes of Battle Mountain are in either commercial timber (primarily mixed hardwoods), cattle pasture (western slope) or crops (corn, hay and pumpkins as of 2019). Battle Mountain Farm, which comprises the majority of the eastern slope of Battle Mountain is a mixed hardwood timber and small-scale commercial pumpkin grower, specializing in large jack-o- lantern pumpkins. Their pumpkins are grown without herbicides or pesticides in multiple commercial-scale 60-foot by 5-foot ecologically sustainable raised beds (no soil tilling required) using locally produced natural fertilizers. The beds also utilize water-conserving polymer mulch and irrigation drip lines attached to on-site wells approximately 300 feet deep, providing mineral-rich water from volcanic aquifers. The well water pressure is provided by a 19 kilowatt grid-tied solar panel array on the farm, with lead-acid battery backup.

Etymology and origins of the character A number of origins have been proposed for the name Beowulf. =Beowulf= Henry Sweet, a philologist and linguist specializing in Germanic languages, proposed that the name Bēowulf literally means in Old English \\"bee-wolf\\" or \\"bee-hunter\\" and that it is a kenning for \\"bear\\".Sweet, Henry. (1884) Anglo-Saxon Reader in Prose and Verse The Clarendon Press, p. 202. Recorded instances of similar names mirror this etymology. The AD 1031 Liber Vitae records the name Biuuuwulf. The name is attested to a monk from Durham and literally means bee wolf in the Old Northumbrian dialect.Chadwick, Hector Munro (1983) The Origin of the English Nation, p. 294. The 11th century English Domesday Book contains a recorded instance of the name Beulf. The scholar suggested that the name Beowulf derived from a mistranslation of Böðvarr with -varr interpreted as vargr meaning \\"wolf\\". The Relation of the Hrolfs Saga Kraka and the Bjarkarimur to Beowulf by Olson, 1916, at Project Gutenberg. However, Sophus Bugge questioned this etymology, and instead suggested that the personage Böðvarr Bjarki derived from Beowulf. =Beow-Wolf= In 2005, Andy Orchard theorized an etymology on the basis of the common Old Norse name Þórólfr (which literally translates to \\"Thor Wolf\\"), stating in parallel that a \\"more likely\\" meaning for the name would be the \\"wolf\\" of the Germanic god Beow.Orchard, Andy. (2003) A Critical Companion to Beowulf =Biewolf= English philologist Walter William Skeat proposed an etymological origin in a term for \\"Woodpecker\\" citing the Old Dutch term biewolf for the bird. Skeat states that the black woodpecker is common in Norway and Sweden and further reasons that the \\"indominatable nature\\" and that the \\"bird fights to the death\\" could have potentially influenced the choice of the name.Skaet, Walter William. (1877) \\"The Name Beowulf\\" from The Academy 24 February 1877, p. 163. This etymological origin has been criticized as not being in accordance to Grimm's law and Skeat may have recanted the proposal at a later date.Shippey, Tom A. Beowulf: The Critical Heritage pp. 387–88. =Beado-Wulf (war wolf)= The editors of Bosworth's monumental dictionary of Anglo-Saxon propose that Beowulf is a variant of beado-wulf meaning \\"war wolf\\" and that it is cognate with the Icelandic Bodulfr which also means \\"war wolf\\".The Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, the posthumous dictionary by Joseph Bosworth (1898), see beorne – Beó-wulf. =Beowulf before Beowulf= Scholars have long debated the origins of the character Beowulf. Some have argued that Beowulf existed in heroic- legendary tradition prior to the composition of Beowulf, while others have believed that the Beowulf poet invented his Geatish protagonist. Leonard Neidorf has argued that Beowulf was present in (now lost) heroic-legendary cycles before Beowulf was composed. Neidorf argued that the seventh-century usage of the name ‘Biuuulf’ (Beowulf), which involves an element (Beow) that was unproductive in contemporary name-giving, suggests that legends of Beowulf existed well before the composition of our extant poem.Neidorf, Leonard. \\"Beowulf before Beowulf: Anglo-Saxon Anthroponymy and Heroic Legend.\\" Review of English Studies 64 (2013): 553–73 Beowulf manuscript =Origins in Geatland= As told in the surviving epic poem, Beowulf was the son of Ecgtheow, a warrior of the Swedish Wægmundings. Ecgþeow had slain Heaðolaf, a man from another clan (named the Wulfings) (according to Scandinavian sources, they were the ruling dynasty of the Geatish petty kingdom of Östergötland). Apparently, because the victim was from a prominent family, the weregild was set too high, and so Ecgþeow was banished and had to seek refuge among the Danes. The Danish king Hroðgar generously paid the weregild, and had Ecgþeow swear an oath. Ecgþeow was in the service of the Geatish king Hreðel, whose daughter he married. They had Beowulf, who grew up with the Geats. Beowulf's childhood friend was Breca the Bronding \\"supposed to be the inhabitants of the island Brännö, lying off the coast of West Gothland in the Cattegat\\".The Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, the posthumous dictionary by Joseph Bosworth (1898), see bróc – brot. This would be a realistic location for a childhood friend of Beowulf, and the poem describes a swimming contest between them. =Zealand and Grendel= When King Hroðgar, his wife Wealhþeow, and his court were terrorized by the monstrous Grendel, Beowulf left Geatland (West Götaland) and sailed to Zealand with fourteen warriors in order to pay his father's debt. During the night, Grendel arrived to attack the sleeping men and devoured one of the other Geats before seizing Beowulf. As no manmade weapon could harm Grendel, Beowulf fought back with his bare hands and tore off the beast's arm. Grendel fled back to the bog to die from his wound, and his arm was attached to the wall of Heorot. The next day, Beowulf was lauded and a skald (scop) sang and compared Beowulf with the hero Sigmund. However, during the following night Grendel's mother arrived to avenge her son's death and collect weregild. As Beowulf slept in a different building he could not stop her. He resolved to descend into the bog in order to kill her. They fought beside Grendel's corpse, and Beowulf finally won with the aid of an enchanted giant sword stolen from the lair's plundered wooden box. =Return to Geatland, kingdom, and death= Having returned to Geatland, Beowulf took part in a historic raid against the Franks with his king Higlac. Higlac died during the raid, and Beowulf swam home in full armour. Back in Geatland, queen Hygd offered Beowulf the throne but Beowulf declined in favour of the young prince Heardred. However, Heardred received two Swedish princes, Eadgils and Eanmund who reported that they had fled their uncle Onela who had usurped the Swedish throne. This led to a Swedish invasion in which Heardred was killed. Beowulf was proclaimed king and decided to avenge Heardred and to help Eadgils become king of Sweden. The event when Onela was slain was probably a historic event. Even though it is only briefly mentioned in Beowulf, it occurs extensively in several Scandinavian sources where it is called the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. For example, Snorri Sturluson wrote: > Onela rode Raven, as they rode to the ice, but a second one, a grey one, > hastened, wounded by spears, eastwards under Eadgils. [...] In this fight > Onela died and a great many of his people. Then king Eadgils took from him > his helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven. (Although, in Snorri's text the names are in their corresponding Old Norse forms). Beowulf ruled the Geats for 50 years, until his realm was terrorized by a fire-breathing dragon after a thief stole a golden cup from its hoard of treasure. After unsuccessfully attacking the dragon with his thegns, Beowulf decided to pursue the monster into its lair at Earnanæs, but only his young Swedish relative Wiglaf dared join him. Beowulf's sword broke; but he dealt the dragon its death-blow with his dagger. He had been mortally wounded by the dragon's poisonous bite. Dying, he was carried out by Wiglaf, and with his last breaths named Wiglaf his rightful heir. His body was burned on a funeral pyre, and his ashes buried in a barrow by the sea. The last three lines of the poem are, in Seamus Heaney's translation: :They [the Geats] said that of all the kings upon the earth, :he was the man most gracious and fair-minded, :kindest to his people and keenest to win fame. The statement is clear, except for the final word, lof-geornest ('keenest to seek fame'), which is two-edged. It is no shame for a hero to seek fame, but it may be possible to be too eager for it.

It lies on the A518, approximately halfway between the towns of Newport (in Shropshire) and the county town of Staffordshire, Stafford. Gnosall Heath lies immediately south-west of the main village, joined by Station Road and separated by Doley Brook. Other nearby villages include Woodseaves, Knightley, Cowley, Ranton, Church Eaton, Bromstead Heath, Moreton and Haughton.  History  The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book, in which it was named Geneshale. It is listed there as having a population of 12 households. The Stafford to Shrewsbury railway line once ran through the village. Gnosall's railway station opened on and closed on . The line was built by the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, which also managed the Shropshire Union Canal which runs through the village. A footpath, the Way for the Millennium, now follows its route. St. Lawrence's Church Landmarks of interest include: *St. Lawrence's Church, which dates from Norman times and stands over the site of an earlier Saxon church. *Coton Mill, where local rumours suggest self-raising flour was invented (despite strong evidence it was created in 1845, by Henry Jones, a baker in Bristol.) *The lock-up, originally built on Station Road some time after , when its construction was scheduled, and moved to its current site on Sellman Street in . There are also several old, privately owned, buildings such as the Duke's Head on the High Street that was previously a public house. With a thatched roof, and herring- bone brick pattern between faded, unpainted wooden beams, it may be suggested that it forms one of the most picturesque scenes in the village. A new primary school opened in 2016 replacing the building constructed as Heronbrook School. This building was unusual in that it was designed to appear attractive from the railway line passing behind it rather than from the front.  Amenities  Gnosall is fairly self-contained in terms of shops and amenities, with its own fire station, supermarket, doctor's surgery, two dental practices, petrol station, sports club, take-aways, five pubs and historic high street. Gnosall Heath has two canalside pubs, The Boat and The Navigation. The Royal Oak is situated on the main A518. In Gnosall village centre may be found The Horns and George and the Dragon, the latter a micropub which opened in 2015. The Sports Club is situated in extensive grounds off the 1970s Brookhouse Estate. Many of the village's ancient traditions are still honoured today, notably the carnival, where children dress up in themed costumes, and a parade complete with custom made floats and a brass band that runs to the St Lawrence School field from the Royal Oak. A large health centre was completed in 2006 at the opposite end of Gnosall from the old doctor's surgery which was situated by the fire station; tribute to the rapid increase in population of recent years. The village has a community first responder group, a charity consisting of trained local people who provide emergency cover on behalf of West Midlands Ambulance Service in response to 999 calls and administer basic life support, oxygen therapy, defibrillation and first aid whilst an ambulance is en route. The village's newspaper; \\"GPN\\" (Gnosall Parish News), is produced and sold in the village, and serves as a local advertiser of services and events, as well as publishing articles of interest to the local community. Despite there being controversy over the legality, fishing is popular and fruitful on the canal.  Notable people  * The Rev.

It originated from the OSType or ResType metadata system used in classic Mac OS and was adopted for the Amiga/Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and derivatives. The idea was later reused to identify compressed data types in QuickTime and DirectShow. History In 1984, the earliest version of a Macintosh OS, System 1, was released. It used the single-level Macintosh File System with metadata fields including file types, creator (application) information, and forks to store additional resources. All these fields are four-character codes known as OSType. It was possible to change this information without changing the data itself, so that they could be interpreted differently. Identical codes were used throughout the system, as type tags for all kinds of data. In 1985, Electronic Arts introduced the Interchange File Format (IFF) meta-format (family of file formats), originally devised for use on the Amiga. These files consisted of a sequence of \\"chunks\\", which could contain arbitrary data, each chunk prefixed by a four-byte ID. The IFF specification explicitly mentions that the origins of the FourCC idea lie with Apple. This IFF was adopted by a number of developers including Apple for AIFF files and Microsoft for RIFF files (which were used as the basis for the AVI and WAV file format). Apple referred to many of these codes as OSTypes. Microsoft and Windows developers refer to their four-byte identifiers as FourCCs or Four-Character Codes. FourCC codes were also adopted by Microsoft to identify data formats used in DirectX, specifically within DirectShow and DirectX Graphics. = In Apple systems = Since Mac OS X Panther, OSType signatures are one of several sources that may be examined to determine a Uniform Type Identifier and are no longer used as the primary data type signature. Mac OS X (macOS) prefers the more colloquial convention of labelling file types using file name extensions. At the time of the change, the change was a source of great contention among older users, who believed that Apple was reverting to a more primitive way that misplaces metadata in the filename. Filesystem-associated type codes are not readily accessible for users to manipulate, although they can be viewed and changed with certain software, most notably the macOS command line tools GetFileInfo and SetFile which are installed as part of the developer tools into /Developer/Tools, or the ResEdit utility available for older Macs.  Technical details  The byte sequence is usually restricted to ASCII printable characters, with space characters reserved for padding shorter sequences. Case sensitivity is preserved, unlike in file extensions. FourCCs are sometimes encoded in hexadecimal (e.g., \\"0x31637661\\" for 'avc1') and sometimes encoded in a human-readable way (e.g., \\"mp4a\\"). Some FourCCs however, do contain non-printable characters, and are not human-readable without special formatting for display; for example, 10bit Y'CbCr 4:2:2 video can have a FourCC of ('Y', '3', 10, 10) which ffmpeg displays as \`rawvideo (Y3[10] [10] / 0x0A0A3359), yuv422p10le\`. Four-byte identifiers are useful because they can be made up of four human-readable characters with mnemonic qualities, while still fitting in the four-byte memory space typically allocated for integers in 32-bit systems (although endian issues may make them less readable). Thus, the codes can be used efficiently in program code as integers, as well as giving cues in binary data streams when inspected. = Compiler support = FourCC is written in big endian relative to the underlying ASCII character sequence, so that it appears in the correct byte order when read as a string. Many C compilers, including GCC, define a multi- character literal behavior of right-aligning to the least significant byte, so that becomes \`0x31323334\` in ASCII. This is the conventional way of writing FourCC codes used by Mac OS programmers for OSType. (Classic Mac OS was exclusively big-endian.) On little-endian machines, a byte-swap on the value is required to make the result correct. Taking the avc1 example from above: although the literal already converts to the integer value , a little-endian machine would have reverse the byte order and stored the value as . To yield the correct byte sequence , the pre-swapped value is used. Common uses One of the most well-known uses of FourCCs is to identify the video codec or video coding format in AVI files. Common identifiers include DIVX, XVID, and H264. For audio coding formats, AVI and WAV files use a two-byte identifier, usually written in hexadecimal (such as 0055 for MP3). In QuickTime files, these two- byte identifiers are prefixed with the letters \\"ms\\" to form a four-character code. RealMedia files also use four-character codes, however, the actual codes used differ from those found in AVI or QuickTime files. Other file formats that make important use of the four-byte ID concept are the Standard MIDI File (SMF) format, the PNG image file format, the 3DS (3D Studio Max) mesh file format and the ICC profile format. Other uses for OSTypes include: * as Gestalt selector codes * as record field IDs and event type and class IDs in AppleEvents * for identifying components in the Component Manager * as “atom” IDs in the QuickTime movie and image file formats * as a localization- independent way of identifying standard folders in the Folder Manager * in QuickDraw GX, they were used as gxTag types and also as types of collection items in the Collection Manager. * as error codes in certain libraries, such as QuickTime See also *Filename extension (also known as \\"file extension\\") *Interchange File Format *Magic number *OSType ** creator code ** type code References =General references= *Official Registration Authority for the ISOBMFF family of standards   Apple Inc. software Apple Inc. file systems Mac OS Metadata Four character code ","title":"FourCC"},{"id":"995745","text":"Frederick Anthony \\"Freddie\\" Jackson (born October 2, 1956) is an American Grammy-nominated singer. Originally from New York, Jackson began his professional music career in the late 1970s with the California funk band Mystic Merlin. Among his well–known R&B;/Soul hits are \\"Rock Me Tonight (For Old Times Sake)\\" (1985), \\"Have You Ever Loved Somebody\\" (1986), \\"Jam Tonight\\" (1986), \\"Do Me Again\\" (1990), and \\"You Are My Lady\\" (1985). He contributed to the soundtrack for the 1989 film, All Dogs Go to Heaven with the Michael Lloyd-produced duet \\"Love Survives\\" alongside Irene Cara. Biography =1956–1980: early life and education, Mystic Merlin= Born in Harlem section of New York City, Jackson was trained as a gospel singer from an early age, singing at the White Rock Baptist Church of Harlem. There he met Paul Laurence, who would later become his record producer and songwriting partner. After completing school, Jackson joined Laurence's group LJE (Laurence Jones Ensemble) and played the New York nightclub scene. During the late 1970s, Jackson moved to the West Coast and sang lead with the band Mystic Merlin (with whom he released three studio albums, 1980-1982), but soon returned to New York to work with Laurence at the Hush Productions company. =1981–2013: solo career= Jackson sang on demo recordings of Laurence's compositions, and also served as a backing singer for Melba Moore after she saw his nightclub act in 1981. In 1984, Jackson landed a recording contract with Capitol Records, and released his debut album, Rock Me Tonight in 1985. The Laurence- penned title track stormed the R&B; charts, spending six weeks at number one, and made Jackson an instant hit on urban contemporary radio. \\"You Are My Lady\\" gave him a second straight R&B; chart-topper, and also proved to be his highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #12. With \\"He'll Never Love You (Like I Do)\\" and \\"Love Is Just a Touch Away\\" also hitting the R&B; Top Ten, Rock Me Tonight topped the R&B; album chart and went platinum. Jackson issued the follow-up Just Like the First Time 1986, on the heels of a number one R&B; duet with Melba Moore, \\"A Little Bit More\\" (from her album A Lot of Love). Another platinum seller, Just Like the First Time continued Jackson's dominance of the R&B; singles charts; \\"Tasty Love,\\" \\"Have You Ever Loved Somebody,\\" and \\"Jam Tonight\\" all hit #1, while \\"I Don't Want to Lose Your Love\\" went to #2. The pace of Jackson's success slowed with the 1988 release of Don't Let Love Slip Away, which nonetheless featured another two R&B; chart-toppers in \\"Hey Lover\\" and \\"Nice 'N' Slow.\\" The title track of 1990's Do Me Again and \\"Love Me Down\\" duplicated that feat, and \\"Main Course\\" just missed, topping out at #2. Even so, Jackson's earlier placings in the lower reaches of the Billboard Hot 100 had long since disappeared, and some critics charged that his albums were growing too similar to one another. Jackson appeared as a lounge singer on the 1989 The Golden Girls episode \\"Two Rode Together\\" and sang the Disney song \\"It's a Small World\\" to Sophia. Also in 1989, Jackson sung the duet \\"Love Survives\\" with Irene Cara for the soundtrack to the film All Dogs Go to Heaven. Seeking a new beginning, Jackson parted ways with Capitol/EMI in late 1993, and signed with RCA/BMG Records. His label debut, Here It Is, appeared the following year, with diminished commercial returns. Following a Christmas album, Jackson split with RCA and recorded Private Party for the smaller Street Life imprint of Scotti Brothers Records in 1995. Several years of silence ensued, until Orpheus issued Life After 30 in late 1999; the equally low-key release Live in Concert followed in 2000. After returning to the charts with It's Your Move in February 2004 (Martland Entertainment), Jackson released his tenth studio album, Transitions, in September 2006 on the record label Orpheus Music. At the end of 2010, Jackson released a new album on the Entertainment One Music label, entitled For You, and produced by hit songwriter Barry Eastmond. The album featured the single \\"I Don't Wanna Go\\". =2014–present: later career= On August 26, 2014, Jackson released the single \\"Love & Satisfaction,\\" written by Dustin \\"Dab\\" Bowie, Gregory Bowman, Kameron Corvet, Bertram Ford Jr, and Selasi \\"The African Kid,\\" and released by the entertainment company Climax Entertainment. The single received some positive reviews and airplay, and allowed Jackson to reintroduce himself as he toured internationally in support of the release, as well as appear with artists Jeffrey Osborne, Peabo Bryson, Melba Moore, and Stephanie Mills at various performances and festivals. In late 2016, Jackson announced that he was recording a new album and that a new single would be released early the following year to mark his true return to recording studio and on May 1, 2017, the lead single \\"One Night\\" from his forthcoming album Love Signals was released via Climax and reached #1 on the internet radio Indie Soul chart associated with the Internet Broadcasters Alliance on June 12, 2017, while reaching in the top 50 of independent R&B;, smooth jazz, and soul charts around the US and Europe. In January 2018, Jackson appeared on the cover of STS Entertainment and Fashion Magazine. He performed in Albany, GA on April 21, 2018, at a Soul Music festival along with the 69 boys and various other performers. In August 2019, it was announced that Jackson would perform later that month as the headlining act of the 37th annual African World Festival, hosted by the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. In 2019, Jackson released the single \\"A Million Ways\\". A fiction piece in the November 25, 2019 issue of The New Yorker, by John Edgar Wideman, titled Arizona, is written as a letter to Jackson. Controversy In August 1988, the British music magazine NME, reported that Jackson had verbally attacked George Michael in the Los Angeles Times over his black music chart success.

John Thomas Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale (1805 - 2 May 1886) was a Protestant controversialist, and member of the House of Lords. Life He was born in Dublin on 9 September 1805, the son of John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale. He was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford (BA 1825, MA 1828, DCL 1853). On the death of his father in 1830, he succeeded as second baron, but took little part in the debates of the House of Lords until 1837, when he began to interest himself in the wording and detail of parliamentary bills. Wellington recommended him to study the private business of the house, so as to qualify himself for the chairmanship of committees, and on the resignation of the Earl of Shaftesbury, 4 February 1851, Redesdale was unanimously chosen his successor, with the approval of Lansdowne, Stanley, and Wellington. This appointment he held with general credit until his death, and though assiduous in presiding when bills were in committee, made his power chiefly felt over private bill legislation. His shrewdness and independence of judgment enabled him to detect the artifices of attorneys and agents, while his dictatorial manner was proverbial. Though he regarded all things, great and small, with a genuine conservatism, yet he never allowed his peculiar views to warp his decisions. Redesdale was especially severe on the drafting of railway bills, and in 1867 threatened to hale a contractor named France to the bar of the house for expressions reflecting on him as chairman. The correspondence showed that he was acting under a misapprehension. Nevertheless, his firm and honest management increased the authority of the House of Lords in connection with private business. Redesdale was also a frequent speaker on general topics, e.g. the Reform Bill of 1867, when he opposed Earl Grey's amendment for the disfranchisement of certain boroughs, on the ground that the matter was beyond the proper jurisdiction of the peers, and that it was a mistake to make the franchise a party question. On the Alabama Claims, he maintained in 1872 that the United States had no claims to compensation because the Southerners had reentered the Union at the close of the war.  Controversialist But his interests lay chiefly in religious topics, on which he assumed a pronouncedly Protestant and orthodox attitude. He published in 1849 some 'Reflections on the Doctrine of Regeneration and its Connection with both Sacraments, and in 1850 some 'Observations on the Gorham Judgment and its Consequences.' In 1853 he was one of the revivers of convocation. He refused to sign the report of the royal commission on the law of divorce, of which he was a member, on the ground that the dissolution of the marriage tie was contrary to Scripture, and besides vindicating his views in a pamphlet entitled 'The Law of Scripture against Divorce' (1856), offered vigorous opposition to the measure of the following year. Equally outspoken was his resistance to the disestablishment of the Irish church, which he maintained to be a violation of the coronation oath. On 17 July 1868, he moved for a copy of the oath, besides publishing two pamphlets, 'Some of the Arguments by which Mr. Gladstone's Resolutions are supported considered' (1868), and 'Lord Macaulay on the Coronation Oath' (1869). In 1874, appeared 'Reasoning on some Points of Doctrine,' and in 1875 Redesdale entered into a controversy with Cardinal Manning in the 'Daily Telegraph' on the subject of communion in both kinds. The correspondence was republished by the 'Press and St. James's Chronicle,' under the title of 'The Infallible Church and the Holy Communion.' Redesdale displayed considerable ingenuity in forcing the cardinal to base his arguments on authorities whose cogency he had denied, but, as might be expected from the predispositions of the dialecticians, the dispute led to no practical result. On 3 January 1877, he was created Earl of Redesdale, in the County of Northumberland. on Benjamin Disraeli's recommendation. On 14 June, he called attention in the House of Lords to a manual entitled 'The Priest in Absolution,' published privately for the use of the clergy by the Society of the Holy Cross, and elicited a strong condemnation of its doctrines from Archbishop Archibald Tait. In the same year also appeared his 'Apostolic Doctrine of the Real Presence,' and in 1879 'On the Doctrine of the Real Presence; Correspondence between the Earl of Redesdale and the Hon. C. L. Wood, a discussion evoked by a speech of the latter at a meeting of the university branch of the English Church Union. Redesdale also published 'Thoughts on English Prosody and Translations from Horace,' and 'Further Thoughts on English Prosody' (1859), odd attempts, suggested by an article in the ' Quarterly Review,' vol. cxiv., on 'Horace and his Translators,' to formulate rules of quantity for the English language on Latin models. His last pamphlet was 'The Earldom of Mar: a Letter to the Lord Register of Scotland, the Earl of Glasgow,' a reply to the Earl of Crawford's criticisms on Glasgow's judgment. He died unmarried 2 May 1886, when the peerages became extinct. The earl bequeathed his estates to his kinsman, Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford, for whom the barony of Redesdale was re- created in 1902.

Nicknamed \\"Barty\\", he was the paternal grandfather of the Mitford sisters. Early years Freeman-Mitford was the son of Henry Reveley Mitford (1804–1883) of Exbury House, Exbury, Hampshire, and the great-grandson of the historian William Mitford, and was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. While his paternal ancestors were landed gentry, whose holdings had once included Mitford Castle in Northumberland, his mother (Georgiana) Jemima was a daughter of the courtier the 3rd Earl of Ashburnham, with a noble ancestry through the earls of Beverley. His parents separated in 1840 when Redesdale was just three years old, and his mother remarried a Mr. Molyneaux. Like his cousin Swinburne, he was named Algernon after his great-grandfather Algernon Percy, 1st Earl of Beverley. Career =Diplomacy= Entering the Foreign Office in 1858, Mitford was appointed Third Secretary of the British Embassy in St Petersburg. After service in the Diplomatic Corps in Shanghai, he went to Japan as second secretary to the British Legation at the time of the migration of the Japanese Seat of Power from Kyoto to Edo (modern-day Tokyo), known as the \\"Meiji Restoration\\". Mitford's memoirs recount the troubled time of the foreign settlements at Kobe over the fortnight following American Rear- Admiral Henry Bell's death, and the death of British consul Francis Gerard Mijburgh. Rededale served as secretary under Myburgh's replacement, John Frederik Lowder. There he met Ernest Satow and wrote Tales of Old Japan (1871), a book credited with making such Japanese Classics as \\"The Forty-seven Ronin\\" first known to a wide Western public. He resigned from the diplomatic service in 1873. Following the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance, in 1906 he accompanied Prince Arthur on a visit to Japan to present the Emperor Meiji with the Order of the Garter. He was asked by courtiers there about Japanese ceremonies that had disappeared since 1868. He had persuaded Edward VII to plant Japanese knotweed at Sandringham House and it later became difficult to eradicate, according to George VI. =Public life= From 1874 to 1886, Mitford acted as secretary to HM Office of Works, involved in the lengthy restoration of the Tower of London and in landscaping parts of Hyde Park such as \\"The Dell\\". From 1887, he was a member of the Royal Commission on Civil Services. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Stratford-on-Avon between 1892 and 1895. According to W. S. Gilbert, Mitford served as a consultant on Japanese culture to Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan during the development of their 1885 Savoy Opera The Mikado. A traditional Japanese song hummed by Mitford to Gilbert and Sullivan during a rehearsal was used in the opera for the march accompanying the Mikado's entrance. In 1886, Mitford inherited the substantial country estates of his first cousin twice removed, John Freeman- Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale. In accordance with the will he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Freeman. Appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Gloucestershire, he became a magistrate and took up farming and horse breeding. He was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron from 1889 to 1914.Cortazzi H., \\"Mitford's Japan: memories and recollections, 1866–1906\\" p.xxiii Redesdale joined the Royal Photographic Society in 1907 and became a Fellow in 1908.Obituary.

It was bought by Lord Dulverton and is still owned by his descendants. Peerage In the 1902 Coronation Honours list it was announced that he would receive a barony, and the Redesdale title was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Redesdale, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland, on 15 July 1902. He took the oath and his seat in the House of Lords a week later, on 24 July. Pre- and extra-marital fatherhood During his time in Japan, he was said to have fathered two children with a geisha. Later, he was considered to be one of the possible fathers of Clementine Hozier (1885–1977), in the course of an affair with his wife's sister Blanche.Joan Hardwick; Clementine Churchill: The Private Life of a Public Person John Murray, London (1997). Clementine married Winston Churchill in 1908. H. S. Chamberlain In his closing years, Lord Redesdale edited and wrote extensive and effusive introductions for two of Houston Stewart Chamberlain's books, Foundations of the Nineteenth Century and Immanuel Kant: A Study and Comparison with Goethe, Leonardo da Vinci, Bruno, Plato, and Descartes, both two volumes each, translated into English by John Lees, M.A., D.Litt., and published by John Lane at the Bodley Head, London, in 1910 and 1914 respectively.

It is the principal route for entering and leaving Portsmouth. It continues as the A3 into Portsmouth, and meets the M27 at its northern terminus. From the motorway, there are scenic views over Portsmouth harbour, and the Sails of the South between the two carriageways. The M275 is one of few motorways in England which is not the responsibility of Highways England. It is managed by Portsmouth City Council from the point where the slip roads to the M27 end. The M275 was not built with a full hard shoulder. For its entire length, a narrow verge is maintained, although there is space available for a full width shoulder. Instead, drivers are warned on entry from the A3 and M27 of the lack of hard shoulder, with signs saying \\"no hard shoulder for 2 miles\\". History The M275 nearing Portsmouth The motorway was opened throughout its entire length in 1976. A junction was originally planned for a new development in the Tipner area of Portsmouth, known as the Gateway Project,Portsmouth City Council Page which was shelved at the time. The junction's construction was abandoned primarily because planners realised that it would breach regulations that there must be a minimum of between motorway junctions. Before construction was halted, significant work had been carried out, including four incomplete slip roads with no road surfacing, two bridges above the site for the main roundabout, and realignment of Tipner Lane so that it served the roundabout. In 2001 the Sails of the South was unveiled close to the site of the missing junction. 2005 saw Portsmouth City Council carry out refurbishments to gantry mounted signs on approach to the M27 junction, new signage was stuck over old signage, and was significantly smaller and disproportionate to the previous layout. Incorrect lane illustrations, lack of adequate route information, and increased difficulty to read at a long distance lead to driver frustration and confusion. In 2005, the Tipner Gateway Project was resurrected along with plans for a junction. As previously, preparatory works have been carried out for the junction. Due to the regulations regarding junction spacing, the speed limit on the main carriageway of the M275 has been reduced to , and on the slip roads and from the southern end of Mile End Road to the Kingston Crescent Junction. The latter junction was to be renamed Junction 2, with the new Tipner Junction becoming Junction 1. Most of the road signs have been replaced and the M27/M275 interchange has been remodelled to make it easier for drivers, including splitting one lane into two, although this has meant that some of the overhead gantry signs are now redundant. Completion of the junction was achieved April 2014. The junction now leads to Tipner West. A large park and ride site for over 600 cars is alongside the junction.

Early life =Early years= Born in Hamedan in 1892, Fazlollah Zahedi was the son of Abol Hassan \\"Bassir Diwan\\" Zahedi, a wealthy land owner at the city of Hamedan. During his service at the Imperial Russian-trained Iranian Cossack Brigade, one of his military superiors was Reza Khan, who later became the Iranian monarch. Zahedi was among the officers dispatched to Gilan to put an end to the Jangal movement of Mirza Kuchak Khan. At the age of 23, as a company commander, Zahedi led troops into battle against rebel tribesmen in the northern provinces.Kinzer, Stephen, All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003 p.142 Two years later Reza Shah promoted him to the rank of brigadier general. Zahedi is a distant relative of the Mohammad Mossadegh. He was also involved in the overthrow of Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee's government in 1920. It was Colonel Zahedi who arrested Sheikh Khaz'al Khan and brought him to Tehran. During Reza Shah's reign, General Zahedi was named (1926) military governor of Khuzestan province, his first important government position, and in 1932 chief of national police, one of the nation's top internal posts. During World War II he was appointed (1941) commanding general of the Isfahan Division. Arrest and internment Following the forced abdication of Reza Shah in 1941, the British came to believe that Zahedi was planning a general uprising in cooperation with German forces, and as one of the worst grain-hoarders, was responsible for widespread popular discontent.Maclean, Fitzroy. Eastern Approaches. 1949. Jonathan Cape, London. No ISBN. He was arrested in his own office by Fitzroy Maclean, who details the adventure in his 1949 memoir Eastern Approaches. On searching Zahidi's bedroom Maclean found \\"a collection of automatic weapons of German manufacture, a good deal of silk underwear, some opium, an illustrated register of the prostitutes of Isfahan,\\" and correspondence from a local German agent. Zahedi was flown out of the country and interned in Palestine. =Return from Internment= Returned from internment in Palestine in 1945, during the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah (Reza Shah's son and successor), General Zahedi became Inspector of military forces in southern Iran. He became once more chief of national police (Shahrbani) in 1949, when Mohammad Reza Shah appointed him as chief of the Shahrbani Police Forces, in order to counter the growing threat of Sepahbod Haj Ali Razmara. After 1945 =The 1950s= After retiring from the army, he was named Senator in 1950. Zahedi was appointed Minister of the Interior (1951) in Hossein Alas administration, a post he would retain when Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh became Prime Minister. Zahedi actively supported the new government's nationalisation of the oil industry, which had previously been owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP.Kinzer, Stephen, All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.195-196 However, he was at odds with Mossadegh over his increasing tolerance for the outlawed communist party Tudeh, which had boldly demonstrated in favor of nationalisation. Both of these moves antagonised the Western Powers, especially the United Kingdom and the United States. Zahedi was dismissed by Prime Minister Mossadegh after a bloody crackdown on pro-nationalization protesters in mid-1951 in which 20 people were killed and 2000 wounded.Kinzer, Stephen, All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.102 Zahedi finally broke with Mossadegh, with the latter accusing him of fostering plans for a coup. Meanwhile, sanctions levied by the Western Powers significantly curtailed Iranian oil exports, leading to an economic crisis. Disorder among several ethnic groups in southern Iran and labor unrest among oil-field workers put further pressures on the government. =1953 Coup= At the behest of the British and American governments, the Iranian military carried out a coup d'état which put an end to Mossadeq's rule and the era of constitutional monarchy and replaced it by direct rule of the Shah. The newly formed CIA, along with the British intelligence agency MI6, took an active role in the developments, terming their involvement Operation Ajax. Zahedi and his followers, financed by the foreign intelligence services, planted newspaper articles in Iranian publications and paid agent provocateurs to start riots. There were such riots in Tehran and other cities. Fearing his arrest, Zahedi went into hiding. On 15 August, after the first attempted coup d'état failed, the Shah fled first to Baghdad and then to Rome, Italy, after signing two decrees, one dismissing Mossadegh and the other naming Zahedi to replace him as Prime Minister. Both decrees were in accordance with clause 46 of the Iranian constitution, which stated that the Shah had the power to appoint all Ministers. Backed by the United Kingdom and the United States, and encouraged by the intelligence agents Kermit Roosevelt Jr and Donald Wilber, Zahedi staged a second coup on 19 August 1953. Military units arrested Mossadeq at his home at night. The Shah returned from exile on 22 August 1953.Kinzer, Stephen, All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003 =Final years= General Zahedi's role as Iran's Prime Minister ended in 1955. His final post was Ambassador to the United Nations, in Geneva, where he died in 1963. Family Zahedi's Family Zahedi was a descendant of the Sufi mystics Sheikh Zahed Gilani and Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili, the eponym of the Safavid Dynasty, and through his mother, Djavaher Khanom, he traced his descent to the dynastic ruler Karim Khan Zand. Zahedi married Khadijeh Pirnia, daughter of Hossein Pirnia (titled Motamen-ol-Molk), and granddaughter to Mozzafar-al-Din Shah Qajar (1853–1907). They had a son, Ardeshir, and a daughter, Homa. His son Ardeshir became a politician and diplomat and married Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi, the daughter of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from his first marriage to Princess Fawzia of Egypt, daughter of King Fuad I. His daughter Homa Zahedi was a member of Parliament, representing the constituency of the region of Hamadan. According to The New York Times report a day after the 1953 coup, \\"General Zahedi has been married twice, but it is not known here whether his second wife is living. By his second wife he had two sons, one of whom lives in Sydney, Australia, while the second son, an air force officer, was killed in a crash.\\" See also *Pahlavi Dynasty *List of Prime Ministers of Iran *Monarchism in Iran *1953 Iranian coup d'état *Mohammad Mosaddegh References =Citations= =Bibliography= * 'Alí Rizā Awsatí (عليرضا اوسطى), Iran in the past three centuries (Irān dar Se Qarn-e Goz̲ashteh - ايران در سه قرن گذشته), Volumes 1 and 2 (Paktāb Publishing - انتشارات پاکتاب, Tehran, Iran, 2003).

At , it is the third- largest national park in Zimbabwe, and also one of the least known because of its isolated situation on the Zambezi Escarpment. It has good wildlife populations and some majestic scenery. The name of the park comes from the Batonga word chijalila, which translates into English as \\"great barrier\\", referring to Zambezi Escarpment, of which Chizarira’s rough terrain forms a part. The northern portion of the park is situated within the Southern miombo woodlands ecoregion, while the southern part is located within the Zambezian and mopane woodlands ecoregion. The escarpment falls steeply some to the Zambezi River valley floor and offers magnificent views towards Lake Kariba, north. Rivers such as the Mcheni and Lwizikululu have cut almost sheer gorges in the escarpment. At the north eastern extremity of the park lies Tundazi, a mountain on which, according to local legend, resides an immense serpent, the river god Nyaminyami. The southern boundary is marked by the Busi River which is flanked by floodplains supporting winter thorn Faidherbia albida woodlands. Chizarira is Zimbabwe's 3rd largest national park, with a hugh population of four of the Big Five animals with the rhinos missing . The terrain is excellent for leopard, and there is a good variety of herbivore. Its main attraction is its enormous wilderness appeal. Walking safaris are a big part of the experience. Arguably Zimbabwe’s third largest National Park and indisputably the most remote wilderness area, Chizarira national park derives its name from the Batonga word “Chijalila” which means “The Great Barrier”, an orientation of phenomenal mountains and copious hills that form a fabulous portion of the Zambezi Escarpment. The terrain in the park is craggy, punctuated with ragged mountains, intensely incised by gorgeous gorges and awesome gulches. In the intensely impenetrable valleys, sandwiched by the unique open plain rests the lush vegetation comfortably suckled by vibrant natural springs. This has made the park an amazing place to appreciate nature. Chizarira National Park, plays host to most of the expected plains wildlife as well as megafauna such as African elephant, lion, leopard and Cape buffalo. There are also many species of smaller wildlife, including the klipspringer, known for its ability to thrive in near-vertical rocky outcrops. Chizarira has a large variety of bird life and hundreds of species have been sighted within the Park. Sought after birds recorded include the African broadbill, Livingstone's flycatcher, western nicator, African emerald cuckoo and the rare and elusive African pitta. Chizarira is also home to the Taita falcon which breeds within the Park. Chizarira was declared as a non-hunting reserve in 1938 and as a game reserve in 1963; it was given National Park status under the Parks and Wild Life Act (1975). The park has its headquarters at Manzituba. This remoteness and the few visitors has meant that Chizarira has experienced increased risk from poachers in recent years. The lack of lodges and safari operators in the park has meant that poachers have free rein and the park has suffered as a result, particularly during the economic crisis that engulfed Zimbabwe in the early 2000s.

Construction began in 1973 and it opened in 1975.The Motorway Archive – M27 Dates Page It provides part of the route to Southampton Docks from the M27, which in turn makes up another part of the route to the docks from the nearby M3 Motorway. Route The motorway begins at Redbridge near Totton at a grade separated roundabout with the A35, heading north, briefly as a dual 3 lane motorway. At its first junction, it reduces to 2 lanes and continues east of Hillyfields. After a further it reaches a junction with the M27 at a signal controlled roundabout. North of the M27 it enters the countryside and terminates after a further of dual 2 lane road at another roundabout, this time with the A3057 near Upton. The route has several features that are inconsistent with UK motorway standards, including a sharp bend at its southern terminus, and an at-grade roundabout at its junction with the M27. Hampshire County Council's LTTP to 2026 (Long Term Transport Plan) identifies the need for an 'M271 Spur' at the southern end to connect it to the A33 towards the docks in a free-flow interchange.

Their two double bonds are conjugated (i.e., separated by a single bond). CLAs can be either cis-fats or trans-fats. CLA is marketed as a dietary supplement on the basis of its supposed health benefits. History The biological activity of CLA was noted by researchers in 1979 who found it to inhibit chemically-induced cancer in mice and research on its biological activity has continued. In 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration categorized CLA as generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Biochemistry Most studies of CLAs have used a mixture of isomers wherein the isomers c9,t11-CLA (rumenic acid) and t10,c12-CLA were the most abundant. More recent studies using individual isomers indicate that the two isomers have very different health effects. Conjugated linoleic acid is both a trans fatty acid and a cis fatty acid. The cis bond causes a lower melting point and, ostensibly, also the observed beneficial health effects. Unlike other trans fatty acids, it may have beneficial effects on human health. CLA is conjugated, and in the United States, trans linkages in a conjugated system are not counted as trans fats for the purposes of nutritional regulations and labeling. CLA and some trans isomers of oleic acid are produced by microorganisms in the rumens of ruminants. Non-ruminants, including humans, produce certain isomers of CLA from trans isomers of oleic acid, such as vaccenic acid, which is converted to CLA by delta-9-desaturase. In healthy humans, CLA and the related conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA) isomers are bioconverted from linoleic acid and alpha- linolenic acid, respectively, mainly by Bifidobacterium bacteria strains inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract. However, this bioconversion may not occur at any significant level in those with a digestive disease, gluten sensitivity, or dysbiosis. Health CLA is marketed in dietary supplement form for its supposed anti-cancer benefit (for which there is some evidence, but no known mechanism, and very few studies conducted so far) and as a bodybuilding aid. A 2004 review of the evidence said that while CLA seemed to benefit non-human animals, there was a lack of good evidence of human health benefits, despite the many claims made for it. Likewise, there is insufficient evidence that CLA has a useful benefit for overweight or obese people as it has no long-term effect on body composition. Although CLA has shown an effect on insulin response in diabetic rats, there is no evidence of this effect in humans. A 2017 study found CLA supplementation has been associated with increased plasma C-reactive protein concentrations and a reduction in serum adiponectin concentrations, which indicates that CLA supplements have a pro- inflammatory effect. Dietary sources Food products from grass-fed ruminants (e.g. mutton and beef) are good sources of CLA and contain much more of it than those from grain-fed animals. Eggs from chickens that have been fed CLA are also rich in CLA, and CLA in egg yolks has been shown to survive the temperatures encountered during frying. Some mushrooms, such as Agaricus bisporus and Agaricus subrufescens, are rare non-animal sources of CLA.

The Grand Slam was a larger version of the Tallboy bomb and closer to the size that its inventor, Barnes Wallis, had envisaged when he developed the idea of an earthquake bomb. Medium Capacity (M.C.) bombs were designed to remedy the shortcomings of General Purpose (G.P.) bombs, with a greater blast and casings which were robust enough to confer a considerable capacity to penetrate, especially Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs. The Grand Slam case was made of a chrome-molybdenum alloy steel and had a charge-to-weight ratio of nearly fifty per cent. It was also known as Ten Ton Tess because of its weight. Development =Medium Capacity bombs= Medium Capacity (M.C.) bombs were designed to address the shortcomings of General Purpose (G.P.) bombs, which had a charge-to-weight ratio of about 27 per cent (contemporary German bombs had a ratio of fifty per cent). M.C. bombs were to have a charge-to-weight ratio of at least forty per cent and use explosives of greater power, although shortages led often to inferior explosive types being used. High Capacity (H.C.) bombs had a charge-to-weight ratio of up to 75 per cent. M.C. bombs had greater blast effect than G.P. bombs but had casings which were robust enough to confer a considerable capacity to penetrate. =Grand Slam= On 18 July 1943, work started on a larger version of the Tallboy bomb, which became the Grand Slam. As with the earlier Tallboy, the fins of the Grand Slam generated a stabilising spin. The bomb had a thicker case than a G.P. bomb, which allowed deeper penetration and the Grand Slam had a charge-to-weight ratio of nearly fifty per cent. The Grand Slam was so heavy that in the air, the wing tips of the Lancaster bent upwards by until the bomb was released; the aircraft then leapt . After release, the Grand Slam would reach a near- supersonic speed of and would penetrate deep underground before detonating. The explosion could form a camouflet (cavern) and shift the ground, undermining the foundations of the target. The first Grand Slam was tested at the Ashley Range in the New Forest, on 13 March 1945 and left a hole deep with a diameter of . The first successful Grand Slam operation was flown the next day. =Tactics= A modified Avro Lancaster B.Mk 1 (Special) bomber was designed for the Grand Slam, equipped with Merlin 24 engines, minus front and mid-upper turrets and the crew reduced to five; the bomb bay doors were removed and a stronger undercarriage installed. Like the Tallboy, after hot molten Torpex was poured into the casing, the explosive took a month to cool and set. Aircrews were told to land with an unused bomb on board rather than jettison them into the sea if a sortie was aborted. The commander of 617 Squadron, John \\"Johnny\\" Fauquier gave orders that if returning with a bomb, an aircraft would divert from RAF Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, and use the longer runway at RAF Carnaby near the coast at Bridlington in East Yorkshire. Grand Slam operations, 1945 =Bielefeld, 14 March= By mid-March 1945, over had been dropped on the Bielefeld viaduct in 54 attacks and damage from 17 hits in one raid was repaired in 24 hours. After abortive attempts on 9 and 13 March, on the next day, fifteen Lancasters of 617 Squadron carrying 14 Tallboys and a Grand Slam fuzed for an 11-second delay, returned. A Mosquito of 627 Squadron was present to film the attack along with four Oboe Mosquitoes of 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group to mark the target, escorted by eight squadrons of P-51 Mustangs. The cloud base was at and the air was quite hazy; at the viaduct, cloud cover at the north end precluded a north-to-south bombing run. The Lancaster carrying the Grand Slam, flown by Squadron Leader C. C. Calder, made a run from the south and dropped the Grand Slam bomb from , a height far from ideal, at . The Lancaster rose suddenly as the bomb left the aircraft. The pilot of the filming aircraft, which recorded the attack from called that the bomb had destroyed the viaduct. The effect of the Grand Slam could not be distinguished from the eleven Tallboys but photographic reconnaissance later showed that of the north viaduct and of the south viaduct had been demolished. =Arnsberg, 15 and 19 March= On 15 March, in poor weather, two aircraft of 617 Squadron carried Grand Slams with 14 Lancasters of 9 Squadron carrying Tallboys to attack the railway viaduct at Arnsberg. The -long viaduct, built from brick and stone faced with concrete, crossed the Ruhr in five spans. A Grand Slam was dropped from at on the fourth attempt and the second bomb was brought home because of cloud cover. Ten Tallboys were also dropped with no effect and no aircraft were lost. On 19 March, 19 Lancasters of 617 Squadron, six with Grand Slams and 13 with Tallboys, attacked the viaduct again. A photographic aircraft from the Australian 463 Squadron filmed the Grand Slams falling and showed one hitting the west end of the viaduct. A Grand Slam hit the side of the bridge and two dropped slightly short of the aiming point, one Lancaster tried to bomb twice but the release mechanism failed. Two spans of a length of about were brought down into the water and the embankment was destroyed for about and the rail lines severely damaged; after the war one Grand Slam casing was found at the site, thought to have landed flat on the road, only the filling at the rear of the casing having exploded. The crews had been briefed to avoid a hospital near the viaduct and managed to do so. =Arbergen, 21 March= Twenty Lancasters of 617 Squadron, two carrying Grand Slams and the rest Tallboys, flew in clear weather to Bremen to attack a railway bridge which crossed the Weser near Nienburg. The first Grand Slam was dropped from , landing short and the second fell off target to the north, due to (anti-aircraft fire) and aiming problems. The Tallboys hit the middle of the bridge and the ends were blown off their piers, the pier to the east collapsed onto the ground and the western pier was twisted and sagged to the ground at one place; part of the railway track, above the embankment and the first pier on the west side, was wrecked. One Lancaster was shot down near Okel and left a crater deep; five Lancasters were damaged by and an attack by a Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter. =Nienburg, 22 March= Twenty Lancasters of 617 Squadron, six carrying Grand Slams fuzed for 25–30 seconds' delay and 14 carried Tallboys with one-hour delay fuzes, attacked the railway bridge at Nienburg, between Bremen and Hanover in atmospheric conditions ideal for bombing. One Lancaster crew claimed a near miss with a Grand Slam and another crew claimed a hit. A third Lancaster crew found that their bomb would not fall off at the first two attempts and the bridge collapsed before the third, the crew bringing back the bomb. A fourth Grand Slam was reported to have hit the east end of the structure. Reconnaissance photographs showed that the bridge had been destroyed. =Bremen, 23 March= The Grand Slam Lancasters of 617 Squadron were fitted with Avro Lincoln undercarriages, with tyres at , double that of Lancaster tires. Another railway Bridge near Bremen was attacked later in the day by twenty 617 Squadron Lancasters, six carrying Grand Slams and 14 with Tallboys in weather that was as good for the Bremen anti-aircraft defences as it was for bombing. Lancaster NG489 was hit by and the crew jettisoned the Grand Slam to regain control. Several other Lancasters were hit by anti-aircraft fire and four others were attacked by Me 262s, fifteen of which were seen on the flight to the target. Crews reported three hits and two near-misses to the south and the bridge was brought down by a Tallboy. =Farge, 27 March= Twenty Lancasters of 617 Squadron attacked the Valentin submarine pens ( was the code name for Vegesack) at Farge, north of Bremen-Vegesack. The pen was intended to be the assembly plant for the Type XXI submarine and work had commenced in 1942. The plant was long and wide, with of the structure above ground and below. The roof was made of reinforced concrete with arched trusses on the walls, filled with concrete. Twenty Lancasters, thirteen with Grand Slams, seven with Tallboys fuzed for one hour, were escorted by eight RAF Mustang squadrons to the target. The weather was good over Farge, with slight and no fighter opposition. One Lancaster returned soon after take-off and another turned back over the target with engine- trouble, ditching the Grand Slam in the North sea. Two of the fourteen hits on the pens were by Grand Slams, which landed near the middle of the roof and exploded deep in the concrete, each causing about of the roof to fall in and leaving large holes; no aircraft were lost. =Hamburg, 9 April= Number 617 Squadron dispatched 17 Lancasters to bomb the U-boat pens at Hamburg, two with Grand Slams and the rest with Tallboys. The formation was escorted by Spitfire and Mustang fighters. fighters, including jets, attempted to intercept the formation. Five hits were claimed but the Grand Slams appear to have missed; reconnaissance photographs revealed seven hits, four through the roof. Many buildings to the north and west of the pens were destroyed or damaged. Six Lancasters were hit by but no aircraft were lost. =Heligoland, 19 April= An attack on coastal gun-batteries on Heligoland and Düne in the Heligoland Bight, the south-eastern extremity of the North Sea, was planned by the RAF. The military installations on the main island comprised a radar installation covering the Elbe and Weser rivers, an airfield and a coastal battery each of and guns. To ensure that Allied ships could enter the Elbe and Weser estuaries, Bomber Command intended to attack the island with bombs but at least forty heavy anti-aircraft guns on the islands had to be silenced. The gun positions had a diameter of about and only hits or near misses could damage them. On 18 April 953 bombers attacked the anti-aircraft guns and achieved some hits. The next day, twenty Lancasters of 617 Squadron, six carrying Grand Slams and the rest Tallboys, along with 16 aircraft from 9 Squadron, escorted by six squadrons of Spitfires and one of Mustangs, attacked the islands and achieved more hits; no aircraft were lost. Aftermath =Analysis= In March 156 day sorties were flown, 31 with Grand Slams and 40 with Tallboys. An analysis of the bombing accuracy of 617 Squadron and 9 Squadron on Tallboy sorties. The squadrons used different bomb sights and bombed from heights between and the comparison showed that 1 per cent of the Tallboys dropped by 617 Squadron were gross errors, defined as missing the aiming point by more than against 10 per cent of the Tallboys dropped by 9 Squadron. Unlike the Tallboy, the Grand Slam was designed to penetrate concrete roofs and was more effective against fortifications than earlier bombs. By the end of the war, 41 Grand Slams had been dropped on operations. =Project Ruby= Beginning in March 1946, Project Ruby was a joint Anglo–American project to investigate the use of penetration bombs against heavily protected, concrete targets. The submarine pens near Bremen were chosen as a target, having become unusable and abandoned since the attack on 27 March 1945. Grand Slams were carried by Lancasters from 15 Squadron and US B-29 bombers. Around 140 sorties were flown, testing bombs including the rocket-assisted Disney bomb. =Examples= Five complete Grand Slam bombs are preserved and displayed in the United Kingdom at the RAF Museum, London; Brooklands Museum; RAF Lossiemouth; Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum and the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Visitors' Centre at RAF Coningsby. Main portions of these bombs, without their lightweight tails, can be seen at the Kelham Island Museum in Sheffield and Yorkshire Air Museum at Elvington. The T-12 Cloudmaker is an American-made variant of the Grand Slam; an example is displayed at the Air Force Armament Museum in the United States.

In 1891, he founded the Free Library of Philadelphia. Early life Pepper was born in Philadelphia to Dr. William Pepper Sr. and Sarah Platt. He married Frances Sergent Perry on June 25, 1873. They were the parents of four sons (William, Thomas, Benjamin, and Oliver Pepper). He was educated at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from the college in 1862 and from the medical school in 1864. Career In 1868 Pepper became lecturer on morbid anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and in 1870 lecturer on clinical medicine. From 1876 to 1887, he was professor of clinical medicine at Penn and in 1887 succeeded Dr Alfred Still as professor of theory and practice of medicine. Pepper founded the Philadelphia Medical Times and was editor of that journal in 1870 and 1871. He was elected provost of the University of Pennsylvania in 1881 and remained in that position until 1894. For his services as medical director of the United States Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, he was made Knight Commander of Saint Olaf by King Oscar II of Sweden. Pepper was the founder of Philadelphia's first free public library, chartered in 1891 through funds provided by the estate of his late uncle, which became the Free Library of Philadelphia, today the city's multi-branch public library system. He sponsored the Pepper-Hearst expedition (1895–1897) on the Gulf coast of Florida, near Tarpon Springs. Pepper was known academically for his contributions to the theory and practice of medicine and the System of Medicine that he edited in 1885-86 became one of America's standard medical textbooks. He died July 28, 1898, at Pleasanton, California. A bronze statue of Pepper by Karl Bitter stands on the south side of College Hall at the University of Pennsylvania.

It is also used in combination with 5-fluorouracil to treat colorectal cancer, may be used to treat folate deficiency that results in anemia, and methanol poisoning. It is taken by mouth, injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. Side effects may include trouble sleeping, allergic reactions, or fever. Use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is generally regarded as safe. When used for anemia it is recommended that pernicious anemia as a cause be ruled out first. Folinic acid is a form of folic acid that does not require activation by dihydrofolate reductase to be useful to the body. Folinic acid was first made in 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS about £4.62 per 30 mg vial.  Medical use  Levofolinic acid Folinic acid is given following methotrexate as part of a total chemotherapeutic plan, where it may protect against bone marrow suppression or gastrointestinal mucosa inflammation. No apparent effect is seen on pre-existing methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity.Therapeutic Information Resources Australia (2004). Calcium Folinate (Systemic) in AUSDI: Australian Drug Information for the Health Care Professional. Castle Hill: Therapeutic Information Resources Australia. Folinic acid can be taken as a pill (orally) or injected into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). While not specifically an antidote for methotrexate, folinic acid may also be useful in the treatment of acute methotrexate overdose. Different dosing protocols are used, but folinic acid should be redosed until the methotrexate level is less than 5 x 10−8 M. Additionally, folinic acid is sometimes used to reduce the side effects of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This includes reductions in nausea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver blood tests, and mouth sores. Folinic acid is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil in treating colon cancer. In this case, folinic acid is not used for \\"rescue\\" purposes; rather, it enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. Folinic acid is also sometimes used to prevent toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine. It may be prescribed in the treatment of toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Folinic acid is also used in the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which the use of folic acid cannot normalize cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-MTHF.  Side effects  Folinic acid should not be administered intrathecally. This may produce severe adverse effects or even death.  Drug interactions  Fluorouracil: Folinic acid may increase the toxicity associated with fluorouracil if the two are administered together. Some adverse effects that have occurred, particularly in elderly patients, include severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim: A potential drug interaction exists with concomitant use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folinic acid. Folinic acid has been shown to decrease the efficacy of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in the treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii), a common cause of pneumonia in AIDS patients.  Mechanism of action  Folinic acid is a 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. It is readily converted to other reduced folic acid derivatives (e.g., 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate), thus has vitamin activity equivalent to that of folic acid. Since it does not require the action of dihydrofolate reductase for its conversion, its function as a vitamin is unaffected by inhibition of this enzyme by drugs such as methotrexate. This is the classical view of folinic acid rescue therapy. In 1980s, however, folinic acid was found to reactivate the dihydrofolate reductase itself even when methotrexate exists. Although the mechanism is not very clear, the polyglutamylation of methotrexate and dihydrofolate in malignant cells is considered to play an important role in the selective reactivation of dihydrofolate reductase by folinic acid in normal cells. Folinic acid, therefore, allows for some purine/pyrimidine synthesis to occur in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, so some normal DNA replication processes can proceed. Folinic acid has dextro- and levorotary isomers. Both levoleucovorin (the levorotary isomer) and racemic folinic acid (a mixture of both isomers) have similar efficacy and tolerability. Levoleucovorin was approved by the FDA in 2008.  History  Folinic acid was discovered as a needed growth factor for the bacterium Leuconostoc citrovorum in 1948, by Sauberlich and Baumann. This resulted in it being called \\"citrovorum factor,\\" meaning citrovorum growth factor. It had an unknown structure, but was found to be a derivative of folate that had to be metabolized in the liver before it could support growth of L. citrovorum. The synthesis of citrovorum factor by liver cells in culture was eventually accomplished from pteroylglutamic acid in the presence of suitable concentrations of ascorbic acid. The simultaneous addition of sodium formate to such systems resulted in increased citrovorum factor activity in the cell- free supernatants (producing, as now known, the 5-formyl derivative), and from this method of preparation of large amounts of the factor, its structure as levo-folinic acid (5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid) was eventually deduced. Names Folinic acid should be distinguished from folic acid (vitamin B9). However, folinic acid is a vitamer for folic acid and has the full vitamin activity of this vitamin. Levofolinic acid and its salts are the 2S- form of the molecule. They are the only forms of the molecule that are known to be biologically active. It is generally administered as the calcium or sodium salt (calcium folinate (INN), sodium folinate, leucovorin calcium, leucovorin sodium).

Born in Taunton, Somerset, Addison started his playing career with York City before moving to Nottingham Forest, Arsenal and Sheffield United. His managerial career started when he took the post of player-manager of Hereford United in 1971 during their famous 1971–72 FA Cup run, which saw them defeat Newcastle United. Since then Addison has managed a wide variety of clubs in the UK, as well as in Spain, South Africa, Kuwait and Qatar. Playing career Addison was born in Taunton but brought up in York. He joined York City as an amateur and turned professional in May 1957. In his second season, he scored 10 league goals helped York win promotion to the recently created Third Division, and midway through the 1960–61 season he was transferred to First Division side Nottingham Forest for £12,000, a then- record fee for City. Addison was a regular at the City Ground scoring 62 goals in 160 league appearances, before being signed by Bertie Mee's Arsenal in 1966 for £45,000. His time at Highbury was hampered by injury and, after scoring an average of 1 goal in every 3 games for the Gunners, he was sold to First Division side Sheffield United at the end of the 1967 season. Addison joined United on the recommendation of assistant manager Andy Beattie who he had played with whilst at Nottingham Forest, signing for £40,000. Signed as a centre forward and provide goals, he remained a first-team regular until the 1971 season where, when he opted to move into management, joining leading non- league side Hereford United as player-manager. Managerial career =Player-Manager= Addison arrived at Hereford United in October 1971, succeeding the legendary John Charles as player-manager. He inherited a strong group of players which he led through the club's famous Giantkilling FA Cup run and ultimately election to the Football League. In the Second Round, Addison and his team needed two replays to get past Northampton Town but it was worth the effort as a trip to top-flight Newcastle United awaited. After going 2–1 down in the tie, it was Addison who hit the 25-yard equaliser to take the Magpies to the return fixture at Edgar Street. In front of a capacity crowd and on a quagmire of a pitch, Addison and Hereford unbelievably won 2–1 after extra time with Radford and George scoring. They went on to take West Ham United to another replay in the Fourth Round before eventually losing 3–1 at Boleyn Ground. Hereford were elected to the Football League at the end of Addison's first season as a manager, and the success continued the following season when Hereford finished as runners-up in Division Four. = Management at the Touchline = Addison carried on playing until November 1973, but with a broken leg, he proceeded as manager until 1974 when he left to manage South African side Durban City F.C.. To mark his achievements at Hereford, an area north of the Edgar Street football ground was named Addison Court in his honour. He returned to England in December 1975, joining Notts County as assistant to Ronnie Fenton. His next managerial position was at Newport County achieving the 'Great Escape' of the 1976-77 seasonNewport County Great Escape before he returned to West Bromwich Albion as assistant manager to Ron Atkinson. After two seasons in charge at Derby County Addison departed in 1982, returning to Newport County where he led the team to their highest post- war league finish in the 1982–83 season. In May 1985 Addison left the Welsh side, moving to Qatar to guide Al-Ahli to second position in the Qatari league. Subsequently, Addison took the reins in Spain, where he took Celta Vigo into 'La Liga' First Division in his first season in charge. A second spell at West Bromwich Albion as assistant manager to Ron Atkinson followed, before he and Ron departed for Atlético Madrid in October 1988. However, Atkinson left Los Colchoneros after only two months, with Addison taking over the leadership of the club. Addison departed Atlético Madrid leaving the capital's side 5th in La Liga First Division, moving to Cádiz CF where he garnered a string of victories to ensure Cadiz's position in La Liga First Division. Addison then moved to Kuwait where he won the league with Al-Arabi, finishing above second-placed team managed by Felipe Scolari. Returning to the UK, Addison once again took up the reins at Hereford United. Further management callings in the UK followed, with a succession of clubs including Yeovil Town, Swansea City and Conference National side Forest Green Rovers, leading the club to what was their highest ever league finish. He was manager of Scarborough in the season 1998-99 in English football when Jimmy Glass' astonishing and memorable goal for Carlisle United changed the course of the season in the last minute. Personal life Addison currently resides in the city of Hereford, and was a pundit on BBC Radio Wales until 2008. He has operated as commentator and pundit on Spanish Football for Sky Sports, and as experienced FA Cup player and manager, as commentator and pundit for ESPN. Addison acts as commentator and football advisor across the UK and Europe. He also consults for clubs and media entities in Spain, USA and Asia.

Circling around the south of Edinburgh, as the equivalent of a ring road for the coastal city, it links together the A1 towards north-east England, the A702 towards north-west England, the M8 through the Central Belt towards Glasgow, the A7 through south-east Scotland and north-west England as well as the A8 leading to the M9 for Stirling and the Queensferry Crossing. The road is dual carriageway standard throughout, including emergency laybys and hard shoulders in areas. The road is classed as a special road in legal terms. Every motorway in the UK is termed a special road in that specific regulations govern its use. Not every special road is classed as a motorway and this bypass is one of those roads. Between Gogar and Sheriffhall junctions (see below) the A720 forms part of European route E15, which runs from Inverness, in northern Scotland, to Algeciras, in southern Spain. North of Gogar, the E15 runs towards the A90 and the Forth Road Bridge; and south of Sheriffhall along the A68. History A720 was built in sections between 1980 and 1989. The first section built was the Colinton section (A702 to Baberton) opened in 1981, with the Dreghorn junction opening circa 1985. Next up was the Sighthill section (Baberton to A8 at Gogarburn) which opened in late 1986. 1988 saw two sections open: the Burdiehouse section (A702 to A701) in the summer followed in the autumn by the section between the A68 at Sheriffhall and the A1 at Old Craighall. The last section was completed in 1989 around the Gilmerton junction. Junctions The A720 starts at the Old Craighall junction in the east where it meets the A1, from which traffic can approach Edinburgh city centre from the east, or run past Musselburgh and Haddington on the way to England. =Junction 1: Millerhill= This junction comes shortly after the eastern start of the A720, which was completed in 2008 as the Dalkeith Northern Bypass of the A68. This is a crucial route for traffic to south-east Scotland. In 2013 the road between Millerhill and Sheriffhall was temporarily diverted for the construction of a new underbridge serving the rebuilt Edinburgh-Galashiels railway line, as the original railway had been closed and was built over when the bypass was built. =Junction 2: Sheriffhall Roundabout= About 1.5 miles further is the most congested junction on the bypass. Whereas all the other junctions on the bypass are grade separated, the Sheriffhall location is a traffic-light controlled roundabout and the evident traffic problems of forcing all through A720 traffic to halt is evident, worsened by the importance of the roads which intersect here - the A7 which leads north to the city centre and south to Carlisle, the former A68 which now leads to the town of Dalkeith and also has access to the A68, and a minor A-road, the A6106. Traffic jams at the roundabout are common at most times of day. The reason for the lack of grade separation is the presence of a geological fault that crosses the bypass here, and the associated risk for bridge construction with the area having (at the time) active coal mining. Hermiston Junction where the A720 meets the M8 and the A71. As of 2015, an upgrade for the Sheriffhall Junction is in preparation, with four options for grade separation still under assessment. =Junction 3: Gilmerton= This is a small junction which is for the A772, that used to be the A7 until the mid-1990s. This road leads to Cameron Toll shopping centre as well as the A701 and the city centre. There is evidence that western slip-roads were considered at the roundabout to join the A772. This junction offers only connections to and from the west on the A720. =Junction 4: Lasswade= Just shortly after the Gilmerton junction, comes the Lasswade junction. Like the Gilmerton junction, this junction offers only connections to and from the west on the A720. South of Calder Junction =Junction 5: Straiton= This junction includes access to Straiton Retail Park, Costco, and IKEA. This junction also provides access to the A701 and southern suburbs. =Junction 6: Lothianburn= This junction was the original eastern terminus of the road. This is a major junction with the A702, which provides access to western England, via Abington and the A74(M) to Carlisle and the M6. =Junction 7: Dreghorn= This junction primarily provides access to the only services on the bypass. Local roads including the B701, and Dreghorn Barracks are also accessed from this junction. =Junction 8: Baberton= This junction was the original western terminus of the road. It provides direct access to the suburb of Baberton and indirect access to the A70, for Lanark, or the centre of Edinburgh. This junction offers only connections to and from the eastern stretch of the A720. =Junction 9 & 10: Calder and Hermiston Gait= The centre of these junctions are within half a mile of each other, with a tangle of inter-weaving slips roads, flyovers, and underpasses between and either side of them. The A71 meets the bypass at a roundabout over the carriageway, and the M8 terminates at a roundabout under the carriageway, along with access to Hermiston Gait retail park. The A71 provides one of the main routes into Edinburgh via Calder Road, and west to Livingston and Kilmarnock. The M8 runs to Glasgow and provides direct access to the M9 for Stirling, and via the M90 to the Queensferry Crossing. =Junction 11: Gogar Junction= Finally the road swings north to finish on the A8 at Gogar Roundabout. The original junction was a simple roundabout connecting both roads, and access to South Gyle and Edinburgh Park. The roundabout now has an underpass for traffic on the A8. From this junction, traffic can proceed into Edinburgh City Centre by an alternative route through Corstorphine, or can head west out to Edinburgh Airport and the M9 for Stirling, with connecting roads leading to all places north.

Background and education Thomas Milner Gibson came of a Suffolk family, but was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, where his father, Thomas Milner Gibson, was serving as an officer in the British Army. He was educated in Trinidad, in a school at Higham Hill also attended by Benjamin Disraeli, at Charterhouse, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1830. Political career In 1837 Gibson was elected to parliament as Conservative member for Ipswich, but resigned two years later, having adopted Liberal views, and became an ardent supporter of the free-trade movement. As one of Richard Cobden's chief allies, he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Manchester in 1841, and from 1846 to 1848 he was Vice-President of the Board of Trade in Lord John Russell's ministry. Though defeated in Manchester in 1857, he found another seat for Ashton-under-Lyne, and sat in the cabinet under Lord Palmerston and then Russell from 1859 to 1866 as President of the Board of Trade. In 1846 he was sworn of the Privy Council.The London Gazette, 10 July 1846 Gibson was the leading spirit in the movement for the repeal of taxes on knowledge, and his successful efforts on behalf of journalism and advertising were recognized by a public testimonial in 1862. He retired from political life in 1868, but he and his wife, whose salon was a great Liberal centre, were for many years very influential in society. Milner Gibson was a sportsman and a typical man of the world, who enjoyed life and behaved liberally to those connected with him.

Engineers were unable to increase the performance of their designs due to the huge number of components involved. In theory, every component needed to be wired to every other component (or at least many other components) and were typically strung and soldered by hand. In order to improve performance, more components would be needed, and it seemed that future designs would consist almost entirely of wiring. History The first known recorded use of the term in this context was made by the Vice President of Bell Labs in an article celebrating the 10th anniversary of the invention of the transistor, for the \\"Proceedings of the IRE\\" (Institute of Radio Engineers), June 1958 . Referring to the problems many designers were having, he wrote: At the time, computers were typically built up from a series of \\"modules\\", each module containing the electronics needed to perform a single function. A complex circuit like an adder would generally require several modules working in concert. The modules were typically built on printed circuit boards of a standardized size, with a connector on one edge that allowed them to be plugged into the power and signaling lines of the machine, and were then wired to other modules using twisted pair or coaxial cable. Since each module was relatively custom, modules were assembled and soldered by hand or with limited automation. As a result, they suffered major reliability problems. Even a single bad component or solder joint could render the entire module inoperative. Even with properly working modules, the mass of wiring connecting them together was another source of construction and reliability problems. As computers grew in complexity, and the number of modules increased, the complexity of making a machine actually work grew more and more difficult. This was the \\"tyranny of numbers\\". It was precisely this problem that Jack Kilby was thinking about while working at Texas Instruments. Theorizing that germanium could be used to make all common electronic components - resistors, capacitors, etc. - he set about building a single-slab component that combined the functionality of an entire module. Although successful in this goal, it was Robert Noyce's silicon version and the associated fabrication techniques that make the integrated circuit (IC) truly practical. Unlike modules, ICs were built using photoetching techniques on an assembly line, greatly reducing their cost. Although any given IC might have the same chance of working or not working as a module, they cost so little that if they didn't work you simply threw it away and tried another. In fact, early IC assembly lines had failure rates around 90% or greater, which kept their prices high. The U.S. Air Force and NASA were major purchasers of early ICs, where their small size and light weight overcame any cost issues. They demanded high reliability, and the industry's response not only provided the desired reliability but meant that the increased yield had the effect of driving down prices. ICs from the early 1960s were not complex enough for general computer use, but as the complexity increased through the 1960s, practically all computers switched to IC-based designs. The result was what are today referred to as the third-generation computers, which became commonplace during the early 1970s. The progeny of the integrated circuit, the microprocessor, eventually superseded the use of individual ICs as well, placing the entire collection of modules onto one chip. Seymour Cray was particularly well known for making complex designs work in spite of the tyranny of numbers. His attention to detail and ability to fund several attempts at a working design meant that pure engineering effort could overcome the problems they faced. Yet even Cray eventually succumbed to the problem during the CDC 8600 project, which eventually led to him leaving Control Data.

He was also known as Angelus and is remembered for writing hymns.See the link below \\"German Classics\\" Schefferus was born in Strasbourg, then part of the Holy Roman Empire. He came from the patrician family (Scheffer), studied at university there and briefly in Leiden, and was in 1648 made professor Skytteanus of eloquence and government at Uppsala University, a chair he held until his death in 1679. Schefferus also spent time on philological and archaeological studies. His De orbibus tribus aureis became the first publication on Swedish archaeology. The story of the Sami people, Lapponia (1673) became popular around Europe but was not translated into Swedish (as Lappland) until 1956. His posthumous publication, Suecia literata (\\"The Learned Sweden\\") (1680) is a Swedish history of science bibliography. Schefferus was later in life involved in an intellectual dispute, particularly with Olof Verelius (1618–1682) over the location of the Temple at Uppsala. He argued that the temple should be found near the current location of Helga Trefaldighets kyrka (Church of the Holy Trinity) in Uppsala. It is today known that his opponents usually used forgery to meet his argumentation. This was presumably the reason that parts of the largest surviving Gothic text, Codex Argenteus, were retouched. In 1648, Schefferus married Regina Loccenia, the daughter of a previous (1628–1642) professor skytteanus, Johannes Loccenius, and had two sons (see Scheffer).

Some 77,345 acres (313 km²) in area, it provides one of Zimbabwe's few areas of plains scenery, with good visibility and sparse but important mammal populations. Flora and fauna Kazuma Pan is virtually unspoilt wilderness with an open landscape of grassy plains which is reminiscent of the great East African plains and is thus dissimilar to the usual Zimbzbwen bush or woodland landscapes. Within the Park there are a series of pans, some of which are kept continuously filled by water pumped from boreholes during the dry season. This permanent water source causes large concentrations of wildlife to seasonally migrate between Botswana and Zimbabwe, especially towards the end of the dry season from September through to the first rains of November or December. Wildlife to be seen in Kazuma Pan National Park include lion, leopard, Southern giraffe, common zebra, gemsbok, roan antelope, sable antelope, tsessebe, common eland and Southern reedbuck. African elephant and Cape buffalo are present in large numbers towards the end of the dry season when water is scarce elsewhere. White rhinoceros can also be frequently seen. A special species to the Kazuma Pan National Park is the oribi, a small antelope, nwhich is rather rare in Zimbabwe. Cheetah or African wild dog are still present though rare but lions are fairly common. Much of the park consists of grassland, fringed by mopane and Kalahari sand woodlands. There are a series of seasonally flooded pans in the south-west of the park attracts a wide variety of waterfowl. The pan systems are also ideal habitat to a large variety of water birds, with a number of species including storks, crowned cranes, stilts, cormorants, ducks and kingfishers occurring throughout the area. Kazuma Pan was proclaimed a National Park in 1949, but was deproclaimed in 1964 as no development had taken place. It regained its National Park status under the Parks and Wild Life Act (1975). There is no accommodation within the park but camping is allowed at two undeveloped camp sites, with permission from the Department of National Parks and Wild Life Management.

The ballad tells of how a huge dragon - almost as big as the Trojan Horse - devours anything it wishes, even trees and buildings, until the Falstaffian knight Moore of Moore Hall obtains a bespoke suit of spiked Sheffield armour and delivers a fatal kick to the dragon's \\"arse-gut\\" - its only vulnerable spot, as the dragon explains with its dying breath. The topography of the ballad is accurate in its detail as regards Wharncliffe Crags and environs, but the story, and its burlesque humour, has been enjoyed in places far from the landscape from which it appears to derive and has been used to make a number of points unrelated to it. More Hall is a 15th-century (or earlier) residence immediately below the gritstone edge of Wharncliffe Crags—Wharncliffe being formerly known in the local vernacular as Wantley—The dragon was reputed to reside in a den, and to fly across the valley to Allman (Dragon's) Well on the Waldershelf ridge above Deepcar. The 1573 case A lawsuit was taken out in 1573 by one George More of Sheffield on behalf of the Sheffield Burgery (the 'free men' of Sheffield) against the Lord of the manor of Sheffield, George Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, in respect of his appropriation of the proceeds of Sheffield 'waste' land, which hitherto had paid for Sheffield's poor, civic works and the parish church.The records of the Burgery of Sheffield by John Daniel Leader (1897) pp. 29, 31, & 36.Church and Manor: A Study in English Economic History by Sidney Oldall Addy (1913) p. 263. This had long been the practice under an agreement in 1297 by one of Talbot's predecessors, one Thomas Furnival,Sheffield (History and Guide) by David Fine (1991) pp. 54 & 43. and had seemed secure after a successful petition some two decades previously to the newly enthroned Queen Mary with the full support of George Talbot's father (the previous—fifth—Earl of Shrewsbury, Francis Talbot).\\"History\\", Sheffield Church Burgesses Trust Percy's interpretation In his Reliques of Ancient English Poetry Thomas Percy holds that the story of The Dragon of Wantley relates to a dispute over the alleged misappropriation of church tithes in Wharncliffe by Sir Francis Wortley who was opposed by a local lawyer named More. Opera parody Henry Carey wrote the libretto to a burlesque opera called The Dragon of Wantley in 1737. The opera, with music composed by John Frederick Lampe, punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at Robert Walpole and his taxation policies. This Augustan parody was a huge success and its initial run was 69 performances in the first season; a number which exceeded even The Beggar's Opera. The opera debuted at the Haymarket Theatre, where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. Part of its satire of opera was that it had all of the words sung, including the recitatives and da capo arias. The play itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. The Musical Entertainer from 1739 contains engravings showing how the staging was performed. The piece is at once a satire of the ridiculousness of operatic staging and an indirect satire of the government's tax policy. In Carey's play, Moore of Moorehall, \\"a valiant knight, in love with Margery\\", is a drunk who pauses to deal with the dragon only between bouts of drinking and carousing with women. Margery offers herself as a human sacrifice to Moore to persuade him to take on the cause of battling the dragon, and she is opposed Mauxalinda, Moore's \\"cast-off mistress\\", who has interest in him now that a rival has appeared. The battle with the dragon takes place entirely offstage, and Moore only wounds the dragon (who is more reasonable than Moore in his dialogue) in its anus. The main action concerns the lavish dances and songs by the two sopranos and Moore. The opera is now rarely performed. A fully staged production was performed by the West London amateur group, Isleworth Baroque (now Richmond Opera), in the theatre at West Thames College in 2012. The University of Birmingham also performed the opera as part of their Summer Festival in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts. It is being produced for two performances in Chicago's Haymarket Opera Company in October of 2019 The novel A novel, The Dragon of Wantley, was written by Owen Wister (best known as the author of The Virginian) in 1892. Published by Lippincott Press, the story is a comic \\"burlesque\\" (in the author's words), concerning the \\"true\\" story of the Dragon. It is a romantic story set at Christmastime in the early 13th century. The book was a surprise success, going through four editions over the next ten years. Representations There is a representation of the dragon above More Hall on the opposite side of the valley to Wharncliffe Crags.

It is used either by mouth or injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, vomiting, sleepiness, loss of appetite, cough, rash, and joint pain. Serious side effects include allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby but this use has not been well studied. Mesna is an organosulfur compound. It works by altering the breakdown products of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide found in the urine making them less toxic. Mesna was approved for medical use in the United States in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.  Medical uses  = Chemotherapy adjuvant = Mesna is used therapeutically to reduce the incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis and haematuria when a patient receives ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide for cancer chemotherapy. These two anticancer agents, in vivo, may be converted to urotoxic metabolites, such as acrolein. Mesna assists to detoxify these metabolites by reaction of its sulfhydryl group with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl containing compounds such as acrolein. This reaction is known as a Michael addition. Mesna also increases urinary excretion of cysteine. = Other = Outside North America, mesna is also used as a mucolytic agent, working in the same way as acetylcysteine; it is sold for this indication as Mistabron and Mistabronco.  Administration  It is administered intravenously or orally (per mouth). The IV mesna infusions would be given with IV ifosfamide, while oral mesna would be given with oral cyclophosphamide. The oral doses must be double the intravenous (IV) mesna dose due to bioavailability issues. The oral preparation allows patients to leave the hospital sooner, instead of staying four to five days for all the IV mesna infusions.  Mechanism of action  Mesna reduces the toxicity of urotoxic compounds that may form after chemotherapy administration. Mesna is a water-soluble compound with antioxidant properties, and is given concomitantly with the chemotherapeutic agents cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Mesna concentrates in the bladder where acrolein accumulates after administration of chemotherapy and through a Michael addition, forms a conjugate with acrolein and other urotoxic metabolites. This conjugation reaction inactivates the urotoxic compounds to harmless metabolites. The metabolites are then excreted in the urine. Names It is marketed by Baxter as Uromitexan and Mesnex. The name of the substance is an acronym for 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate Na (Na being the chemical symbol for sodium).

The mathematical basis for tomographic imaging was laid down by Johann Radon. A notable example of applications is the reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) where cross-sectional images of patients are obtained in non-invasive manner. Recent developments have seen the Radon transform and its inverse used for tasks related to realistic object insertion required for testing and evaluating computed tomography use in airport security. This article applies in general to reconstruction methods for all kinds of tomography, but some of the terms and physical descriptions refer directly to the reconstruction of X-ray computed tomography.  Introducing formula  Figure 1: Parallel beam geometry utilized in tomography and tomographic reconstruction. Each projection, resulting from tomography under a specific angle, is made up of the set of line integrals through the object. artifacts, due to limited amount of projection slices over angles. The projection of an object, resulting from the tomographic measurement process at a given angle \\\\theta, is made up of a set of line integrals (see Fig. 1). A set of many such projections under different angles organized in 2D is called sinogram (see Fig. 3). In X-ray CT, the line integral represents the total attenuation of the beam of x-rays as it travels in a straight line through the object. As mentioned above, the resulting image is a 2D (or 3D) model of the attenuation coefficient. That is, we wish to find the image \\\\mu(x,y). The simplest and easiest way to visualise the method of scanning is the system of parallel projection, as used in the first scanners. For this discussion we consider the data to be collected as a series of parallel rays, at position r, across a projection at angle \\\\theta. This is repeated for various angles. Attenuation occurs exponentially in tissue: :I = I_0\\\\exp\\\\left({-\\\\int\\\\mu(x,y)\\\\,ds}\\\\right) where \\\\mu(x,y) is the attenuation coefficient as a function of position. Therefore, generally the total attenuation p of a ray at position r, on the projection at angle \\\\theta, is given by the line integral: :p_{\\\\theta}(r) = \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{I}{I_0}\\\\right) = -\\\\int\\\\mu(x,y)\\\\,ds Using the coordinate system of Figure 1, the value of r onto which the point (x,y) will be projected at angle \\\\theta is given by: :x\\\\cos\\\\theta + y\\\\sin\\\\theta = r\\\\ So the equation above can be rewritten as :p_{\\\\theta}(r)=\\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty}\\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty}f(x,y)\\\\delta(x\\\\cos\\\\theta+y\\\\sin\\\\theta-r)\\\\,dx\\\\,dy where f(x,y) represents \\\\mu(x,y) and \\\\delta() is the Dirac delta function. This function is known as the Radon transform (or sinogram) of the 2D object. The Fourier Transform of the projection can be written as P_\\\\theta(\\\\omega)=\\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty}\\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty}f(x,y)\\\\exp[-j\\\\omega(x\\\\cos\\\\theta+y\\\\sin\\\\theta)]\\\\,dx\\\\,dy = F(\\\\Omega_1,\\\\Omega_2) where \\\\Omega_1 =\\\\omega\\\\cos\\\\theta, \\\\Omega_2 =\\\\omega\\\\sin\\\\theta P_\\\\theta(\\\\omega) represents a slice of the 2D Fourier transform of f(x,y) at angle \\\\theta. Using the inverse Fourier transform, the inverse Radon transform formula can be easily derived. f(x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{\\\\pi} g_\\\\theta(x\\\\cos\\\\theta+y\\\\sin\\\\theta)d\\\\theta where g_\\\\theta(x\\\\cos\\\\theta+y\\\\sin\\\\theta) is the derivative of the Hilbert transform of p_{\\\\theta}(r) In theory, the inverse Radon transformation would yield the original image. The projection-slice theorem tells us that if we had an infinite number of one-dimensional projections of an object taken at an infinite number of angles, we could perfectly reconstruct the original object, f(x,y). However, there will only be a finite number of projections available in practice. Assuming f(x,y) has effective diameter d and desired resolution is R_s, rule of thumb number of projections needed for reconstruction is N > \\\\pi d / R_s  Reconstruction algorithms  Practical reconstruction algorithms have been developed to implement the process of reconstruction of a 3-dimensional object from its projections.Herman, G. T., Fundamentals of computerized tomography: Image reconstruction from projection, 2nd edition, Springer, 2009 These algorithms are designed largely based on the mathematics of the Radon transform, statistical knowledge of the data acquisition process and geometry of the data imaging system. = Fourier-Domain Reconstruction Algorithm = Reconstruction can be made using interpolation. Assume N-projections of f(x,y) are generated at equally spaced angles, each sampled at same rate. The Discrete Fourier transform on each projection will yield sampling in the frequency domain. Combining all the frequency-sampled projections would generate a polar raster in the frequency domain. The polar raster will be sparse so interpolation is used to fill the unknown DFT points and reconstruction can be done through inverse Discrete Fourier transform. Reconstruction performance may improve by designing methods to change the sparsity of the polar raster, facilitating the effectiveness of interpolation. For instance, a concentric square raster in the frequency domain can be obtained by changing the angle between each projection as follow: \\\\theta' = \\\\frac{R_0}{ \\\\max\\\\\\\\{|\\\\cos\\\\theta|, |\\\\sin\\\\theta|\\\\\\\\}} where R_0 is highest frequency to be evaluated. The concentric square raster improves computational efficiency by allowing all the interpolation positions to be on rectangular DFT lattice. Furthermore, it reduces the interpolation error. Yet, the Fourier-Transform algorithm has a disadvantage of producing inherently noisy output. = Back Projection Algorithm = In practice of tomographic image reconstruction, often a stabilized and discretized version of the inverse Radon transform is used, known as the filtered back projection algorithm. With a sampled discrete system, the inverse Radon Transform is f(x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\\\Delta\\\\theta_i g_{\\\\theta_i}(x\\\\cos\\\\theta_i+y\\\\sin\\\\theta_i) g_\\\\theta(t) = p_\\\\theta(t) \\\\cdot k(t) where \\\\Delta\\\\theta is the angular spacing between the projections and k(t) is radon kernel with frequency response |\\\\omega. The name back-projection comes from the fact that 1D projection needs to be filtered by 1D Radon kernel (back-projected) in order to obtain a 2D signal. The filter used does not contain DC gain, thus adding DC bias may be desirable. Reconstruction using back-projection allows better resolution than interpolation method described above. However, it induces greater noise because the filter is prone to amplify high-frequency content. = Iterative Reconstruction Algorithm = Iterative algorithm is computationally intensive but it allows to include a priori information about the system f(x,y). Let N be the number of projections, D_i be the distortion operator for ith projection taken at an angle \\\\theta_i. \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\\\\\} are set of parameters to optimize the conversion of iterations. f_0(x,y) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\lambda_i p_{\\\\theta_i}(r) A fan-beam reconstruction of Shepp-Logan Phantom with different sensor spacing. Smaller spacing between the sensors allow finer reconstruction. The figure was generated by using MATLAB. f_k(x,y) = f_{k-1} (x,y) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\lambda_i [p_{\\\\theta_i}(r)-D_if_{k-1}(x,y)] An alternative family of recursive tomographic reconstruction algorithms are the Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques and iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance. = Fan-Beam Reconstruction = Use of a noncollimated fan beam is common since a collimated beam of radiation is difficult to obtain. Fan beams will generate series of line integrals, not parallel to each other, as projections. The fan- beam system will require 360 degrees range of angles which impose mechanical constraint, however, it allows faster signal acquisition time which may be advantageous in certain settings such as in the field of medicine. Back projection follows a similar 2 step procedure that yields reconstruction by computing weighted sum back-projections obtained from filtered projections. = Deep learning reconstruction = The influence of Poisson noise in deep learning reconstruction where Poisson noise causes the U-Net fail to reconstruct an existing high contrast lesion-like object. Deep learning methods are widely applied to image reconstruction nowadays and have achieved impressive results in various image reconstruction tasks, including low-dose denoising, sparse-view reconstruction, limited angle tomography and metal artifact reduction. An excellent overview can be found in the special issue of IEEE Transaction on Medical Imaging. One group of deep learning reconstruction algorithms apply post-processing neural networks to achieve image-to-image reconstruction, where input images are reconstructed by conventional reconstruction methods. Artifact reduction using the U-Net in limited angle tomography is such an example application . However, incorrect structures may occur in an image reconstructed by such a completely data- driven method , as displayed in the figure. Therefore, integration of known operators into the architecture design of neural networks appears beneficial, as described in the concept of precision learning . For example, direct image reconstruction from projection data can be learnt from the framework of filtered back-projection . Another example is to build neural networks by unrolling iterative reconstruction algorithms . Except for precision learning, using conventional reconstruction methods with deep learning reconstruction prior is also an alternative approach to improve the image quality of deep learning reconstruction.  Tomographic reconstruction software  For flexible tomographic reconstruction, open source toolboxes are available, such as PYRO-NN, TomoPy, CONRAD, ODL, the ASTRA toolbox, and TIGRE.Released by the University of Bath and CERN. TomoPy is an open-source Python toolbox to perform tomographic data processing and image reconstruction tasks at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. TomoPy toolbox is specifically designed to be easy to use and deploy at a synchrotron facility beamline. It supports reading many common synchrotron data formats from disk through Scientific Data Exchange, and includes several other processing algorithms commonly used for synchrotron data. TomoPy also includes several reconstruction algorithms, which can be run on multi-core workstations and large-scale computing facilities. The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB and Python toolbox of high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography, from 2009–2014 developed by iMinds-Vision Lab, University of Antwerp and since 2014 jointly developed by iMinds-VisionLab (now imec-VisionLab), UAntwerpen and CWI, Amsterdam. The toolbox supports parallel, fan, and cone beam, with highly flexible source/detector positioning. A large number of reconstruction algorithms are available through TomoPy and the ASTRA toolkit, including FBP, Gridrec, ART, SIRT, SART, BART, CGLS, PML, MLEM and OSEM. Recently, the ASTRA toolbox has been integrated in the TomoPy framework. By integrating the ASTRA toolbox in the TomoPy framework, the optimized GPU-based reconstruction methods become easily available for synchrotron beamline users, and users of the ASTRA toolbox can more easily read data and use TomoPy’s other functionality for data filtering and artifact correction.

After at least two intermediary sales, the land was purchased by Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who was also the 7th Vice President of the United States. Calhoun started a mining company to mine the land and later allowed his son-in-law Thomas Green Clemson, the founder of Clemson University, to manage it. The ore deposit was a very rich deposit and, according to an 1856 letter from Clemson to his brother-in-law, was still producing significant quantities of gold nearly 30 years after its initial discovery on the land. This mine - along with the Consolidated Mine and the Loud Mine - were some of the most productive mines in the Georgia Gold Belt. In 1879, the Calhoun Mine passed from the Calhoun family. In 1939, after the deposits at the Calhoun Mine were long thought to be depleted, a small pocket was discovered and mined. After that excitement, things became quiet once again at the mine. The Calhoun Mine was added to the National Register of Historical Places and named a National Historic Landmark in 1973. Calhoun Mine is located about 3 miles (5 km) south of Dahlonega off State Route 60 and on the eastern side of the Chestatee River. It lies on a hill on the west side of the road - about 0.6 miles (1 km) off the road - on the opposite side of the ridge, on private property. The mine was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, for its nationally significant role as an instigating element of the Cherokee removal. The mine was located directly adjacent to Cherokee land, and the conflict with miners illegally working Cherokee lands contributed to calls for removal, and the eventual displacement of, the Cherokee from their lands.

He laid the foundation of his reputation by his involvement with stele of Mesha (Moabite Stone), which bears the oldest Semitic inscription known. In 1871, Clermont-Ganneau identified the biblical city of Gezer (Joshua 16:11) with that of Abu Shusha, formerly known as Tell el Jezer.Charles Clermont-Ganneau, Archaeological Researches in Palestine during the Years 1873-1874, vol. II, London 1896, pp. 251-255; 275. In the same year he discovered the Temple Warning inscription in Jerusalem. In 1874 he was employed by the British government to take charge of an archaeological expedition to Palestine. Among his discoveries there was the rock-cut tomb of the Biblical Shebna.The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem, David Ussishkin, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 33, No. 2 (May, 1970), pp. 33-46, He explored/discovered many tombs in Wady Yasul, a valley immediately south of Jerusalem, which he claimed served as an auxiliary cemetery for Jerusalem at some ancient .

He was subsequently entrusted by his own government with similar missions to Syria and the Red Sea. He was made chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1875. After serving as vice-consul at Jaffa from 1880 to 1882, he returned to Paris as secrétaire interpréte for oriental languages, and in 1886 was appointed consul of the first class. He subsequently accepted the post of director of the École des Langues Orientales and professor at the Collège de France. In 1889 he was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, of which he had been a correspondent since 1880. In 1896 he was promoted to be consul-general, and was minister plenipotentiary in 1906. =Crusades against archaeological forgeries= In 1873, after the Jerusalem antiquities dealer Moses Wilhelm Shapira offered a set of Moabite artifacts (known as the Shapira Collection) for sale, Clermont-Ganneau attacked the collection as a forgery. In 1883, Shapira offered the so-called Shapira Strips, fragments of ancient parchment allegedly found near the Dead Sea, for sale to the British Museum, which exhibited two of the strips. Clermont-Ganneau attended the exhibition, and was the first person in England to attack their authenticity. In 1903 he took a prominent part in the investigation of the so-called Tiara of Saitaferne. This tiara had been purchased by the Louvre for 200,000 francs, and exhibited as a genuine antique. Much discussion arose as to the perpetrators of the fraud, some believing that it came from southern Russia. It was agreed, however, that the whole object, except perhaps the band round the tiara, was of modern manufacture.

Treat-all keeps an open house for all of those who oppose the king, and he has disinherited Wilding. Wilding launches a complex scheme to triumph over Treat-all. First, he introduces Diana (his mistress) to Treat-all as Charlot, allowing Treat-all to woo her. This allows him to court the real Charlot himself. Diana cares for Wilding, but after seeing him pursue both Charlot and Lady Galliard, she decides to make an advantageous marriage with the wealthy Treat-all. During a staged entertainment, Wilding assumes a disguise and pretends to be a Polish nobleman. He offers Treat-all the throne of Poland, which the greedy Treat-all accepts. Wilding then arranges for a burglary, where he and Treat-all both end up bound, and the burglars take all of Treat-all's papers. The burglars are Wilding's confidantes, and the papers contain evidence of Treat-all's treason. Wilding ends up marrying Charlot, and Treat-all marries Diana. However, Treat-all is forced by blackmail to treat Wilding well and to leave him his estates. In a sub-plot, Wilding successfully seduces the rich widow Lady Galliard. Shortly afterwards, one of her drunken former suitors (Sir Charles) breaks into her chamber and begins to undress. In order to get rid of him (and thinking that he will not remember their conversation), she agrees to marry him. She is then shocked to discover that two other people have overheard her make a legally binding promise of marriage.  Reception  Contemporaries singled out The City Heiress as one of Behn's \\"good\\" and lucrative comedies, although few modern critics have discussed it at length. The City Heiress was one of Behn's plays singled out by satirists for scorn. Referring to the epilogue, Robert Gould sarcastically asked, :\\"The City Heiress, by chast Sappho Writ: :Where the Lewd Widow comes, with brazen Face, :Just reeking from a Stallion's rank Embrace :T'acquaint the Audience with her Filthy Case. :Where can you find a Scene for juster Praise, :In Shakespear, Johnson, or in Fletcher's Plays?\\" -- The Play-House, a Satyr Behn's play has been called \\"a comedy of libertine complicity: her characters act as though they believed in order, authority, true love, and marriage even though they celebrate for the better part of five acts their license to disbelieve\\". Other Restoration comedies were as frank with their sexuality, and others had women choosing their lovers on the basis of their wit (while wits choose theirs on the basis of money), but Behn's characters do not moderate their desires in their comedic solutions. Further, Treat-all's punishment is poverty and subjugation, rather than being hanged; and Wilding's goal is luxury, rather than moral justice. The distinctions are subtle, but it was not merely Behn's sex that made the play offensive to moralizing poets of the 1690s and the first decade of the 18th century.

He also wrote the screenplay for 2013 feature film Trance.  Career  Ahearne's career began when the short film Latin for a Dark Room won an award at the Edinburgh Festival in 1994, and shortly afterwards he began working for the independent television production company World Productions. Among his work for World were episodes of the 1997 series the BBC Two drama This Life, for which Ahearne wrote two and directed another three episodes, making him the only person to both write and direct episodes for the series. His next major production for World was the six- episode Channel Four vampire series Ultraviolet, which Ahearne both wrote and directed. Ultraviolet was broadcast in 1998 to critical acclaim, and has subsequently been released on both VHS and DVD. The series also ran on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States, and the Fox Network in that country produced a pilot for their own version in 2001, although this did not lead to a series. In 2002 Ahearne directed the pilot for the Big Bear Productions horror-fantasy drama Strange, written by Andrew Marshall and broadcast on BBC One. The pilot was successful enough for a series to be commissioned the following year, with Ahearne helming three of the six episodes, although the series was not a success and a second series did not follow. Ahearne both wrote and directed the two-part drama-documentary series Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets for the BBC and the Discovery Channel in 2004. He was the director of five episodes of the 2005 series of the BBC's Doctor Who, for which Ahearne was nominated for his first BAFTA. In December 2006 his drama Perfect Parents, starring Doctor Who lead Christopher Eccleston, was aired on ITV1. The following month Ahearne returned to This Life to direct the one-off reunion episode \\"This Life +10\\", shown on BBC Two on 2 January 2007. Ahearne's project Apparitions, a supernatural series for the BBC which he wrote and directed, began on BBC One in November 2008. Ahearne also worked on Da Vinci's Demons, a fictional adventure TV-series created by David S. Goyer for Starz and BBC Worldwide. He also wrote the four-issue Fantastic Force mini-series for Marvel Comics in 2009 and Fantastic Four Annual 32 in 2010. In 2013, Ahearne co-wrote the screenplay for Trance, a 2013 psychological thriller directed by Danny Boyle starring James McAvoy, which was partially a remake of Ahearne's own version of the story, made for British television in 2001. He had sent the script to Boyle in 1994 after the release of Shallow Grave. Boyle never forgot it and over a decade later contacted Ahearne with the intention of making a feature film. It went on to receive mostly positive reviews. In 2017 Ahearne wrote and directed the BBC One thriller mini-series The Replacement.

Protest art is the creative works produced by activists and social movements. It is a traditional means of communication, utilized by a cross section of collectives and the state to inform and persuade citizens. Protest art helps arouse base emotions in their audiences, and in return may increase the climate of tension and create new opportunities to dissent. Since art, unlike other forms of dissent, take few financial resources, less financially able groups and parties can rely more on performance art and street art as an affordable tactic. Protest art acts as an important tool to form social consciousness, create networks, operate accessibly, and be cost-effective. Social movements produce such works as the signs, banners, posters, and other printed materials used to convey a particular cause or message. Often, such art is used as part of demonstrations or acts of civil disobedience. These works tend to be ephemeral, characterized by their portability and disposability, and are frequently not authored or owned by any one person. The various peace symbols, and the raised fist are two examples that highlight the democratic ownership of these signs. Protest art also includes (but is not limited to) performance, site-specific installations, graffiti and street art, and crosses the boundaries of Visual arts genres, media, and disciplines. While some protest art is associated with trained and professional artists, an extensive knowledge of art is not required to take part in protest art. Protest artists frequently bypass the art-world institutions and commercial gallery system in an attempt to reach a wider audience. Furthermore, protest art is not limited to one region or country, but is rather a method that is used around the world. There are many politically charged pieces of fine art — such as Picasso's Guernica, some of Norman Carlberg's Vietnam war-era work, or Susan Crile's images of torture at Abu Ghraib. History It is difficult to establish a history for protest art because many variations of it can be found throughout history. While many cases of protest art can be found during the early 1900s, like Picasso's Guernica in 1937, the last thirty years has experienced a large increase in the number of artists adopting protest art as a style to relay a message to the public. Protest art against SOPA Digital billboard in Manchester UK displaying protest art by Martin Firrell A piece of protest art featuring a parody of the logo of the NBA. As awareness of social justices around the world became more common among the public, an increase in protest art can be seen. Some of the most critically effective artworks of the recent period were staged outside the gallery, away from the museum and in that sense, protest art has found a different relationship to the public. Activist art Activist art represents and includes aesthetic, sociopolitical, and technological developments that have attempted to challenge and complicate the traditional boundaries and hierarchies of culture as represented by those in power. Like protest art, activist art practice emerged partly out of a call for art to be connected to a wider audience, and to open up spaces where the marginalized and disenfranchised can be seen and heard. Activist art incorporates the use of public space to address socio-political issues and to encourage community and public participation as a means of bringing about social change. It aims to affect social change by engaging in active processes of representation that work to foster participation in dialogue, raise consciousness, and empower individuals and communities. The need to ensure the continued impact of a work by sustaining the public participation process it initiated is also a challenge for many activist artists. It often requires the artist to establish relationships within the communities where projects take place. If social movements are understood as “repeated public displays” of alternative political and cultural values,Reed, T.V., The art of protest : culture and activism from the civil rights movement to the streets of Seattle. (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005) xiv. then activist art is significant in articulating such alternative views. Activist art is also important to the dimension of culture and an understanding of its importance alongside political, economical, and social forces in movements and acts of social change. One should be wary of conflating activist art with political art, as doing so obscures critical differences in methodology, strategy, and activist goals. =Historical basis in art and politics= Activist art cites its origins from a particular artistic and political climate. In the art world, performance art of the late 1960s to the 70s worked to broaden aesthetic boundaries within visual arts and traditional theatre, blurring the rigidly construed distinction between the two. Protest art involves creative works grounded in the act of addressing political or social issues. Protest art is a medium that is accessible to all socioeconomic classes and represents an innovative tool to expand opportunity structures. The transient, interdisciplinary, and hybrid nature of performance art allowed for audience engagement. The openness and immediacy of the medium invited public participation, and the nature of the artistic medium was a hub for media attention. Emerging forms of feminism and feminist art of the time was particularly influential to activist art. The idea that “the personal is the political,” that is, the notion that personal revelation through art can be a political tool,Suzanne Lacy, ed. Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 27 guided much activist art in its study of the public dimensions to private experience. The strategies deployed by feminist artists parallel those by artists working in activist art. Such strategies often involved “collaboration, dialogue, a constant questioning of aesthetic and social assumptions, and a new respect for audience” and are used to articulate and negotiate issues of self-representation, empowerment, and community identity. Conceptual Art sought to expand aesthetic boundaries in its critique of notions of the art object and the commodity system within which it is circulated as currency. Conceptual artists experimented with unconventional materials and processes of art production. Grounded by strategies rooted in the real world, projects in conceptual art demanded viewer participation and were exhibited outside of the traditional and exclusive space of the art gallery, thus making the work accessible to the public. Similarly, collaborative methods of execution and expertise drawn from outside the art world are often employed in activist art so as to attain its goals for community and public participation. Parallel to the emphasis on ideas that conceptual art endorsed, activist art is process-oriented, seeking to expose embedded power relationships through its process of creation. In the political sphere, the militancy and identity politics of the period fostered the conditions out of which activist art arose. =Strategy and practice= In practice, activist art may often take the form of temporal interventions, such as performance, media events, exhibitions, and installations. It is also common to employ mainstream media techniques (through the use of billboards, posters, advertising, newspaper inserts…etc.). By making use of these commercial distributive channels of commerce, this technique is particularly effective in conveying messages that reveal and subvert its usual intentions. The use public participation as a strategy of activating individuals and communities to become a “catalyst for change” is important to activist art. In this context, participation becomes an act of self-expression or self- representation by the entire community. Creative expression empowers individuals by creating a space in which their voices can be heard and in which they can engage in a dialogue with one another, and with the issues in which they have a personal stake. The Artist and Homeless Collaborative is an example of a project that works with strategies of public participation as a means of individual and community empowerment. It is an affiliation of artists, arts professionals and women, children and teenagers living in NYC shelters, the A & HC believe that their work in a collaborative project of art-making offers the residents a “positive experience of self-motivation and helps them regain what the shelter system and circumstances of lives destroy: a sense of individual identity and confidence in human interaction.”Wolper,Andrea. Making Art, Reclaiming Live: The Artist and Homeless Collaborative. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 252-253 The process of engaging the community in a dialogue with dominant and public discourses about the issue of homelessness is described in a statement by its founder, Hope Sandrow: “The relevancy of art to a community is exhibited in artworks where the homeless speak directly to the public and in discussion that consider the relationship art has to their lives. The practice of creating art stimulates those living in shelters from a state of malaise to active participation in the artistic process”Wolper,Andrea. Making Art, Reclaiming Live: The Artist and Homeless Collaborative. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 253 The A & HC came into being at a time when a critique of the makers, sellers, and consumers of art that addressed social concerns became increasingly pronounced. Critics argued that the very works of art whose purpose was to provoke political, social and cultural conversation were confined within the exclusive and privileged space of galleries museums, and private collections. By contrast, the A & HC was an attempt to bridge the gap between art production and social action, thus allowing for the work subjects that were previously excluded and silenced to be heard. = Ongoing Activist Art = Activist art can often be ongoing or community oriented- an example is the Read Opera The Charter of the Forest, which updates every two weeks and has a following of activists. In general, Read Opera is intended to be a genre of activist art, stemming from its nature as a free and anti-advertising form of expression. It rejects the manipulative practices of art-for-profit, and takes as given that culture is a right, not a privilege. The Charter of the Forest specifically deals with the ramifications and ideas surrounding nonviolence and what it means for political structures, taking cues from Noam Chomsky and Leo Tolstoy. Resistance art Resistance art is art used as a way of showing their opposition to powerholders. This includes art that opposed such powers as the German Nazi party, as well as that opposed to apartheid in South Africa. Willie Bester is one of South Africa's most well known artists who originally began as a resistance artist. Using materials assembled from garbage, Bester builds up surfaces into relief and then paints the surface with oil paint. His works commented on important black South African figures and aspects important to his community. South African resistance artists do not exclusively deal with race nor do they have to be from the townships. Another artist, Jane Alexander, has dealt with the atrocities of apartheid from a white perspective. Her resistance art deals with the unhealthy society that continues in post-apartheid South Africa.Sue Williamson, Resistance Art in South Africa (1989) Collections The Center for the Study of Political Graphics archive currently contains more than 85,000 posters and has the largest collection of post-World War II social justice posters in the United States and the second largest in the world.Sheff, Harry. \\"The Center for the Study of Political Graphics\\".

Under the terms of the Vienna Convention on Traffic, bicycles are considered to be vehicles and cyclists are considered to be drivers. The traffic codes of most countries reflect this. In some countries (such as in the Czech Republic,The law of the Czech Republic: 361/2000 Sb., § 30 Canada, and the United States), hand signals are designated not only for cyclists, but for every vehicle that does not have signal lights or has damaged signal lights. For example, drivers of older cars and mopeds may be required to make hand signals. Similar to automobile signaling, there are three primary signals: Left turn/overtaking, Right turn, and Stopping/braking. Left turn The same signals are also used for overtaking to the left in Right-hand traffic countries. Left turn signal ; All Countries : Extend left arm straight out in the direction of the turn, horizontally. ; South Africa : The driver extends his/her right arm with the forearm pointing vertically downwards and moving in a circular anti-clockwise motion. For tractors, animal-drawn vehicles and two-wheeled vehicles, the driver is allowed to extend their left arm horizontally with the palm to the front. If a vehicle is fitted with turn indicators, they may be used instead. Road traffic regulations Regulations 324 - 328 Right turn The same signals are also used for overtaking to the right in Left-hand traffic countries. Right turn hand signal ; US and Canada, (optional): Current convention for signaling right, either while cycling in traffic or cycling with other riders, is to extend the right arm perpendicularly to the body; to wit, the cyclist arm is pointing in the same direction of the intended turn. Prior to the common sense approach of extending right arm to indicate a right turn, the convention was for cyclist to extend the left upper-arm out to the left, horizontally and angle one's forearm vertically upward; this practice is no longer in use due to safety concerns. The Uniform Vehicle Code in the US recognizes both signals; although, the Code strongly encourages cyclists to use the arm to the right technique. State traffic laws generally conform to the Uniform Vehicle Code, but exceptions may exist. British Columbia (Canada) recognizes both. ; South Africa : The driver extends their right arm horizontally with the palm to the front. If a vehicle is fitted with turn indicators, they may be used instead. Arm to the right has the advantage that it is more visible to any traffic likely to be affected, for example vehicles in the next lane to the right or also intending to turn right. It is also easier to teach to children: \\"point in the direction you are going to turn.\\"  Slowing down  ; South Africa : Sudden reduction in speed requires the same signal as stopping. It is also allowed to extend the right arm horizontally with the palm facing down and move the arm upwards and downwards.  Overtaking  ; South Africa : A vehicle may signal a vehicle behind them to overtake them by extending the right arm below shoulder level, with the palm facing forwards, and moving the arm forwards and backwards. Stopping/braking US stop signal ; UK and Ireland : To indicate that you’re about to slow, extend your right arm fully out to the side, palm-down, and move your hand up and down at the wrist. To indicate coming to a full stop, extend your right arm vertically, with palm facing forward. ; US and Canada : Extend your left arm out to the left, horizontally and angle your forearm vertically downward. ;Italy : Extend your right arm vertically, with palm facing forward. ; Australia, Denmark: Extend your right arm vertically, with palm facing forward, or extend your right upper arm out to the right horizontally and make your forearm vertical with your palm facing forward (as depicted in the US right turn signal above). ; South Africa: Extend the right upper arm out to the right horizontally and make your forearm vertical with your palm facing forward (as depicted in the US right turn signal above). Conflict with brake operation A bicycle's front brake lever is typically installed on the side of the handlebar closest to the center of the road (front-left for right-side driving). In many countries, the hand signal for stopping/braking requires that the cyclist signal with the hand used for the front brake. The front brake is the most effective method of stopping a bike under normal road conditions. Cyclists, like all other road users, should be ready to make an emergency stop at all times. When approaching a junction a cyclist may wish to \\"cover the brake\\" in readiness for an emergency stop. It is not possible to cover both brakes when performing a hand signal and both hands are needed on the handlebars to steady the bicycle under hard braking. Cyclists therefore sometimes have to choose between giving a hand signal and covering the brake.

The route is located in Hennepin County. MN 100 in Edina History =Routing as a beltway= The route was authorized in 1934. MN 100 was originally meant as a beltway around the Twin Cities (presumably the reason for the round number) and actually achieved that status for about 20 years in the mid-20th century (although it wasn't a full freeway).

Old MN 100 then turned west upon County Road F and north along White Bear Avenue to meet up with and concurrent westward with old MN 96 (the section of which is now County Rd 96 in Vadnais Heights and Shoreview). Old MN 100 then turned south briefly along U.S. Highway 8 (US 8, now a city maintained street in New Brighton), then old MN 100 carried on westward along the current routing of I-694 through New Brighton and Fridley to meet back at its present-day northern terminus at Brooklyn Center. Due to traffic pattern changes over the years, it is no longer possible to directly follow the path of old MN 100. Small detours are necessary which involve the use of exits 40 and 60 of the present I-494/I-694 beltway. =Lilac Way= A historic view of Lilac Park with a rock garden and an ornamental pool. The inset shows one of the beehive grills. The original construction of MN 100 started in 1935, as a New Deal project. The project was a cooperative venture between the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Minnesota Highway Department, and was the largest WPA project in the state. The demand for the highway came out of growing pains in the Twin Cities during the 1920s, when Minneapolis city streets were congested and suburban roads were poorly maintained dirt roads. The plan for a beltway around the Twin Cities incorporated existing roads, both paved and unpaved. A new section of highway, between MN 5 (now I-494 and MN 5) in Edina and then-US 52 (now CR 81) in Robbinsdale was needed to complete the beltway. As such, it was planned as a state-of-the-art highway, with two lanes in each direction separated by wide medians, bridges at major intersections and railroad crossings, and the first cloverleaf interchanges in Minnesota. Carl Graeser, the highway engineer and Arthur R. Nichols, a landscape architect, teamed up to design the highway. A large number of WPA workers worked on the construction of the highway. Since the WPA was designed to keep a large number of workers busy, a lot of hand digging was done as opposed to using bulldozers. Cloverleaf interchanges were built at MN 7, US 12 (now I-394 and US 12) and MN 55 (Olson Highway). The landscaping of the highway was meant to give the highway a parkway-like experience. As such, it was built with a wider right-of-way than the typical highway. The Golden Valley Garden Club supported efforts to plant lilacs along the highway and the Minneapolis Journal coined the name \\"Lilac Way\\". Eventually, 7,000 lilacs were planted. In addition, the builders built five wayside parks along the way. These parks were intended for picnicking and featured stone picnic tables, beehive barbecues, waterfalls and so on. These fixtures provided work for local stonemasons, as another part of the WPA project. The western leg was completed in 1940, but further construction on the beltway was halted with the United States' entry into World War II. An extension from then-US 52 (now CR 81) in Robbinsdale to US 10 (near present-day I-35W) in New Brighton was built with federal aid to provide access to industrial areas as an asset to the manufacture of \\"essential war materials\\". A picnic area shown in a 1939 view of Lilac Park along MN 100 Graeser Park in Robbinsdale and the St. Louis Park Roadside Park (near the southeast corner of MN 100 and MN 7) are the only remaining roadside parks from the 1930s that are still mostly intact after widening of MN 100. The beltline was not completed until 1950. At that point, demand from the baby boom led to rapid growth in the suburbs. In 2009, restoration of the St. Louis Park Roadside Park was completed and the park renamed Lilac Park. As part of the restoration project, a beehive fireplace from the old Lilac Park to the north was transferred and restored. A new bicycle/walkway path constructed within the park connects the park to the Southwest LRT Trail. =Recent construction= Lilac Park beehive grill in its new location Conversion of the remaining portion of the road into a freeway is complete. In 2004, construction was finished on the northern portion of MN 100 between I-394 and I-694, making MN 100 a freeway for its entire length. The section between MN 7 and I-394 in St. Louis Park, the oldest part of the freeway, was reconstructed into a 6-lane freeway, completed in Nov. 2016. MN 100 is now 6 lanes from just north of the I-494 interchange in Edina, to the interchange at Bottineau Boulevard (County Road 81) in Robbinsdale. As part of these projects, 2 of the original 3 cloverleaf intersections were replaced. The cloverleaf at MN 55 in Golden Valley was changed and rebuilt in 2004 as a signalized single-point urban interchange (SPUI). The cloverleaf at MN 7/CR 25 was replaced with a folded diamond interchange. The remaining cloverleaf is at the I-394 interchange. The original Lilac Park in St. Louis Park was also lost to this construction. Several of the park's WPA-built stone picnic tables and a beehive fireplace were saved and relocated to the remaining portion of St. Louis Park Roadside Park, which was then renamed Lilac Park.http://www.deadpioneer.com/articles/MN100/stlouislilac/stlouislilac.html Exit list References =General references=    * External links *Restore Lilac Way website 100 Works Progress Administration in Minnesota Transportation in Hennepin County, Minnesota ","title":"Minnesota State Highway 100"},{"id":"995969","text":"The Consolidated Mine was a gold mine in Lumpkin County, Georgia, United States, just east of Dahlonega. Like most of the area around Dahlonega, the placer mining on the land on which the mine is located probably started during the Georgia Gold Rush. By 1880, the placer deposits were exhausted and the land was down to hard rock. Gold was soon discovered in a huge quartz vein system, and mined. \\"The richest acre\\" was mined deep into the ground, and the resulting shaft became known as the \\"Glory Hole.” After an interruption of operations at the mine, a group of investors purchased about 7,000 acres (28 km²) of land around the discovery sight and formed the Dahlonega Consolidated Gold Mining Co. in 1895. After constructing the largest stamp mill east of the Mississippi River at the Consolidated Mine property, the Mining Co. folded in 1906. The mine's lower workings became flooded and lay dormant until seventy- five years later, when the site came under new ownership. There is still gold to be mined here – but the cost of extracting the gold from the mine exceeds the value of the gold, at least for the time being. Today, a part of the upper level of the mine remains open for tourists, who can tour portions of the \\"Glory Hole\\" underground and pan for gold. Original cart rails, electrical lines and even an operational pneumatic drill recovered from the mine may be viewed. This mine and Crisson Mine are the two mines in the Dahlonega area that remain open for tourists. The Consolidated Mine remains the only mine in the area safe enough to take tourists into.

The album documents King Crimson's performance at the Hyde Park Festival of July 5, 1969, held in London, England. It has been estimated that half a million people attended this outdoor concert, which was headlined by the Rolling Stones. King Crimson were the opening act. Their setlist was cut for the occasion, and the last track was much shorter than usual. Nonetheless, the consensus was that their performance was a success, which significantly increased the band's reputation. The CD also includes two bonus tracks. The first is a series of excerpts from a press conference, held by all five members of the original King Crimson along with the band's road management. This conference was recorded at the release of King Crimson's Epitaph box set, featuring four CDs of concert material by the original band. The conference was held at the InterContinental London hotel on March 15, 1997. The second bonus track is an instrumental recording of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", recorded at Morgan Studios in London on June 12, 1969. Guitarist Robert Fripp has acknowledged that his solo on this version is \\"dismal in extremis\\", though noting that it was intended only as a guide track (and was subsequently replaced by a \\"proper\\" solo). The album was originally scheduled to be released in August 2000, but was held up by a dispute between members of the 1969 line-up of King Crimson.

Two oxygen cells as used by oxygen analysers for diving gas showing commonly used connectors An electro-galvanic fuel cell is an electrochemical device which consumes a fuel to produce an electrical output by a chemical reaction. One form of electro-galvanic fuel cell based on the oxidation of lead is commonly used to measure the concentration of oxygen gas in underwater diving and medical breathing gases. Electronically monitored or controlled diving rebreather systems, saturation diving systems, and many medical life-support systems use galvanic oxygen sensors in their control circuits to directly monitor oxygen partial pressure during operation. They are also used in oxygen analysers in recreational, technical diving and surface supplied mixed gas diving to analyse the proportion of oxygen in a nitrox, heliox or trimix breathing gas before a dive. These cells are lead/oxygen galvanic cells where oxygen molecules are dissociated and reduced to hydroxyl ions at the cathode. The ions diffuse through the electrolyte and oxidize the lead anode. A current proportional to the rate of oxygen consumption is generated when the cathode and anode are electrically connected through a resistor Function The cell reaction for a lead/oxygen cell is: 2Pb + O2 → 2PbO, made up of the cathode reaction: O2 \\\\+ 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−, and anode reaction: 2Pb + 4OH− → 2PbO + 2H2O + 4e−. The cell current is proportional to the rate of oxygen reduction at the cathode, but this is not linearly dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas to which the cell is exposed: Linearity is achieved by placing a diffusion barrier between the gas and the cathode, which limits the amount of gas reaching the cathode to an amount that can be fully reduced without significant delay, making the partial pressure in the immediate vicinity of the electrode close to zero. As a result of this the amount of oxygen reaching the electrode follows Fick's laws of diffusion and is proportional to the partial pressure in the gas beyond the membrane. This makes the current proportional to PO2. The load resistor over the cell allows the electronics to measure a voltage rather than a current. This voltage depends on the construction and age of the sensor, and typically varies between 7 and 28 mV for a PO2 of 0.21 bar Diffusion is linearly dependent on the partial pressure gradient, but is also temperature dependent, and the current rises about two to three percent per kelvin rise in temperature. A negative temperature coefficient resistor is used to compensate, and for this to be effective it must be at the same temperature as the cell. Oxygen cells which may be exposed to relatively large or rapid temperature changes, like rebreathers, generally use thermally conductive paste between the temperature compensating circuit and the cell to speed up the balancing of temperature. Temperature also affects the signal response time, which is generally between 6 and 15 seconds at room temperature for a 90% response to a step change in partial pressure. Cold cells react much slower and hot cells much faster. As the anode material is oxidised the output current drops and eventually will cease altogether. The oxidation rate depends on the oxygen reaching the anode from the sensor membrane. Lifetime is measured in oxygen-hours, and also depends on temperature and humidity Applications =Gas mixture analysis= The oxygen content of a stored gas mixture can be analysed by passing a small flow of the gas over a recently calibrated cell for long enough that the output stabilises. The stable output represents the fraction of oxygen in the mixture. Care must be taken to ensure that the gas flow is not diluted by ambient air, as this would affect the reading. =Breathing gas composition monitoring= The partial pressure of oxygen in anaesthetic gases is monitored by siting the cell in the gas flow, which is at local atmospheric pressure, and can be calibrated to directly indicate the fraction of oxygen in the mix. The partial pressure of oxygen in diving chambers and surface supplied breathing gas mixtures can also be monitored using these cells. This can either be done by placing the cell directly in the hyperbaric environment, wired through the hull to the monitor, or indirectly, by bleeding off gas from the hyperbaric environment or diver gas supply and analysing at atmospheric pressure, then calculating the partial pressure in the hyperbaric environment. This is frequently required in saturation diving and surface oriented surface supplied mixed gas commercial diving. =Diving rebreather control systems= The breathing gas mixture in a diving rebreather loop is usually measured using oxygen cells, and the output of the cells is used by either the diver or an electronic control system to control addition of oxygen to increase partial pressure when it is below the chosen lower set-point, or to flush with diluent gas when it is above the upper set-point. When the partial pressure is between the upper and lower set- points, it is suitable for breathing at that depth and is left until it changes as a result of consumption by the diver, or a change in ambient pressure as a result of a depth change. Accuracy and reliability of measurement is important in this application for two basic reasons. Firstly, if the oxygen content is too low, the diver will lose consciousness due to hypoxia and probably die, or if the oxygen content is too high, the risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity causing convulsions and loss of consciousness, with a high risk of drowning becomes unacceptable. Secondly, decompression obligations cannot be accurately or reliably calculated if the breathing gas composition is not known. Pre-dive calibration of the cells can only check response to partial pressures up to 100% at atmospheric pressure, or 1 bar. As the set points are commonly in the range of 1.2 to 1.6 bar, special hyperbaric calibration equipment would be required to reliably test the response at the set-points. This equipment is available, but is expensive and not in common use, and requires the cells to be removed from the rebreather and installed in the test unit. To compensate for the possibility of a cell failure during a dive, three cells are generally fitted, on the principle that failure of one cell at a time is most likely, and that if two cells indicate the same PO2, they are more likely to be correct than the single cell with a different reading. Voting logic allows the control system to control the circuit for the rest of the dive according to the two cells assumed to be correct. This is not entirely reliable, as it is possible for two cells to fail on the same dive. The sensors should be placed in the rebreather where a temperature gradient between the gas and the electronics in the back of the cells will not occur. Lifespan Oxygen cells behave in a similar way to electrical batteries in that they have a finite lifespan which is dependent upon use. The chemical reaction described above causes the cell to create an electrical output that has a predicted voltage which is dependent on the materials used. In theory they should give that voltage from the day they are made until they are exhausted, except that one component of the planned chemical reaction has been left out of the assembly: oxygen. Oxygen is one of the fuels of the cell so the more oxygen there is at the reaction surface, the more electrical current is generated. The chemistry sets the voltage and the oxygen concentration controls the electric current output. If an electrical load is connected across the cell it can draw up to this current but if the cell is overloaded the voltage will drop. When the lead electrode has been substantially oxidised, the maximum current that the cell can produce will drop, and eventually linearity of output voltage to partial pressure of oxygen at the reactive surface will fail within the required range of measurement, and the cell will no longer be accurate. There are two commonly used ways to specify expected sensor life span: The time in months at room temperature in air, or volume percentage oxygen hours (Vol%O2h). Storage at low oxygen partial pressure when not in use would seem an effective way to extend cell life, but when stored in anoxic conditions the sensor current will cease and the surface of the electrode may be passivated, which can lead to sensor failure. High ambient temperatures will increase sensor current, and reduce cell life. In diving service a cell typically lasts for 12 to 18 months, with perhaps 150 hours service in the diving loop at an oxygen partial pressure of about 1.2 bar and the rest of the time in storage in air at room temperature. Failures in cells can be life-threatening for technical divers and in particular, rebreather divers. The failure modes common to these cells are: failing with a higher than expected output due to electrolyte leaks, which is usually attributable to physical damage, contamination, or other defects in manufacture, or current limitation due to exhausted cell life and non linear output across its range. Shelf life can be maximised by keeping the cell in the sealed bag as supplied by the manufacturer until being put into service, storing the cell before and between use at or below room temperature, - a range of from 10 to 22 °C is recommended by a manufacturer - and avoid storing the cell in warm or dry environments for prolonged periods, particularly areas exposed to direct sunlight. =Failure modes= When new, a sensor can produce a linear output for over 4 bar partial pressure of oxygen, and as the anode is consumed the linear output range drops, eventually to below the range of partial pressures which may be expected in service, at which stage it is no longer fit to control the system. The maximum output current eventually drops below the amount needed to indicate the full range of partial pressures expected in operation. This state is called current-limited. When a current limited sensor can no longer reliably activate the control system at the upper set-point in a life support system, there is a severe risk of an excessive oxygen partial pressure occurring which will not be noticed, which can be life-threatening. Other failure modes include mechanical damage, such as broken conductors, corroded contacts and loss of electrolyte due to damaged membranes. Failing high is invariably a result of a manufacturing fault or mechanical damage. In rebreathers, failing high will result in the rebreather assuming that there is more oxygen in the loop than there actually is which can result in hypoxia. Current limited cells do not give a high enough output in high concentrations of oxygen. The rebreather control circuit responds as if there is insufficient oxygen in the loop and injects more oxygen to reach a setpoint the cell can never indicate resulting in hyperoxia. Non-linear cells do not perform in the expected manner across the required range of oxygen partial pressures. Two-point calibration against diluent and oxygen at atmospheric pressure will not pick up this fault which results in inaccurate loop contents of a rebreather. This gives the potential for decompression illness if the loop is maintained at a lower partial pressure than indicated by the cell output, or hyperoxia if the loop os maintained at a lower partial pressure than indicated by cell output. =Testing cells in the field= Preventing accidents in rebreathers from cell failures is possible in most cases by accurately testing the cells before use. Some divers carry out in-water checks by pushing the oxygen content in the loop to a pressure that is above that of pure oxygen at sea level to indicate if the cell is capable of high outputs. This test is only a spot check and does not accurately assess the quality of that cell or predict its failure. The only way to accurately test a cell is with a test chamber which can hold a calibrated static pressure above the upper set-point without deviation and the ability to record the output voltage over the full range of working partial pressures and graph them. =Managing cell failure in a life-support system= If more than one statistically independent cell is used, it is unlikely that more than one will fail at a time. If one assumes that only one cell will fail, then comparing three or more outputs which have been calibrated at two points is likely to pick up the cell which has failed by assuming that any two cells that produce the same output are correct and the one which produces a different output is defective. This assumption is usually correct in practice, particularly if there is some difference in the history of the cells involved.Cells from the same batch with the same history are more likely to fail together in the same way than cells with a different history The concept of comparing the output from three cells at the same place in the loop and controlling the gas mixture based on the average output of the two with the most similar output at any given time is known as voting logic, and is more reliable than control based on a single cell. If the third cell output deviates sufficiently from the other two, an alarm indicates probable cell failure. If this occurs before the dive, the rebreather is deemed unsafe and should not be used. If it occurs during a dive, it indicates an unreliable control system, and the dive should be aborted. Continuing a dive using a rebreather with a failed cell alarm significantly increases the risk of a fatal loop control failure. This system is not totally reliable. There has been at least one case reported where two cells failed similarly and the control system voted out the remaining good cell. If the probability of failure of each cell was statistically independent of the others, and each cell alone was sufficient to allow safe function of the rebreather, the use of three fully redundant cells in parallel would reduce risk of failure by five or six orders of magnitude. The voting logic changes this considerably. A majority of cells must not fail for safe function of the unit. In order to decide whether a cell is functioning correctly, it must be compared with an expected output. This is done by comparing it against the outputs of other cells. In the case of two cells, if the outputs differ, then one at least must be wrong, but it is not known which one. In such a case the diver should assume the unit is unsafe and bail out to open circuit. With three cells, if they all differ within an accepted tolerance, they may all be deemed functional. If two differ within tolerance, and the third does not, the two within tolerance may be deemed functional, and the third faulty. If none are within tolerance of each other, they may all be faulty, and if one is not, there is no way of identifying it. Using this logic, the improvement in reliability gained by use of voting logic where at least two sensors must function for the system to function is greatly reduced compared to the fully redundant version. Improvements are only in the order of one to two orders of magnitude. This would be great improvement over the single sensor, but the analysis above has assumed statistical independence of the failure of the sensors, which is generally not realistic. Factors which make the cell outputs in a rebreather statistically dependent include: *Common calibration gas - They are all calibrated together in the pre-dive check using the same diluent and oxygen supply. *Sensors are often from the same manufacturing batch - Components, materials and processes are likely to be very similar. *Sensors are often installed together and have since been exposed to the same PO2, temperature profile over the subsequent time. *Common working environment, particularly with regards to temperature and relative humidity, as they are usually mounted in very close proximity in the loop, to ensure that they measure similar gas. *Common measurement systems *Common firmware for processing the signals This statistical dependency can be minimised and mitigated by: *Using sensors from different manufacturers or batches, so that no two are from the same batch *Changing sensors at different times, so they each have a different history *Ensuring that the calibration gases are correct *Adding an statistically independent PO2 measuring system to the loop at a different place, using a different model sensor, and using different electronics and software to process the signal. *Calibrating this sensor using a different gas source to the others An alternative method of providing redundancy in the control system is to recalibrate the sensors periodically during the dive by exposing them to a flow of either diluent or oxygen or both at different times, and using the output to check whether the cell is reacting appropriately to the known gas as the known depth. This method has the added advantage of allowing calibration at higher oxygen partial pressure than 1 bar. This procedure may be done automatically, where the system has been designed to do it, or the diver can manually perform a diluent flush at any depth at which the diluent is breathable to compare the cell PO2 readings against a known FO2 and absolute pressure to verify the displayed values. This test does not only validate the cell. If the sensor does not display the expected value, it is possible that the oxygen sensor, the pressure sensor (depth), or the gas mixture FO2, or any combination of these may be faulty. As all three of these possible faults could be life-threatening, the test is quite powerful.

Few members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions. Under the later Empire at least some of them were of senatorial rank. Origin At least two distinct linguistic origins have been proposed for the nomen Artorius. Schulze, Herbig, and Salomies propose that the name is derived from the Etruscan praenomen Arnthur, perhaps Latinized as Artor.Schulze, Zur Geschichte lateinischer Eigennamen.Herbig, Tituli Faleriorum Veterum, p. 98.Salomies: Die römischen Vornamen, p. 68. Other scholars have proposed a Messapic origin, identifying a nomen Artorres, from an earlier Artas, with a Messapic possessive suffix -or, of uncertain meaning.Chelotti, Morizio, & Silvestrini, Le epigrafi romane di Canosa, pp. 261, 264.Santoro, \\"Per la nuova iscrizione messapica di Oria\\", \\"La Nuova Epigrafe Messapica\\". Some scholars have suggested that Artorius might be the origin of the Welsh name Arthur. Praenomina The chief praenomina of the Artorii were Lucius, Gaius, Marcus, and Quintus, four of the most common names throughout Roman history. Lesser- used praenomina of the Artorii included Gnaeus, Sextus, and Titus, and there are a few examples of other names. Branches and cognomina The Artorii do not appear to have been divided into distinct families, but a number of them used common surnames, such as Secundus, typically designating a second or younger child, and its derivatives.

These assumptions include judgments about the physical properties, purpose, intentions and behavior of people and objects, as well as possible outcomes of their actions and interactions. A device that exhibits commonsense reasoning will be capable of predicting results and drawing conclusions that are similar to humans' folk psychology (humans' innate ability to reason about people's behavior and intentions) and naive physics (humans' natural understanding of the physical world).  Commonsense knowledge  In Artificial intelligence, commonsense knowledge is the set of background information that an individual is intended to know or assume and the ability to use it when appropriate. It is a shared knowledge (between everybody or people in a particular culture or age group only). The way to obtain commonsense is by learning it or experiencing it. In communication, it is what people don't have to say because the interlocutor is expected to know or make a presumption about. = Commonsense knowledge problem = The commonsense knowledge problem is a current project in the sphere of artificial intelligence to create a database that contains the general knowledge most individuals are expected to have, represented in an accessible way to artificial intelligence programs that use natural language. Due to the broad scope of the commonsense knowledge this issue is considered to be among the most difficult ones in the AI research sphere. In order for any task to be done as a human mind would manage it, the machine is required to appear as intelligent as a human being. Such tasks include object recognition, machine translation and text mining. To perform them, the machine has to be aware of the same concepts that an individual, who possess commonsense knowledge, recognizes.  Commonsense in intelligent tasks  In 1961, Bar Hillel first discussed the need and significance of practical knowledge for natural language processing in the context of machine translation. Some ambiguities are resolved by using simple and easy to acquire rules. Others require a broad acknowledgement of the surrounding world, thus they require more commonsense knowledge. For instance when a machine is used to translate a text, problems of ambiguity arise, which could be easily resolved by attaining a concrete and true understanding of the context. Online translators often resolve ambiguities using analogous or similar words. For example, in translating the sentences \\"The electrician is working\\" and \\"The telephone is working\\" into German, the machine translates correctly \\"working\\" in the means of \\"laboring\\" in the first one and as \\"functioning properly\\" in the second one. The machine has seen and read in the body of texts that the German words for \\"laboring\\" and \\"electrician\\" are frequently used in a combination and are found close together. The same applies for \\"telephone\\" and \\"function properly\\". However, the statistical proxy which works in simple cases often fails in complex ones. Existing computer programs carry out simple language tasks by manipulating short phrases or separate words, but they don't attempt any deeper understanding and focus on short-term results. = Computer vision = Issues of this kind arise in computer vision.Antol, Stanislaw, et al. \\"Vqa: Visual question answering.\\" Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision. 2015. For instance when looking at a photograph of a bathroom some items that are small and only partly seen, such as facecloths and bottles, are recognizable due to the surrounding objects (toilet, wash basin, bathtub), which suggest the purpose of the room. In an isolated image they would be difficult to identify. Movies prove to be even more difficult tasks. Some movies contain scenes and moments that cannot be understood by simply matching memorized templates to images. For instance, to understand the context of the movie, the viewer is required to make inferences about characters’ intentions and make presumptions depending on their behavior. In the contemporary state of the art, it is impossible to build and manage a program that will perform such tasks as reasoning, i.e. predicting characters’ actions. The most that can be done is to identify basic actions and track characters. = Robotic manipulation = The need and importance of commonsense reasoning in autonomous robots that work in a real-life uncontrolled environment is evident. For instance, if a robot is programmed to perform the tasks of a waiter on a cocktail party, and it sees that the glass he had picked up is broken, the waiter-robot should not pour liquid into the glass, but instead pick up another one. Such tasks seem obvious when an individual possess simple commonsense reasoning, but to ensure that a robot will avoid such mistakes is challenging.  Successes in automated commonsense reasoning  Significant progress in the field of the automated commonsense reasoning is made in the areas of the taxonomic reasoning, actions and change reasoning, reasoning about time. Each of these spheres has a well-acknowledged theory for wide range of commonsense inferences. = Taxonomic reasoning = Taxonomy is the collection of individuals and categories and their relations. Taxonomies are often referred to as semantic networks. Three basic relations are: * An individual is an instance of a category. For example, the individual Tweety is an instance of the category robin. * One category is a subset of another. For instance robin is a subset of bird. * Two categories are disjoint. For instance robin is disjoint from penguin. Transitivity is one type of inference in taxonomy. Since Tweety is an instance of robin and robin is a subset of bird, it follows that Tweety is an instance of bird. Inheritance is another type of inference. Since Tweety is an instance of robin, which is a subset of bird and bird is marked with property canfly, it follows that Tweety and robin have property canfly. When an individual taxonomizes more abstract categories, outlining and delimiting specific categories becomes more problematic. Simple taxonomic structures are frequently used in AI programs. For instance, WordNet is a resource including a taxonomy, whose elements are meanings of English words. Web mining systems used to collect commonsense knowledge from Web documents focus on taxonomic relations and specifically in gathering taxonomic relations. = Action and change = The theory of action, events and change is another range of the commonsense reasoning. There are established reasoning methods for domains that satisfy the constraints listed below: * Events are atomic, meaning one event occurs at a time and the reasoner needs to consider the state and condition of the world at the start and at the finale of the specific event, but not during the states, while there is still an evidence of on-going changes (progress). * Every single change is a result of some event * Events are deterministic, meaning the world's state at the end of the event is defined by the world's state at the beginning and the specification of the event. * There is a single actor and all events are his actions. * The relevant state of the world at the beginning is either known or can be calculated. = Temporal reasoning = Temporal reasoning is the ability to make presumptions about humans' knowledge of times, durations and time intervals. For example, if an individual knows that Mozart was born after Hadyn and died earlier than him, they can use their temporal reasoning knowledge to deduce that Mozart had died younger than Hadyn. The inferences involved reduce themselves to solving systems of linear inequalities. To integrate that kind of reasoning with concrete purposes, such as natural language interpretation, is more challenging, because natural language expressions have context dependent interpretation.Liu, Hugo, and Push Singh. \\"Commonsense reasoning in and over natural language .\\" International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2004. Simple tasks such as assigning timestamps to procedures cannot be done with total accuracy. = Qualitative reasoning = Qualitative reasoning is the form of commonsense reasoning analyzed with certain success. It is concerned with the direction of change in interrelated quantities. For instance, if the price of a stock goes up, the amount of stocks that are going to be sold will go down. If some ecosystem contains wolves and lambs and the number of wolves decreases, the death rate of the lambs will go down as well. This theory was firstly formulated by Johan de Kleer, who analyzed an object moving on a roller coaster. The theory of qualitative reasoning is applied in many spheres such as physics, biology, engineering, ecology, etc. It serves as the basis for many practical programs, analogical mapping, text understanding.  Challenges in automating commonsense reasoning  As of 2014, there are some commercial systems trying to make the use of commonsense reasoning significant. However, they use statistical information as a proxy for commonsense knowledge, where reasoning is absent. Current programs manipulate individual words, but they don't attempt or offer further understanding. According to Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus, five major obstacles interfere with the producing of a satisfactory \\"commonsense reasoner\\". First, some of the domains that are involved in commonsense reasoning are only partly understood. Individuals are far from a comprehensive understanding of domains as communication and knowledge, interpersonal interactions or physical processes. Second, situations that seem easily predicted or assumed about could have logical complexity, which humans’ commonsense knowledge does not cover. Some aspects of similar situations are studied and are well understood, but there are many relations that are unknown, even in principle and how they could be represented in a form that is usable by computers. Third, commonsense reasoning involves plausible reasoning. It requires coming to a reasonable conclusion given what is already known. Plausible reasoning has been studied for many years and there are a lot of theories developed that include probabilistic reasoning and non-monotonic logic. It takes different forms that include using unreliable data and rules, whose conclusions are not certain sometimes. Fourth, there are many domains, in which a small number of examples are extremely frequent, whereas there is a vast number of highly infrequent examples. Fifth, when formulating presumptions it is challenging to discern and determine the level of abstraction. Compared with humans, as of 2018 existing computer programs perform extremely poorly on modern \\"commonsense reasoning\\" benchmark tests such as the Winograd Schema Challenge. The problem of attaining human-level competency at \\"commonsense knowledge\\" tasks is considered to probably be \\"AI complete\\" (that is, solving it would require the ability to synthesize a human-level intelligence).Yampolskiy, Roman V. \\"AI-Complete, AI-Hard, or AI- Easy-Classification of Problems in AI.\\" MAICS. 2012.Andrich, C, Novosel, L, and Hrnkas, B. (2009). Common Sense Knowledge. Information Search and Retrieval, 2009. Some researchers believe that supervised learning data is insufficient to produce an artificial general intelligence capable of commonsense reasoning, and have therefore turned to less-supervised learning techniques.  Approaches and techniques  Commonsense's reasoning study is divided into knowledge-based approaches and approaches that are based on machine learning over and using a large data corpora with limited interactions between these two types of approaches. There are also crowdsourcing approaches, attempting to construct a knowledge basis by linking the collective knowledge and the input of non-expert people. Knowledge-based approaches can be separated into approaches based on mathematical logic. In knowledge-based approaches, the experts are analyzing the characteristics of the inferences that are required to do reasoning in a specific area or for a certain task. The knowledge-based approaches consist of mathematically grounded approaches, informal knowledge-based approaches and large-scale approaches. The mathematically grounded approaches are purely theoretical and the result is a printed paper instead of a program. The work is limited to the range of the domains and the reasoning techniques that are being reflected on. In informal knowledge-based approaches, theories of reasoning are based on anecdotal data and intuition that are results from empirical behavioral psychology. Informal approaches are common in computer programming. Two other popular techniques for extracting commonsense knowledge from Web documents involve Web mining and Crowd sourcing. COMET (2019), which uses both the OpenAI GPT language model architecture and existing commonsense knowledge bases such as ConceptNet, claims to generate commonsense inferences at a level approaching human benchmarks. Like many other current efforts, COMET over- relies on surface language patterns and is judged to lack deep human-level understanding of many commonsense concepts. Other language-model approaches include training on visual scenes rather than just text, and training on textual descriptions of scenarios involving commonsense physics.Bosselut, Antoine, et al. \\"Comet: Commonsense transformers for automatic knowledge graph construction.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05317 (2019).

His hadith collection, known as Sahih Muslim, is one of the six major hadith collections in Sunni Islam and is regarded as one of the two most authentic (sahih) collections, alongside Sahih al-Bukhari. Biography Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj was born in the town of Nishapur in the Abbasid province of Khorasan, in present-day northeastern Iran. Historians differ as to his date of birth, though it is usually given as 202 AH (817/818), 204 AH (819/820), or 206 AH (821/822). Adh- Dhahabi said, \\"It is said that he was born in the year 204 AH,\\" though he also said, \\"But I think he was born before that.\\" Ibn Khallikan could find no report of Muslim's date of birth, or age at death, by any of the ḥuffāẓ (hadith masters), except their agreement that he was born after 200 AH (815/816). Ibn Khallikan cites Ibn al-Salah, who cites Ibn al-Bayyiʿ's Kitab ʿUlama al-Amsar, in the claim that Muslim was 55 years old when he died on 25 Rajab, 261 AH (May 875) and therefore his year of birth must have been 206 AH (821/822). Ibn al-Bayyiʿ reports that he was buried in Nasarabad, a suburb of Nishapur. According to scholars he was of Arab or Persian origin The nisbah of \\"al-Qushayri\\" signifies Muslim's belonging to the Arab tribe of Banu Qushayr, members of which migrated to the newly conquered Persian territory during the expansion of the Rashidun Caliphate. A scholar named Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī introduced the idea that he may have been a mawla of Persian descent, attributed to the Qushayr tribe by way of wala' (alliance). An ancestor of Muslim may have been a freed slave of a Qushayri, or may have accepted Islam at the hands of a Qushayri. According to 2 other scholars, Ibn al-Athīr and Ibn al-Salāh, he was actually an Arab member of that tribe of which his family had migrated to Iran nearly two centuries earlier following the conquest Estimates on the number of hadiths in his books vary from 3,033 to 12,000, depending on whether duplicates are included, or only the text (isnad) is. His Sahih (\\"authentic\\") is said to share about 2000 hadiths with Bukhari's Sahih.Lu'lu wal Marjan says 1900; Abi Bakr Muhammad b. 'Abdallah al-Jawzaqi apud Brown, 84 counted 2326. The author's teachers included Harmala ibn Yahya, Sa'id ibn Mansur, Abd-Allah ibn Maslamah al-Qa'nabi, al-Dhuhali, al-Bukhari, Ibn Ma'in, Yahya ibn Yahya al-Nishaburi al-Tamimi, and others. Among his students were al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Abi Hatim al-Razi, and Ibn Khuzaymah, each of whom also wrote works on hadith. After his studies throughout the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, Iraq and Syria, he settled in his hometown of Nishapur, where he met, and became a lifelong friend of, Bukhari. Legacy The Sunni scholar Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh was first to recommend Muslim's work. Ishaq's contemporaries did not at first accept this. Abu Zur‘a al-Razi objected that Muslim had omitted too much material which Muslim himself recognised as authentic; and that he included transmitters who were weak. Ibn Abi Hatim (d. 327/938) later accepted Muslim as \\"trustworthy, one of the hadith masters with knowledge of hadith\\"; but this contrasts with much more fulsome praise of Abu Zur‘a and also his father Abu Hatim. It is similar with Ibn al-Nadim. Muslim's book gradually increased in stature such that it is considered among Sunni Muslims the most authentic collections of hadith, second only to Sahih Bukhari.

Located to the south west of Maghull and to the north east of Great Crosby, it is on the flood plain of the River Alt. The village is bisected by the B5422, Brickwall Lane, which cuts also through the site of the moat of Sefton Old Hall, a recognised National Monument. At the 2001 Census the population was recorded as 772, increasing to 855 at the 2011 Census. Historically a part of Lancashire, the name Sefton is thought to be derived from the Old Norse sef, meaning \\"sedge\\" or \\"rushes\\" and tún meaning \\"farmstead\\". In the past Sephton was an alternative spelling. The Parish Church of St Helen (Church of England) - the only Grade I listed building in the Borough - was first built around 1170 as the private chapel of the Molyneux family. This village is home to Sefton Parish Church, Saint Helen's Well, a pre-Reformation shrine, a plague pot, the Grade II listed 'Punch Bowl Inn' and the site of Sefton Mill dating back to the Middle Ages. Local folklore has it that Sefton Hall, a loyalist stronghold, was the scene of a skirmish in the English Civil War. The Georgian Rectory to nearby Sefton Parish Church was demolished in the 1970s, however the gate piers still stand at the entrance to Glebe End. The curate's house, Lunt House, was situated in the nearby hamlet of Lunt. Governance From 1997 until 2010 the village and civil parish of Sefton was part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency represented by George Howarth, a Labour Party MP. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the village now forms part of the new Sefton Central constituency which is represented by the Labour MP Bill Esterson. For elections to Sefton Council the village and civil parish of Sefton is within the Park electoral ward and is represented by three councillors.

It describes the relationship between Krishna and the gopis (female cow herders) of Vrindavana, and in particular one gopi named Radha. The Gita Govinda is organized into twelve chapters. Each chapter is further sub-divided into twenty-four divisions called Prabandhas. The prabandhas contain couplets grouped into eights, called Ashtapadis. It is mentioned that Radha is greater than Krishna. The text also elaborates the eight moods of Heroine, the Ashta Nayika, which has been an inspiration for many compositions and choreographic works in Indian classical dances. Summary The work delineates the love of Krishna for Radha, the milkmaid, his faithlessness and subsequent return to her, and is taken as symbolical of the human soul's straying from its true allegiance but returning at length to the God which created it. Chapters #Sāmodadāmodaram (Exuberant Krishna) # Akleshakeshavam (Blithesome Krishna) # Mugdhamadhusūdanam (Winsome Krishna) # Snigdhamadhusūdanam (Tender Krishna) # Sākāṅkṣa puṇdarīkākṣham (Passionate Krishna) # Dhrṣta vaikuṇṭa (Audacious Krishna) # NāgaranārāyanaH (Dexterous Krishna) # VilakṣyalakṣmīpatiH (Apologetic Krishna) # Mugdhadamukunda (Unpretentious Krishna) # ChaturachaturbhujaH (Tactful Krishna) # Sānandadāmodaram (Joyful Krishna) # SuprītapītāmbaraH (Exultant Krishna) Translations RasaLila by Krishna, in Prem Mandir Vrindavan The poem has been translated into most modern Indian languages and many European languages. There is a German rendering which Goethe read by F. H . van Dalberg. Dalberg's version was based on the English translation done by William Jones published in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta in 1792. A verse translation by the German poet Friedrick Rukert was begun in 1829 and revised according to the edited Sanskrit and Latin translations of C. Lassen in Bonn 1837. There's also another manuscript at the Guimet Museum in Paris in Devanagari script narrating the love between Krishna and Radha. This oblong work is printed on paper in nagari script on seven lines per page, and has a foliation located in the left margin on the reverse. It is made up of 36 folios. This volume is decorated with a snow crystal motif scattered throughout the text, a practice typical of the Indian publisher Baburam. This edition was produced in Calcutta in 1808, in imitation of the manuscripts; devoid of title page, it is accompanied by a colophon.

He was noted as founder and editor of International Reports, a New York-based weekly publication he created in 1947 and sold to the London Financial Times in 1983, and author of The Vampire Economy (1939) about what he described as the onerous business policy of the National Socialist German Workers Party and its disastrous effects on the German economy. Prior to World War II, Reimann was a member of the Communist Party of Germany and at the forefront of the underground resistance to Adolf Hitler within Nazi Germany. Biography Reimann was born Hans Steinicke in Angermünde (near Berlin), German Empire: the Steinickes were a bourgeois German-Jewish family.https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/01/guardianobituaries.germany Drawn to the left-wing intelligentsia at an early age in Berlin, Reimann associated and worked with Ernst Thälmann, Anna Seghers and Walter Ulbricht at the Romanisches Café. Still a teenager, Reimann assumed the position of economics editor for the communist newspaper, Die Rote Fahne, taking on the pen-name of Günter Reimann. After the Reichstag fire in February 1933, Reimann went underground to oppose the new National Socialist regime under the resistance movement of the German social democrats and communists. In 1934, the Gestapo continued zeroing in on his location, finally raiding his house and arresting Hu Lanqi, who later became the first female general of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. Reimann fled to France and then London. After arriving in London, he wrote The Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism, published in 1939. In that treatise, Reimann documented how the oppressive rule of the Nazi regime crushed the autonomy of the private sector through severe regulations and the threat of confiscatory fines for petty offenses. As an economist, he later founded the \\"International Reports on Finance and Currencies\\" financial newsletter in 1947. He also authored Patents for Hitler in 1942. After his migration to the United States, he lived in New York City, where he met Miriam Weber, a socialist activist, who he later married and fathered two children, before the two divorced. He then married Jutta Ruesch, a German citizen, and they subsequently had two children. Reimann later moved to Manhasset, Long Island, New York. In 2004, Reimann was awarded Germany's Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit, the nation's highest civilian award. He died at the age of 100 on February 5, 2005. Reimann is survived by his wife Jutta, his four children, 2 grandchildren and 5 great- grandchildren.

It was edited by Douglas Adams and Peter Fincham and contained contributions from Adams and many of the leading comedy writers and performers of the day.  Contents  The book is of particular interest to fans of Douglas Adams' work as it contains several items written by him which are hard to find or exclusive to the collection. Besides the novella Young Zaphod Plays it Safe and the short story \\"The Private Life of Genghis Khan\\", which have since appeared in The Salmon of Doubt, the book also contains Adams' short story \\"A Christmas Fairly Story\\" (written in collaboration with Terry Jones) and three supplements to The Meaning of Liff. Items by other authors include: * Adrian Mole's Christmas, an addition to Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole series (later included in The True Confessions of Adrian Albert Mole). * A New Decade of Heroic Failures, an exclusive addition to Stephen Pile's Book of Heroic Failures. * Tie-ins to popular TV comedies of the day including Yes Minister, The Young Ones and Spitting Image. Fundraising The book promised that profits would be distributed \\"80% to SAVE THE CHILDREN FUND and OXFAM for famine relief and 20% to Charity Projects to support young people faced with the problems of drug abuse, homelessness and disability here in Britain.\\" Censorship The book has never been reprinted following its initial print run, as a result of religious censorship. In line with its Christmas theme the book contained several pieces based on the Christian nativity story, including: * The Gospel According to a Sheep by Richard Curtis with additions by Douglas Adams. This tells the story of the nativity night from the point of view of a sheep that gets eaten as part of the celebrations, and therefore has a slightly jaundiced view of the whole affair. * The Young Ones' Nativity Play in which the characters from The Young Ones act out the nativity story in typically irreverent style. * Jesus' Birthday in which Jesus is portrayed as a grumpy and mischievous child in a modern household. Nicholas Winterton MP led a campaign to ask W.H. Smith not to stock the book. Christian groups took offence, and attempted to get the book withdrawn. They picketed bookshops and threatened to sue for blasphemy. Eventually they prevented the book from being reprinted by applying pressure on the publisher, Collins. Collins held the rights to print certain versions of the Bible and it was threatened that these would be withdrawn. Douglas Adams complained that, as a result, considerably less money was raised for famine relief.

He is most known for his epic poem Gita Govinda which concentrates on Krishna's love with the cowherdess, Radha in a rite of spring. This poem, which presents the view that Radha is greater than Krishna, is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism.http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2008/May-2008/engpdf/Poet39-40.pdf Little is known of his life, except that he was a loner poet and a Hindu mendicant celebrated for his poetic genius in eastern India. Jayadeva's ashtapadis are central to the repertoire of Odissi music, the traditional classical music of the state of Odisha. Jayadeva is the earliest dated author of hymns that are included the Guru Granth Sahib, the primary scripture of Sikhism – a religion founded in the Indian subcontinent centuries after his death. Biography A Brahmin by birth, the date and place of Jayadeva's birth are uncertain (see Jayadeva birth controversy). The Gitagovinda suggests that he was born in the \\"Kindubilva\\" village: scholars of Odisha, Bengal and Mithila have variously identified this place with a present-day village in their own region, including Kenduli Sasan near Puri in Odisha, Jaydev Kenduli in Birbhum district, and or the village of Kenduli Kenduli near Jhanjharpur in Mithila (Bihar). Recent studies show scholars still disagree on the issue. Jayadeva, a wanderer, probably visited Puri at some point and there, according to tradition, he married a dancer named Padmavati though that is not supported by early commentators and modern scholars. Ancient stone idol of Jayadeba at Akhandaleswara Temple, Prataparudrapura, Odisha The poet's parents were named Bhojadeva and Ramadevi. From temple inscriptions it is now known that Jayadeva received his education in Sanskrit poetry from a place called Kurmapataka, possibly near Konark in Odisha. = Historical records on Jayadeva's life = Inscriptions at Lingaraj temple, and the more recently discovered Madhukeswar temple and Simhachal temple that were read and interpreted by Satyanarayana Rajguru have shed some light on Jayadeva's early life. These inscriptions narrate how Jayadeva had been a member of the teaching faculty of the school at Kurmapataka. He might have studied at Kurmapataka as well. It must have been right after his childhood education in Kenduli Sasan that he left for Kurmapataka and gained experience in composing poetry, music and dancing. Literary contributions 335x335px Basohli painting () depicting a scene from Jayadeva's Gita Govinda. A few poems of Jayadeva written in archaic Odia have been published by the Directorate of Culture, Odisha. They describe the romance of Radha-Krishna and contain ideas very similar to those used in the Gita Govinda. Jayadeva is widely considered as one of the earliest musicians of Odissi music. Every night during the Badasinghara or the last ritual of the Jagannatha temple of Puri, the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva is sung, set to traditional Odissi ragas & talas. This tradition has continued unbroken since the time of Jayadeva, who himself used to sing in the temple. After the time of the poet, the singing of the Gitagovinda according to the authentic Odissi ragas & talas was instated as a mandatory sevā at the temple, to be performed by the Maharis or Devadasis, systematically recorded in inscriptions, the Mādalā Pānji and other official documents that describe the functioning of the temple. To this date, the Jagannatha temple remains the fountainhead of Odissi music and the most ancient & authentic compositions (including a few archaic Odia chhandas and jananas by Jayadeva himself) survive in the temple tradition, although the Devadasis are no more found owing to their systematic eradication by the British government. Two hymns of Jayadeva, have been incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikh religion. The hymns are written in a mixture of Sanskrit and eastern Apabhramsha. There are records narrating how Jayadeva's work had a profound influence on Guru Nanak during his visit to Puri.

The title refers to dialogue from Shakespeare's Macbeth. Plot Hurlyburly depicts the intersecting lives of several low-to-mid-level Hollywood players in the 1980s. Fueled by large quantities of drugs, they attempt to find meaning in their isolated, empty lives. Title The title (meaning \\"noisy confusion\\" or \\"tumult\\") is derived from dialogue in Act I, Scene I of Shakespeare's Macbeth: *First Witch: \\"When shall we three meet again / In thunder, lightning, or in rain?\\" *Second Witch: \\"When the hurlyburly's done, / When the battle's lost and won.\\" Production history The play's first staging was produced by the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. It opened Off-Broadway at Manhattan's Promenade Theatre in June 1984. The Broadway production, directed by Mike Nichols, opened on August 7, 1984 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where it ran for 343 performances. The original cast included William Hurt, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel, Jerry Stiller, Judith Ivey, Sigourney Weaver, and Cynthia Nixon. Nixon was performing in The Real Thing at the same time. (The timing of her entrance and exit in each play allowed her to run back and forth between the two theatres, located two blocks from each other.) Replacements later in the run included Danny Aiello, Susan Anton, Christine Baranski, Frank Langella, Ron Silver, John Rubinstein and Candice Bergen. A 2005 Off-Broadway revival was produced by The New Group, and starred Ethan Hawke, Josh Hamilton, Bobby Cannavale, Parker Posey, Wallace Shawn, Halley Wegryn Gross, and Catherine Kellner. Elizabeth Berkley took over from Catherine Kellner and received much praise, with Charles Isherwood of The New York Times even going as far as apologizing to her for his past criticisms of her ability, stating that the fact she held \\"her own among this skilled company of scene-stealers is a testament to how much her talent has grown\\".

Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall safety of the planned dive, by reducing the risk of decompression sickness and/or nitrogen narcosis, and may improve ease of breathing. Filling cylinders with a mixture of gases has dangers for both the filler and the diver. During filling there is a risk of fire due to use of oxygen and a risk of explosion due to the use of high- pressure gases. The composition of the mix must be safe for the depth and duration of the planned dive. If the concentration of oxygen is too lean the diver may lose consciousness due to hypoxia and if it is too rich the diver may suffer oxygen toxicity. The concentration of inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, are planned and checked to avoid nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness. Methods used include batch mixing by partial pressure or by mass fraction, and continuous blending processes. Completed blends are analysed for composition for the safety of the user. Gas blenders may be required by legislation to prove competence if filling for other persons. Application For some diving, gas mixtures other than normal atmospheric air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% trace gases) can be used to advantage, so long as the diver is competent in their use. The most commonly used mixture is nitrox, also referred to as Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN), which is air with extra oxygen, often with 32% or 36% oxygen, and thus less nitrogen, reducing the risk of decompression sickness or allowing longer exposure to the same pressure for equal risk. The reduced nitrogen may also allow for no stops or shorter decompression stop times or a shorter surface interval between dives. A common misconception is that nitrox can reduce narcosis, but research has shown that oxygen is also narcotic. The increased partial pressure of oxygen due to the higher oxygen content of nitrox increases the risk of oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of the mixture. To displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox. For dives requiring long decompression stops, divers may carry cylinders containing different gas mixtures for the various phases of the dive, typically designated as Travel, Bottom, and Decompression gases. These different gas mixtures may be used to extend bottom time, reduce inert gas narcotic effects, and reduce decompression times.  Hazards  There are several hazards associated with gas mixing: * cylinders are filled with high pressure gas. If there is any damage or corrosion in the pressure vessel or valves of the cylinder, this is the occasion when they are most likely to fail structurally. * oxygen supports combustion; if it comes into contact with fuel and heat the three ingredients for a fire exist. Fires in the presence of high concentrations of oxygen burn more vigorously than those in air. A fire in the presence of high-pressure gas may cause cylinders to fail. * other high- pressure equipment such as whips, compressors, gas banks and valves are used, which can cause injury if the pressure is released or there is a mechanical failure while under pressure * there are dangers of fire from the fuel and electric power supplies of the compressor * there are dangers of injury from the moving parts of the compressor * there is the possibility of asphyxiation due to the presence, in a confined space, of large concentrations of gases that contain no oxygen, such as helium It is possible for gas blenders to create toxic and dangerous gas mixes for divers. Too much or too little oxygen in the mix can be fatal for the diver. Oxygen analysers are used to measure the oxygen content of the mix after blending. Inadequate mixing may cause inaccurate analysis. To ensure that the composition of the gas is known by the end user, the contents are analysed in the presence of the diver who acknowledges the contents by signing a log. It is possible that toxic contaminants, such as carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon lubricants, will enter the cylinders from the diving air compressor. This is generally a problem with the compressor maintenance or location of the air input to the compressor though it can be from other sources. Toxic contaminants can also get into the breathing mix if any material inside the blending valves or pipes burns, for instance when adiabatic heating occurs when decanting or boosting oxygen.  Oxygen precautions  In the presence of large volumes of high-pressure oxygen, one corner of fire triangle exists in good measure. It is vital the other two corners are not allowed to exist. Internally, the blending equipment and diving cylinders must be oxygen clean; all fuels and particles which could be sources of ignition must be removed. The materials chosen for use in the valves, joints and compressors must be oxygen compatible: they must not burn or degrade readily in high oxygen environments. In gas blending, high temperatures are easily produced, by adiabatic heating, simply by decanting high-pressure gas into lower pressure pipes or cylinders. The pressure falls as the gas leaves the opened valve but then increases when the gas encounters obstructions such as a cylinder or a bend, constriction or particle in the pipe-work. One simple way to reduce the heat of decanting is to open valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low- pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration. Spaces where gas is blended or oxygen is stored should be well ventilated to avoid high concentrations of oxygen and the risk of fire.  Blending nitrox  With nitrox there are several methods of gas mixing: * Mixing by partial pressure: a measured pressure of oxygen is decanted into the cylinder and cylinder is \\"topped up\\" with air from the diving air compressor. For mixtures with oxygen fraction of 40% or more, the delivered air quality must be suited for oxygen service. This is usually achieved by using a suitable grade of oil and an extra in-line filter to reduce the residual oil contamination in the compressed air to the more stringent requirements for blending with high oxygen partial pressure gases. Cylinders used for partial pressure blending and for mixtures with oxygen fraction greater than 40% are required by law in some countries to be cleaned for oxygen service. * Pre-mix decanting: the gas supplier provides large cylinders with popular mixes such as 32% and 36%. * Mixing by continuous blending: measured quantities of oxygen are introduced to the compressor inlet. The compressor and particularly the compressor oil, must be suitable for this service. If the oxygen fraction is less than 40%, some countries do not require the cylinder and valve to be cleaned for oxygen service. * Mixing by mass fraction: oxygen is added to a partially full cylinder that is accurately weighed until the required mix is achieved. * Mixing by gas separation: a nitrogen permeable membrane is used to remove some of the smaller nitrogen molecules from low-pressure air until the required mix is achieved. The resulting low-pressure nitrox is then pumped into cylinders by a compressor. Blending helium mixes Helium mixes may be made by partial pressure blending, mass fraction blending or compressing a premix blended at atmospheric pressure (continuous blending). =Partial pressure blending= Gas is mixed by decanting or compressing the component gases into a high- pressure cylinder, measured by partial pressure, added in sequence, and corrected for temperature. With trimix, measured pressures of oxygen and helium are decanted into a cylinder, which is \\"topped up\\" with air from the diving gas compressor, resulting in a three gas mix of oxygen, helium and nitrogen. An alternative is to first decant helium into a cylinder and then top it up to the working pressure with a known nitrox mix. Both NAUI and TDI offer courses using a trimix that they call \\"helitrox\\", blended by the latter method, which limit the fraction of helium to about 17–20%. Mixtures made by blending helium with nitrox containing around one-third oxygen such as EAN32 (a common premixed nitrox) have the desirable property that at their maximum operating depth for a partial pressure of oxygen of 1.4 bar, their equivalent narcotic depth is always approximately , a safe limit. With heliox, measured pressures of oxygen and helium are decanted or pumped into a cylinder, resulting in a two gas mix of oxygen and helium. With heliair, a measured pressure of helium is decanted into a cylinder, which is \\"topped up\\" with air from the diving gas compressor, resulting in a three gas mix of oxygen, helium and nitrogen, with the nitrogen:oxygen ratio fixed at 4:1. =Mass fraction blending= Mass fraction blending requires an accurate scale which should preferably be capable of being set to zero with the empty cylinder connected to the filling whip standing on the scale. The masses of the gases to be mixed must be calculated based on the final partial pressure ratio and total pressure, and the cylinder is filled to the appropriate weight corresponding to the added weight of each component. The advantage of this system is that temperature does not affect the accuracy, as pressure is not measured during the process. The disadvantage is that helium has a much lower density than the other components, and a small error in measured mass of helium will result in a relatively large error in composition. =Continuous blending and compression= Principle Continuous blending is the process of adding the component gases of the mixture together as a continuous process and then compressing the mixture into a storage cylinder. The intention is to supply the component gases to the intake of the compressor in a continuous flow at a pressure suited to the compressor design, already mixed to the correct specification. This generally requires equipment to monitor and control the flow of the input gases, which are usually supplied from high-pressure storage cylinders, excepting for air which is normally taken from the ambient surroundings. Mixing the gases Schematic diagram of a mixing tube with oxygen sensors for continuous trimix blending. A Tx16/50 blend in this example Most high-pressure breathing gas compressors are designed to accept intake gas at normal atmospheric pressure. and one of the usual components for breathing gas mixtures for diving is atmospheric air, so it is convenient to blend the gases at atmospheric pressure in an accessory to the compressor called a mixing tube or blending stick. The mixing tube may be constructed in a variety of ways, providing that it does not unduly restrict flow, and adequately mixes the gases before analysis and before intake into the compressor. A large range of commercially produced and home made blending tubes have been successfully used. One popular configuration for the mixing tube is a large bore tube with a series of internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction. Continuous blending by adding oxygen and helium in series allows change in oxygen partial pressure to be used as a proxy for helium content measurement. The oxygen is added first, and PO2 measured after mixing, then helium is added in a second mixing tube and PO2 measured at the outlet after mixing. The difference in PO2 can be used to calculate PHe, or conversely, a desired trimix product partial pressures can be used to calculate the PO2 for the nitrox and trimix stages of the blend. :Example: ::Desired product 50% heliun, 16% oxygen, remainder nitrogen (34%). The PO2 after the helium addition must be 0.16 bar if there is negligible pressure loss. ::The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen must be 16:34, which gives 16/(16+34) = 32% oxygen, or a 0.32 bar PO2 for the nitrox. ::These values will be affected by pressure losses in the mixing tubes, so some empirical calibration may be required. Gas flow rates are usually controlled by an industrial gas regulator on the cylinder, and may be measured by an industrial flow meter. Measurement of flow rate can be a substitute for analysis of the mixed gas, but is generally less accurate in predicting the delivered mixture due to variations in temperature and gas delivery efficiency of the compressor, which may vary as the delivery pressure changes. The blended gases at the intake to the compressor will be at a pressure slightly below ambient, due to losses in the blending tube. This may make it impracticable to use some types of analysis instruments, which rely on a flow of gas through the instrument driven by the pressure of the measured gas. Oxygen cells are also sensitive to a pressure drop, as they directly measure partial pressure, and this may lead to a mix richer than intended, as the oxygen flow may be set to the partial pressure appropriate for atmospheric pressure, while the measured mixture is at a lower pressure. This can be compensated by using a small sampling pump drawing gas from the blending tube and delivering it to the instruments, or by allowing for the reduced inlet pressure for oxygen analysis with an in-line sensor cell. This would require a vacuum gauge measuring the pressure drop or absolute pressure at the sensor. Partial pressure of oxygen must be correct as a fraction of absolute pressure at the point of measurement. Compression Many high-pressure compressors used for breathing gases are suitable for compressing breathing gas mixtures containing moderate fractions of oxygen and helium, but the manufacturer should be consulted regarding limits on both gases. Compression of mixtures with a high fraction of oxygen are an increased fire hazard, and the compressor lubricant must be compatible to minimise this risk. Helium poses a very different problem, as it is totally inert, and creates no fire hazard directly, but its temperature rises more than oxygen and nitrogen when compressed, which can cause a compressor designed for air to overheat. This can eventually lead to problems with the compressor lubricant and bearings, and if the oxygen fraction is also high, this will increase the fire hazard. Fortunately most Trimix blends have an oxygen fraction inversely related to the helium fraction, which reduces the probability of this problem. Analysis of the mix The mixed gas must be analysed before use, as an inaccurate assumption of composition can lead to problems of hypoxia or oxygen toxicity in the case of the oxygen analysis, and decompression sickness if the inert gas components differ from the planned composition. Analysis of oxygen fraction is usually done using an electro-galvanic oxygen sensor, whereas helium fraction is usually done by a heat transfer comparison between the analysed gas and a standard sample. Quantities and accuracy To avoid oxygen toxicity and narcosis, the diver needs to plan the required mix to be blended and to check the proportions of oxygen and inert gases in the blended mix before diving. Generally the tolerance of each final component gas fraction should be within +/-1% of the required fraction. Analysis instruments commonly used by recreational/technical diving gas blenders are typically capable of a resolution of 0.1% for both oxygen and helium. =Calculating composition= When blending mixes with pressures up to about , the Ideal gas law provides a reasonable approximation and simple equations can be used to calculate the pressures of each component gas needed to create the mix. At this pressure and normal temperatures, air departs from linearity by about 5%, e.g. a 10-litre cylinder filled to 230 bar with air only contains about 95% of the expected 2300 litres of free air. Above this pressure, the composition of the final mix is difficult to predict using simple equations but needs the more complex Van der Waals equation. Ideal gas calculations Partial pressure blending using ideal gas calculations is fairly straightforward. The required mixture is chosen, either as a best mix which optimises the decompression advantages for acceptable oxygen exposure based on the planned dive profile, or selected from a range of standardised mixes suitable for a range of depths and times, or optimised to suit available gas stocks or other constraints. The mixture is specified in terms of gas fractions of the component gases, and the convention is to specify the type, (nitrox, trimix or heliox) and composition as percentage by volume of oxygen, helium if present, and nitrogen. The remainder of nitrogen is not always specifically stated, and is assumed to be the balance. :Examples: :* \\"Tx 20/40\\" (or Tx 20/40/40) would be a trimix blend with 20% oxygen, 40% helium and the remaining 40% nitrogen. This would be suitable for depths up to if the partial pressure of oxygen is to be limited to 1.4 bar. This is a normoxic blend and is safe to use at the surface. :* \\"He/O2 12/88\\" would be a heliox blend with 12% oxygen and 88% helium. This gas would be used in commercial diving to depths up to about , depending on duration, but can not be used shallower than about without risk of hypoxia. :* \\"Nitrox 32\\", or EAN 32, would be a nitrox blend with 32% oxygen and 68% nitrogen. This is a popular recreational blend for dives to depths up to . The nitrogen in the mixture is almost always provided by topping up the cylinder with air to the filling pressure. All helium, and some of the oxygen is provided by decanting or boosting from bulk cylinders. The amount of helium that must be decanted is very simple to calculate: Multiply the desired gas fraction of helium (FHe) by the total filling pressure (Ptot) to get partial pressure of helium (PHe). In the case of the Tx 20/40, in a 230 bar cylinder, this would be 230 bar x 40% = 92 bar (or for a 3,000 psi fill, it would require 3,000 x 40% = 1,200 psi of helium). The amount of oxygen is more difficult to calculate, as it is derived from two sources, the added oxygen and the air top-up. However, all of the nitrogen is provided by the air top- up, so the partial pressure of the nitrogen is calculated in a similar way as for helium, which allows the pressure of the air to be calculated, assuming nitrogen to be 79% of the air. In the Tx 20/40 example, the fraction of nitrogen is 100% - (20% + 40%) = 40%. The required partial pressure of nitrogen is therefore 230 bar x 40% = 92 bar, so the air top-up pressure is 92 bar/79% = 116 bar (for a 3,000 psi fill this would be 3,000 x 40% / 79% = 1,500 psi of air). The remaining pressure of 230 bar - 92 bar - 116 bar = 22 bar is the added oxygen pressure required for the mix (for a 3,000 psi fill this would be 3,000 - 1,200 - 1,500 = 300 psi of oxygen). =Real gas effects= Comparison of compressibility versus pressure for typical breathing gases for diving at 293K (20°C) At pressures above about 200 bar the compression of gases begins to deviate from the ideal gas laws, and consequently partial pressure blending must take into account that the gases added at higher pressure will provide lower volumetric proportion than gases added at lower pressure, and these deviations from linearity will vary according to the gas. Calculations for high pressure partial pressure blends may require use of the Van der Waals equation. This does not affect premixed gases, which will retain their mix ratio at any pressure, so continuous blending is not affected by this problem. Both nitrogen and oxygen compress relatively linearly and will approximate the ideal gas to much higher pressures than helium, which deviates significantly even below 200 bar. Air and nitrox mixtures can be approximated as ideal without significant error up to about 230 bar at normal temperatures. = Effects of adiabatic heating = Increases in temperature when filling make it difficult to accurately decant or pump a measured quantity of gas based on pressure measurement. When cylinders are filled with gas quickly, typically in 10 to 60 minutes at a dive filling station, the gas inside gets hot, which increases the pressure of the gas relative to its mass. When the cylinder cools, the gas pressure falls resulting in a reduced volume of breathable gas available to the diver. There are several solutions to this problem: * fill the cylinder to the required pressure, let the cylinder cool and measure the gas pressure and then repeat the process until the correct pressure is achieved. The cooling interval needed depends on the ambient temperature. This step must be followed for each component of the mixture. * fill the cylinders in a water bath. The higher thermal conductivity of water compared to air means that heat in the cylinder is more quickly removed from the cylinder as it fills. For this to produce accurate results, the filling must be slow enough to avoid a significant temperature rise. This is very slow. * fill the cylinders with 5 to 20% more gas (as pressure readings) than required. If the overfill (in pressure while hot) is well judged, when the cylinder cools the final pressure will be within the tolerance of the required pressure. This is relatively quick, but requires good judgement based on experience, or measurement of the temperature of the gases in the cylinder after each stage of the mixing, and corrections must be made to allow for the influence of the temperature. = Gas analysis = Analysing a trimix blend using a portable helium analyzer Two oxygen cells as used by oxygen anylysers for diving gas Oxygen and helium analyser for breathing gas for diving Before a gas mix leaves the blending station and before the diver breathes from it, the fraction of oxygen in the mix should be checked. Usually electro-galvanic oxygen sensors are used to measure the oxygen fraction. Helium analyzers also exist, although they are expensive at present, which allow the Trimix diver to find out the proportion of helium in the mix. It is important that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the results will be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends. Reliable specifications for the amount of agitation required for complete mixing are not available, but if the analysis remains the same before and after agitation the gas is probably fully mixed. Once mixed, gas will not stratify with time.  Gas supplies  In the United Kingdom and South Africa, oxygen and helium are bought from commercial industrial and medical gas suppliers and typically delivered in 50 litre \\"J\\" cylinders at a maximum of 200 bar. In addition to the cost of the gas, charges may be made for cylinder rental and delivery. The \\"cascade system\\" is used to decant economically from banks of storage cylinders so that the maximum possible gas is removed from the bank. This involves filling a diving cylinder by decanting from the bank cylinder with the lowest pressure that is higher than the diving cylinder's pressure and then from the next higher pressure bank cylinder in succession until the diving cylinder is full. The system maximises the use of low- pressure bank gas and minimises the use of high-pressure bank gas. Small portable high pressure breathing gas booster pump Booster pumps, such as the Haskel pump, can be used to scavenge the remnants of expensive gases in nearly empty cylinders allowing low-pressure gases to be pumped safely into cylinders already containing gas at higher pressure.

In this shallow approach, statistical heuristics are used to identify the most salient sentences of a text. Sentence extraction is a low-cost approach compared to more knowledge-intensive deeper approaches which require additional knowledge bases such as ontologies or linguistic knowledge. In short \\"sentence extraction\\" works as a filter which allows only important sentences to pass. The major downside of applying sentence-extraction techniques to the task of summarization is the loss of coherence in the resulting summary. Nevertheless, sentence extraction summaries can give valuable clues to the main points of a document and are frequently sufficiently intelligible to human readers.  Procedure  Usually, a combination of heuristics is used to determine the most important sentences within the document. Each heuristic assigns a (positive or negative) score to the sentence. After all heuristics have been applied, the highest-scoring sentences are included in the summary. The individual heuristics are weighted according to their importance. = Early approaches and some sample heuristics = Seminal papers which laid the foundations for many techniques used today have been published by Hans Peter Luhn in 1958 and H. P Edmundson in 1969. Luhn proposed to assign more weight to sentences at the beginning of the document or a paragraph. Edmundson stressed the importance of title-words for summarization and was the first to employ stop-lists in order to filter uninformative words of low semantic content (e.g. most grammatical words such as \\"of\\", \\"the\\", \\"a\\"). He also distinguished between bonus words and stigma words, i.e. words that probably occur together with important (e.g. the word form \\"significant\\") or unimportant information. His idea of using key-words, i.e. words which occur significantly frequently in the document, is still one of the core heuristics of today's summarizers. With large linguistic corpora available today, the tf–idf value which originated in information retrieval, can be successfully applied to identify the key words of a text: If for example the word \\"cat\\" occurs significantly more often in the text to be summarized (TF = \\"term frequency\\") than in the corpus (IDF means \\"inverse document frequency\\"; here the corpus is meant by \\"document\\"), then \\"cat\\" is likely to be an important word of the text; the text may in fact be a text about cats.

The form of the result is that other coefficients may be used, at the cost of using a Tor functor. For example it is common to take to be , so that coefficients are modulo 2. This becomes straightforward in the absence of 2-torsion in the homology. Quite generally, the result indicates the relationship that holds between the Betti numbers of and the Betti numbers with coefficients in a field .

According to the Max Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary, the name of the lake originates from the Finnic Ilmajärvi, which means \\"air lake\\". Thanks to Novgorodian colonisation, many lakes in Russia have names deriving from Lake Ilmen. Yuri Otkupshchikov has argued that the presence of the name \\"Ilmen\\" in Southern Russia can't be explained by the Novgorodian colonisation alone, and proposed a Slavic etymology instead.

(in Russian) The average surface area is (it may vary between and depending on water level). The lake is fed by 52 inflowing rivers, the four main ones being the Msta, the Pola, the Lovat, and the Shelon. It is drained through a single outlet, the Volkhov, into Lake Ladoga, and subsequently via the Neva into the Gulf of Finland. The source of the Volkhov is marked by the Peryn Chapel built in the 1220s. The basin of Lake Ilmen contains vast areas in Novgorod, Pskov, and Tver Oblasts of Russia, as well as minor areas in the north of Vitebsk Region in Belarus. The water level is regulated by the Volkhov hydroelectric plant situated downstream the Volkhov River. Water temperature in July is 19-20 °C. The bathing season is about 90 days. Lake Ilmen is navigable. Shipping lines are Veliky Novgorod - Staraya Russa and Veliky Novgorod - Shimsk. There is a fishery in the lake. The lake area was the location of an important battle during World War II, the Demyansk Pocket.

Life  = Early life = Stojan Jovanović () was born on 28 December 1610, in the village of Mrkonjići at the bottom of the Popovo field in the Ljubinje nahija (Herzegovina), at the time part of the Ottoman Empire. His father was Petar Stojanović and his mother was Ana. He was a diligent and obedient child, and he inherited his graciousness and benevolence from his parents. Having raised cattle on the Herzegovinian hills and mountain slopes, he shared all of his food with poorer people. The Ottomans started to notice him, unenthusiastically monitoring this gifted young man. His parents, in order to avoid any danger, took him to the nearby Zavala Monastery, where his paternal uncle, the hieromonk Serafim served as the hegumen of the monastery. There he would study, and be protected. Ostrog Monastery in Bjelopavlići = Studies = Having a rich library at his hands, the young Vasilije especially liked the cells dug into the rocks above the monastery church of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. His character quickly made him a master of the Bible and basic Christian mysteries. After a while his uncle sent his protégé to the Monastery of the Most Holy Mother of God, the Tvrdoš Monastery in Trebinje, for further spiritual and theological studies. = Bishop of Zahumlje = St. Basil's modesty made him reluctant to occupy high positions. However, his piety, humility and dedication to the Church made him well suited for the role and he was elected as Bishop of Zahumlje and Skenderija, which he reluctantly accepted in 1639. He retired from the position ten years later in 1649.  Legacy  Monastery of St. Basil of Ostrog in Bijeljina After his death in 1671 he was buried at the Ostrog Monastery he had founded in Montenegro, and his tomb in a cave-church soon became a site of pilgrimage for Christians (both Orthodox and Roman Catholic) and Muslims drawn by reports of miracles occurring through the intercession of the saint. The Monastery of Ostrog is now one of the major pilgrimage sites in the Balkans, and large numbers of pilgrims gather particularly at Pentecost. St. Basil of Ostrog is commemorated in the Serbian orthodox liturgical calendar on April 29 (May 12 in the Gregorian Calendar). The Orthodox seminary in East Sarajevo (Pravoslavni bogoslovski fakultet Sveti Vasilije Ostroški), part of the University of East Sarajevo, is named after him. A church in Nalježići, in the Grbalj region is named after him.

The team was created by Bob Rozakis and Dick Ayers in the pages of Freedom Fighters #7 (March 1977). The characters serve as stand-ins for several Marvel Comics superheroes from the 1940s, while the team roster resembles the line-up of The Invaders. Fictional team history The Crusaders were a metafictional team of superheroes appearing in comic books on Earth-One during World War II. The Crusaders appeared \\"for real\\" on Earth-One during the 1970s, offering their services to New York City District Attorney David Pearson to help capture the Freedom Fighters, who were at that time fugitives because they were believed to have been working with the villainous Silver Ghost. Pearson gave the Crusaders the authority to pursue Uncle Sam and his group after a report that they had caused a blackout in upstate New York. After a lengthy fight, at the end of which the Crusaders are defeated, the Freedom Fighters ask the Crusaders how they became the comic book heroes of World War II. The group revealed that the Americommando had approached a group of young comic book collectors at a convention (Marvin, Lennie, Arch, and Roy) and had offered to recreate them as his former teammates, using a special device to transform them into their superpowered identities. Meanwhile, the others had caught up to the Americommando and Martha Roberts. The villain dropped Martha, but the Ray was able to save her. He left Martha with Doll Man and headed off after the Americommando. The Ray again caught up with him and the sky battle between them burned off the Americommando's mask, revealing him to indeed be the Silver Ghost. The fight also attracted the attention of some state trooper helicopters, which swooped in to arrest both of them. The Ray accidentally hit one of the helicopters with an energy blast, prompting the troopers to open fire. The Ray was wounded and fell to Earth. The Silver Ghost gloated and left him to die. The Ray was later rescued by Rod Reilly, the Golden Age Firebrand who had emigrated to Earth-One some time prior to the Freedom Fighters. The Crusaders fought among themselves until finally, after being deserted by the Americommando, they reveal their origins. They disappeared at the end of the story and there was no sign that they have lost their powers, but they never appear again. There was never an explanation of how the Silver Ghost gained super-strength or developed the technology to turn comic fans into superheroes. Members The Crusaders only appeared in Freedom Fighters #7–9. The names of the team are actually taken from obscure Golden Age superheroes. *The Americommando – Based on Captain America, he was actually the Silver Ghost *Barracuda – Based on Namor the Sub-Mariner *Fireball – Based on the android Human Torch *Rusty – Based on Bucky *Sparky – Based on Toro Updated versions of the Americommando and Barracuda have since appeared in the miniseries Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters (2006–2007), as part of the team called First Strike. However, it is doubtful that their pre-Crisis history is still canonical. In Lord Havok and the Extremists, Barracuda and the Americommando are also members of Earth-8's Meta-Militia, an updated version of the Champions of Angor. In the 2007–2008 Uncle Sam series, a new team of Crusaders, gathered and controlled by the government, were introduced including Captain Triumph, Citizen X, Libertine, and Magno. After they are freed from their mind-controlled state, they team up with Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters. Citizen X and Libertine are killed by alien insects, but Captain Triumph and Magno both go on to continue their superhero careers.

Some were armed with sticks and stones. After seven men were shot and killed by the volunteer militia, the protesters attacked and burned the court house and nearby buildings. A total of 25 people died. Over the next two days, peasants rose up across St. Thomas-in-the-East parish and controlled most of the area.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), p. xiii. The Jamaicans were protesting injustice and widespread poverty. Most freedmen were prevented from voting by high poll taxes, and their living conditions had worsened following crop damage by floods, cholera and smallpox epidemics, and a long drought. A few days before, when police tried to arrest a man for disrupting a trial, a fight broke out against them by spectators. Officials had issued a warrant for the arrest of preacher Bogle. Governor Edward John Eyre declared martial law in the area, ordering in troops to hunt down the rebels. They killed many innocent black individuals, including women and children, with an initial death toll of more than 400. Troops arrested more than 300 persons, including Bogle. Many of these were also innocent but were quickly tried and executed under martial law; both men and women were punished by whipping and long sentences. This was the most severe suppression of unrest in the history of the British West Indies. The governor had George William Gordon, a mixed-race representative of the parish in the House of Assembly, arrested in Kingston and brought back to Morant Bay, where he tried the politician under martial law. Gordon was quickly convicted and executed. The violent suppression and numerous executions generated a fierce debate in England, with some protesting about the unconstitutional actions of the governor John Eyre, and others praising him for his response to a crisis. The rebellion and its suppression remain controversial, and it is frequently debated by specialists in black and colonial studies. Background Slavery ended in Jamaica on 1 August 1834, with the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 which, after four years of \\"apprenticeship\\", would lead to full emancipation on 1 August 1838. This was the date on which former slaves became free to choose their employment and employer. On paper, former slaves gained the right to vote. However, most blacks remained desperately poor, and could not meet requirements to pay a high poll tax.Clinton V. Black, History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 183-4. The British population in Jamaica, like Europeans in other Caribbean colonies, were fearful of the widespread massacres and violence against the French that accompanied the Haitian Revolution when the slaves overthrew their masters and achieved independence in 1804. As a result, the colonial authorities levied a high poll tax which deprived the majority of black Jamaicans of the right to vote.Clinton V. Black, History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 232. Consequently, the British were afraid that the mass of black Jamaicans, ex-slaves and poor, would also rise up against the European elite, and this fear prompted the atrocities committed by Eyre and his militias in the aftermath of the rebellion. Tensions in the 1860s During the election of 1864, fewer than 2,000 black Jamaican men were eligible to vote (no women could vote at the time) out of a total population of more than 436,000, in which blacks outnumbered whites by a ratio of 32:1. Prior to the rebellion, conditions in Jamaica had been worsening for freedmen. In 1864 there were several floods which ruined many crops, whilst 1865 marked the end of a decade in which the island had been overwhelmed by plagues of cholera and smallpox. A two-year drought preceding 1865 made economic conditions worse for much of the population of former slaves and their descendants. Several bankruptcies were declared in the sugar industry, causing a loss of jobs and widening the economic void. Tensions between white farmers and ex-slaves increased, and rumours began circulating among the freedmen that white planters intended to restore slavery. Gordon criticised Eyre's draconian punishments such as flogging and the treadmill for crimes such as stealing food. He warned that \\"If we are to be governed by such a Governor much longer, the people will have to fly to arms and become self-governing.\\"C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 191. In 1865, Dr. Edward Underhill, Secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society of Great Britain, wrote a letter to the Colonial Office in London in order to describe Jamaica's poor state of affairs for the mass of people. This letter was later shown to Jamaica's Governor John Eyre, who immediately tried to deny the truth of its statements. Jamaica's poor blacks learned of the letter and began organizing in \\"Underhill Meetings\\". Peasants in Saint Ann parish sent a petition to Queen Victoria asking for Crown lands to cultivate, saying they could not find land for themselves.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 44–55. The petition was sent to Eyre first, and he enclosed a letter with his own comments. The Queen's reply was made known, and many of the poor believed that Eyre had influenced her opinion: she encouraged the poor to work harder, rather than offering any help. Gordon, who was one of two representatives from parish of St. Thomas-in- the-East, began encouraging the people in his parish to find ways to make their grievances known.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 55–60. One of his followers was a black Baptist deacon named Paul Bogle. In 1865 Bogle led a deputation of peasants from St. Thomas-in-the-East to the capital, Spanish Town, hoping to meet with the governor, John Eyre to discuss issues. But the governor refused to receive them.Clinton Hutton, \\"Review: The Killing Time': The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica by GAD Heuman\\", Social and Economic Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 (MARCH 1995), pp. 191–205, published by Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies, University of the West Indies; via JSTOR; accessed 13 July 2016 Rebellion and response On 7 October 1865, a black man was put on trial, convicted and imprisoned for trespassing on a long-abandoned sugar plantation, a charge and sentence that angered black Jamaicans. During the proceedings, James Geoghegon, a black spectator, disrupted the trial in Morant Bay. In the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, the two policemen were beaten with sticks and stones from the crowd.Holt (1992), p. 295 The following Monday the court issued arrest warrants for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police. Among those with warrants out was preacher Paul Bogle. A few days later on 11 October, Bogle marched with hundreds of Jamaican peasant-labourers to Morant Bay. They had taken oaths before marching, to \\"cleave to the black and leave the white\\", a sign that they were preparing for insurrection. Gad Heuman argues shows that oath taking in African tradition was a way to bring the group together and prepare for war. When the group arrived at the court house in Morant Bay, they were met by local officials and a small and inexperienced volunteer militia, gathered from personnel from the plantations. The crowd began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the protesters. This angered the crowd, who reacted violently, burning the court house and nearby buildings. More than 25 people were killed on both sides, before the militia retreated. For the next two days, the mass of rebellious black peasants took over the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-East. In response, Governor John Eyre sent government troops, under Brigadier-General Alexander Nelson,\\"Alexander Nelson\\" at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial. The troops met with no organized resistance, but they killed blacks indiscriminately, most of whom had not been involved in either the riot at the courthouse or the later rebellion. Heuman has described it as a reign of terror. The Jamaican Maroons of Moore Town, under the command of former Charles Town superintendent Alexander Fyfe, committed a number of atrocities and extrajudicial murders before they captured and arrested Bogle, and delivered him to the colonial authorities.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 132–133. Believing that the blacks could not have planned such events themselves (as he shared the widespread white assumption of the time that they were not capable of it), Governor John Eyre had representative George William Gordon arrested. The mixed-race Jamaican businessman and politician was wealthy and well-known; he was openly critical of the governor and his policies. Eyre believed that Gordon had been behind the rebellion. Despite having very little to do with it, Gordon was quickly convicted and executed. Though he was arrested in Kingston, where martial law had not been declared, Eyre had him transferred to Morant Bay, where he could be tried under martial law.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 146–150. The trial and execution of Gordon via martial law, following the excesses of suppressing the rebellion, added to the outrage felt by many in Britain. They felt there were serious constitutional issues by Eyre's bringing Gordon under martial law. They were concerned about whether British dependencies should be ruled under the government of law, or through military license. With a speedy trial, Gordon was convicted quickly and hanged on 23 October, just two days after his trial had begun.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 150–151. According to one soldier, \\"we slaughtered all before us ... man or woman or child\\". In the end, the soldiers killed 439 black Jamaicans directly, and they arrested 354 more (including Paul Bogle), who were later executed, many without proper trials. Bogle was executed \\"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning\\".\\"The Jamaica Prosecutions. Further Examinations of Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Brand\\", The Illustrated Police News: Law-Courts and Weekly Record (London), 23 February 1867: 1. On October 25, Bogle was hanged alongside 14 others, including his brother Moses.Heuman, The Killing Time, p. 139. Other punishments included flogging of more than 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences. The soldiers burned thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans without any justifiable reason, leaving families homeless throughout the parish. This was the most severe suppression of unrest in the history of the British West Indies, exceeding incidents during slavery years. Aftermath =Consequences in Britain= When news of the Jamaican government's response to the rebellion broke in Britain, with hundreds killed and hundreds more arrested and being executed, it generated fierce debate. Public figures of different political affiliations lined up to support or oppose Governor Eyre's actions. Part of the controversy related to whether observers believed that blacks had planned the uprising on their own, or whether George William Gordon and possibly whites had led them. Opponents of Eyre established the Jamaica Committee in 1866, which called for Eyre to be tried for mass murder. More radical members of the Committee wanted him tried for the murder of British subjects, such as George William Gordon, under the rule of law, stating that Eyre's actions taken under the aegis of martial law were illegal. The Committee included English liberals, such as John Bright, Charles Darwin, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Henry Huxley, Thomas Hughes and Herbert Spencer. Other notable members included Leslie Stephen, James Fitzjames Stephen, Frederic Harrison, Charles Buxton, Goldwin Smith, Charles Lyell, Edmond Beales, Frederick Chesson, Edward Frankland, Thomas Hill Green and Henry Fawcett. Governor Eyre Defense and Aid Committee, in support of Eyre, was set up by Thomas Carlyle. It included Alfred Tennyson, Charles Kingsley, Charles Dickens, John Ruskin and John Tyndall. When Eyre returned to Britain in August 1866, his supporters held a banquet in his honour, while opponents at a protest meeting the same evening condemned him as a murderer. Twice Eyre was charged with murder, but the cases never proceeded to trial. =In Jamaica= Eyre was replaced as governor by John Peter Grant who arrived in August 1866. Since the 1830s free people of color, like Gordon, Edward Jordon, and Robert Osborn, had been elected to the Jamaican House of Assembly in increasing numbers, and that alarmed the colonial authorities. In the wake of the Morant Bay Rebellion, Eyre, with the support of the Colonial Office, persuaded the Assembly to renounce its charter, thus ending two centuries of elected representation in the Colony of Jamaica.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 158–159. White planters were appointed by the governor. However, this move deprived the black majority of a voice in the colony's government, and it was condemned by Jordon and Osborn. Jamaica became a Crown Colony, under direct rule from London.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 158–159. Legacy In 1969 Paul Bogle and George William Gordon were among several men who were named as Jamaican National Heroes, the highest honour in the nation. =The Rebellion in popular culture= Several Jamaicans in the first half of the 20th century wrote about the Rebellion: * H. G. de Lisser, long-time editor of the newspaper The Gleaner, wrote a novel entitled Revenge (1918). It is now out of print. * Roger Mais, best known for his 1954 Rastafarian novel Brother Man, wrote the play George William Gordon. About the mixed-race politician who was tried under martial law and executed following the Rebellion, the play was first staged in 1938. * V. S. Reid devoted his novel New Day (1949) to commemorating the rebellion. Non-Jamaican authors have also treated the Morant Bay Rebellion. It is the subject of a chapter of the novel Caribbean (1989) by American James Michener. *It is also a setting for part of the novel James Miranda Barry (1999) by Patricia Duncker. (It was reissued in paperback as The Doctor: A Novel in 2002.) *The rebellion is also cited in the short story L'alfier nero (i.e. The Black Bishop in the game of chess) by the Italian author Arrigo Boito, where it is mistaken for a slave rebellion. The rebellion has been featured in music as well. Reggae artists Third World featured the title track \\"1865 (96° In The Shade)\\" on their second album in 1977; the song described the events of the Morant Bay rebellion from the point of view of Paul Bogle and George William Gordon: > You caught me on the loose, fighting to be free, now you show me a noose on > a cotton tree, entertainment for you, martyrdom for me ... Some may suffer > and some may burn, but I know that one day my people will learn, as sure as > the sun shines, way up in the sky, today I stand here a victim--the truth is > I'll never die.Mel Cooke, \\"Story of the song – Third World keeps '1865' > current\\" , Jamaica Gleaner, 20 January 2008.

Qasim Amin (, ; 1 December 1863, in AlexandriaPolitical and diplomatic history of the Arab world, 1900-1967, Menahem Mansoor - April 22, 1908 in Cairo) was an Egyptian jurist, Islamic Modernist and one of the founders of the Egyptian national movement and Cairo University. Qasim Amin has been historically viewed as one of the Arab world's \\"first feminists\\", although he joined the discourse on women's rights quite late in its development,Hatem, Mervat F. The Nineteenth Century Discursive Roots of the Continuing Debate on the Social-Sexual Contract in Today's Egypt, pp64-66 and his \\"feminism\\" has been the subject of scholarly controversy. Amin was an Egyptian philosopher, reformer, judge, member of Egypt's aristocratic class, and central figure of the Nahda Movement. His advocacy of greater rights for women catalyzed debate over women's issues in the Arab world. He criticized veiling, seclusion, early marriage, and lack of education of Muslim women. More recent scholarship has argued that he internalized a colonialist discourse on women's issues in the Islamic world, regarded Egyptian women as objects serving to achieve national aspirations, and in practice advocated reforms that diminished the legal rights of women in marriage contracts.Hatem, Mervat F.: The Nineteenth-Century Discursive Roots of the Continuing Debate on the Social-Sexual Contract in Today’s Egypt. Hawwa, 2004, 2:1,pp82-86 Greatly influenced by the works of Darwin, Amin is quoted to have said that \\"if Egyptians did not modernize along European lines and if they were 'unable to compete successfully in the struggle for survival they would be eliminated.\\" He was also influenced by the works of Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill who argued for equality of the sexes; Amin believed that heightening a women's status in society would greatly improve the nation.Smith, Charles D. \\"Islam and The Search for Social Order in Modern Egypt: A Biography of Muhammad Husayn Haykal.\\"Middle Eastern Studies. New York: State University of New York Press,1983 : 233. His friendships with Muhammad Abduh and Saad Zaghloul also influenced this thinking. Amin blamed traditional Moslems for Egyptian women's oppression saying that the Quran did not teach this subjugation but rather supported women's rights. His beliefs were often supported by Quranic verses.\\"The Liberation of Women and The New Woman. Two Documents in the History of Egyptian Feminism,\\" trans. S. Sidhom Peterson, Cairo 2000. Born in an aristocratic family, his father was a governor of Diyarbekir Elayet, and his mother the daughter of an Egyptian aristocrat. Amin finished law school at 17 and was one of thirty seven to receive a government scholarship to study at the University of Montepellier, in France. It was said that there he was influenced by Western lifestyles, especially its treatment of women. This would soon be his role model in his struggle to liberate the Egyptian women. His crusade began when he wrote a rebuttal, \\"Les Egyptiens. Response a M. Le duc d'Harcourt\\" in 1894 to Duke d'Harcourt's work (1893), which downgraded Egyptian culture and its women.Les Egyptiens. Response a M. le Duc D'Harcourt, Cairo 1894. Amin, not satisfied with his own rebuttal, wrote in 1899 Tahrir al mara'a (The Liberation of Women), in which he blamed Egyptian women's \\"veiling,\\" their lack of education, and their \\"slavery,\\" to Egyptian men as being the cause of Egypt's weakness.Tahrir al-mar'a (\\"The Liberation of Women\\"), Cairo 1899. He believed that Egyptian women were the backbone of a strong nationalistic people and therefore their roles in society should drastically change to better the Egyptian nation. Amin is known throughout Egypt as a member of the intellectual society who drew connections between education and nationalism leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement during the early 1900s. Early life Born to an aristocrat Ottoman Turkish father and a respectable middle-class Egyptian mother,Doria Shafik, Egyptian feminist: a woman apart, Cynthia Nelson Amin lived a sheltered life among Egypt's political and wealthy elite.

By 1881, at the age of 17, he received his law degree from the Khedival School and was one of thirty seven to receive a government scholarship to continue his education at Frances' University de Montpellier. His mission in France lasted four years.al-A mal al-kamila li- Qasim: Dirasa wa-tahquiq (\\"The collected works of Qasim Amin. Study And research\\"), ed.

His wife was raised by a British nanny. Therefore, he felt it was necessary for his daughters to be raised by a British nanny as well. Amin's advocacy of resisting women's wearing of the niqab was said to have perpetuated within his own family. Although, he could not change his wife from her wearing of it, his plan was to teach the younger generation of females, like his daughter, to not wear it again.Baron, Beth. \\"The Women's Awakening in Egypt: Culture Society and The Press.\\" The American Historical Review 100, no. 5(Dec 1995): 1637-1638. Career After his accomplishment in France, Amin became a part of the British empire's civil servant class. In 1885, he was appointed a jurist in the Mixed Courts. This court was said to be \\"saturated\\" in foreign western influence.Huquq al-nisa fi l-islam (\\"Women's rights in Islam\\"), Cairo 1900. The Mixed Courts created in 1875, was a mixture based on Napoleonic judicial system and Islamic Law. The jurists were foreigners from England, Austria, Germany, and France. Amin held a successful tenure with these foreign based legal officers. The goal of the Mixed Courts was to control the commercial life of Egypt during its chaotic control by foreign governments and people. The court's governmental tribunal often competed with the religious courts in its decision making. It was noted for its true reflection of the \\"right way\\" because it based its judgments on valid and sound reasoning.Hoyle, Mark S. \\"The Mixed Courts of Egypt: 1906-1915.\\" Arab Quarterly.\\" 2, no1 (May 1987). By 1887, he entered a predominately western- run Egyptian office of the Government Division of Legal Affairs. Within four years, he was selected one of the National courts' Egyptian judges. Cairo University Qasim Amin's was one of the founders of the first Egyptian University, known then as the National University, it formed the nucleus of the present Cairo University, he was a member of its constituent committee.Louis Awad ,The literature of ideas in Egypt, Volume 1, Scholars Press, 1986.

Middle East Centre Charis Waddy an Islamic scholar and writer, and the first woman graduate of Oriental Languages at Oxford University states that Qasim was 'a brilliant young lawyer'.Women in Muslim history, Charis Waddy The Nahda (Awakening) influence A central figure of the Nahda Movement that was said to have trickled down to Egypt during the latter part of the 19th century and into the early part of the 20th century during a period of \\"feminist consciousness', Amin was greatly influenced by several pioneers of the movement particularly the exiled Muhammad Abduh whom he had become a translator for, while in France. Abduh blamed Islamic traditionalists for the moral and intellectual decay of the Islamic world which he believed caused the colonization of the Islamic society by western forces. Egypt at the time was a colony of the British Empire and partly of France. Islamic traditionalist, Abduh believed, had left the true Islamic faith and had followed cultural habits rather than the religion which would have given them greater intellect, power, and justice. Furthermore, he criticized the patriarchal domination of women within the family maintained in the name of sharia law.Badron, Margot. \\"Unveiling in Early Century Egypt: Practical and Symbolic Considerations.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 25, no. 3 (July 1989): 370-386. Abduh advocated for all Muslims to unite, return to the true message sent by Allah which gave women equal status, and resist Western Imperialism that had occupied the Moslem World. Greatly impacted by the influence of Mohammad Abduh and though a trained student of the colonial powers, Amin accepted Abduh's philosophies which he generated into his own. He too believed that traditional Moslems had created an inferior society by not following true Islamic laws, that advocated the right of females in society, but instead followed cultural values to keep Egyptian women in submission. To him, this created an inferior society of men and women compared to the young men and women of the Western World. Amin spent a great portion of his life advocating the change of women's role in Egyptian society through his belief that a freer and more educated Egyptian woman would improve society for the better.  Attitude on Veiling  Qasim Amin in his book The Liberation of Women (1899) argued for the abolition of the veil. He thought that changing customs regarding women and changing their costume, abolishing the veil in particular, were key to bringing about the desired general social transformation. Qasim Amin's book inaugurated the battle that lead to a new discourse in which the veil came to comprehend significations far broader than merely the position of women. He pointed out the connotations of veil also had to do with issues on class and culture: the widening cultural gulf between the culture of the colonizers and that of the colonized. In this discourse, the issues of women and culture first appeared as inevitably fused in Arabic discourse. Amin argued that the veiling and segregation constituted \\"a huge barrier between woman and her elevation, and consequently a barrier between the nation and its advance\\". However, many Muslim scholars like Leila Ahmed criticized Qasim Amin's motivation of liberating women from veils for not being the result of reasoned reflection and analysis but the internalization and replication of the colonialist perception. Amin's argument against seclusion and veiling was simply that girls would forget all they had learned if they were made to veil and observe seclusion after they were educated. The age at which girls started to be veiled and secluded, twelve to fourteen, was a crucial age for the development of talents and intellect, and veiling and seclusion frustrated that development; girls needed to mix freely with men, for learning came from such mixing. This position clearly contradicts with his earlier idea that no education for women should go beyond primary-school level. To answer conservatives who worried about abolition of the veil would have influence on women's purity, Amin replied not from the perspective of gender equality, but from the standpoint to follow the superior Western civilization. He wrote, \\"Do Egyptians imagine that the men of Europe, who have attained such completeness of intellect and feeling that they were able to discover the force of steam and electricity...these souls that daily risk their lives in the pursuit of knowledge and honor above the pleasure of life, ... these intellects and these souls that we so admire, could possibly fail to know the means of safeguarding woman and preserving her purity? Do they think that such a people would have abandoned veiling after it had been in use among them if they had seen any good in it?\\"  Words on Marriage and Divorce  Qasim Amin believed that the marriage among Muslims was not based on love but on ignorance and sexuality, just like the missionary discourse. In his text, the blame has shifted from men to women. Women were the chief source of the \\"lewdness\\" and coarse sensuality and materialism characterizing Muslim marriages. Qasim Amin accused Egyptian wives' souls for being not superior enough to experience true love. Egyptian wives could know only whether their husbands were \\"tall or short, white and black.\\" Their husbands' intellectual and moral qualities, sensitive feelings, knowledge, whatever other men might praise and respect for, were beyond the wives' grasp. To Qasim Amin, the duty of women in marriage is mainly about doing housework and taking care of children. Therefore, a primary-school education would be enough for women to do their duties. Although seeing women as inferior to men, Qasim Amin did support the legislation of divorce. Although according to the tradition, the divorce will become true after repeating the words three times, Qasim Amin thought such oral agreement was not serious enough. The lack of legal system in the divorce process was what Qasim Amin thought that contributed to the high divorce rate in Cairo. He therefore proposed that in legal situations Muslims should depend on formal statements primarily as declarations of intent. Qasim Amin believed the formal statements could force the husband to be aware of his clear desire of separating with his wife. Qasim Amin criticized the Muslim scholars for being narrowly interested in the word \\"divorce\\". Muslim scholars, in the mind of Qasim Amin, focused their works on the variations of expressions of divorce, such as \\"I have divorced you\\" or \\"you are divorced.\\" Qasim Amin pointed out these efforts were only useful in the study of grammar and language, not in the development of discipline in jurisprudence. Qasim Amin thought the benefit of having a legal system on divorce would prevent men from accidentally divorcing from their wives because of jokes and quarrels, Works Qasim was heavily influenced by the works of Darwin, Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill,Islam and the search for social order in modern Egypt, Charles D. Smith and was friends with Mohammad Abduh and Sa'd Zaghlul.Between two empires: Ahmet Ağaoğlu and the new Turkey, Ada Holland Shissler Amin is perhaps most noted as an early advocate of women's rights in Egyptian society. His 1899 book The Liberation of Women (Tahrir al mara'a) and its 1900 sequel The New Woman (al mara'a al jadida) examined the question of why Egypt had fallen under European power, despite centuries of Egyptian learning and civilisation, and concluded that the explanation was the low social and educational standing of Egyptian women. Amin pointed out the plight of aristocratic Egyptian women who could be kept as a \\"prisoner in her own house and worse off than a slave\\".Qasim Amin by Ted Thornton, from History of the Middle East Database, retrieved 29 December 2004. He made this criticism from a basis of Islamic scholarship and said that women should develop intellectually in order to be competent to bring up the nation's children. This would happen only if they were freed from the seclusion (purdah) which was forced upon them by \\"the man's decision to imprison his wife\\" and given the chance to become educated.A Century After Qasim Amin: Fictive Kinship and Historical Uses of “Tahrir al-Mara '” , Malek Abisaab and Rula Jurdi Abisaab, Al Jadid, Vol. 6, no. 32 (Summer 2000), retrieved 29 December 2004. Some contemporary feminist scholars, notably Leila Ahmed, have challenged his status as the supposed \\"father of Egyptian feminism\\". Ahmed points out that in the gender-segregated society of the time, Amin could have had very little contact with Egyptian women other than immediate family, servants, and possibly prostitutes. His portrait of Egyptian women as backward, ignorant, and lagging behind their European \\"sisters\\" was therefore based on very limited evidence. Ahmed also concludes that through his rigorous critique and generalizations of women in Egypt along with his zealous praise of European society and colonialism, Amin, in effect, promoted the substitution of Egyptian androcentrism with Western androcentrism, not feminism. Books by Qasim Amin 1894-Les Egyptiens. Respone a M. le duc D'Hartcourt was written as a response to Duke Hartcourt's staunch criticism of Egyptian life and women. Amin did not defend the Egyptian women in his rebuttal but did defend Islam's treatment of women. 1899- Tahrir al- mar'a (The Liberation of Women)- Unsatisfied with his rebuttal, Amin called for the education of women only to primary level. He maintained his belief in patriarchal domination over women yet advocated modifying legislation affecting divorce, polygamy and abolution of the veil . The book was co- written with Muhammad Abduh and Ahmad Lufti al-Sayid. The book used many Quranic verses to support his belief. 1900- al-Mar'a al-jadida (The New woman) in his book, Amin envisioned 'the new woman' emerging in Egypt whose conduct and actions were modeled from the Western woman. This book was considered more liberal in nature, but used social Darwinist as his argument. In his book he states \\"A woman may be given in marriage to a man she does not know who forbids her the right to leave him and forces her to this or that and then throws her out as he wishes: this is slavery indeed.\\" Other works *\\"Huquq al-nisa fi'l-islam\\"(\\"Women's rights in Islam\\") *\\"Kalimat (\\"Words\\") *\\"Ashbab wa nata if wa-akhlaq wa-mawa.

Amin believed that Egyptian women were denied their Quranic rights to handle their own business affairs and marry and divorce freely. He refuted polygamy saying it \\"implied an intense contempt of women,\\" and that marriage should be a mutual agreement.Kalimat (\\"Words\\"), Cario 1908. He opposed the Egyptian custom of \\"veiling\\" the woman, saying it was the major pronunciation of woman's oppression. The niqab, Amin said, made it impossible to identify women. To him, when they walked with their niqab and long dresses, it made them more noticeable to men and more distrusted. Furthermore, he exclaimed that men in the West treated women with more dignity allowing them to go to school, walk without a veil, and speak their mind. This freedom, he insisted \\"contributed significantly\\" to the foundation of knowledge in the nation. He supported the idea that educated women brought forward educated children. When women were enslaved in the home, without a voice and without an education, they tended to spend their time wastefully and bring forth children that would grow to be lazy, ignorant, and mistrustful.al- Mar a al-jadida (The New Woman), Cairo 1900. Once educated, these women could become better mothers and wives by learning to manage their homes better. Amin gave an example of the situation. He said \\"Our present situation resembles that of a very wealthy man who locks up his gold in a chest. This man,\\" he said \\"unlocks his chest daily for the mere pleasure of see his chest. If he knew better, he could invest his gold and double his wealth in a short time.\\" Therefore, it was important to the Egyptian nation that women's roles should be changed. Although, he maintained his view that Egypt remain a patriarchal society, its women should remove the veil and be given a primary education. This he believed was a stepping stone to a stronger Egyptian nation that which was free of English colonialism. Controversy Critics of Amin's philosophies are quick to point out that Amin had no association with women other than aristocratic woman or prostitutes and they therefore question his stance of condemning all Egyptian women. Furthermore, Leila Ahmed, a novelist and reformer, suggests in her book, Women and Gender in Islam, that Amin's attempt to discredit the veil as a reason for Egyptian weakness is clearly a Western view. She illustrates how Westerners tend to use the veil as a reason to colonize Islamic nations by correlating the veil with inferiority. In addition, Ahmed points out that Amin's Egyptian woman, would not have control over her own body but instead it would be used to build up the nation. To her, this is hypocrisy because the Egyptian woman would still be the slave of her husband, her family, and her nation.Ahmed, Leila, \\"Women and Gender in Islam. In addition, history professor, Mona Russell further challenge Amin's description of the new woman saying that it was \\"one of the fruits of modern society.\\" She argues that she is not \\"new\\", does not care to be \\"synonymous\\" with Western woman, and is her own being. Amin, they believe, was influenced by his foreign education and upper middle class position which looked to foreign colonialism as superior rule. It was his way of integrating into foreign colonialism that held power of Egypt. His quote in which he says \\"We today enjoy a justice and a freedom the like of which I do not think Egypt has ever witnessed at anytime in the past\\" El Saada, Hoda. \\"Amin Qasim.\\"Encyclopedaia of Islam 3.

While a cultural system is very different from a social system, sometimes both systems together are referred to as the sociocultural system. Social theory A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of integration of cultural and social factors. =Action theory= Talcott Parsons, a major figure in sociology and the main originator of action theory in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman (2004) summarize Parsons' view, \\"Parsons saw these action systems acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower levels.\\" In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term \\"functionalism\\" was an inappropriate characterization of his theory. =System and social integration= The British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between social content and social transmission in his work on social structure and agency. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and transmission. Lockwood's conceptual distinction influenced Jürgen Habermas' discussion in the classic Legitimation Crises, who made the now famous distinction between system integration and social integration of the lifeworld. =Cultural and socio-cultural integration= Margaret Archer (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work Culture and Agency, argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as Bronisław Malinowski and later by Mary Douglas, is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons' approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by Antonio Gramsci through the theory of cultural hegemony through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4) Archer, a proponent of critical realism, suggests that cultural factors can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in the transmitted culture. Cultural systems are used (and inform society) both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To quote Archer in this regard: : \\"logical consistency is a property of the world of ideas; causal consistency is a property of people. The main proposition here is the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence can vary independently of one another. Thus it is perfectly conceivable that any social unit, from a community to a civilization, could be found the principle ideational elements (knowledge, belief, norms, language, mythology, etc.) of which do display considerable logical consistency – that is, the components are consistent, not contradictory – yet the same social unit may be low on causal consensus. \\" (2004:4) Archer notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors with various levels of contradiction and consistency. Research According to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of culture, in the 1980-1990s, the \\"cultural studies\\" and \\"cultural indicators\\" approaches, investigators explored the traditionally functionalist concern of \\"cultural systems integration.\\" These two approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems. Burrowes (1996) writes, \\"If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies.\\" Constrained by Merton's middle range theory [note: to be discussed here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social systems and their interaction.

History Timberjack was founded in Woodstock, Ontario in the 1950s by Wesley Maggill and Robert Simons, who designed an articulated four-wheel drive tractor with a winch at the back. They produced a prototype and production took off from there. There were affiliations with King Trailer ind. and with Timberland Ellicott Corp. before Eaton Corporation purchased Timberjack and named it the Forestry Equipment Division. The traditional color of all Timberjack products was a reddish orange. In 1992, the color was changed to green with black and yellow trim. John Deere purchased Timberjack and continued the green, black and yellow paint scheme. Timberjack was owned by the Eaton Corporation in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. In 1984 Timberjack made a leveraged buyout from Eaton to become an independent company. Timberjack was acquired by FMG (ForestMachineGroup), owned by Finnish Rauma- Repola. After a short period carrying the double-name FMG-Timberjack, in 1993 Timberjack became the brandname for the group. Other well known forest machine brands, which have been incorporated into FMG-Timberjack were Swedish Kockums, ÖSA and Bruun System as well as Finnish LOKOMO. In December 2000 John Deere bought Timberjack from Metso Corporation (formerly Rauma-Repola) for $570 million which also included the purchase of a separate company, Waratah, a leading manufacturer of heavy-duty harvester heads. As of June, 2006, at the forestry fair \\"Florence Wood\\", the Timberjack product line was discontinued, and John Deere, its parent company, became the largest single brand of forestry equipment.

(Lower-middle left, below the Altair 8800 computer and next to the TV Typewriter.) The COSMAC Elf was an RCA 1802 microprocessor-based computer described in a series of construction articles in Popular Electronics magazine in 1976 and 1977. Through the back pages of electronics magazines, both Netronics and Quest Electronics offered low-priced, enhanced kits that were based on this design. The system was a very early single-board personal computer. It was operated without built-in ROMs and programs were entered directly with help of the CPU integrated DMA using 8 toggle switches and an Input push button. It featured two hexadecimal LED displays for byte data value output and a set of 8 toggle switches for input. (a hexadecimal keypad was an optional extension) The base configuration had 256 bytes of RAM, but expansion projects could raise that to a power of two-based memory store, with an upper limit of 64K address space. The original Elf design used a crystal with a frequency in the range of 1 to 2 MHz with the 1802's built in oscillator circuit. A simple circuit used the DMA feature of the 1802 to permit entry of programs and data into RAM through the toggle switches. Entering a byte via the toggle switches and pressing the \\"input\\" button would enter a byte into RAM and display it on the pair of hex LEDs, then advance the DMA counter to the next location. A \\"memory protect\\" switch could be used to disable memory alteration. If an error was made in program entry, it could be corrected by turning on memory protect, turning off load mode (thus resetting the program counter to zero), turning on load mode, and pressing \\"input\\" to advance to the address of the incorrect data. After turning off memory protect, the correct value could be entered. The fourth article of the series presented modifications to use a companion RCA 1861 “Pixie” video generator IC (CDP1861). The Pixie required a 1.76 MHz clock, and since that was an uncommon crystal frequency, usually a readily available 3.579545 MHz colorburst crystal was instead used in a separate oscillator circuit with a divide-by-two circuit to drive the clock inputs of both the microprocessor and Pixie. The resulting 1.7897725 MHz clock was close enough for the hardware to work. Monochrome video output (with timing roughly approximating NTSC standard) could be generated using DMA operations interleaved with carefully arranged 1802 opcodes as instructions in software. The maximum resolution of the 1861 was 64h by 128v rectangular pixels. By changing the placement of instructions in the video display control and interrupt routines, pixel rows could be repeated to obtain lower resolutions, allowing the video display to be used with 256 bytes of RAM (64×32 square pixels). A one-bit output from the microprocessor, the Q line, could be driven by software to produce sounds through an attached speaker, to save programs in RAM to a cassette recorder, and for serial I/O output. Branch instructions in the 1802 instruction set could read the state of the EF1 through EF4 single bit value input lines, which were used to read the 'I' keypad (input) momentary pushbutton (typically EF4), programs from the cassette recorder through interface circuitry, serial I/O input, and input from peripherals such as a light pen. There are also seven 8-bit I/O ports available for decoding and interfacing.  Microcomputers  The original Elf computers were essentially home-built versions of the RCA Microkit, Microtutor I and Microtutor II, which were RCA's demonstration boards for their CDP1801 2-chip predecessor and single-chip CDP1802 microprocessors. Enhanced kits such as the Netronics Elf II and Quest Super Elf added built-in features such as keypads for data entry, serial I/O, cassette interface, and the CDP1861 \\"Pixie\\" video chip. RCA later introduced their own similarly expanded version as the COSMAC VIP. In August 2006, Nuts and Volts magazine, along with Spare Time Gizmos, released a project to build the \\"Cosmac Elf 2000,\\" based on the original Elf, with some newer and easier to find components and enhanced features, modules, and functionality, including the STG1861 Pixie Graphics Replacement board that is functionally equivalent to the now-rare RCA CDP1861 integrated circuit. The Membership Card is a modern, simple COSMAC Elf-like remake for retrocomputing hobbyists that is designed to fit in an Altoids tin. Various other hobbyist systems can be found on the Internet, including hardware emulators using FPGA and modern microcontrollers.  Software  A series of newsletters and small booklets offered by Netronics and Quest contained 1802 machine language and CHIP-8 programs, along with schematics for expanding the Elf and adding peripherals, including a light pen. Other, similar information and hobbyist software projects can be found on the Internet. The only published book about the 1802 is Tom Swan's \\"Programmer’s Guide to the 1802\\" (1981), which has been made available as a PDF after being out of print for many years. Tiny BASIC, a version of BASIC offered by Tom Pittman, could be used to write small BASIC programs on the Elf that could display through the Pixie low-resolution monochrome graphics display or TV-Typewriter hardware. Pittman also wrote a small booklet about the 1802 titled \\"A Short Course In Programming\\", which he has allowed to be published and made available online free of charge. Mike Riley has written an editor, assembler, BASIC and FORTH interpreters, a BIOS, and the Elf/OS disk operating system that will run on expanded Elf systems, including the COSMAC Elf 2000. Other languages available are noted at the RCA 1802 Wikipedia entry, including interpreters, compilers and assemblers. Game cartridges for the RCA Studio II contain Chip-8 games, which can run on other 1802 systems. File dumps of these games can be found on the Internet.

Veche (, , viche, vecha, věšte) was a popular assembly in medieval Slavic countries. In Novgorod and in Pskov, where the veche acquired great prominence, the veche was broadly similar to the Norse thing or the Swiss Landsgemeinde. Etymology The word is inherited from Proto-Slavonic *větje , meaning 'council', 'counsel' or 'talk' (which is also represented in the word \\"soviet\\", both ultimately deriving from Proto- Slavic verbal stem of *větiti 'to talk, speak'). There exists misinformation claiming a relation to \\"-vice\\" in \\"advice\\", and somewhat more distantly to Sanskrit \\"Veda\\", Germanic words like \\"wise\\" (English), \\"weten\\" (Dutch, \\"to know\\"), \\"witch\\" (Slavonic: věšt-ica) and many others, which however come from a different Indo-European root. Likewise, there exists misinformation claiming that the semantic derivation that yields the meaning of the word under consideration is parallel to that of congregation. The contemporary words svedeniya () and svidchennya () both meaning \\"information\\" are cognates of this word.  Rus  The East Slavic veche is thought to have originated in tribal assemblies of Eastern Europe, thus predating the Rus' state. The earliest mentions of veche in East European chronicles refer to examples in Belgorod Kievsky in 997, Novgorod the Great in 1016, in Kiev in 1068, in Pskov in 1123. The assemblies discussed matters of war and peace, adopted laws, and called for and expelled rulers. In Kiev, the veche was summoned in front of the Cathedral of St Sophia. In Ukraine, the town viche was simply a gathering of community members to inform everybody of important events (vich-na-vich - eye-to-eye) and come up with a collective planning for the near future. = Novgorod Republic = Removal of the veche bell from Novgorod to Moscow in 1478. The veche was the highest legislature and judicial authority in the Republic of Novgorod until 1478, after the conquest of Novgorod by Grand Prince Ivan III. The traditional scholarship goes on to argue that a series of reforms in 1410 transformed the veche into something similar to the public assembly of Venice; it became the Commons or lower chamber of the parliament. An upper Senate-like Council of Lords (sovet gospod) was also created, with title membership for all former city magistrates (posadniks and tysyatskys). Some sources indicate that veche membership may have become full-time, and parliament deputies were now called vechniks. Some of the more recent scholars call this interpretation into question. The Novgorod assembly could be presumably summoned by anyone who rang the veche bell, although it is more likely that the common procedure was more complex. The whole population of the city - boyars, merchants, and common citizens - then gathered at Yaroslav's Court or in front of the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (the latter called a Vladychnoe veche - \\"An Archbishop's Veche,\\" since it was called in front of the cathedral). The veche bell was a symbol of republican sovereignty and independence and for this reason, Ivan III carted it off to Moscow when he took control of the city, to show that the old way of doing things was at an end. Separate assemblies could be held in the boroughs or \\"Ends\\" of Novgorod. Of all other towns of Novgorod Land, the chronicles only mention a veche in Torzhok, however possibly they existed in all other towns as well. = Pskov republic = In the Pskov Republic the veche continued until 1510, when that city was taken over by Grand Prince Vasilii III (1505–1533). In Pskov the veche assembled in the court of the Trinity cathedral. Poland A wiec in the time of Poland's King Casimir III (reigned 1333-70). Veches, known in Poland as wiece, were convened even before the beginning of the Polish statehood in the Kingdom of Poland. Issues were first debated by the elders and leaders, and later presented to all the free men for a wider discussion. One of the major types of wiec was the one convened to choose a new ruler. There are legends of a 9th-century election of the legendary founder of the Piast dynasty, Piast the Wheelwright, and a similar election of his son, Siemowit (this would place a Polish ruler's election a century before an Icelandic one's by the Althing), but sources for that time come from the later centuries and their validity is disputed by scholars. The election privilege was usually limited to the elites, which in the later times took the form of the most powerful nobles (magnates, princes) or officials, and was heavily influenced by local traditions and strength of the ruler. By the 12th or 13th centuries, the wiec institution likewise limited its participation to high ranking nobles and officials. The nationwide gatherings of wiec officials in 1306 and 1310 can be seen as precursors of the Polish parliament (the general sejm). Early Slavs Procopius of Caesarea mentioned Slavic people gathering in popular assemblies already in VI century: > But when the report was carried about and reached the entire nation, > practically all the Antae assembled to discuss the situation, and they > demanded that the matter be made a public one(...).

In the late 1990s x86 virtualization was achieved by complex software techniques, necessary to compensate for the processor's lack of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities while attaining reasonable performance. In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits.A Comparison of Software and Hardware Techniques for x86 Virtualization, Keith Adams and Ole Agesen, VMware, ASPLOS’06 October 21–25, 2006, San Jose, California, USA \\"Surprisingly, we find that the first-generation hardware support rarely offers performance advantages over existing software techniques. We ascribe this situation to high VMM/guest transition costs and a rigid programming model that leaves little room for software flexibility in managing either the frequency or cost of these transitions. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.  Software-based virtualization  The following discussion focuses only on virtualization of the x86 architecture protected mode. In protected mode the operating system kernel runs at a higher privilege such as ring 0, and applications at a lower privilege such as ring 3. In software-based virtualization, a host OS has direct access to hardware while the guest OSs have limited access to hardware, just like any other application of the host OS. One approach used in x86 software-based virtualization to overcome this limitation is called ring deprivileging, which involves running the guest OS at a ring higher (lesser privileged) than 0. Three techniques made virtualization of protected mode possible: * Binary translation is used to rewrite in terms of ring 3 instructions certain ring 0 instructions, such as POPF, that would otherwise fail silently or behave differently when executed above ring 0, making the classic trap-and-emulate virtualization impossible. To improve performance, the translated basic blocks need to be cached in a coherent way that detects code patching (used in VxDs for instance), the reuse of pages by the guest OS, or even self-modifying code. * A number of key data structures used by a processor need to be shadowed. Because most operating systems use paged virtual memory, and granting the guest OS direct access to the MMU would mean loss of control by the virtualization manager, some of the work of the x86 MMU needs to be duplicated in software for the guest OS using a technique known as shadow page tables. This involves denying the guest OS any access to the actual page table entries by trapping access attempts and emulating them instead in software. The x86 architecture uses hidden state to store segment descriptors in the processor, so once the segment descriptors have been loaded into the processor, the memory from which they have been loaded may be overwritten and there is no way to get the descriptors back from the processor. Shadow descriptor tables must therefore be used to track changes made to the descriptor tables by the guest OS. * I/O device emulation: Unsupported devices on the guest OS must be emulated by a device emulator that runs in the host OS. These techniques incur some performance overhead due to lack of MMU virtualization support, as compared to a VM running on a natively virtualizable architecture such as the IBM System/370. On traditional mainframes, the classic type 1 hypervisor was self-standing and did not depend on any operating system or run any user applications itself. In contrast, the first x86 virtualization products were aimed at workstation computers, and ran a guest OS inside a host OS by embedding the hypervisor in a kernel module that ran under the host OS (type 2 hypervisor). There has been some controversy whether the x86 architecture with no hardware assistance is virtualizable as described by Popek and Goldberg. VMware researchers pointed out in a 2006 ASPLOS paper that the above techniques made the x86 platform virtualizable in the sense of meeting the three criteria of Popek and Goldberg, albeit not by the classic trap-and-emulate technique. A different route was taken by other systems like Denali, L4, and Xen, known as paravirtualization, which involves porting operating systems to run on the resulting virtual machine, which does not implement the parts of the actual x86 instruction set that are hard to virtualize. The paravirtualized I/O has significant performance benefits as demonstrated in the original SOSP'03 Xen paper. The initial version of x86-64 (AMD64) did not allow for a software-only full virtualization due to the lack of segmentation support in long mode, which made the protection of the hypervisor's memory impossible, in particular, the protection of the trap handler that runs in the guest kernel address space. Revision D and later 64-bit AMD processors (as a rule of thumb, those manufactured in 90 nm or less) added basic support for segmentation in long mode, making it possible to run 64-bit guests in 64-bit hosts via binary translation. Intel did not add segmentation support to its x86-64 implementation (Intel 64), making 64-bit software-only virtualization impossible on Intel CPUs, but Intel VT-x support makes 64-bit hardware assisted virtualization possible on the Intel platform. On some platforms, it is possible to run a 64-bit guest on a 32-bit host OS if the underlying processor is 64-bit and supports the necessary virtualization extensions.  Hardware-assisted virtualization  In 2005 and 2006, Intel and AMD (working independently) created new processor extensions to the x86 architecture. The first generation of x86 hardware virtualization addressed the issue of privileged instructions. The issue of low performance of virtualized system memory was addressed with MMU virtualization that was added to the chipset later. = Central processing unit =  Virtual 8086 mode  Based on painful experiences with the 80286 protected mode, which by itself was not suitable enough to run concurrent DOS applications well, Intel introduced the virtual 8086 mode in their 80386 chip, which offered virtualized 8086 processors on the 386 and later chips. Hardware support for virtualizing the protected mode itself, however, became available 20 years later.  AMD virtualization (AMD-V)  AMD Phenom CPU AMD developed its first generation virtualization extensions under the code name \\"Pacifica\\", and initially published them as AMD Secure Virtual Machine (SVM), but later marketed them under the trademark AMD Virtualization, abbreviated AMD-V. On May 23, 2006, AMD released the Athlon 64 (\\"Orleans\\"), the Athlon 64 X2 (\\"Windsor\\") and the Athlon 64 FX (\\"Windsor\\") as the first AMD processors to support this technology. AMD-V capability also features on the Athlon 64 and Athlon 64 X2 family of processors with revisions \\"F\\" or \\"G\\" on socket AM2, Turion 64 X2, and Opteron 2nd generation and third-generation, Phenom and Phenom II processors. The APU Fusion processors support AMD-V. AMD-V is not supported by any Socket 939 processors. The only Sempron processors which support it are APUs and Huron, Regor, Sargas desktop CPUs. AMD Opteron CPUs beginning with the Family 0x10 Barcelona line, and Phenom II CPUs, support a second generation hardware virtualization technology called Rapid Virtualization Indexing (formerly known as Nested Page Tables during its development), later adopted by Intel as Extended Page Tables (EPT). As of 2019, all modern Zen- based AMD processors support AMD-V. The CPU flag for AMD-V is \\"svm\\". This may be checked in BSD derivatives via dmesg or sysctl and in Linux via \`/proc/cpuinfo\`. Instructions in AMD-V include VMRUN, VMLOAD, VMSAVE, CLGI, VMMCALL, INVLPGA, SKINIT, and STGI.  Intel virtualization (VT-x)  Intel Core i7 (Bloomfield) CPU Previously codenamed \\"Vanderpool\\", VT-x represents Intel's technology for virtualization on the x86 platform. On November 13, 2005, Intel released two models of Pentium 4 (Model 662 and 672) as the first Intel processors to support VT-x. The CPU flag for VT-x capability is \\"vmx\\"; in Linux, this can be checked via \`/proc/cpuinfo\`, or in macOS via \`sysctl machdep.cpu.features\`.To see if your processor supports hardware virtualization Intel 2012. \\"VMX\\" stands for Virtual Machine Extensions, which adds 13 new instructions: VMPTRLD, VMPTRST, VMCLEAR, VMREAD, VMWRITE, VMCALL, VMLAUNCH, VMRESUME, VMXOFF, VMXON, INVEPT, INVVPID, and VMFUNC. These instructions permit entering and exiting a virtual execution mode where the guest OS perceives itself as running with full privilege (ring 0), but the host OS remains protected. , almost all newer server, desktop and mobile Intel processors support VT-x, with some of the Intel Atom processors as the primary exception. With some motherboards, users must enable Intel's VT-x feature in the BIOS setup before applications can make use of it. Intel started to include Extended Page Tables (EPT), a technology for page-table virtualization, since the Nehalem architecture, released in 2008. In 2010, Westmere added support for launching the logical processor directly in real mode a feature called \\"unrestricted guest\\", which requires EPT to work.http://2013.asiabsdcon.org/papers/abc2013-P5A-paper.pdf: \\"Intel added unrestricted guest mode on Westmere micro-architecture and later Intel CPUs, it uses EPT to translate guest physical address access to host physical address. With this mode, VMEnter without enable paging is allowed.\\"http://download.intel.com/products/processor/manual/326019.pdf: \\"If the “unrestricted guest” VM-execution control is 1, the “enable EPT” VM- execution control must also be 1\\" Since the Haswell microarchitecture (announced in 2013), Intel started to include VMCS shadowing as a technology that accelerates nested virtualization of VMMs. The virtual machine control structure (VMCS) is a data structure in memory that exists exactly once per VM, while it is managed by the VMM. With every change of the execution context between different VMs, the VMCS is restored for the current VM, defining the state of the VM's virtual processor.Understanding Intel Virtualization Technology (VT). Retrieved 2014-09-01 As soon as more than one VMM or nested VMMs are used, a problem appears in a way similar to what required shadow page table management to be invented, as described above. In such cases, VMCS needs to be shadowed multiple times (in case of nesting) and partially implemented in software in case there is no hardware support by the processor. To make shadow VMCS handling more efficient, Intel implemented hardware support for VMCS shadowing.The 'what, where and why' of VMCS shadowing. Retrieved 2014-09-01  VIA virtualization (VIA VT)  VIA Nano 3000 Series Processors and higher support VIA VT virtualization technology compatible with Intel VT-x.VIA Introduces New VIA Nano 3000 Series Processors EPT is present in Zhaoxin ZX-C, a descendent of VIA QuadCore-E & Eden X4 similar to Nano C4350AL.  Interrupt virtualization (AMD AVIC and Intel APICv)  In 2012, AMD announced their Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller (AVIC) targeting interrupt overhead reduction in virtualization environments.Wei Huang, Introduction of AMD Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller , XenSummit 2012 This technology, as announced, does not support x2APIC. In 2016, AVIC is available on the AMD family 15h models 6Xh (Carrizo) processors and newer. Also in 2012, Intel announced a similar technology for interrupt and APIC virtualization, which did not have a brand name at its announcement time. Later, it was branded as APIC virtualization (APICv) and it became commercially available in the Ivy Bridge EP series of Intel CPUs, which is sold as Xeon E5-26xx v2 (launched in late 2013) and as Xeon E5-46xx v2 (launched in early 2014). = Graphics processing unit = Graphics virtualization is not part of the x86 architecture. Intel Graphics Virtualization Technology (GVT) provides graphics virtualization as part of more recent Gen graphics architectures. Although AMD APUs implement the x86-64 instruction set, they implement AMD's own graphics architectures (TeraScale, GCN and RDNA) which do not support graphics virtualization. Larrabee was the only graphics microarchitecture based on x86, but it likely did not include support for graphics virtualization. = Chipset = Memory and I/O virtualization is performed by the chipset. Typically these features must be enabled by the BIOS, which must be able to support them and also be set to use them.  I/O MMU virtualization (AMD-Vi and Intel VT-d)  An input/output memory management unit (IOMMU) allows guest virtual machines to directly use peripheral devices, such as Ethernet, accelerated graphics cards, and hard- drive controllers, through DMA and interrupt remapping. This is sometimes called PCI passthrough. An IOMMU also allows operating systems to eliminate bounce buffers needed to allow themselves to communicate with peripheral devices whose memory address spaces are smaller than the operating system's memory address space, by using memory address translation. At the same time, an IOMMU also allows operating systems and hypervisors to prevent buggy or malicious hardware from compromising memory security. Both AMD and Intel have released their IOMMU specifications: * AMD's I/O Virtualization Technology, \\"AMD-Vi\\", originally called \\"IOMMU\\" * Intel's \\"Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O\\" (VT-d), included in most high-end (but not all) Nehalem and newer Intel processors In addition to the CPU support, both motherboard chipset and system firmware (BIOS or UEFI) need to fully support the IOMMU I/O virtualization functionality for it to be usable. Only the PCI or PCI Express devices supporting function level reset (FLR) can be virtualized this way, as it is required for reassigning various device functions between virtual machines. If a device to be assigned does not support Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI), it must not share interrupt lines with other devices for the assignment to be possible. All conventional PCI devices routed behind a PCI/PCI-X-to-PCI Express bridge can be assigned to a guest virtual machine only all at once; PCI Express devices have no such restriction.  Network virtualization (VT-c)  *Intel's \\"Virtualization Technology for Connectivity\\" (VT-c). = PCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) = PCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) provides a set of general (non-x86 specific) I/O virtualization methods based on PCI Express (PCIe) native hardware, as standardized by PCI-SIG: * Address translation services (ATS) supports native IOV across PCI Express via address translation. It requires support for new transactions to configure such translations. * Single-root IOV (SR-IOV or SRIOV) supports native IOV in existing single-root complex PCI Express topologies. It requires support for new device capabilities to configure multiple virtualized configuration spaces. * Multi- root IOV (MR-IOV) supports native IOV in new topologies (for example, blade servers) by building on SR-IOV to provide multiple root complexes which share a common PCI Express hierarchy. In SR-IOV, the most common of these, a host VMM configures supported devices to create and allocate virtual \\"shadows\\" of their configuration spaces so that virtual machine guests can directly configure and access such \\"shadow\\" device resources. With SR-IOV enabled, virtualized network interfaces are directly accessible to the guests, avoiding involvement of the VMM and resulting in high overall performance; for example, SR-IOV achieves over 95% of the bare metal network bandwidth in NASA's virtualized datacenter and in the Amazon Public Cloud.

After finishing her education in Zagreb, Milanov made her debut in 1927 in Ljubljana as Leonora in Giuseppe Verdi's Il Trovatore. From 1928 to 1936, she was the leading soprano of the Croatian National Theatre. In 1937, Milanov performed at the Metropolitan Opera for the first time, where she continued to sing until 1966. She also performed as a concert singer and was a noted vocal coach and teacher. Milanov is the sister of the composer and pianist Božidar Kunc. Biography Born in Zagreb, Croatia as Zinka Kunc (), she studied with the Wagnerian soprano Milka Ternina and her assistant Marija Kostrenčić. She also studied in Milan with Carpi and in Berlin with Stückgolt. On October 29, 1927, she made her operatic debut as Leonora in Giuseppe Verdi's Il Trovatore in Ljubljana, Slovenia, at age 21. Her debut in her native Croatia, at the National Theatre in Zagreb, took place five weeks later as Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust. After an early debut in Dresden (November 5, 1928, also as Leonora), her teacher, Ternina, was not pleased and much work commenced to perfect her technique. She performed in Zagreb and Ljubljana almost exclusively for the next six years. Later she became a member of the New German Theatre in Prague, where all performances were sung in German. She was discovered there by Bruno Walter, who recommended her to Arturo Toscanini for a performance of Verdi's Requiem in Salzburg. In 1937, the soprano made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, once again as Leonora. At that time she adopted the name Milanov, the stage name of her second husband, an actor. According to Milanov herself, \\"Kunc\\" wasn't \\"glamorous\\" enough for the Metropolitan Opera. The 2004 Opera News article \\"Zinka Takes Off\\"Opera News, November 2004, vol 69, no. 5 stated that the name change was deemed necessary since the gentlemen at the Met feared the \\"implications inherent in what they predicted would be the standard American mispronunciation — but they were never forthright with her about it\\". On November 8, 1937, Erich Simon, who was in charge of engaging Milanov, cabled Edward Ziegler, the assistant manager of the Met, \\"Mme Zinka KUNZ-MARCOVIC has informed me that she wishes to perform under her husband's stage name, MILANOV.\\" In 1940, Milanov was one of the featured soloists in a radio performance of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, along with Jussi Bjoerling (tenor), Alexander Kipnis (bass), Bruna Castagna (mezzo), and the Westminster Choir. Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra. In 1947, she left the Met when she married, for the third time, to Yugoslav general and diplomat Ljubomir Ilić, and returned to live in Yugoslavia. She was at the peak of her artistic and vocal powers when she made her debut at the Teatro alla Scala as Tosca in 1950. Milanov returned to the Metropolitan Opera the same year, invited by Rudolf Bing in his first year there as general manager.5,000 Nights at the Opera, Sir Rudolf Bing, Doubleday, 1972; pp. 152-3. She gave her final performance in 1966 at the closing night of the old Metropolitan Opera House. Having worked as a voice teacher while still performing, Milanov devoted herself to teaching after her retirement. Among her pupils were Betty Allen, Grace Bumbry, Christa Ludwig, Regina Resnik, Dubravka Zubovic and Milka Stojanovic. Composer Richard Hundley was one of her studio pianists. She recorded prolifically from the 1940s through to the 1960s. Her voice was well- suited to Italian operas such as those of Verdi, Ponchielli, Puccini and the verismo composers. She died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on May 30, 1989 following a stroke, aged 83.

She has a playful, mischievous personality, delighting in baiting the Doctor and getting into trouble. History Iris Wildthyme first appears in one of Magrs's non-genre novels, Marked for Life,Wildthyme at Large as a lesbian novelist who has lived for far longer than a normal lifespan.\\"Hypothetical Hills\\", in Territories of Desire in Queer Culture: Refiguring Contemporary Boundaries, James Knowles, pp.133, 140 At the end of the novel, Iris Wildthyme seems to die and then become a baby in a scene reminiscent of regeneration. The infant Iris appears in later books by Magrs taking place in the same Phoenix Court setting, and an apparently adult version re-appears in the story \\"Hospitality:, in the collection Iris: Abroad. Iris's first Doctor Who appearance is in the short story \\"Old Flames\\", where she meets the Fourth Doctor and Sarah. The Doctor already knows Iris as an \\"old friend\\", and she is seen to be travelling in a 20th-century London AEC Routemaster double-decker bus (the route 22 to Putney Common), which is, in reality, her TARDIS. The character was described as \\"a studied affront\\" to existing Doctor Who textsBritton, Piers, TARDISbound: Navigating the Universes of Doctor Who, IB Tauris, p.200 and \\"an ethical challenge\\" to some of the series' \\"main inconsistencies\\".Britton, Piers, TARDISbound: Navigating the Universes of Doctor Who, IB Tauris p.201 In 2011, SFX called Iris Wildthyme one of the 'Top 5 Spinoff Companions' and said 'her adventures (with the Doctor, and in her own line of books) are a joy'.SFX - The Ultimate Dr Who Top Fives, SFX, November 2011 Iris was featured at length in The Scarlet Empress\\"Shelf Life\\", Dave Owen, Doctor Who Magazine No. 269, August 1998 and The Blue Angel,\\"Shelf Life\\", Dave Owen, Doctor Who Magazine No. 282, August 1999 and went on to appear in several more short stories and novels in the BBC Books range, most recently Mad Dogs and Englishmen in 2002.\\"Preview: Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\", Paul Magrs, Doctor Who Magazine No. 312, January 2002\\"The DWM Review\\", Doctor Who Magazine No. 314, February 2002 Since then the character has been the subject of a number of short story anthologies, edited by Magrs and others, published by Obverse Books and one by Big Finish Productions,Big Finish - Wildthyme on Top and two novels published by Snowbooks.Snowbooks - Enter Wildthyme! Snowbooks - Wildthyme Beyond! In 2001, Philip Purser-Hallard submitted a proposal for a novel, Iris Wildthyme in the City of the Saved, which would have seen Iris in a hedonistic artificial world at the end of time where all people are resurrected and made immortal. It was rejected as an Iris Wildthyme novel range was considered unviable at the time. Purser-Hallard reused elements of the story in 2002's The Book of the War (in which Iris appears as an unnamed traveller) and 2004's Of the City of the Saved.... In 2002, the character started appearing as an occasional crossover character in audio plays by Big Finish Productions, where she is voiced by Katy Manning.Katy Manning CVSandifer, pp. 274–275 Following the casting of Manning in the role, imagery of the character used by Big Finish (and, later, Obverse Books) on packaging and covers now depicts Manning's likeness.Big Finish - Iris Wildthyme The character has appeared as the main character in five \\"seasons\\" of audio dramas, released respectively in 2005, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2015, along with a 2009 Christmas special.The Claws of SantaKaty Manning News and Event Each release of the second season is a pastiche of a decade of televised Doctor Who, from the 1960s through to the 1990s. The 2012 release Iris Rides Out is a crossover with the out-of-copyright character Carnacki the Ghost-Finder. Although in some of her early appearances (including Verdigris and Wildthyme on Top) Iris is accompanied by her companion Tom (played on audio by Ortis Deley), her usual foil in her Big Finish, Obverse Books and Snowbooks appearances is Panda, a 10-inch-tall sentient, stuffed toy (played on audio by David Benson).\\"Soho Stories\\", Clayton Littlewood, Polarimagazine, Feb 2010 Character Iris claims to have been raised by a House of Aunts (as opposed to Cousins), in the mountains of southern Gallifrey, and also that she has erased all of her records from the Matrix, explaining why the Time Lords know nothing about her. She is known to have survived the destruction of Gallifrey and the apparent retroactive wiping of the Time Lords from history that took place at the end of the novel The Ancestor Cell. Iris regenerates at the end of The Scarlet Empress (into a form resembling Jane Fonda in Barbarella), and is known to have at least six other incarnations. One of these, Bianca (voiced by Maria McErlane), appears in the Big Finish Productions audio play The Wormery and is similar to the Doctor's villainous Valeyard incarnation. Iris has also apparently worked for UNIT as a Scientific Advisor, and for the Ministry of Incursions and Ontological Wonders (MIAOW). There is no indication of what relationship the character has with the new television series. In \\"The End of the World\\" (2005), the Doctor states that his homeworld had been destroyed and that he is the last of the Time Lords. Attempting to pin down the exact details of Iris's history is problematic because such details are not only kept deliberately vague by Magrs and other writers, but also because the accounts of her adventures may not be reliable, in whole or in part. For example, some of her claimed exploits bear a remarkable similarity to those of the Doctor's, and some have suggested that it is the Doctor's adventures that are plagiarised from Iris's life, rather than the other way around. Her TARDIS is a double-decker red London bus, the number 22 to Putney Common. In contrast with other TARDISes, hers is slightly smaller on the inside, a fact attributed to the fact that her TARDIS was dying when she found it. She also claims to have stolen the TARDIS, and to be on the run from her \\"mysterious superiors\\". Iris has also argued that her adventures are more \\"true\\" than the Doctor's recollections because she writes them in her diaries while the Doctor does not. Magrs has explicitly stated that Iris \\"knows — of course she knows — that she's a very deliberate parody of Doctor Who. That's why she loves him so.\\" In postmodernist style, Iris is portrayed as playfully aware that she is a character in a television programme (or a series of books and audio dramas spun off from a television programme). Even more so than the Doctor's TARDIS, Iris's bus is a device for moving her between fictional genres and even texts. In the context of the Doctor Who universe, all this may be explained by Iris's claim in the novel The Blue Angel that she is from the Obverse, a surreal parallel universe with radically different physical laws. More recently in both Big Finish audios and Obverse Books short stories, she has claimed to come from The Clockworks, a planet in the Obverse, ruled over by a race not unlike the Time Lords.

CTL is typically a two- man, two-machine operation with a harvester felling, delimbing, and bucking trees and a forwarder transporting the logs from the felling to a landing area close to a road accessible by trucks. Harvester Forwarder The capital costs for a typical CTL operation, with one harvester and one forwarder, are quite high. The price of a pair of machines alone are approx. US$1,000,000. CTL is the primary logging method in European countries, while full-tree logging and the even older technique of tree-length logging are more popular in North America and less developed countries, where tree sizes can exceed the capacity of the harvester's felling head, i.e., tree stems with a butt diameter of over 90 centimeters. CTL lends itself to timber harvesting in plantation forestry where stems are often harvested before they reach large dimensions.

Family Born at Haga Palace in Stockholm, she is the second child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten and Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and a granddaughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf. Her sisters are Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler, Princess Désirée, Baroness Silfverschiöld, and Princess Christina, Mrs. Magnuson. She is a first cousin of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark Among her sisters she alone married a man of princely status, and, in keeping with the tradition that princesses who marry princes retain their royal status, Princess Birgitta retained her Swedish style of Royal Highness, a higher treatment than that of Serene Highness, to which the Princes of Hohenzollern and their wives were historically entitled. Marriage Wedding day of Princess Birgitta of Sweden and Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern in Stockholm. On a visit in 1959 to friends and relatives in Germany, Birgitta met her future husband at a cocktail party. On 15 December 1960, her engagement to Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern (31 July 1932 – 2 March 2016), was announced. The civil ceremony took place at the Royal Palace of Stockholm on 25 May 1961, and the religious in the Sankt Johann Church at the bridegroom's Family Palace of Sigmaringen on 30 May/ 31 July 1961. The bridesmaids were the bride’s sister Princess Christina and cousin Princess Benedikte of Denmark; the groomsmen were the bride's brother Crown Prince Carl Gustaf and her cousin Count Michael Bernadotte of Wisborg (son of Sigvard Bernadotte). Birgitta applied to convert to Roman Catholicism when she married the Hohenzollern prince, but her application was rejected in wording which questioned her spiritual commitment to the change.Roger Lundgren in Sibylla en biografi Bonniers Stockholm p. 223 Of her marriage, she had three children: Carl (b. 1962), Désirée (b. 1963), and Hubertus (b. 1966). She and her children were passed over for succession to the Swedish throne when subsequent absolute primogeniture was established in Sweden in 1979 and 1980, and then only included her brother's descendants and her uncle Prince Bertil. Prince Johann Georg and Princess Birgitta separated in 1990, although they remained legally married. She lived on the island of Majorca in Spain, while her husband lived in Munich. He died in 2016. Public life In November 1960 Birgitta visited the United States accompanied by her younger sister Princess Désirée on behalf of their grandfather King Gustaf VI Adolf for the 50th anniversary of The American-Scandinavian Foundation. In their honour a ball was organised for the two princesses at the Renaissance Blackstone Hotel in Chicago by Mayor Richard Daley. Princess Birgitta was involved with golf and charities outside of Sweden and was an honorary board member of the (British) Royal Swedish Golfing Society, a position she took over when her uncle Prince Bertil died.

Ledoux criterion  In stellar astrophysics, Ledoux's name is now associated with the criterion under which material in a star becomes unstable to convection in the presence of a gradient of chemical composition. In homogenous material, the Schwarzschild criterion shows that material is unstable to convection if the radiation field alone would establish a steeper temperature gradient steeper than the adiabatic (or isentropic) temperature gradient. However, Ledoux showed that a composition gradient stabilises or destabilises the material against convection. In convectively-stable regions destabilised by the composition gradient, one expects thermohaline mixing; in convectively- unstable regions that are stabilised, one expects double-diffusive mixing, known in stellar astrophysics as semiconvection.

He currently plays in experimental rock band Battles. He has also previously played in Tomahawk and The Mark of Cain, as well as performing on several releases as a studio musician. He is known for his speed, endurance, and precision as a performer. Stanier uses a Tama Artstar II drum kit. Biography Stanier grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Florida and is a veteran of the local hardcore music scene. He is known for having a drum corps background, but never actually marched a summer season. He played tenor drums for the Florida Wave Drum and Bugle Corps through a few years of their winter/spring camps. He studied orchestral percussion at the University of South Florida, but never took formal drumset lessons. Stanier cites Neil Peart as his biggest influence. He has also been influenced by drummers such as John Bonham, Billy Cobham, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio, Carl Palmer, and Lenny White. Stanier's drumming with Helmet has been cited as a big influence on a new generation of rock drummers. He endorses Tama drums, and is also well known for his Zildjian K crash cymbal perched as high as it can go when playing with Battles. The breakup of Helmet in 1998 was supposedly amicable, though Stanier offers few details beyond: \\"There's no big story or anything. It was just... time to call it a day. We'd been around for 10 years... no drama or fights or anything like that.\\" Stanier has not kept in contact with former band mates Page Hamilton and Henry Bogdan, and Hamilton has commented that Stanier ignored attempts to communicate. With Helmet firmly in the past, Stanier wanted to get involved with other projects after taking some time off. A big fan of hip-hop music, he \\"accidentally\\" became a professional DJ for a year and a half. The length of his drumming inactivity was in part due to a broken wrist, as well as the fact that he simply could not find a band he wanted to play with. Since 2000, Stanier has been much more active with drumming. He is currently a member of three bands: Battles, Tomahawk, and The Mark of Cain.

In contact with a catalyst, it decomposes into a high-temperature mixture of steam and oxygen, with no remaining liquid water. It was used as a propellant of HTP rockets and torpedoes, and has been used for high-performance vernier engines. Properties Hydrogen peroxide works best as a propellant in extremely high concentrations (roughly over 70%). Although any concentration of peroxide will generate some hot gas (oxygen plus some steam), at concentrations above approximately 67%, the heat of decomposing hydrogen peroxide becomes large enough to completely vaporize all the liquid at standard pressure. This represents a safety and utilization turning point, since decomposition of any concentration above this amount is capable of transforming the liquid entirely to heated gas (the higher the concentration, the hotter the resulting gas). This very hot steam/oxygen mixture can then be used to generate maximal thrust, power, or work, but it also makes explosive decomposition of the material far more hazardous. Normal propellant-grade concentrations, therefore, vary from 70 to 98%, with common grades of 70, 85, 90, and 98%. The volume change of peroxide due to freezing varies with percentage. Lower concentrations of peroxide (45% or less) will expand when frozen, while higher concentrations (65% or greater) will contract. Hydrogen peroxide becomes more stable with higher peroxide content. For example, 98% hydrogen peroxide is more stable than 70% hydrogen peroxide. Water acts as a contaminant, and the higher the water concentration the less stable the peroxide is. The storability of peroxide is dependent on the surface-to-volume ratio of the materials the fluid is in contact with. To increase storability, the ratio should be minimized. Applications When used with a suitable catalyst, HTP can be used as a monopropellant, or with a separate fuel as a bipropellant. HTP has been used safely and successfully in many applications, beginning with German usage during World War II, and continues to the present day. During World War II, high-test peroxide was used as an oxidizer in some German bipropellant rocket designs, such as the Walter HWK 509A rocket engine that powered the Messerschmitt Me 163 point defense interceptor fighter late in World War II, comprising 80% of the standardized mixture T-Stoff, and also in the German Type XVII submarine. Some significant United States programs include the reaction control thrusters on the X-15 program, and the Bell Rocket Belt. The NASA Lunar Lander Research Vehicle used it for rocket thrust to simulate a lunar lander. The Royal Navy experimented with HTP as the oxidiser in the experimental high-speed target/training submarines and between 1958 and 1969. The first Russian HTP torpedo was known by the strictly functional name of 53-57, the 53 referring to the diameter in centimeters of the torpedo tube, the 57 to the year it was introduced. Driven by the Cold War competition, they ordered the development of a larger HTP torpedo, to be fired from the 65-centimeter (26-inch) tubes. HTP in one of these Type 65 torpedoes on August 12, 2000 exploded on board and sank the K-141 Kursk submarine. British experiments with HTP as a torpedo fuel were discontinued after a peroxide fire resulted in the loss of the submarine in 1956. British experimentation with HTP continued in rocketry research, ending with the Black Arrow launch vehicles in 1971. Black Arrow rockets successfully launched the Prospero X-3 satellite from Woomera, South Australia using HTP and kerosene fuel. The British Blue Steel missile, attached to Vulcan and Victor bombers, in the 1960s, was produced by AVRO. It used 85% concentration of HTP. To light the twin chamber Stemtor rocket, HTP passed though a catalyst screen. Kerosene was then injected into the two chambers to produce 20,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds of thrust each. The larger chamber was for climbing and accelerating, while the small chamber was to maintain cruise speed. The missile had a range of 100 nautical miles when launched at high altitude and about 50 nautical miles launched at low level (500 to 1000 feet). Its speed was about Mach 2.0. After a high altitude launch it would climb to 70,000 to 80,000 feet. From a low level launch, it would climb to only 40,000 feet but its speed would still be around Mach 2.0 With concentration of 82%, it is still in use on the Russian Soyuz rocket to drive the turbopumps on the boosters and on the orbital vehicle. The Blue Flame rocket-powered vehicle achieved the world land speed record of 622.407 mph (1,001.667 km/h) on October 23, 1970, using a combination of high-test peroxide and liquified natural gas (LNG), pressurized by helium gas. Propellant-grade hydrogen peroxide is being used on current military systems and is in numerous defense and aerospace research and development programs. Many privately funded rocket companies are using hydrogen peroxide, such as the defunct Armadillo Aerospace and Blue Origin, and some amateur groups have expressed interest in manufacturing their own peroxide, for their use and for sale in small quantities to others. HTP will be used again in an attempt to break the land speed record with the Bloodhound SSC car, aiming to reach over 1000 mph. It will be the oxidiser for the hybrid fuel rocket, reacting with the solid fuel hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. Availability The available suppliers of high-concentration propellant- grade hydrogen peroxide are, in general, one of the large commercial companies that make other grades of hydrogen peroxide, including Solvay Interox, PeroxyChem (formerly FMC Global Peroxygens, a division of FMC Corporation), and Evonik. X-L Space Systems upgrades technical-grade hydrogen peroxide to HTP. Other companies that have made propellant-grade hydrogen peroxide in the recent past include Air Liquide and DuPont. DuPont recently sold its hydrogen peroxide manufacturing business to Evonik. Propellant-grade hydrogen peroxide is available to qualified buyers. In typical circumstances, this chemical is sold only to companies or government institutions that have the ability to properly handle and utilize the material. Non-professionals have purchased hydrogen peroxide of 70% or lower concentration (the remaining 30% is water with traces of impurities and stabilizing materials, such as tin salts, phosphates, nitrates, and other chemical additives), and increased its concentration themselves. Distillation is extremely dangerous with hydrogen peroxide; peroxide vapor can not ignite but the released oxygen can ignite any material that it is in contact with, detonation is possible depending on specific combinations of temperature and pressure, the detonation is the result of rapid reactive evaporation of the liquid resulting in high temperature and pressure resulting in a violent rupture of the containing vessel. In general, any boiling mass of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide at ambient pressure will produce vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, which can detonate. This hazard is mitigated, but not entirely eliminated, with vacuum distillation. Other approaches for concentrating hydrogen peroxide are sparging and fractional crystallization. Hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of at least 35% appear on the US Department of Homeland Security's Chemicals of Interest list. Safety Since many common substances catalyze peroxide's exothermic decomposition into steam and oxygen, handling of HTP requires special care and equipment. It is noted that the common materials iron and copper are incompatible with peroxide, but the reaction can be delayed for seconds or minutes, depending on the grade of peroxide used. Small hydrogen peroxide spills are easily dealt with by flooding the area with water. Not only does this cool any reacting peroxide but it also dilutes it thoroughly. Therefore, sites that handle hydrogen peroxide are often equipped with emergency showers, and have hoses and people on safety duty. Contact with skin causes immediate whitening due to the production of oxygen below the skin. Extensive burns occur unless washed off in seconds. Contact with eyes can cause blindness, and so eye protection is usually used. The Kursk submarine disaster involved the accidental release of HTP in a torpedo which reacted with the torpedo's fuel.

() is a decorative border constructed from a continuous line, shaped into a repeated motif. Such a design is also called the Greek fret or Greek key design, although these are modern designations. On the one hand, the name \\"meander\\" recalls the twisting and turning path of the Maeander River in Asia Minor, and on the other hand, as Karl Kerenyi pointed out, \\"the meander is the figure of a labyrinth in linear form\\".Kerenyi, Dionysos: archetypal image of indestructible life (Princeton University Press) 1976:89. Among some Italians, these patterns are known as Greek Lines. Usually the term is used for motifs with straight lines and right angles; the many versions with rounded shapes are called running scrolls. Meanders are common decorative elements in Greek and Roman art. In ancient Greece they appear in many architectural friezes, and in bands on the pottery of ancient Greece from the Geometric Period onwards. The design is common to the present-day in classicizing architecture. The meander is a fundamental design motif in regions far from a Hellenic orbit: labyrinthine meanders (\\"thunder\\" patternSee J. E. L., description of a Late Chou hou at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, in \\"A Chinese Bronze\\", Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts 27 (August 1929:48).) appear in bands and as infill on Shang bronzes, and many traditional buildings in and around China still bear geometric designs almost identical to meanders. There is a possibility that meanders of Greek origin may have come to China during the time of the Han Dynasty by way of trade with the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. They were among the most important symbols in ancient Greece; and perhaps symbolized infinity and unity; many ancient Greek temples incorporated the sign of the meander. Greek vases, especially during their Geometric Period, were probably the main reason for the widespread use of meanders; alternatively, very ocean-like patterns of waves also appeared in the same format as meanders, which can also be thought of as the guilloche pattern. The shield of Philip II of Macedon, conserved in the museum of Vergina, is decorated with multiple symbols of the meander. Meanders are also prevalent on the pavement mosaics found in Roman villas throughout the Roman empire. A good example is at the Chedworth Roman Villa in England, leading many historians to believe that the pattern was part of the original inspiration for the Latin \\"G\\" character. Meanders and their generalizations are used with increasing frequency in various domains of contemporary art. The painter Yang Liu, for example, has incorporated smooth versions of the traditional Greek Key (also called Sona drawing, Sand drawing, and Kolam) in many of her paintings.Yang Liu, \\"Visual art as research: Explorations with sona drawings\\", Leonardo, April 2010, Vol. 43, No. 2, pp. 129–131.Yang Liu, \\"Cross-culturalism in painting: visualization via meanders\\", Journal of Visual Arts Practice, Vol. 8, No. 3, 2009, pp. 205–214.Yang Liu, \\"From sona drawings to contemporary art\\", HYPERSEEING, Summer 2009, pp. 37–41.

After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire these became uneconomical, and the replacement income from sponge diving has now dwindled as well. The inhabitants now live by fishing and small-scale farming. The main town in the group is Colonel Hill on Crooked Island. Albert Town, on Long Cay, now sparsely populated, was once a prosperous little town. It was engaged in the sponge and salt industries and also served as a transfer port for stevedores seeking work on passing ships.

Its population was 277 in the 2010 census. It has an area of about . About north of Great Inagua and southeast of the capital Nassau, Mayaguana is considered the halfway point between South Florida and Puerto Rico and is about off Palm Beach, Florida. It is a popular stopover for boaters on a direct route to the eastern Caribbean. History Mayaguana was inhabited by Lucayans prior to the arrival of the Spanish following 1492. After the last of the Lucayans were carried off to Hispaniola by the Spanish early in the 16th century, the island remained uninhabited until 1812, when people began to migrate from the Turks and Caicos Islands, which are located about southeast. The Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen suggested in 1824 that Mayaguana is Guanahani, the first island visited by Christopher Columbus at his discovery of the Americas. His theory has found little support. Mayaguana apparently was the Lucayan name (meaning \\"Lesser Midwestern Land\\" ) for the island. The first steamship to circumnavigate the globe, the Royal Navy sloop HMS Driver, was wrecked on Mayaguana on 3 August 1861, 14 years after the completion of her epic voyage in 1847. During NASA's Project Mercury and the Apollo program, the United States space program had a missile tracking station on what is now Mayaguana Airport. The station was used to help keep astronauts on course. The Mayaguana Airport was built by US Army Engineers attached to the US Air Force. The airport was built as a runway for jet planes that would follow missiles fired from Cape Canaveral. Real time sighting and photography was the best technology of the time for observing the flight of the missiles. The Bahamian government has recently approved working with American investors MMC to turn Mayaguana into a \\"free trade zone,\\" complete with tourism development of approximately 14% of the island. Actually, this is 14% of the total landmass but essentially most of the coastal region. The proposal was met with moderate resistance by Mayaguanians, who look forward to economic expansion but are unsure of what change is to come. This development is still in a planning phase and is trying to maintain the nature of the island as a quiet eco- tourist destination while still creating sustainable economic growth. Mayaguana is one of only the few remaining Bahamian islands which still retains their original Lucayan names. Other islands have preferred to change to non-nativist names. People The largest settlement is Abraham's Bay (pop. 143) on the south coast; other settlements are the neighboring towns of Betsy Bay (pop. 44) and Pirate's Well (pop. 90) in the northwest with the population slowly decreasing. The uninhabited areas of Upper Point (north shore), Northeast Point, and Southeast Point are largely inaccessible by road. Education There are only two schools on the island. Pirates Well Primary is located in the settlement of Pirates Well. The Abraham's Bay High school is located in the capital of Abraham's Bay. Culture In 2016, Mayaguana held its first annual regatta festival called the All Mayaguana Regatta. The festival focuses on the sailing competition, food, arts and music. Conchfest is also held as a replacement for the Abraham's Bay Homecoming in early August. The least developed Bahamian island, Mayaguana has never really seen major growth largely due to the government taking little interest in the economy. However, the government has provided some locals with entry-level positions at various government offices. Others make a living by either fishing and farming. Considered the most isolated Bahamian island, Mayaguana uses the country's mail boat system as its primary form of import and export. Mayaguana is visited once a week for delivery and pickup by M/V Lady Mathilda. Food Mayaguana is known for fresh sea food. Sea life regularly caught for commercial purposes include conch, grouper, spiny lobster, snappers and tuna. Marlin and bone fish found in Bahamian waters are fished for sporting activities only. Environment Mayaguana is known for its fertile soil, which is good for farming, and its woody terrain. Bahamian dry forests' hardwoods, common lignum-vitae (Guaiacum officinale), and holywood lignum- vitae (G. sanctum) can be found throughout the island. The island is home to several government nature reserves. As the southeasternmost island in the Bahamian Commonwealth, Mayaguana is bordered to its east by deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Many underwater coral reefs are found off-shore, as well as shipwrecks. Mayaguana is home to the Bahamian hutia, a rodent that was thought to be extinct until the mid-1960s, as well as Bahamian flamingos, Bartsch's iguanas, plovers, terns, and osprey. Nesting sea turtles can be found throughout the undeveloped northern part of the island. About 118 species of bird are found on the island, including two large brown booby colonies. Tourism Mayaguana remains one of the most pristine and untouched islands in the Bahamas. Yet the island – home to beautiful beaches, unique wildlife and world-class fishing – has never fully reached its development potential. Most tourists who visit, do so for the unspoiled essence of the island. Visitors can also enjoy scuba diving, bonefishing, snorkeling, white crown pigeon hunting and bird watching. The eastern part of the island is a popular area for persons who are interested in crabbing (catching local island crabs) off-trail bikers. Ecotourism is also a growing spectrum. Booby Cay is home to hundreds of indigenous species of iguanas only to Mayaguana. There is also an interesting species of booby birds that is also found on a separate cay on the northern side of Mayaguana. Blackwood Point, located in upper Pirates Well is where one would find Bahamian flamingo feeding year round. The island is accessible by the Mayaguana Airport (MYG), which is located southeast of Abraham's Bay and is visited by Bahamasair as well as private aircraft. New construction is set to take place at the Mayaguana Airport before the fourth quarter of 2017.

Publication history Cartoonist Dan DeCarlo, who had spent most of the 1950s drawing teen and career-girl humor comics such as Millie the Model for Atlas Comics, that decade's forerunner of Marvel Comics, began freelancing for Archie Comics. In 1960, he and Atlas editor-in-chief Stan Lee co-created the short-lived syndicated comic strip Willie Lumpkin, about a suburban mail carrier,Dan DeCarlo at the Lambiek Comiclopedia for the Chicago, Illinois- based Publishers Syndicate.Carter, B. J. \\"Interview: Dan DeCarlo: Archie, Josie and Dan\\", The Trades, January 1, 2002. WebCite archive. Casting about for more comic-strip work, DeCarlo created the characters of Josie and her friends.

The series featured levelheaded, sweet- natured redhead Josie, her ditzy blonde bombshell friend Melody, and the brainy, cynical, bespectacled brunette Pepper. These early years also featured the characters of Josie's beatnik boyfriend Albert; Pepper's strong but not- too-bright boyfriend Socrates (\\"Sock\\" for short); Albert's rival Alexander Cabot III, who chased after both Josie and Melody; and Alex's obnoxious twin sister Alexandra Cabot. None of the mainstream Archie characters appeared with Josie until the ninth issue of her own title.Josie #9 at the Grand Comics Database Josie and her friends occasionally appeared in \\"crossover\\" issues with the main Archie characters.

The series finished its run undert this title with issue #106 (October, 1982).Josie and the Pussycats at the Grand Comics Database Josie and her gang also made irregular appearances in Pep Comics and Laugh Comics during the 1960s. In 1969, Archie Comics made several changes to the Josie comic: * In Josie #42 (August 1969), Josie met a heavily built blond folk singer named Alan M. who, over time, became Josie's on-again, off-again boyfriend (much to the chagrin of Alexandra, who was also immediately smitten with Alan M. and never missed an opportunity to try and steal him away). * In Josie #43 (September 1969), Alexandra discovered that her cat Sebastian was actually a reincarnation of an ancestor of the Cabot family, who was executed for consorting with witches. Whenever Alexandra held Sebastian in her arms, she could cast magic spells. Alexandra generally used her powers to compete with Josie for Alan M., but the spells she cast usually backfired in some way. Moreover, her spells ended whenever someone nearby snapped their fingers (which happened often). Alexandra and Sebastian's witchy powers were not used in Hanna-Barbera's TV show, and they were soon discontinued in the comic as well. * In Josie and the Pussycats #45 (December 1969), the first issue to bear that new title, Josie and Melody decided to start a band called the Pussycats. Alexandra was asked to be their bassist, but she insisted that the group's name be to \\"Alexandra's Cool Time Cats\\"; so, instead, Valerie Smith, a new girl in school, was recruited to play bass. The Pussycats made their leopard print band uniforms (complete with cat-ear headbands and long tails) and performed at their first gig, a school dance, as a seething Alexandra tried unsuccessfully to use her witchcraft for revenge. The reimagining of the comic resulted in three casualties: Albert, Sock, and Pepper, who were phased out altogether. From 1970 on, most of the stories in the comic book revolved around the Pussycats traveling around the country and the world to perform gigs, with Alan M., Alex, and Alexandra (and sometimes Sebastian) in tow. When the girls were not performing, they dealt with the various trials and tribulations of teenage life, often including Alex's jealousy of Alan M. and Alexandra's jealousy of Josie. The Josie and the Pussycats comic ran until 1982, after which the girls were featured in various Archie Giant Series issues and miniseries and one-shot comics of their own. Reprinted Josie stories (including the occasional pre-Pussycats story) appear frequently in the various Archie Library digests. Archie & Friends #47-95 (June 2001-November 2005) featured new Josie and the Pussycats stories in the regular house style after the 2001 film renewed interest in the series. They later appeared in a new two-part story, \\"Battle of the Bands\\", in Archie & Friends #130-131 (June–July 2009). =Manga makeover= In March 2005, Archie Comics announced that a manga version of the title would be published, with art by Tania del Rio,Brady, Matt. \\"Josie and the Pussycats Go Manga\\" , Newsarama.com, March 3, 2005 who was also responsible for the manga makeover of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. The first such \\"Josie and the Pussycasts\\" story, \\"Opening Act\\" ran in Tales from Riverdale Digest #3 (August 2005) The band had previously appeared in manga form in issue Sabrina, The Teenage Witch #67 (August 2005). In Archie & Friends #96 (January 2006) the origin of the Pussycats was retconned. The manga version implies that none of the characters previously knew each other. Josie Jones was cut from the school choir, but met Valerie Smith and the two founded the band. They recruited Melody, whose idea it was to wear cat outfits. The band was not doing well at first, but Alex liked the group, though Alexandra could tell he was more interested in Josie. Alex's father let him be the manager as long as he did not use his wealth to help make them stars. In Sabrina the Teenage Witch #72 (February 2006), a stranger named Alan helped carry their equipment. Josie, already attracted to Alan, jealously thought there was an attraction between Alan and Melody. Alex hired him as their stagehand. The manga focused on the group's attempt to reach fame rather than on their career after they have already achieved it. It featured characters not seen in other comics, including Alan's younger sister Alison and the rival group the Vixens. The manga version was not popular among readers, who preferred the traditional style. Its final appearance was in Archie & Friends #104 (December 2006). A Katy Keene revival replaced it (both featured alongside each other in the latter part of the manga's run), though it, too, did not last. =Afterlife with Archie= In the world of Afterlife with Archie, Josie and the Pussycats are revealed to be vampires. Josephine McCoy is orphaned shortly after her birth in 1906 and winds up in an orphanage run by Alexandra Cabot, who has three other children: Melody, Valerie, and Pepper. Due to their singing talent, \\"Uncle Buddy\\" (one of Alexandra's friends) takes the trio on tour, eventually forcing Pepper to marry him. Shortly after this, Josie, Melody and Valerie are turned into vampires. The three then go on to become several short lived groups, with \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" being the latest incarnation. In the 1980s, Pepper finds Josie and tries to blackmail Josie into turning her into a vampire. Josie tries to explain that becoming a vampire locks you into the state you were in when you were turned. Pepper won't listen and Josie is forced to kill her childhood friend. Josie them mesmerizes the interviewer she has been telling this to so the three of them can feed. Later on, on their jet, they detect irregularities at their destination of Riverdale, deciding to land there anyway rather than detour.\\"Afterlife with Archie\\" #10 (2016) =Reboot= On June 8, 2016 a reboot of the series was announced in the same style of the Archie, Jughead, and Betty & Veronica reboots as part of the New Riverdale imprint. The series is be co-written by Marguerite Bennett and Cameron DeOrdio with the art by Audrey Mok. The reboot features Josie uniting the band to take their big shot at musical stardom, only to contend with the machinations of Alexandra Cabot, the ever-Machiavellian daughter of the Pussycats’ manager. The first issue was released on September 28, 2016.Holub, Christian. \\"Josie & the Pussycats reboot comic coming this September\\" ew.com, June 8, 2016 Characters =Josie McCoy= A short-haired redhead, Josie is the leader and co-founder of the Pussycats. She is the lead vocalist and songwriter and plays guitar. Portrayed as a sweet, attractive, and level-headed teenage girl, Josie is usually the stable center in the middle of the chaos surrounding her band and her friends. Josie's surname has been inconsistent. It was alternately \\"Jones\\" or \\"James\\" for much of the comic's run. McCoy was her surname for the 2001 movie. Archie Comics later sometimes acknowledged the surnames from the movie as canonical, though not consistently. In a few stories reprinted in the 2000s decade, Archie Comics changed her surname to McCoy. However, the manga version used \\"Jones\\", which was her first surname to actually appear in the comics. During the early years of her comic (1963–1969), Josie dated a guitarist named Albert. During and after the Josie and the Pussycats revamp, she dated Alan M. Mayberry. Alexander Cabot is regularly attracted to her in the comics. Though she is known to date him, she really loves Alan M. In the cartoon series, Josie's speaking voice was performed by Janet Waldo (the voice of Judy Jetson and Penelope Pitstop) and her singing voice was performed by Cathy Dougher. She was played by Rachael Leigh Cook in the 2001 live-action Josie and the Pussycats movie (singing voice performed by Kay Hanley). She appeared in The CW series Riverdale with Ashleigh Murray portraying her as an African American and lead singer of the band. Murray eventually left the show and joined the spinoff Katy Keene. Josie was ranked 77th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. =Melody Valentine= The co-founder and drummer for the Pussycats (she also sang occasional lead vocals for the TV series), Melody is a cute blonde and usually speaks in a sing-song voice, denoted by the musical notes in her cartoon word balloons. She is an absent- minded, bubbly sort of character often taken to using silly, nonsense language, and provides much of the comic relief of the series. Melody is almost never given a surname in a comic story. Occasionally, she is called \\"Melody Jones\\". At these times, the name \\"James\\" is used for Josie to avoid confusion. However, the manga, having settled on the name \\"Josie Jones\\", essentially nullifies this. The 2001 movie establishes her surname as Valentine, a name that Archie Comics has accepted. Many comic stories use Melody's beauty as a plot device. When male characters see her, they uncontrollably fall for her and lose all sense of anything else, frequently leading to chaos; although, she is usually oblivious to this. Despite any trouble that occurs for her or her friends, Melody maintains a cheerful, optimistic attitude. In the cartoon series, whenever the group is in a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation, Melody's ears would wiggle. In the cartoon, she frequently gets brainwashed, but is already very dim-witted. Later, in the Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space series, she adopts a cute little alien named Bleep. Melody's speaking voice is performed by Jackie Joseph, and her singing voice is performed by Cheryl Ladd (credited as Cherie Moor). She was played by Tara Reid in the live-action film. Bleep's voice was done by Don Messick (also the voice of Scooby-Doo, Astro, Dr. Benton Quest, Boo Boo, and more). Ashanti Bromfield portrayed her in the CW series Riverdale. =Valerie Brown= In addition to being the group's main songwriter and a multi-instrumentalist, dark-haired Valerie also performs back-up vocals (in the comics, cartoons, and the movie) and occasionally sings lead (nearly always in the TV series) for the Pussycats. In the comics and the movie, she is the group's dedicated bassist; in the cartoons, she plays tambourine. In the comic book, she replaced Pepper, a sharp-minded spectacled brunette. Valerie's surname may be the most definite of the three. Archie Comics have occasionally used the name \\"Brown\\" from the movie on their website and in promotional material, but in the comics, she is always called Valerie Smith. But recently, the \\"Brown\\" surname has been used again in comics and the Riverdale TV series. The return of the Brown surname happens due to the return of the Pepper Smith character in the New Riverdale and Archie Horror universe. In the comics, Valerie is more tomboyish than her two bandmates. Besides being good at science and a skilled auto mechanic, she occasionally shows a quick temper as well as being physically stronger than she might appear. She is also less concerned about her appearance or her love life than Josie, Melody or Alexandra, and had rarely been seen in a romantic relationship, though in the cartoons she seems attracted to Alexander. In 2010, she began an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with Archie Andrews, although her band's touring schedule often keeps her out of Riverdale and away from Archie (much to the relief of Veronica Lodge and Betty Cooper, Archie's other girlfriends). In the animated series, she is somewhat similar to Velma Dinkley from Scooby- Doo and they met in a 1973 episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, \\"The Haunted Showboat\\". She is the character who saves the day the most often, thanks to her street smarts and her mechanical and scientific genius. In the comics, this is downplayed, although she is still the most intelligent of the group. Valerie is the first African-American female cartoon character on a regular animated television series. Valerie's speaking voice is performed by Barbara Pariot, and her singing voice is performed by Patrice Holloway, sister of Motown recording artist Brenda Holloway. She was played by Rosario Dawson in the live-action film. Hayley Law portrayed her in the CW series Riverdale. =Alexander Cabot III= Rich, temperamental, and cowardly, Alexander is the Pussycats' shifty and not-too-dependable manager. He often gets the group in hot water because of his crazy promotional schemes. Alexander wears sunglasses often and likes to flaunt his wealth, typically dressing in flamboyant and expensive clothing. In the comics, Alexander is reminiscent of Reggie Mantle. He has a crush on Josie and often tries to divert her attention from her boyfriend, Alan M. He is blunt and critical towards Alan M., regarding him as all brawn and no brains. Occasionally, Alexander will take an interest in Melody, particularly when Josie is unavailable. The interest seems genuine, since, unlike other boys, who fall helplessly in love with Melody at first sight, Alexander tends to remain composed around her. Alexander's personality is markedly different in the animated series; he is much friendlier, though no more dependable and far more cowardly than his comic strip alter ego. In this context, he most often serves as a comedic foil for Alexandra's constant scheming. The animated version of Alexander also exhibits no romantic feelings towards Josie, tends to gravitate towards Melody or Valerie, depending on interpretation, and is very similar to Shaggy Rogers from Scooby-Doo. The animated depiction of Alexander was voiced by Casey Kasem, who also voiced Shaggy. In a 1973 Josie-guested episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, Alexander and Shaggy both appear on-screen together for quite some time. Alexander was played by Paulo Costanzo in the 2001 live-action motion picture. He appears as a supporting regular character on The CW's live-action series Katy Keene, portrayed by Lucien Laviscount. =Alexandra Cabot and Sebastian= Alexandra is technically a supporting character, but often overshadows the rest of the cast in both the comics and the cartoons. She is Alexander's fraternal twin sister in the comics; the 1970 cartoon series does not establish the siblings as twins, nor which sibling is older. Alexandra has black hair with a white lightning-bolt shaped stripe running through the middle of it, giving her ponytail a slight impression of a skunk's tail. In contrast to the good-natured girls in the Pussycats, Alexandra is cynical, hateful, mean, offensive, rude, envious, scheming and self-centered. She is insanely jealous of the Pussycats, especially Josie, about whom she never has a kind word. Despite having no vocal or musical talent at all, Alexandra desperately wants to be a star; her conditions for joining the Pussycats were that she be made the lead and that the band be renamed Alexandra's Cool Time Cats. Alexandra has an enormous crush on Alan M., and often tries to steal him away from Josie. In the comics, although she is not particularly fond of her brother, Alexandra often joins forces with him to separate Alan M. and Josie, which would benefit both siblings, since Alexander is interested in Josie. Alexandra's personality in the cartoon is largely unchanged. Sebastian is a tuxedo cat, and Alexandra's sidekick. In the comics, Sebastian is the reincarnation of Sebastian Cabot, a witchcraft-practicing ancestor of the Cabot family. Alexandra finds that, by holding Sebastian in her arms, she can cast powerful magic spells (Alexandra and Sebastian's bond is represented in that they both have a matching white stripe in the middle of their hair/fur). This plot device was sporadically employed by various writers at Archie over the years; Alexandra was later shown to be able to cast spells on her own. In the cartoon, Alexandra and Sebastian do not have magic powers but they still have their white stripes. Sebastian usually follows Alexandra's schemes when it comes to getting in between Josie and Alan, but unlike Alexandra, he has no real grudge or dislike towards Josie and is usually shown to be friendly to her. Alexandra's voice in the cartoons is provided by former Mouseketeer Sherry Alberoni, while Don Messick supplies the meows, screams, and Muttley- esque snickers for Sebastian. Alexandra was played by Missi Pyle in the live- action Josie and the Pussycats movie, while Sebastian does not appear in the live-action film. Alexandra appears as a supporting regular character who dislikes Josie McCoy on The CW's live-action series Katy Keene, portrayed by Camille Hyde. This version of Alexandra is the senior vice president of Cabot Entertainment, who uses her position as leverage against Josie, who signed a deal with the company through Alexander. In Katy Keene, Alexander and Alexandra are step-siblings (posing as twins in public), a relationship complicated by their having dated in high school before Alexander's father and Alexandra's mother later married. =Alan M. Mayberry= Alan M. Mayberry (known as \\"Alan M.\\" in the comics, and as simply \\"Alan\\" in the cartoon series) is a tall, blond, muscular folk singer who serves as the Pussycats' roadie. He is also Josie's on-off boyfriend, but Alexandra is constantly trying to win a date with him. In the comics, he replaced Josie's former boyfriend and Alex's former rival Albert. In his first comic book appearance, the creators tried to give him and Alex their own band, The Jesters, but it did not last beyond one issue, and the comic took a different direction. Though Alex looks down on Alan M. and insults his intelligence, Alan M. has more common sense than Alex does. Despite being one of the six main characters, he appeared less often in the comics in the 1980s onward. In the cartoon series, he plays the role of the self-appointed group leader, similar to that of Fred Jones from Scooby-Doo (and perhaps not coincidentally does bear some resemblance to him as well). His and Alex's characters were changed in an attempt to recapture Scooby-Doo's success. Alan M.'s animated persona is voiced by Jerry Dexter. He was played by Gabriel Mann in the live-action film. =Other recurring characters= * Pepper Smith: Josie's best friend in the original comics, and, until the 1969 renovation, one of the main five characters (along with Josie, Melody, Albert and Alex). She had short-cropped black hair, conservative spectacles, wore clothes that were less formfitting than her friends, and was noted for her sharp wit and cynical nature. She dated Sock, but to his frustration, she preferred to remain emotionally reserved when it came to boys. The original comic focused on three girls (a redhead, a brunette and a blonde) who were frequently seen together, but Pepper was dropped from the comics and replaced by Valerie. This change has no explanation, as Albert and Pepper's roles are similar to their replacements’. Pepper made a small cameo appearance in Part 3 of 2007's “Civil Chore” in Tales From Riverdale (Alan M. was notably absent). Pepper later had a more prominent role in the 2016-17 Josie and the Pussycats comic series by Marguerite Bennett and Cameron DeOrdio. She appears as a lead character in The CW's live-action series Katy Keene, portrayed by Julia Chan. * Albert: Sometimes seen as a mischievous goofball, but at other times quite sensitive, he was Josie's boyfriend in the original comics and one of the original male leads. He was also Alex's rival. However, while the Pussycats- era Alex was similar to Reggie Mantle, Albert and Alex were more like a male Betty and Veronica: good friends until it came to the girl they competed for. Alexandra tried unsuccessfully to get him to date her. Albert was fond of playing the guitar and singing, and also liked to ride his motor scooter. Often portrayed as member of the 1960s counterculture, he went from being a beatnik to a folk singer to a mod and finally to a hippie (depending on the year of the issue) before he was finally dropped from the comics. Alan M. would fill his old role. Since then, he, Pepper and a few other characters would only appear in stories reprinted in digests. * Sock: His real name was Socrates, and he was a jock who dated Pepper and was a good friend of Albert's. Like a stereotypical jock, he was not very intelligent, but this was not exaggerated as it is with Moose Mason. Despite lasting up to and including Alan M.'s first story, he, like Alexandra, remained a supporting character. Unlike Albert and Pepper, he was removed from the comics with no actual replacement character. * Alexander Cabot II: Alex and Alexandra's very rich father. He is slightly heavyset, his hair is turning white, and he is often frustrated with the ideas of his children. He insists that the band his son manages earn their own fame without the help of his millions. * Josie's father: He is a slim, middle-aged man who has dark hair with a wisp of gray. His name, depending on the source, is Mr. McCoy, Mr. Jones or Mr. James. He is totally supportive of his daughter's music career. In Riverdale, he is named Myles McCoy. * Cricket O'Dell: The familiar Archie character made a few appearances in the original Josie comics. A pert, friendly girl with an amazing talent: she is able to smell money or monetary values. * Sheldon: A short, fat glutton from a few stories in the late 1960s who occasionally dated Melody. Despite his lack of importance, his final appearance was after the Pussycats' makeover. * Clyde Didit: Best known as the star of Archie's Mad House, Clyde appeared for a few issues in Josie in the late 1960s. * Mr. Tuttle: The principal of Midvale High School where Josie and her friends attend. He made a number appearances in the pre-Pussycats comics. * Archie's Gang: The main characters often crossover with Josie and the Pussycats (and vice versa), sometimes in stories involving the Archies. * The Vixens: A rival rock trio that Alexandra manages. Although they are glamorous, they have no musical talent (a fact that Alexandra somehow overlooked). Exclusive to the manga version. In other media =Film= Live-action Josie and the Pussycats is a 2001 Canadian-American musical comedy film released by Universal Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Directed and co-written by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, the film is loosely based upon the comic and the Hanna-Barbera cartoon. The film is about a young all-female band that signs a record contract with a major record label, only to discover that the company does not have the musicians' best interests at heart. The film stars Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, and Rosario Dawson as the Pussycats, with Alan Cumming, Parker Posey, and Gabriel Mann in supporting roles. The film received mixed reviews and was a box office bomb, earning about $15 million against a $39 million budget. =Television= Animated During the 1968-1969 television season, the first Archie-based Saturday morning cartoon, The Archie Show, debuted on CBS. The Archie Show, produced by Filmation Studios, was not only a hit on TV, but spun off a radio hit as well (the Archies' song \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" hit the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in September 1969 and went on to be Billboard's number one \\"Hot 100 Single\\" of that year). Competing animation studio Hanna-Barbera Productions contacted Archie Comics about possibly adapting another of its properties into a similar show. Archie Comics offering to redevelop the Josie series into one about a teenage music band, and allowing Hanna-Barbera to adapt it into a music-based Saturday morning show. The show aired 16 episodes during the 1970-71 television season. In the 1972-73 television season, the show was re-conceptualized as Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space and aired another 16 episodes. After the shows' cancellation, Josie and the Pussycats made a final appearance in a guest shot on the September 22, 1973 episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, \\"The Haunted Showboat\\". Live-action Josie and the Pussycats appear in Riverdale on The CW. They are high school students who are dedicated to perfecting the \\"Pussycat\\" brand. Ashleigh Murray portrays Josephine \\"Josie\\" McCoy, named for Josephine Baker, whose father is a jazz musician and wishes his daughter played more serious music. Her mother is Riverdale's mayor. Asha Bromfield and Hayley Law portray Melody Valentine and Valerie Brown, respectively. All three of them are African-Americans. Josie would later emigrate to the spin-off series Katy Keene as an adult, with Murray reprising her role.

It may imply a slowing of tempo. Sostenuto pedal keyboard of the grand piano On a modern grand piano with three pedals, the middle pedal is usually a sostenuto pedal. It sustains only those notes that are being held down when the pedal is depressed, allowing future notes played to be unaffected. It is commonly abbreviated \\"S.P.\\", \\"Sost. Ped.\\", or \\"ThP.\\" (from the German equivalent \\"Tonhalte-Pedal\\"). The right pedal is the sustain pedal, which undamps all the strings on the piano, while the left pedal is the soft pedal. On some upright pianos and lower-quality grand pianos, the middle pedal is not a sostenuto pedal but instead sustains all notes in the bass register. On other uprights, the middle pedal is a practice pedal (with a locking option), which makes the sound even quieter than the standard soft pedal. This is often achieved by dropping a felt cloth between the hammers and the strings when the practice pedal is depressed. Not all pianos have a sostenuto pedal, however.

He was a member of the powerful Radziwiłł family, last of the Ołyka line, fourth to bear the name of Albrycht. During his life he was an influential magnate and diplomat in the country. Radziwiłł was a vigorous Roman Catholic and staunch supporter of Counter-Reformation, but also the arch enemy of the Protestant community. Biography He was born on 1 July 1595 in his family manor in Ołyka to Stanisław Pius Radziwiłł and Marianna née Myszka. During his life Albrycht held several important posts in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, some of them hereditary. Apart from directing his family estate in Ołyka at Wołyń (ordynacja ołycka), he was in charge of foreign policies and internal affairs of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as he held the posts Lesser Lithuanian Chancellor of Lithuania (since 1619), Grand Chancellor of Lithuania and Starosta (city foreman) of Vilnius (since 1623), as well as governor of Kowel, Tuchola, Gniew, Pińsk, Wieluń, Dyneburg, Kobryń and Szawle. Trąby coat of arms Supporter of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund III Vasa, he often stood in opposition to his son and successor, Władysław IV Vasa on the matters of religion. Władysław was lenient towards Protestants and encouraged religious tolerance, while Albrycht was an outspoken opponent of all non-Catholics, sometimes even refusing to stamp documents with his Chancellor's seal granting them rights and privileges. He was also a patriot of Grand Duchy: he always strived to ensure that there is no discrimination towards his compatriots and they have equal representation in the Commonwealth federal political structure, just as he tried to ensure that non-Catholics had as little of it as possible. In his opposition to 'heretics' he was supported by Chancellor Jerzy Ossoliński. He sympathized with the Habsburg faction and supported Queen Cecilia Renata of Austria, the Habsburg wife of King Władysław IV. Just like the other Radziwiłł family members, he was famous for the support given to his relatives: he did not fail to watch over the interests of his Calvinist cousins, despite being renowned for his opposition to the \\"heretics\\". Despite being one of the most powerful magnates in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, both of his marriages (with Regina von Eisenreich in 1619, court lady of Queen Constance and after her death in 1637 with Anna Krystyna Działyńska-Lubomirska in 1638) were childless. During later stages of his life, Radziwiłł wrote a diary Memoriale rerum gestarum in Polonia (Memoir or Diary of the history of Poland) covering the 1632–1656 period. This book is perhaps his most famous legacy. He died childless on 12 November 1656. His estates were inherited by Ordynat of Nieśwież line of Radziwiłł family.

Ragged Island is part of the Jumentos Cays and Ragged Island Chain. The crescent- shaped chain measures over in length and includes cays known as Raccoon Cay, Hog Cay and Double-Breasted Cay. On 8 September 2017, Duncan Town took a direct hit from Hurricane Irma. Economy Until recently the island had an active salt industry, the salt ponds having been developed in the 19th century by Duncan Taylor, after whom Duncan Town, the only settlement, is named. Due to the decline of the salt industry, which peaked in the 1930s, there has been a gradual emigration to more prosperous islands such as New Providence, Grand Bahama Island, Abaco Island, The Exumas and Eleuthera. Population and people The population of Ragged Island in the 2010 census was 72.Ragged Island Population by Settlement and Total Number of Occupied Dwellings: 2010 Census - Bahamas Department of Statistics Senator Mizpah Tertullien was born on the island in 1930. =Duncan Town= Duncan Town is the only settlement in the entire Ragged Island chain and is situated within a bay of shallow water. The island contains a small airstrip, a harbor, and a lighthouse. A tower on the south end of the island is visible from ships transiting the Old Bahama Channel. Most of the inhabitants on the island are direct descendants of the original settlers and they bear their original family names, such as Moxey, Curling, Lockhart, Maycock, Munroe, Joffre, Wallace, and Wilson. One of the surnames Maycock originated from Maycock Cay. The familiar heritage and their remoteness have resulted in the islands being part of the “family islands” or “out island”. Although the island is remote and sparsely populated, many of its descendants have taken important roles within sailing & maritime affairs, politics, athletics, entertainment, and business. In September 2017, the Prime Minister invoked a mandatory evacuation order for all members of the community to leave the island to allow for cleanup and the restoration of services, following a devastating hit by Hurricane Irma. Eighteen residents who had not evacuated prior to the storm were affected by the request, which included the offer of an airlift to New Providence.Khrisna Russell, Unliveable: PM Urges Remaining Ragged Island Residents To Evacuate, Tribune 242 (Bahamas), September 12, 2017.

In a speech on March 19, Prime Minister evaded reporters questions concerning the proposed solar farm for the island. Construction of the solar farm began in December 2019. With the battery storage system finalized, the system is expected to supply at least 90% of the island's energy needs. The solar field was essentially completed in early February, 2020 and was commissioned by the end of February. Communications In August 2005, a contract was signed with TYCO International to deploy a fiber-optic submarine cable in a self-healing ring topology, connecting 14 islands of the Bahamas; namely: New Providence, Andros, Eleuthera, Exuma, Long Island, Ragged Island, Inagua, Mayaguana, San Salvador, Rum Cay, Cat Island, Abaco, Crooked Island and Grand Bahama, at a cost of $60 million. Transportation The island relies on the \\"mail boat\\" for transportation to and from the major islands, as well as for freight and commerce. The island is also served by Duncan Town Airport. Upgrades to the Duncan Town Airport (funded by the European Union) were commenced in 2006 at a cost of $650,000. The dredging and construction of a dock in Ragged Island commenced in 2006, at an estimated cost of some $3.5 million.

Plot Devil Hunter Yohko is about a boy-crazy sixteen-year-old girl named Yohko Mano who banishes demons from the Earth. Yohko is voiced by Aya Hisakawa in the original Japanese dialogue. In the English dubbed version she is portrayed by Amanda Winn-Lee. For centuries, the Mano family has been slaying demons. Yohko's grandmother, Madoka, is the 107th Devil Hunter, and Yohko's mother, Sayoko, would have been the 108th, but for a small hitch: A Devil Hunter must be a virgin to take on the power and responsibility. Sayoko became pregnant before Madoka could reveal the family's secrets, and so the job fell to Yohko Mano, Sayoko's daughter, who is placed as the 108th Devil Hunter. Now as a Devil Hunter, Yohko must face off against demons while trying to live her life as a boy-crazy schoolgirl. Characters *Yohko Mano (真野 妖子 Mano Yōko) : The heroine of the anime. Her grandmother gives Yohko the responsibility to be the 108th Devil Hunter and continue their family's legacy of Devil Hunters. She now fights as a Devil Hunter against demons that appear and interrupt her life and ruin her chances of ever getting with the guy of her dreams. As the story goes on, Yohko appears younger. In part 1, she was drawn with a lot of detail, giving her a mature look. By part 6, less detail and a younger look were used. *Azusa Kanzaki (神崎 あづさ Kanzaki Azusa) : A sidekick, or apprentice under Yohko. She is a Devil Hunter in training.

Azusa wears a Youma bracelet instead of the traditional Youma ring that Yohko possesses and she wields the Spear of Fuma in combat. *Madoka Mano (真野 マドカ Mano Madoka) : Grandmother to Yohko Mano and mother of Sayoko Mano, Yohko's mother. She was the former 107th Devil Hunter but now is too old to continue being a Devil Hunter, although she still has some skill and fight in her. She passes the title of Devil Hunter to Yohko to continue the family legacy. *Sayoko Mano (真野 小夜子 Sayoko Mano) : Daughter of Madoka Mano and mother to Yohko Mano. She was supposed to be the 108th Devil Hunter but became pregnant with Yohko (Only virgins can become Devil Hunters). She had a very frank and open opinion on sex and even gave Yohko a package of condoms in the first episode. This attitude, like most things in the series, was later toned down greatly in subsequent episodes. *Chikako Ogawa (小川 千賀子 Ogawa Chikako) : Yohko's best friend. Chi (her nickname) seems to have an extensive information gathering network and tends to know about most of the events going on at the school. She usually supplies Yohko with info (sometimes pictures) on the most handsome guys. She employs herself as Yohko's \\"manager\\" and assist Yohko where she can, although she does tend to get herself caught in the line of fire. =Secondary characters= *Osamu Wakabayashi : A friend and admirer of Yohko, he gets used by the demons in the first OVA in an attempt to prevent her from becoming a Devil Hunter. *Haruka Mano (真野 ハルカ Mano Haruka) : The very first Devil Hunter from the Mano Family. She is very skilled as a Devil Hunter and is able to fend and defeat any demon, even the most powerful of all demons, Yujiro Tasugaru. In several artworks, she is portrayed with a white Devil Hunter outfit with pink hair. In the anime however, she wears a red Devil Hunter outfit and has light green hair. *Yujiro Tasugaru : The strongest of all demons, Yujiro is one of the first formidable demons and enemy of the Mano Family, being an oni-looking humanoid muscle demon and wearing a monster face on his back. Yujiro is very powerful and has the ability to manipulate time and space. He was responsible for allowing demons to enter the human world and almost brought the world to the brink of hell, until the first Devil Hunter, Haruka Mano, defeated and sealed him. Every generation, Yujiro manages to free himself, only to be beaten and sealed again by that generation's Devil Hunter. Not only is he extremely powerful, he is extremely clever and cunning. *Chiaki Mano : Twin sister of Madoka Mano and Grandmother to Ayako Mano. Chiaki competed against Madoka to see which of the two would hold the title of the 107th Devil Hunter. Chiaki lost to her sister and because of this, she grew bitter of Madoka and left the family house, stealing the Whip of Destruction in the process. She now trains Ayako and Azusa 2 to defeat the 108th Devil Hunter, Yohko Mano, to prove that Ayako is the true 108th Devil Hunter. *Ayako Mano : Granddaughter of Chiaki Mano and cousin to Yohko Mano. She was trained by Chiaki Mano to defeat Yohko and become the true 108th Devil Hunter. Ayako shares a very similar appearance to Yohko, thus making them look like twins. However, Ayako has lighter hair and her eyes are a bit more narrow than Yohko's, and her Devil Hunter uniform is black, not red. She is the wielder of the Whip of Destruction, which she uses at its full potential. Together with Azusa 2, she had planned to take the Devil Hunter title from Yohko and claim it as her own. However, they joined forces to fight a very powerful demon, one Ayako had accidentally released, which temporarily shook her confidence. Afterwards, Ayako decided she needed more training and left to improve herself, parting with her cousin on more amiable terms. *Azusa 2: Sidekick to Ayako Mano. She looks very much like Azusa Kanzaki. Since she never mentioned her actual name, Madoka dubs her with the name \\"Azusa 2\\". She is very much like Azusa, both in appearance and in skill, which means that she too is a klutz at times and not very skilled in fighting. She does seem to have a bit more experience in combat, although not much of a difference compared to Azusa Kanzaki. Episodes *Devil Hunter Yohko: Yohko Mano is introduced. Yohko goes about her daily life; day dreaming about a cute guy named Hideki. Yohko learns that her family has a long history of being devil hunters. But this time the demons decide to take out the next devil hunter before she can fight back. After a failed attempt to take Yohko's virginity (so that she can't become a devil hunter), the demons decide to use Hideki as bait. Yohko must become the 108th devil hunter and rescue the man of her dreams. The English- dubbed \\"Special Edition\\" of this episode restores approximately 30 seconds of assorted footage that was cut from the final Japanese print of the film. *Devil Hunter Yohko 2: Yohko trains to become a good devil hunter. Nearby a local construction site destroys a forest in which sleeping spirits lie. The spirits are disturbed by this and start harassing the construction workers. Azusa Kanzaki, a Devil Hunter in training, is introduced. Azusa came to become an apprentice to Yohko. The two team up to fight against the spirits that are harassing the workers. *Devil Hunter Yohko 3: Yohko has a dream about a man named Master Biryu. Yohko is transported to another dimension and learns that Biryu has been imprisoned. Yohko learns that she must save Master Biryu (although she develops a crush on him). Meanwhile, Azusa saw Yohko disappear and attempts to get Yohko back with Yohko's friend, Chi. They manage to get to where Yohko is, but fail and manage to get themselves back where they started. She must fight the demon holding Master Biryu captive in order to free him. *Devil Hunter Yohko 4-Ever: A tribute to Devil Hunter Yohko, with a collection of music videos. These videos feature songs from the series (including three new songs), put to scenes from the anime, colored manga picture, an original animated video featuring chibified versions of Yohko and Azusa, and two live videos. *Devil Hunter 5: Hell on Earth: Madoka, Yohko's grandmother, senses the return of Tokima: the demon who from the time of the first devil hunter has been the enemy of the Mano family, is approaching. Tokima appears and possesses Ryuichi Asakura, a man whom Yohko has a crush on. Tokima tricks Yohko and gets near the clock that keeps his power sealed, but is repelled by special talismans. The next day, Madoka ends up with her past youthful body! Tokima possesses Azusa, who takes the clock. Yohko fights Azusa to try to stop her from destroying the clock. Yohko is tricked and \\"killed\\". The clock is destroyed and the demon's power released. Yohko is taken to the time of the very first Devil Hunter, Haruka Mano. The two go back into the present and fight against Tokima. *Devil Hunter Yohko 6: Double Jeopardy: Ayako Mano, who is nearly identical in appearance to Yohko, is introduced; she has spent her life training and honing her abilities so that one day she may defeat Yohko and become the devil hunter of the Mano family, and now she is ready for the final confrontation. Yohko continues to live her life and is unaware of Ayako until she starts stealing away every guy that on whom Yohko has a crush. Then one night while taking a bath, Yohko hears something outside and gives chase. She then meets up with an Azusa look-alike. She and Ayako attack the unsuspecting Yohko with crushing attacks, while Yohko parries the onslaught. The fight stops, but Ayako vows to finish it. Madoka reveals a certain part of her past that relates to the encounter. Yohko's teacher, whom she has a crush on, is used as bait to lure Yohko. Ayako and Yohko meet face-to-face for the showdown. The fight awakens a demon who sleeps deep within the Earth and the two must learn to fight together to fend off this powerful creature. Theme music *Episode 1 End Theme: \\"Go, Go!

Revolution) Release Devil Hunter Yohko was ADV Films' first VHS release on December 15, 1992. ADV co-founder, Matt Greenfield, said the reason Yohko was chosen as the first release was because \\"we wanted something that was really very unique, that people were going to say 'Whoa! What was that?', because at the time no one in the US had seen anything like this.\\" Toho reluctantly licensed Devil Hunter Yohko to ADV, making the title ADV's first; even though Shozo Watanabe, the general manager of the Los Angeles office of Toho, expressed concern that ADV would not be able to handle the distribution of the film, Toho was unable to find another distributor, so it selected ADV. The story was adapted into a manga by Gaku Miyao. The anime was re-released to DVD in 2002, commemorating the tenth anniversary of its original release by ADV. Video games The series was adapted into several video games by Masaya (a division of NCS Corporation): * Mamono Hunter Yōko: Dai 7 no Keishō (1991) for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive. * Mamono Hunter Yōko: Makai kara no Tenkōsei (1992) for the PC Engine. * Mamono Hunter Yōko: Tooki Yobigoe (1993) for the PC Engine.

The building was designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), and consists of a stainless steel facade with black spandrels below the windows. Opened in 1961, it is tall. 28 Liberty Street, on the northern half of a site, consists of 60 above-ground stories, a ground-level concourse, and five basement levels. A plaza that surrounds the tower includes a sunken Japanese rock garden designed by Isamu Noguchi. The building's design is similar to that of SOM's earlier Inland Steel Building in Chicago. David Rockefeller, Chase's executive vice president, proposed the tower in the 1950s as a means to keep the newly merged Chase Manhattan Bank within Lower Manhattan while merging its 8,700 employees into one facility. Construction started in early 1957, and though the tower opened in early 1961, the basements and plaza were not opened until 1964. Despite some early challenges, One Chase Manhattan Plaza was nearly fully occupied from its opening, with numerous financial and legal tenants. The building was renovated in the early 1990s, and Chase moved its headquarters in 1997. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark in 2008. Chase Manhattan's parent company JPMorgan Chase sold the building to Chinese investment company Fosun in 2013; the building was subsequently renamed 28 Liberty Street.  Site  28 Liberty Street is on the northern half of a city block bounded to the west by Nassau Street, to the north by Liberty Street, to the east by William Street, and to the south by Pine Street. Its plaza is on the southeastern portion of the site, while the southwestern portion is occupied by 20 Pine Street, which had been Chase Manhattan Bank's previous headquarters. The tower and the plaza cover in total. The site slopes down to the north, so that the plaza is at the elevation of Pine Street, while Liberty Street is one story beneath the plaza; there are an additional five basements under the plaza. There are stairs leading down the east side of the plaza to Cedar Street. The block was formerly two smaller city blocks, separated by Cedar Street, which ran from west through east. Cedar Street was closed in the late 1950s to make way for 28 Liberty Street's construction. In exchange for acquiring the block of Cedar Street, Chase agreed to cede on each side of the lot for street-widening; paid the city $100,000; and took responsibility for utilities under the newly closed portion of Cedar Street. The city had rarely closed streets for private commercial development, except when there was \\"substantial\\" benefit to the public, such as with Grand Central Depot (later Grand Central Terminal) and the original Pennsylvania Station. Chemical Bank, which purchased the adjacent 20 Pine Street, agreed to carve out an arcade on that building along the southern facade of the ground level in order to allow the widening of the Pine Street sidewalk. Within 28 Liberty Street's immediate surroundings are the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building to the north; the Chamber of Commerce Building and Liberty Tower to the northwest; 140 Broadway to the west; and the Equitable Building to the southwest. The public plaza faces Federal Hall National Memorial to the southwest and 40 Wall Street to the south. The building's concourse has a direct entrance to the Wall Street station () of the New York City Subway. There are also connections to Wall Street () and to Broad Street () via passageways underground. Design Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) designed 28 Liberty Street. Four of the firm's thirteen general partners were most involved with 28 Liberty Street's design, namely Gordon Bunshaft, Edward Mathews, Nathaniel A. Owings, and J. Walter Severinghaus. Bunshaft, who was tasked with the building's general design, passed most of the planning responsibilities to Roy O. Allen and Jacques E. Guiton, since Bunshaft was also involved in several other projects at the time. Three contractors were hired to excavate the foundations, while Turner Construction was hired as the general contractor. Weiskopf & Pickworth was hired as the structural engineer. The building comprises a 60-story tower atop a base composed of five basement stories and the ground floor on Liberty Street. It has a total height of , making it the third-tallest building in the Financial District upon its completion, after the 40 Wall Street and the 70 Pine Street. In addition, 28 Liberty Street was the first curtain-walled building to be taller than . = Form = Looking up at the tower from the plaza; the structural columns project from the facade The 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required skyscrapers in New York City to have setbacks as they rose, was designed to prevent new skyscrapers from overwhelming the streets with their sheer bulk. However, these setbacks were not required if the building occupied 25% or less of its lot. As a result, 28 Liberty Street was designed as a single slab. While buildings with setbacks had less office space on upper floors, Chase wanted to make the upper floors as desirable to tenants as the lower floors, which led to each floor having the same area. Chase was granted a variance from the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals so that the building actually occupied 27.3% of the site; the extra 2.3% site coverage allowed for an additional on each floor. = Facade = The facade is composed of 8,800 plate glass panes, each measuring tall by wide. The glass panes are set within aluminum panels—chosen for their durability and performance—as well as vertical aluminum mullions. The aluminum panels were thick by up to tall and were manufactured by the General Bronze Corporation. The spandrel panels between the windows on each story were made of natural- color aluminum or black porcelain enamel. The building's forty columns, sheathed with aluminum, are about thick and are about apart from each other, arranged in a 4×10 grid. The columns extend from the building on its long sides, while floors cantilever on the columns on the building's short sides; together, the columns carry much of the weight of each floor. The New York Times described this as a relatively novel design, which had never been used on such a large scale. The presence of the columns at ground level creates a colonnade around the lobby, which is recessed behind the upper floors. The columns are above steel assemblies some below ground level; these assemblies are square and thick. In total, over of steel were used in 28 Liberty Street; at its completion, it had more steel than any other New York City skyscraper except the Empire State Building and 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The 11th, 31st, and 51st floors and the third basement level are mechanical floors. Each of the above-ground mechanical floors is a double-height space, with regular windows along the facade on the upper half of each floor, and ventilation grates on the lower half. = Features =  Interior spaces  The building has about of above-ground floor area. Each story measures , with about of area.Each 280-by-106-foot floor is . This gives the 60-story building a total above-ground surface area of . This made 28 Liberty Street the largest new building in New York City by floor area since the mid-1930s. The interior columns were hidden inside the building's \\"core\\", which contained its elevators and service rooms. This provided great flexibility for the interior floor plans, which many prospective tenants desired. The floor plan was slightly asymmetrical, as the southern side was ten feet wider than the northern side, with columns spaced apart from north-to-south. There were only 150 private offices for the 7,500 employees who worked in the tower upon its opening. The offices of Chase's three highest-ranking executives were on the 17th floor. Bunshaft had planned to place a sculpture on the 60th-story landing, but after realizing that the ornamented spire of 40 Wall Street was visible from that level, abandoned plans for the sculpture. The lobby, at the same level as the raised plaza, had a footprint slightly smaller than the floors above it, and was surrounded by a plate-glass wall. There are numerous revolving doors to the south and west. Originally, there was a mezzanine for the loan offices, which was removed by the 1990s. Inside the lobby are six elevator banks, surrounded by travertine walls. The concourse, directly below the lobby, was accessed from Liberty Street. Chase's main branch, beneath 28 Liberty Street's plaza, was accessed from the concourse and was lit by a oval recess surrounded by a transparent barrier. Also on the concourse was a meeting room, a foyer, and a messenger's room. Passageways in the concourse led to the three surrounding subway stations. The floors beneath the plaza are much larger, covering the entire lot with a combined area of . There are five basement levels below the concourse, which include a truck ramp going to the second basement; dining and kitchen space on the first and second basements; printing, tabulating, and mechanical spaces on the third basement; check handling on the fourth basement; and vaults on the fifth basement. The truck entrance, as well as ventilation grates for air intake and outflow, are on the Liberty Street side, below the raised plaza. There is also a pedestrian entrance on the William Street side, below the plaza, which leads to the eastern part of the concourse. According to Architectural Forum, the fifth basement had a \\"bank vault nearly the size of a football field\\", which sorted $35 billion worth of securities (equivalent to $ billion in ).  Mechanical systems and elevators  Escalators connected the lobby to the concourse directly below it. There are 43 elevators in total: three service elevators running from the basements to the lobby; six passenger elevators from the lobby to the basements; and thirty-four passenger elevators from the lobby to the upper floors. The upper-floor elevators ran nonstop from the lobby to serve the upper floors, and were arranged in five \\"banks\\": one elevator bank served the second through 17th floors; three banks each served ten stories between the 17th through 47th floors; and the fifth bank served the 47th through 60th floors. Air-conditioning units on each mechanical floor weighed a total of , making it \\"the largest fully air-conditioned building in New York\\". There are refrigeration units and steam turbine compressors on the 11th and 31st floors; the equipment on the 11th floor serves all stories below the 21st, while the equipment on the 31st floor serves all stories above the 22nd. An air-conditioning system is embedded in the ceiling of each story. The building was powered by transformer vaults in the first basement and the 51st floor, which in turn drew their power from primary feeders on the second basement. On the roof are a series of fans, which are hidden behind a four- story enclosure with a surrounding parapet.  Plaza  The plaza as seen from William and Pine Streets; 28 Liberty Street is in the background, above the plazaThe plaza, officially known as the David Rockefeller Plaza since 2008, is slightly raised above the surrounding streets, with a surrounding parapet, and surrounds the tower. Due to the topography of the area, the northern end of the plaza is above ground level, while the southern end is just above ground level. The plaza was unusual in that it was in a locale with extremely high land values \\"where land was worth up to $10 million an acre []\\". Legally, the plaza is private property rather than a privately owned public space. Three marble staircases and two ramps connected the sidewalk to the plaza: a wide staircase and ramp from Pine Street to the south, a split staircase and ramp from Nassau and Cedar Streets to the west, and a smaller staircase from William and Cedar Streets to the east. Other features of the plaza include planteres and benches. Sculptor Isamu Noguchi, a frequent collaborator of Bunshaft's, was consulted for the design of the plaza. Original plans in 1956 called for square or rectangular recesses in the plaza, accessed by a spiral staircase, but the final 1957 design called for a circular recess, accessed from the concourse. Noguchi created a sunken Japanese rock garden in the recess, similar to one at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, as part of a series of contemporary artworks collected or commissioned by Chase Manhattan. Seven large, dark basalt rocks from Japan were used in the garden, placed atop a surface of 27,000 white granite blocks, each measuring square. Additionally, the garden incorporated three fountains fed by 45 pipes, which drained into a trough that circumscribed the rock garden. Originally, the rock garden had a pool with goldfish, but the goldfish were removed in 1964, having died of copper poisoning when people threw pennies into the pool. In 1970, Chase commissioned a monumental sculpture entitled \\"Group of Four Trees\\" by French artist Jean Dubuffet, and two years later, it was installed in the building's plaza. The sculpture is made of several fiberglass \\"leaves\\" and painted with polyurethane in hues of black and white. At the time, the -tall sculpture was the largest outdoor public artwork in New York City, beating out Pablo Picasso's \\"Bust of Sylvette\\" by . History = Context = Middle Collegiate Church formerly occupied the site of 28 Liberty Street. The Middle Collegiate Church was built on the northern portion of the lot in 1731. Later becoming the city's main Post Office in the mid-19th century, the church building was torn down in 1882. The building site then served as the headquarters of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York from 1884 until the company moved to Broadway in 1950. Mutual Life had expanded into several annexes on Liberty and Cedar Streets, as well as rented space in two buildings on Cedar Street. Two established banks in Lower Manhattan, the Chase National Bank and the Manhattan Company, merged to create the Chase Manhattan Bank in 1955. Chase had been the largest bank in the U.S. until the early 20th century, and the merger made the Chase Manhattan Bank the second-largest bank in the United States. The combined company was at 20 Pine Street. At the time, the Financial District had languished after many corporations had moved uptown. Few large buildings and structures had been erected in the neighborhood since the 1930s, except for transit infrastructure such as the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel and office towers at 99 Church Street and 161 William Street. =Planning and construction=  Initial planning  In January 1955, Chase Manhattan president John J. McCloy hired David Rockefeller, patriarch of the Rockefeller family, as the company's executive vice president for redevelopment. Rockefeller later recalled that he had persuaded McCloy to employ a \\"qualified outside firm\\" to conduct studies on what facilities Chase Manhattan needed. The firm, Ebasco Services Incorporated, conducted numerous studies and determined that the company should buy land for a single headquarters at one of two possible locations: the \\"Broad Street block\\" and the \\"Mutual Life block\\". The firm further recommended a \\"definitive and dramatic\\" design. Rockefeller worked closely with real estate developer William Zeckendorf, who suggested purchasing the Mutual Life block between Nassau, Liberty, William, and Pine streets. In February 1955, the Chase Manhattan Bank purchased the Mutual Life plot for $4.425 million to construct a new headquarters called One Chase Manhattan Plaza. While Chase Manhattan claimed at the time that it had no plans to construct new headquarters, demolition began in May 1955. SOM was hired for the project in early 1955. Accounts vary on how SOM was selected: Rockefeller wrote that the firm had been recommended by his friend, the architect Wallace Harrison, though Owings claimed that the firm had sought the commission of their own volition. SOM considered three plans for the site: a single building on the block between Cedar and Liberty Streets; two buildings spread out across the two blocks between Pine and Liberty Streets; and a single building on the two blocks, with a plaza abutting it. Although The New York Times later said that Owings \\"claimed credit for the idea of placing a skyscraper on a small part of a downtown lot\\", Rockefeller stated that Zeckendorf was the person responsible for the tower-and-plaza scheme. In September 1955, Guiton presented at least two of these plans to Chase's board of directors. While the tower-and-plaza plan had marginally less interior space than two separate buildings, it was the proposal ultimately selected.  Finalization of plans  The Chase Manhattan Bank officially publicized their intentions to rebuild the two-block site in November 1955; the planned development was described as part of a new \\"Rockefeller Center\\" for Lower Manhattan. The following month, further details of the redevelopment were revealed, including a wider-ranging redevelopment of the Financial District. In addition to the new Chase tower, the plan included a 750-unit middle-income housing project on Whitehall Street, a 1,000-spot parking garage on Pearl Street, and a $6.19 million widening of Water Street, promoted by Rockefeller's Downtown–Lower Manhattan Association. The wider redevelopment was conceived in conjunction with city planner Robert Moses, mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., and Manhattan borough president Hulan Jack. In particular, Rockefeller said that Moses's approval of the project preceded approvals from other entities. Viewed from Cedar Street, one block west; 140 Broadway is to the left and the Equitable Building to the right SOM's design, influenced by the firm's Seagram Building and Inland Steel Building, was completed in early 1956, and SOM submitted blueprints to the New York City Department of Buildings that February. At that point, The New York Times predicted the project would cost $75 million, which included the plaza's cost. The bank's board approved $75 million in March 1956 for the construction of the new tower along with a large public plaza. The bank planned to occupy of the building and lease the remaining to outside tenants. Guiton said that the bank's board applauded the plans when they were approved. Shortly after, the plans were unveiled to the public.  Construction  Construction on the tower began in late 1956. Before starting work on One Chase Manhattan Plaza, SOM built a one-story mockup with aluminum and stainless steel at Roosevelt Field. Of these, aluminum was used for its cost and appearance, despite both materials performing similarly. A groundbreaking ceremony for the building was held on January 29, 1957, with the first ceremonial scoop of dirt being excavated by Chase Manhattan's longest-tenured worker. At the time, the total cost was estimated at $121 million, with $94 million for construction, another $16 million for utilities and land acquisition, and $11 million for furniture. Up to 1,800 workers were employed at any given time. Foundation work took place between March 1957 and November 1958, and excavations reached below ground level. The first of the steel assemblies, upon which each of the 40 structural-steel columns would be placed, was installed within the foundation in September 1958. Afterward, steel work commenced in December 1958, with the building topping out during September 1959. This was followed by the completion of the curtain wall in March 1960. Completion was initially anticipated for 1959, but four citywide strikes of construction workers, including an 18-week elevator worker strike, delayed construction. Furthermore, a crane operator died in a June 1958 construction accident. By December 1960, the tower was completed, and Chase Manhattan Bank employees began moving in to the new tower the next month. Chase Manhattan opened a temporary office within the tower while the plaza and basements were under construction. The official opening was held on May 28, 1961; the southern block had not been cleared at the time of the tower's opening, and the only progress on that block was a group of nine trees that had been planted on Nassau Street. The plaza was completed in December 1963, and the permanent banking office underneath it opened the next month, after which the temporary office was turned into an auditorium. The plaza's official opening was celebrated with a party in May 1964. The structure cost $138 million in total, including the plaza. =Chase Bank ownership=  Late 20th century  From the beginning, One Chase Manhattan Plaza had a 99% occupancy rate: the bank was on the lower stories, and 61 companies with a combined 2,500 workers were on the upper stories. The tenants were mainly financial tenants such as EF Hutton and Fuji Bank; law firms like Cravath, Swaine & Moore; and a private luncheon club called the Wall Street Club. The building's address caused problems for mail delivery persons and the general public. By the early 1970s, though the names of several other buildings in Manhattan ended in the word \\"Plaza\\", One Chase Manhattan Plaza was the only such building that did not have an address designation based on a surrounding street. The \\"Group of Four Trees\\" sculpture in the plaza was installed in 1972. In its early years, the building faced several challenges. The glass panels began blowing away from the building during high winds: during 1962, fifteen glass panels fell from the building due to negative pressure caused by combination of the building's design and minute weaknesses in the glass. All of the building's 8,800 panels were reinspected, with similarly weakened panels replaced. A fire also took place in the sub-basement in 1962, and an anti-Vietnam War bombing occurred on the 16th floor in 1969, causing minor damage. A Brink's truck in the building's underground garage was robbed in 1979 by two armed men driving a stolen fish truck, who took two hostages before transferring over $2 million into the refrigerated truck. The truck was later found abandoned, and the robbers escaped. In 1990, law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy signed a lease for of space in the tower with options to expand to up to . The next year, Chase embarked on a comprehensive renovation of the building, the first major overhaul since its opening 30 years earlier; the renovations were undertaken by SOM. The bank spent $30 million to clean the building's exterior, upgrade elevators, remove asbestos, remodel the lobby, remove the mezzanine, and improve the heating and cooling systems. At the time, numerous large tenants had moved out or were in the process of doing so: law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore had relocated elsewhere in 1990, and Davis Polk & Wardwell moved to 450 Lexington Avenue the next year. The renovations were completed by 1994. While Chase moved its headquarters to 270 Park Avenue in 1996, it retained 70% of the space at One Chase Manhattan Plaza.  21st century  By March 2008, the tower and the surrounding plaza were being considered for official landmark status. The same month, the public plaza around the tower was renamed for David Rockefeller. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission held hearings to designate One Chase Manhattan Plaza as an official landmark in mid-2008, and officially recognized the building as such on February 10, 2009. Chase placed a temporary barricade fence around the plaza in September 2011, at the same time the Occupy Wall Street protests were occurring nearby, though Chase did not specify an exact reason. The ostensible reason for the barricades was construction work in the plaza, though observers saw little work within the plaza, leading to numerous lawsuits against the city's Department of Buildings and Chase; one such lawsuit alleged that the barriers violated the right to freedom of speech provided under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, although the plaza was a private space. Some advocates lodged complaints with the Landmarks Commission, though the barricades were not under the commission's jurisdiction since they were movable barriers. The barricades were dismantled in November 2013. =Fosun ownership= Seen from William Street In 2013, Steve Witkoff made an unsolicited $650 million offer to purchase the building and convert it into a hotel and condominiums. While JPMorgan rejected the offer, it prompted the firm to begin marketing the building to potential bidders as both an office building or a residential conversion opportunity. The building was placed for sale in August 2013. The auction reportedly initially attracted about a dozen bidders, including Witkoff, Harry Macklowe, Joseph Chetrit, Tishman Speyer, Boston Properties, Starwood Capital Group, RXR Realty, and at least two wealthy Asian investment funds. On October 18, 2013, JPMorgan sold the building to Fosun, a Chinese investment company, for $725 million, finalizing the sale that December. Fosun rebranded One Chase Manhattan Plaza as 28 Liberty Street in 2015. The new name refers to the building's position on Liberty Street, but also connects to the Statue of Liberty in the distance and to \\"the good fortune that, according to Chinese tradition, is bound up in the number 8 [and] 28 denotes 'double prosperity'\\". Fosun invested $150 million into reconfiguring the building's ground and lower floors into a retail complex. The renovations included a food hall on the ground floor as well as a , 10-screen Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in the below- ground space. To fund the improvements, Fosun secured an $800 million loan from Deutsche Bank and HSBC in November 2017. In 2018, Danny Meyer opened \\"Manhatta\\", a restaurant and event space taking up the building's entire 60th floor. The same year, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy left their space in the building for the newly built 55 Hudson Yards.

In November 1956, architecture critic Douglas Haskell praised the bulky massing of buildings such as 28 Liberty Street, the Seagram Building, and the Lever House. He called these buildings \\"excellent development\\" in contrast with other structures built as part of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, saying that buildings with \\"wedding-cake\\" setbacks were an \\"abomination\\". Architectural Forum in 1957 described 28 Liberty Street's design as having been influenced by Chase Manhattan directors' desire for the design \\"to say 'bank' in no uncertain terms\\". The New York Times continuously praised the tower's design during 28 Liberty Street's construction. Upon the building's completion, Chase Manhattan hired twelve \\"young women\\" to lead visitors through the building and published a special edition of its magazine, The Chase Manhattan News. A photograph of the building by Erich Locker, called \\"The Chase Manhattan Tower at Dawn\\", was utilized in many advertisements. Time magazine stated that 28 Liberty Street had \\"the Rockefeller touch\\" while The New York Times referred to the tower as \\"New York’s newest landmark\\". Architectural Forum described the construction as \\"a milestone, perhaps even an end point in the development of the American skyscraper, which for decades has been the summit meeting place of business, engineering, and art.\\" Mayor Wagner called the plaza \\"an example of New York City’s endless renaissance\\" upon the plaza's opening. Reviews among architecture critics were more varied. Carole Herselle Krinsky lauded the building's massing and the reflective facade, as opposed to \\"the earlier building surfaces of brick and stone [which] absorb light.\\" New York Times critic Ada Louise Huxtable, writing in 1960, said that 28 Liberty Street, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, and 270 Park Avenue all had a \\"still too-rare esthetic excellence\\". The next month, Huxtable said that the tower and plaza \\"carr[y] the double promise of corporate efficiency and a more enduring value: significant civic beauty.\\" Wolf Von Eckardt said in 1962 that the design was \\"another quiet triumph\\" for architecture despite being \\"not sensationally original\\". Huxtable's successor Paul Goldberger said that the plaza and its \\"progeny\\" had failed, but that the tower had a positive impact on the nearby area. William H. Whyte, a sociologist, praised the plaza as among the \\"great processional spaces\\" in New York City. As early as 1996, architect Robert A. M. Stern had suggested that 28 Liberty Street was a viable candidate for official landmark status.

They are commonly used in the entire region, with the exception of Frostviken in the northernmost part of the province, where the local dialect is of trøndersk origin, due to its later settlement from Norway. In the eastern part of Jämtland the dialects are transitional to those of Ångermanland. The dialect group is commonly regarded and treated as a single entity. Some people consider it a language separate from Swedish. Jamtlandic shares many characteristics with both Trøndersk—the dialect spoken in Trøndelag, Norway—and with the dialects spoken along the coast of Norrland, Sweden. Due to this ambiguous position, there has been a debate since the early 20th century whether Jamtlandic belongs to the West Norse or the East Norse language group. Jamtlandic cannot be uniquely defined belonging to either of these groups. Prior to, and around, the time of the dissolution of the Swedish–Norwegian union, Jamtlandic was undisputedly considered a dialect of Norwegian. See, e.g., p. 112 in part one of Adolf Noreen's Vårt språk (translated from Swedish): :The Westnorthern Swedish (\\"Norwegian-Swedish\\"), originally Norwegian dialects in Särna and Idre (the northwesternmost Dalarna), Härjedalen and Jämtland (where, though, the language east of Östersund eventually passes into Medelpadian or Ångermanlandic). Name The local name for the dialects is jamska, whose literal equivalent in English would be Jamtish or Jämtish. There is, however, no common term for the dialects in English, and academic sources call them by various names, such as jamska, jämtska, Jämtish dialect, Jämtlandic dialect, Jämtland dialects or dialects of Jämtland. The endonym jamska is technically a definite form; the indefinite form jaamsk/jamske is rarely used. Language Since the early 20th century, whether Jamtlandic is a dialect or a language has been hotly debated. Proponents of Jamtlandic as a language point to the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation. A great percentage of the Jamtish speakers recognise Jamtish as a language rather than a Swedish dialect. There have been efforts to make the Swedish government recognise it as a minority language just as Yiddish and Sami. One of the more prominent people that have been active in the effort to make Jamtish a recognised language is Bo Oscarsson. Oscarsson has written books about the Jamtish language/dialect and even compiled dictionaries. History According to the sagas, the region called Jämtland was originally settled by fugitives from Trøndelag after Harald Fairhair united Norway in the 9th century. It became part of Norway during the reign of Haakon I in the 10th century and remained part of Norway until the 17th century. At that point it became part of Sweden. The history of the region accounts for many of the dialect's features. It is difficult to the trace the history of Jamtlandic dialects because written sources only exist from the early 18th century, if not including the early 11th century Frösö runestone or the 14th century legal documents which can not be confirmed to have been written in Old Jamtlandic, the assumed distinct Jamtlandic dialect of Old West Norse.  Orthography  There have been attempts to standardize the orthography of Jamtlandic. The attempt that has been the most popular is Vägledning för stavning av jamska (1994 and 1995) which is the work of the committee Akademien för jamska consisting of Bodil Bergner, Berta Magnusson and Bo Oscarsson. The most prominent application of this orthography has been to prepare translations of parts of the Bible into Jamtlandic resulting in the book Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska. An excerpt: Genesis 1:26–27: :26Å Gud saa: ’Lätt oss gjära når mänish, nager som e lik oss. Å dom ske rå öve fishn derri havan å över foglan pyne himmela, å öve tamdjura öve heile jola, å öve all de djur som kravl å rör se på jorn.´ :27Å Gud skapa mänishan å gjool som n avbild ta se själv. Te kær å kviin skapa n dom. The book does not fully follow Vägledning för stavning av jamska. For example, using Vägledning för stavning av jamska one would spell gjæra v. 'do; make', not \\"gjära\\". Another spelling convention in Nagur Bibelteksta på jamska is the use of the digraph \\"sh\\", in e.g. \\"mänish\\" n. 'human being' and \\"fishn\\" n. 'the fish', with the same pronunciation as English 'sh' in 'shoe'. Properly using Vägledning för stavning av jamska, this would be spelled sch; see § 26 in the external link below. Jamtlandic uses the letters of the Swedish alphabet, with the addition of æ and ô. The letters c, q, w, x, and z are not used in the Jamtlandic alphabet.

Following the introduction of the fifth generation Ford Mustang in 2005, the Shelby nameplate was revived as a new high-performance model, this time designed and built by Ford. 1st generation (1965–1970) = 1965–1966 Shelby GT350 = 1965 GT350R The 1965–1966 cars were the smallest and lightest of the GT 350 models. These cars are often called \\"Cobras\\", which was the Ford-powered AC-based two-seat sports car also produced by Shelby American during the same period. Both models use the Cobra emblem, similar paint scheme, and the optional \\"Cobra\\" valve covers on many GT350s that were part of a marketing tie-in by Shelby, as well as one of his iconic symbols. All 1965–66 cars had the Windsor HiPo K-Code V8 engine, modified with a large 4-barrel Holley 715 CFM carburetor to produce at 6,000 rpm and at 4,200 rpm of torque. Marketing literature referred to this engine as the \\"Cobra hi-riser\\" due to its high-riser intake manifold. Beginning as a stock Mustang with a 4-speed manual transmission and 9\\" live rear axle, the cars were shipped to Shelby American, where they received the high-riser manifolds, Tri-Y headers, and were given larger Ford Galaxie rear drum brakes with metallic-linings and Kelsey-Hayes front disc brakes. The 1965 GT350 was not built for comfort or ease of driving. There were 34 \\"GT350R\\" race-spec cars built specifically for competition use under SCCA rules, and the model was the B-Production champion for three straight years. The 1966 GT350 was more comfortable for casual drivers, including rear seats, optional colors, and an optional automatic transmission. This trend for more options and luxuries continued in the following years, with the cars becoming progressively larger, heavier, and more comfortable, while losing much of their competitiveness in the process. The 1969 GT350s and GT500s were largely styling modifications to a stock Mustang. By 1969 Carroll Shelby was no longer involved in the Shelby GT program, and the design was done in-house by Ford. The 1965 and 1966 GT350s were delivered from Ford's San Jose Assembly Plant in body in white form for modification by Carroll Shelby's operation, originally in Venice Beach and later at Los Angeles International Airport. San Jose cars carried an \\"R\\" in the Ford VIN denoting that facility. The only year that Shelby Mustangs from the 1960s came from another plant was 1968, where they came from New Jersey, \\"T\\" in the VIN, and were modified by A.O. Smith. 1965 GT350s All 1965 GT350s were painted Wimbledon White with Guardsman Blue rocker stripes. Very few GT350s were delivered to the dealer with the optional \\"Le Mans\\" (or \\"LeMans\\") top stripes, which run the length of the entire car. Approximately 28% of the 562 1965 cars built had Le Mans stripes. Dealers often added the stripes, probably at the customer's request. Today, it is difficult to find a GT350 not so equipped. Many ERT 1965 cars had the battery relocated to the trunk, which was changed mid-year from complaints of fumes, and had over-rider traction bars, relocated A-arms, as well as other modifications. Over-rider traction bars are named so because of their design being on top of the leaf spring as opposed to underneath them. There was only one transmission available, a 4-speed Borg-Warner T10 manual. The exhaust system in the 1965 GT350 was a side-exit dual exhaust with glasspack mufflers. For this one year, the GT350 also had special -rated Goodyear \\"Blue Dot\\" tires, named for the prominent blue dot on each sidewall. The 1965 GT350 had a full size spare tire mounted in place of rear seats, making it a 2-seat-only vehicle (to be allowed to race under SCCA regulations as a \\"sports car\\"), and rode on either silver- painted steel wheels or special cast-magnesium center \\"Cragar Shelby\\" 15\\" rims with chromed center caps marked with a stylized \\"CS\\". Total 1965 model year production was 562 units. 1966 GT350s 1966 Shelby GT350 1966 Shelby GT350 For 1966, the GT350 lost its Mustang tag and was marketed simply as the Shelby GT350. The new model year also saw the introduction of non-white colors, including blue, red, green, and black. Other changes included special rear quarter-panel windows replacing the factory extractor vents, functional brake scoops on each side, and optional SelectShift 3-speed automatic, as well as an optional Paxton supercharger. The battery was no longer relocated to the trunk for 1966, and the over-rider traction bars were discontinued. The normal factory fold-down rear seat was optional. While early 1965 cars had black engine blocks, 1966 and later cars had their engines painted the regular factory Ford dark blue. The 1966 models came with a dual-exhaust exiting in the rear. The first 252 GT350s for 1966 began as 1965 Mustang K-Code Fastbacks. These cars were specifically ordered by Shelby American for conversion into 1966 GT350s. Upon delivery to Shelby-American, the cars were randomly picked for conversion. The Shelby VINs do not correspond in numerical order with Ford VINs. The Ford VINs were shipped in 'blocks,' but many differ significantly because of the order that they were selected for conversion. Total production for 1966 was 1,373 fastbacks, including two prototypes and four drag cars, and the 252 early production models with Ford Mustang 1965 bodies. In order to help Shelby sales, Ford, the major shareholder of Hertz, persuaded the rental car giant to purchase 1,003 fastbacks, including two prototypes. Four \\"experimental\\" GT350 convertibles were also built for test purposes in anticipation of a 1967-1/2 convertible offering, bringing total production to 2,378 units for 1966. A small number of the 1966 models were fitted from the factory with Paxton superchargers, but not the No-Spin limited slip differential; with an option price of $670, the engine was rated at . 1966 Shelby GT350 Hertz models '66 GT350-H The deal with the Hertz Corporation to offer ~1,000 GT350s for rental that, after their rental-car lives were finished, were returned to Ford, refurbished, and sold to the public as \\"GT350H\\" models.1966 Shelby GT350-H rental brochure Retrieved from mustangattitude.com on January 22, 2011 Most Hertz cars were black with gold LeMans stripes and rocker panel stripes, although a few were white with blue stripes. The first 85 Hertz cars were available with four-speed manual transmissions and Hertz advertised them as \\"Rent-a-Racer\\" cars. During rental, these cars were sometimes used as production class cars at SCCA events, and were rumored to have been returned to Hertz with evidence of roll bars being welded in. Ford pushed another 800 models on Hertz with black paint, gold stripes and black interior, as well as automatic transmissions. When the Hertz cars were returned to Ford to be prepared for sale to the public, the high- performance parts were often \\"lost\\" (presumably at the manufacturer) before final sale. = 1967 Shelby GT350 / GT500 = For 1967, the GT350 carried over the K-Code high performance 289 with a 'COBRA' aluminum hi-rise. The GT500 was added to the lineup, equipped with a \\"Ford Cobra\\" FE Series V8 engine with two 600 CFM Holley four-barrel carburetors sitting atop a mid-rise aluminum intake manifold. Documented plans to introduce a convertible mid-production year were shelved due to supply, production and financial problems that happened as soon as the first cars started to arrive at Shelby's Los Angeles facility in September. By October 1966, Ford took control over engineering and purchasing. A.O. Smith was tapped to fix the fiberglass fitment and quality problems. Six months later, in May 1967, the decision was made to terminate the California- based Shelby operation. On August 18, 1967, a small staff, along with the remaining engineering cars, was sent to Ionia. The small staff of the newly formed Shelby Automotive, Inc. had substantially less involvement after this time. Notable cars for 1967 include: * 0100, the first GT500 built. * 0131, the only Shelby GT coupe built (\\"Little Red'), which was the precursor to the '68 California Special. The original \\"L'il Red\\" was rediscovered in a Texas farm field in March 2018https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2018/08/21/after-years- of-searching-craig-jackson-unearths-the-lil-red-shelby-prototype/ * 0139, the only Shelby GT500 convertible built (in 1967) Note: cars 0100, 0131 and 0139 were the first big block Shelby GT cars ordered and built. * One 1967 Fastback was updated to a GT500 equipped with a 427 FE GT40 racing engine producing , and was known as the \\"Super Snake\\" The car was capable of speeds over ; hitting during a demonstration (by Shelby himself) of Goodyear's Thunderbolt tires. No cars other than the prototype were built due to limited interest. The car sold at Mecum's 2013 Indianapolis auction for $1.3 million. For 1968, the Cobra name was applied to both models, and they were now marketed as the Shelby Cobra GT350 and the Shelby Cobra GT 500.1968 Shelby GT sales brochure Retrieved from mustangattitude.com on January 22, 2011. The solid lifter K-code engine was discontinued by Ford so Shelby used the hydraulic lifter 230 hp 302. It produced 250 HP with the high rise intake but was not equipped with Shelby headers in order to make room for power steering. The early 1968 GT500 used the Shelby installed 428 Police Interceptor with a single four barrel carburetor rated at 360 HP.

The design of the original 1965 version was evident, but these styling upgrades gave the car a more aggressive appearance and achieved Carroll Shelby's goal of differentiating his car from the Mustang on which it was based. The separate high-beam headlamps in the grille added more character, while a thin, chrome front bumper sat below a mesh grille with the classic \\"Shelby GT350\\" logo in place (except for the very early cars). The small hood scoop was there to deliver fresh air to the engine. Shelby also included new, horizontal sequential taillights (sourced from a '67 Cougar in 1967 and a '65 Thunderbird in 1968) and an integrated Kamm-type rear spoiler. Functional rear brake-cooling scoops adorned the rear quarter panels. Ten-spoke, fifteen-inch, cast-aluminum rims were the wheel choice with Goodyear white-lettered radials. The GT350 was available with air conditioning and an AM/FM radio. The steering wheel was a wood-rimmed and satin-trimmed design with the classic Shelby logo in the center. Behind this wheel was a very classy-looking set of gauges. A 140-mph speedometer and a whopping 8,000-rpm tachometer were joined along with a smaller analog clock, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure gauges. The 1967 GT350 came with an iron-block, 289-cubic-inch (4.7-liter) V-8 rated at 306 horsepower and 329 lb-foot of torque. For a pushrod design, the GT350 revved relatively high, with the horsepower peak not in full swing until the 6,000-rpm redline. 1967 was well before modern fuel injection came about, and the car used a single Holley four-barrel carburetor. The true dual-exhaust with H-shaped crossover system came standard with low restriction mufflers and chrome exhaust tips. Power was routed to the ground through a sturdy, four- speed manual transmission with a single, dry-disc clutch. A three-speed automatic was made available as an option. Rear-end ratios were 3.89-to-1 for the four-speed manual and 3.50-to-1 for the automatic. Acceleration was impressive, with a 0-to-60 time of around seven seconds and a top speed of . Braking duties were handled by 11.3-inch discs up front and drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front suspension consisted of unequal-length control arms, coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a live axle, with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a power-assisted recirculating ball design. In 1968 the 289ci V8 was replaced with a factory 302 V8 using an aluminum Cobra intake manifold and Holley 600 cfm carb. The 302 had less racing parts than the 289 and was rated at 250 hp. A Paxton Supercharger was available that was rated at 33 hp at 5,200 rpm. 1967 Shelby GT500 and 1968 Cobra GT500 1968 convertible The 1967 Shelby G.T. 500 was the first model built in the Shelby G.T. 500 range. It is based on the 1967 Mustang and is equipped with a FE Police-Interceptor V8 engine topped with an aluminum mid-rise intake and 2X4-barrel 600 CFM Holley carburetors producing at 5,400 rpm and at 3200 rpm of torque. Two thousand forty eight were produced in 1967. Several body parts of the G.T. were made of fiberglass including the front-end, hood, rear tail light panel, deck lid, quarter panel extension, and side scoops. 1968 GT500KR Convertible G.T.500KR Beginning in April 1968, Ford began factory installing a version of the 428 engine known as the \\"Cobra Jet\\". The GT500 was subsequently known as The Cobra GT500 KR. The initials KR stood for \\"King of the Road.\\" Ford rated the Cobra jet at , but with of torque at 3,400 rpm, but the horsepower was considered significantly underreported, as it was later found that the car made . Shelby's KR engine was left stock adding die-cast aluminum valve covers with \\"Cobra Lemans\\" to note Ford's FE engine family victory over Ferrari at Le Mans in 1966 and 1967. = 1969-1970 = The GTs lost their Cobra tag for 1969, and once again were marketed simply as the Shelby GT350 and Shelby GT500.1969 Shelby GT350/500 sales brochure Retrieved from mustangtek.com on January 22, 2011 The GT350 and GT500 for the 1969 model year received an extensive face lift, the body alone increasing in length by with some reaching . Ford was involved with design and style decisions, with Shelby having little input. The GT350 was now equipped with a 351 cubic-inch V8. Carroll Shelby terminated his agreement with Ford in the summer of 1969. No production of 1970 Shelby GT350 and 500 models was undertaken; however, unsold 1969 models were given 1970 vehicle identification numbers under FBI supervision. The 1970 models had two cosmetic changes, a front chin spoiler and two black hood stripes. The rest of the changes had to do with emissions. The GT500 had the carburetor modified and marked \\"ed\\" (edited) on tag. The distributor in both the GT 350 and GT500 was changed to a 1970 version. A total of 789 were re-VIN'd. 351 V8 Engine in 1969 Shelby GT 350 File:1969 Shelby GT 350 Convertible.JPG|1969 Shelby GT 350 Convertible  1971 Shelby Europa  Although production of Shelby GTs in the USA had ceased, a total of nine 1971 \\"Shelby Europa\\" GT-350 and GT-500 Mustangs were produced under license by Belgian dealer Claude Dubois for the European market. seven Fastbacks (Ford used the term Sportsroof) and two convertibles were produced; of which seven were M-code and one H-code cars. One 429SCJ J-code Fastback was produced, though its whereabouts today are unknown. Both convertibles and one fastback were modified to GT-500 with 351-HO.Both convertibles are located in Finland. All 1971 Shelby Europas were based on 1971 Mustang, none on 1972 Mustang. Previously it was believed that 14 cars were produced, but the total production number of nine cars was confirmed in 2014 by cross-check of Claude Dubois' files and Ford Factory Mustang production data. 2nd generation 2005–2009 (S-197 I) =Shelby CS6/8= Shelby, along with Paxton, also designed a new variant based on the V6 Mustang. Modifications include a supercharged motor producing , 20\\" wheels bearing the Shelby name and the Cobra badge on each side and the decklid, a 2\\" drop in suspension, Baer/Shelby 14-inch front and rear brakes, an aggressive front fascia and a dual exhaust. Shelby also created the CS8, a 4.6-liter V8 variant of the CS6. The Shelby CS6/8 was not available as a factory release. However, Shelby had made the CS6/8 kit available for purchase. But then the contract with Hertz GT-H came, and only a handful of CS6/8' were built, making them one of the rarest cars ever built by Shelby. = 2006; 2007 Ford Shelby GT-H = 2007 Shelby GT-H Convertible Ford introduced the Shelby GT-H version of the Mustang at the 2006 New York Auto Show. Like the original GT350H from 1966, the GT-H had gold-on- black paint and was only available at the Hertz car rental agency. Ford Racing Performance Group provided Shelby its FR1 Power Pack to add 25 horsepower to the existing Mustang GT powertrain with an additional 10 ft-lb of torque. The package included a 90mm cold air kit, muffler kit, a new X-pipe and Ford Racing \\"GTA\\" axle-back mufflers. The Ford Shelby GT-H also had the Ford Racing Handling Pack (FR3) which included specially tuned dampers, lowering springs, sway bars, strut tower brace, and a Ford Racing 3.55:1 ratio rear axle assembly. A total of 500 cars were built to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original Shelby GT350H. For 2007, a convertible version of the GT-H was offered for rental at Hertz. This time the convertibles came with a custom light bar reminiscent of the 1968 Shelby Mustang convertibles. = 2007–2008 Ford Shelby GT = 2008 Convertible The 4.6 liter, 281-cubic-inch, Ford Shelby GT slotted between the Mustang GT and the Ford Shelby GT500. It is essentially a retail sale version of the Hertz rental-only Ford Shelby GT-H, except a manual transmission is available. The Shelby GT was a unique model in that, just like the Shelby Mustangs of the 60s, the Shelby GT's manufacturing was completed at Shelby Automobiles Inc. in Las Vegas, Nevada after being shipped directly there by Ford Motor Company. Shelby GT's were then sold pre-title to customers. By comparison, GT500 models were manufactured solely by Ford Motor Company in Flat Rock, Michigan. Production of the Shelby GT began in December 2006 and the car went on sale in January 2007. It was originally planned that a limited number of up to 6,000 cars would be built. The Shelby GT's include the deletion of the rear spoiler, a retro Shelby hood scoop, a cold air induction system with performance tuning resulting in a power output of , a Ford Racing suspension package consisting of upgraded dampers, springs which lowered the vehicle 1.5\\" and sway bars, a high performance exhaust system, interior Shelby sill plates and badges and silver stripes, with the car available in either white or black in 2007 and Vista Blue, Grabber Orange, or Black with red stripes for 2008.

Presented in concept form, the new GT350 had a supercharged version of the brand new 5.0-liter V8 engine in the 2011 Mustang GT as well as performance upgrades from Ford Racing, Borla, Cragar, Baer and more. The GT350 was a post-title upgrade available from Shelby. Customers could have their 2011 Mustangs shipped directly to Shelby's Las Vegas facility to be converted or they could deliver the car themselves. Automatic transmission was available for conversion with a naturally aspirated engine, producing up to , and manual transmission cars had the option of NA or a supercharged engine fitted with a Ford Racing supercharger to produce , or at the expense of the warranty, , a Ford Racing suspension system (The first 100 cars were fitted with the Eibach suspension carried over from the GT500 Supersnake), Baer brakes in front and optional in rear, Custom Borla exhaust system, 19\\" Cragar wheels, and more. For the exterior, Shelby installed a new front fascia, front splitter, functional hood scoop, functional brake cooling ducts, tail light trim, rear deck lid filler panel, and a rear fascia with center exhaust exit. Performance White with Guardsman Blue racing stripes were the only available color combination for 2011 models. 2012 models were available in other colors, but lost the 45th Anniversary badge of the 2011. Initial road tests of the GT350 by Motor Trend show the 2011 Shelby GT350 is capable of accelerating from 0- in 3.7 seconds,Lieberman, Jonny. \\"First Test: 2011 Ford Shelby GT350 Prototype\\". Motor Trend, September 22, 2010. compared to the 412 horsepower 2011 Mustang GT's time of 4.4 seconds. It is also faster than the 2011 GT500, which needs 4.2 seconds to get to as well as the Shelby Super Snake with , which takes 4.1 seconds. Weight difference isn't a factor to blame for the better performance than the GT500, considering the GT350 is only lighter than the newly lightened GT500. The GT350's quarter mile time is 12 seconds at NASCAR pace cars Two GT350s were used to pace the 2010 NASCAR race in Las Vegas. They had the prototype front fascia and are now displayed at the Shelby Heritage Museum, being a mainstay for promotional materials and posters. =2011 Shelby GTS= =2012 Shelby GT350= After being revealed at Barrett Jackson in 2010 as a celebration of the original 1965 Shelby GT350s 45th anniversary, the 2012 GT350 made its world debut at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show. A convertible version was offered for 2012, the first convertible GT350 since 1970. The 2011 Ford Shelby Mustang GT350 was previously offered only in a white exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running the length of the vehicle, but the 2012 model year saw two new colors in Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes. These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible offered a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit upgrades included a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced was also included. The 2012 Shelby GT350 delivers the same performance numbers as the 2011 model. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take on a life of its own. An automatic transmission was optional with the naturally aspirated engine. Keeping the powerful engine under control was an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang a reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes were also included in the package. =2012 Shelby GTS= The Shelby GTS was unveiled at the 2012 New York Auto Show, a new model designed to be attainable to the masses. It was available in both V6 and V8 form configurations. \\"It's a car that reaches a younger buyer while acknowledging the economic realities of our times,\\" said Shelby American president John Luft at the time. Shelby installed new front and rear fascias, a \\"deep draw\\" fiberglass hood, black billet grille, Shelby lettering on the trunk lid and finally the signature \\"Le Mans\\" dual stripes over the top and triple side stripes with GTS lettering. Shelby also added a short-throw shifter with cue-ball knob, a serial number plaque and Shelby-badged floor mats. The GTS was fitted with the optional 14-inch Baer front brake system.

For the 2013 model year, the GT350 received new color options, visual styling cues, and optional performance enhancements. The 2013 Shelby GT350 is powered by a 5.0 liter V8 engine offered in either a naturally aspirated version with an optional upgrade to increase the power output to , or a or supercharged versions. The engine could be combined with a manual gearbox with a short throw shifter as standard, or an automatic transmission for the naturally aspirated engine as an option. The 2011 Ford Mustang GT from Shelby was previously only offered in a white exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running the length of the vehicle, and the 2012 model saw the addition of two new colors; Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes.

Changes for the 2013 model year also included a one piece drive shaft, more powerful brakes, cooling enhancements, and a color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. Prototype Demonstrator It was a prototype of GT350 used as a track demonstrator vehicle; which ended up not being used that much as anticipated. It had a supercharged V8 engine, premium interior with Recaro seats, gauges, and 6 piston Wilwood brakes in the front and 4 piston calipers in the rear. It was in the 2013 sales literature and is one of the Heritage Center show cars. =2013 Shelby GTS= =2014 Shelby GT, Shelby GT/SC= The Shelby American version of Shelby GT was based on the 2014 Ford Mustang GT. It was unveiled at the LA Auto Show. Shelby offered a unique set of modifications for the exterior. On the base GT, it got a front splitter conversion with a GT500 rear spoiler and quarter glass covers. The hood was made of fiberglass to save weight and the Le Mans stripes added some style. A separate wide body conversion with the option of rear-only or full all-around wide body wheel arches was also available to spice up the exterior of the 2014 Shelby GT. Among other accessories, Shelby GT front fascia, carbon laminated hood louvers, billet upper grille with Ford running pony emblem and \\"Powered by Ford\\" badges on the sides completed the exterior package. The interior of the 2014 Shelby GT had been overhauled to keep up with the latest trends. Unique touches to the interior included an A-pillar gauge pod with boost, and fuel and oil pressure gauges. This modification was only available on the GT/SC conversion. Even the standard GT conversion got the Shelby headrest covers, special GT dash plaque and engine plate. Leather upholstery in black was standard along with electrically adjustable seats. The \\"Shelby GT Standard\\" is the base pack with 430 horsepower. The slight bump in power was achieved by fitting a Borla performance exhaust as well as engine tuning. The standard package also included a Barton short shifter. The \\"Shelby GT/SC\\" gives 100 more horsepower over the base modification. Shelby Ford Racing Whipple Supercharger kit in either 525 hp or 624 hp configurations, Shelby cooling system and front splitter. Although, Shelby did not independently confirm the performance figures, a 0- of 3.7 seconds and a quarter-mile in an estimated mid 11-second range has been estimated. The base upgrade package used 20-inch wheels, shod with BFG G-Force Comp2 tires and a Panhard suspension bar to stiffen up the chassis. Apart from this, the standard upgrade did not offer much in terms of performance or improved handling. Of course, better tires did provide improved grip while the suspension brace resulted in better cornering. Shelby had done a whole lot to improve the dynamics of the Shelby GT/SC starting with an aluminum driveshaft, employed to deliver power to the rear wheels in order to reduce the overall mass. Wilwood brakes — six-pot front and four-piston rear — for added braking performance. The 20-inch rims on the GT/SC were painted black and were lined with Michelin Pilot Supersport tires. Eibach provided stiffer coil-over springs as well as a sway bar kit to improve handling. 3rd generation (2015–) =2015–2016 Shelby GT= Shelby American launched the 2015 Shelby GT in 2015. It is a package available for the 2015 Ford Mustang GT and is available with either manual or automatic transmissions. According to Shelby American, the upgrades for the 2015 Shelby GT include a more aggressive style with carbon fiber enhancements: hood, rockers, splitters, spoiler and diffuser. Shelby GT also features cold air intakes, custom 20\\" WELD Venice wheels with high-grip Michelin tires, Ford Performance supercharger, Wilwood brakes, adjustable rear control arms, dash-mounted 3-gauge pod for track boost, fuel and oil pressure, race seats, roll cage and harness. Shelby GT Ecoboost The Shelby Ecoboost is a Shelby GT package for Ford Mustang Ecoboost launched in 2015. The package is available in North America. The GT EcoBoost's exterior changes are extensive. Many of the upgrades are the same as the ones found on packages offered on Ford Mustang GT. This includes the extensive use of carbon fiber, notable in the front splitter, hood, rear spoiler and rocker panel. The Shelby Ecoboost includes a Ford Performance handling pack upgraded suspension. Like the manual and automatic transmission V8 version, the EcoBoost version of the car is far more than stripes and a badge. The car was refined with a Ford Performance handling pack upgrade, engine tune and a throatier Ford Performance exhaust. The result is over on 91 octane fuel and significantly better handling. =2015–2016 Shelby Super Snake= Shelby American launched the new Shelby Super Snake in 2015. Due to the discontinuation of Shelby GT500, the 2015 Super Snake lost its GT500 tag, but still have some people called it as GT500 Super Snake. Like the 2015 Shelby GT, it is also based on 2015 Ford Mustang GT. The 2015 Super Snake has a 5.0L V8 equipped with a Shelby/Ford Racing supercharger engine rated at 650+hp (750+hp via Shelby/Whipple Supercharger). According to Shelby, the test car produces . But the car's 12.3-second, quarter-mile run speaks to a horsepower number far less than 750, let alone 850. A stock Camaro ZL1 is faster. Tuner cars such as this one lack SAE-certified horsepower and torque ratings. In front is a carbon-fiber Super Snake hood, adorned with a forced- air scoop that rises above the central grille. The grille is also new, with a black anodized material used both in the upper and lower portions of the front intake. Aerodynamically, Shelby added a carbon-fiber front diffuser, which is complemented in the rear by a larger carbon-fiber spoiler. Below the wing there's more carbon fiber used in the new rear diffuser, taillight panel, and rocker panels with side-skirt aero blades just in front of the rear wheels. The composite is also in place for the mirror covers. Finally, there's the requisite Super Snake racing stripes and external badging. The Super Snake includes special CSM badging, Shelby floor mats, sill plates, a dash-mounted gauge pod made from carbon fiber and stuffed with AutoMeter gauges, Ford Performance short-throw shifter, an upholstery upgrade, racing seats, five- point racing harnesses, Shelby valve covers, and a carbon-fiber latch cover. Routing the power are 3.73 gears and new half shafts, both from Ford Performance. The tires are Michelin Pilot Super Sport wrapped around staggered 20-inch WELD Racing Super Snake wheels. For the first time, the Super Snake will be available with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. Under hood options include an upgraded intercooler and cooling kits for the differential and transmission. Shelby American has for the first time provided right-hand drive version Super Snakes to the UK and Europe through official distributor Bill Shepherd Mustang, and also to Australia, introduced by Mustang Motorsport. =2016 Shelby Terlingua= Shelby American offered a limited run of 50 Shelby Terlingua Racing Team Mustangs based on the 2015–16 Ford Mustang GT in 2016. The Shelby Terlingua is Shelby American's most track-inspired Mustang and is built as a tribute to the Terlingua Racing Team and their 1967 Trans Am Championship. Modifications for the Terlingua include a Whipple supercharger mated to the new Mustang GT 5.0 L V8 engine producing over and an exclusive Eibach sway bar and adjustable coilovers. The Terlingua also includes Ford Performance's upgrades like halfshafts, a short throw shifter and a Borla Exhaust with black tips. The car also added the Brembo big brake kit for race track proven performance, and with 20\\" WELD racing wheels, tons of Shelby-designed carbon fiber components and the distinct Terlingua Racing Team badging. =2016 Ford Shelby GT-H= On the 50th anniversary of the Rent-a-Racer program, Ford, Hertz and Shelby introduced the 2016 Shelby GT-H. Based on the 5.0L V8 Mustang GT, Shelby enhanced the Mustang with Ford Performance components including suspension, exhaust and wheels, along with Shelby design cues like polycarbonate hood and stripes. Beginning Memorial Day, 140 2016 Shelby GT-H's are available for rent as modern-day \\"Rent-A-Racers\\" through the Hertz Adrenaline Collection at select U.S. airport locations. There are several logos and emblems spread throughout the body. \\"GT-H\\" logos are on the grille, rear faux gas cap, and on the trunk lid. Shelby replaced the standard front splitter and rear spoiler with elements made of carbon-fiber. The hood is also specially crafted with vents and a big bulge at the center, the same as the Shelby GT. It has 19-inch aluminum wheels fitted with Michelin tires (255/40s at the front and 275/40s at the rear. The interior of the new Ford Mustang Shelby GT-H is based on the standard Mustang GT. Only a few features sets the two models' interior styling apart.

The 2010 GT500 can brake from 60–0 mph in 107.0 ft and has a lateral acceleration of 1.00 G. 2011 and 2012 Much like the 2011 V6 and GT Mustangs, the 2011 Shelby GT500 got an engine update with an all-new 5.4 L aluminum engine which was lighter than the previous cast-iron engine and uses Ford-patented plasma-coating technology (Plasma transferred wire arc). The inventors of PTWA received the 2009 IPO National Inventor of the Year award. This technology was initially patented and developed by inventors from Flame-Spray. The technology was subsequently improved upon by Ford and Flamespray. With the engine updates, not only has performance improved to at 6,200 rpm and at 4,500 rpm of torque, but the GT500's gas mileage has improved to city and highway, which was enough to eliminate the U.S. Gas Guzzler Tax. The final production number of the 2011 Shelby GT500 by the end of the year was 5100 units. Ford also improved upon the handling characteristics of the GT500. The overall stance of the car has been lowered by 11 millimeters in front and 8 millimeters at the rear. The car also features Ford's new Electric Power Assist Steering (EPAS) that improves torque build-up and road feel which delivers quicker and more precise steering, increased effort on the racetrack or winding roads, and reduced effort in low-speed parking maneuvers. The car also has Ford's AdvanceTrac stability control system, which features a sport mode when pressed twice consecutively while stopped with the brakes applied. External improvements include an optional SVT Performance Package, which includes Goodyear EagleF1 SuperCar G: 2 tires, all-new lightweight 19-inch forged- aluminum wheels in front and 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels at the rear, a 3.73 rear axle ratio, and performance tuned front and rear shocks along with stiffer springs.

Optional is a glass top roof, previously available, starting in 2009, with the Mustang GT. The improvements in handling and performance gives the 2011 Shelby GT500 a skidpad rating of 1.0g, and a Virginia International Raceway lap time of 2:58:48, making it as fast as, and sometimes faster than, cars such as the M3, Audi R8 V10, Dodge Viper SRT-10 and Porsche GT3 around this racetrack. Changes to the 2012 model year Shelby GT500 included a new Recaro seat option. The Sterling Gray color was no longer available. =2011-12 GT500 Super Snake= Just like the 2011 Shelby GT500, born on the proving grounds of the drag strip and road course at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Shelby American worked with companies like Ford Racing to create an even more aggressive suspension and engine package for the 2011 Super Snake.

The Super Snake is offered in two supercharged engine packages which have power outputs of and respectively. The first fifty vehicles sold were available in limited edition colors, either in black with a triple gold stripe or white with a triple gold stripe. The 2013 GT500 Super Snake marked the discontinuation of the Shelby \\"Alcoa\\" Super Snake Wheels. New, lightweight forged aluminium wheel were produced and used instead. These wheels were also used on any GT500 (even 2007–2012 models) that entered the Shelby American Facility to be converted into a Super Snake version. The 2013 Super Snake was also offered with a wide body option. WELD Edition concept The WELD edition Super Snake had new wheels designed specifically and exclusively for Shelby and will be used on the next generations of Shelby Mustangs. This car was in the Weld wheels SEMA show display. The hood of this WELD Super Snake is an all carbon fiber Super Snake hood. It also has carbon fiber trim parts, included side rocker panels, rear diffuser, spoiler and rear fenders. Parts that featured WELD are its vinyl strips and Recaro seats. Wide Body Prototype Wide Body Edition This car was the first of the latest generation wide body Super Snakes. CSM13SS0001P was one of the key development vehicles for the wide body program as well as the Super Snake program for 2013. It appeared on both the wide body and many of the Super Snake promotional materials and displays during this time period. It was previously shown at the Detroit Auto Show in 2013 and the New York Auto Show, as well as many other shows and events all over US. It was also in the Shelby Annual publication. This prototype is currently on display in the Shelby Museum. Demonstrator Edition of Shelby American This demonstrator of Shelby American was used as part of a ride-n-drive to help show drivers the primary difference between the stock GT500 and the GT500 Super Snake. The conversion includes 850HP, courtesy of a 4.0L Whipple Supercharger, and comes with the optional Watts link and upgraded interior. =2013-2014 Shelby 1000 and 1000 S/C= The 2013 Shelby 1000 was officially unveiled at the New York International Auto Show, under once again a Street Package, and a Track Package (S/C). The 2013/14 Shelby 1000 had the V8 engine from the 2013/14 GT500. Upgrades included a full Engine Package using a performance 850 hp fuel system with 72 lb injectors, a Borla Custom 3\\" stainless steel catback exhaust and new parts such as forged pistons, ported cylinder heads, titanium valve springs and titanium retainers. The engine breathes through a Kenne Bell 3.6L Supercharger using a 4.5\\" inlet pipe feeding an 1850cfm throttle body. A High Performance aluminium flywheel and a twin-clutch assembly is also used. The engine is estimated to produce over . Like the 2012 Shelby 1000, the 2013/14 needed significant under-body and chassis strengthening modifications to handle the extra power from the engine. Driveshaft tunnel braces and billet- aluminium supports and suspension parts were used. A Custom 9\\" Wavetrac Differential is used to help put power down through the rear wheels. The Exterior received the usual \\"Shelby 1000\\" decals and an overlay package with a functional carbon-fiber hood, front lip spoiler, rear bumper and side skirts. A Widebody Version of the car was also offered. Since 2011, Shelby 1000 become a package for 2010-14's Ford Shelby GT500, due to the popularity of the package, Shelby American also received 2013–14 Ford Shelby GT500s to be converted into Shelby 1000s from customers. Ford Performance 3rd generation Shelby GT350 (2015–2020) =2015/6 Ford Shelby GT350= For 2016, the GT350 has a flat-plane crank V8 engine, known as Voodoo producing at 7,500 rpm and at 4,750 rpm of torque. The GT350 is more track focused than the GT500, and was benchmarked against the Chevrolet Corvette C7, Porsche 911 S and BMW M4. It has a track-focused chassis tuning, wider front fenders housing 295-width Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, significant aerodynamic changes to include lowering the hood around the engine, active-exhaust, six-piston Brembo brakes with semi-floating rotors, MagneRide damping option (the first MagneRide- equipped Ford), light weight Tremec six speed manual transmission, Recaro seats and various weight reduction efforts. Specifically, it has a carbon fiber reinforced polymer radiator support that directs cooling channels for various components. The GT350 and GT350R were discontinued after model year 2020. GT350R 2016 Shelby GT350R rear At the 2015 North American International Auto Show a more track-focused, hardcore and limited production version of the GT350 was unveiled called the GT350R, benchmarked against the Chevrolet Camaro Z28 and Porsche 911 GT3. The GT350R retains the GT350's 5.2-liter flat plane crank V8 engine, producing the same power, but grip was significantly increased by the means of wider Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, Carbon Revolution carbon fiber wheels (the first ever fitted to a mass- production road car) each weigh approximately 15 pounds less than the aluminum wheels on the GT350, and significantly more downforce thanks to a larger splitter and carbon-fiber rear wing to keep the car stuck to the ground. Items like the air conditioning, stereo, trunk floorboard, all the carpeting, the rear seats, and the backup camera could be removed from the factory resulting in the GT350R weighing less than the GT350. Serial #001 was sold at the 2015 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auction for US$1,000,000 with the proceeds to benefit the JDRF. The GT350R won Road & Track magazine's 2016 \\"Performance Car of the Year\\" (PCOTY) and Car and Driver magazine's \\"10 Best Cars\\" for 2016. GT350R-C As with previous production-based Mustang race cars, Multimatic Engineering was approached by Ford Performance to develop a complete race-only version of the S550 Shelby GT350R. The resulting competition derivative, the GT350R-C, has safety equipment and roll-over protection homologated to FIA and IMSA specifications; Bosch MS5.0 ECU and ABS controller; MoTeC instrumentation and datalogging; adjustable anti-roll bars; Multimatic DSSV spool-valve dampers and other competition upgrades. Though delayed until the third race of the 2015 Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge, the GT350R-C was competitive right away: having earned pole position for its debut race, the GT350R-C won the next two rounds, and took three wins overall in its debut season. Success continued into 2016 as privateer team C360R finished behind the sole entry of factory-supported team Multimatic Motorsports for a 1–2 GT350R-C finish in the season-opener at Daytona. The #15 Multimatic Motorsports Shelby GT350R-C driven by Billy Johnson and Scott Maxwell continued on to win 6 out of 10 races as well as the 2016 Team, Driver, and Manufacturers Championships. =2019 Shelby GT350= The GT350 was updated for the 2019 model year. The update includes new suspension, aerodynamics, and bespoke Michelin summer tires. The updated rear wing has an optional Gurney flap, helping downforce without adding too much drag. The other aerodynamics update is out front. The GT350 now gets the grille from the GT350R, which has fewer openings, creating less front-end drag. The GT350 also moved to the 5.2L engine block, cylinder head and valve train from the GT500 to reduce overall costs. In order to improve corner grip and braking, Ford commissioned a custom set of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires that have a model-specific tread pattern and compound. The tires are 295/35-19 front section and 305/35-19 rear section, the same as the previous model. The springs and shocks have been revised — 10 percent softer in the rear and 10 percent firmer in the front. The tuning for the Magneride system, ABS and electronic power steering system have also been revised. The GT350R also receives the high-tail steering knuckle from the 2020 GT500 as well as a new steering rack. The 2019 GT350 also gets updated in the interior and exterior. Power adjustable seats with faux suede inserts are available, along with faux suede inserts on the doors. An optional 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen Play sound system is also available as the Tech Packages, which also includes puddle lamps, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic alert The GT350 now come standard with the 8-inch SYNC 3 touchscreen infotainment and dual-zone climate control. The new colors were also introduced: Velocity Blue and Ford Performance Blue. The digital instrument cluster is not yet available. An exposed carbon fiber dashboard is an available option. The 2019 GT350 went on sale in early 2019. =2020 Shelby GT350= The GT350 only had minor updates for the 2020 model year. These upgrades include updated suspension tuning and new colors (Grabber Lime, Twister Orange (replacing Orange Fury), Iconic Silver, Rapid Red (replacing Ruby Red)). The 2020 also introduced a new option, the Heritage Edition Package celebrating 55 years of track focused Mustang Fastbacks, which includes Wimbledon White paint with Guardsman Blue Over-the-Top racing stripes, unique Guardsman Blue sides stripes not available on other GT350s. =2020 Shelby GT350SE= To commemorate 55 years since the first Shelby Mustang, Shelby American created Carroll Shelby Signature Edition versions of the 2015-2020 Shelby GT350 and Shelby GT350R. Ford Performance 3rd generation Shelby GT500 (2020–) Rear view =2020 Shelby GT500= The 2020 GT500 was unveiled at the January 2019 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It is powered by a hand-built 5.2-liter \\"Predator\\" aluminum- alloy V8 engine with a 2.65-liter roots-type supercharger. The Shelby GT500 produces and of torque. However, it will not arrive to the European market due to the V8 5.2 liter motor not able to comply with European road regulations, therefore it will only focus on North America and Middle Eastern countries. =2020 Shelby GT500SE= Shelby American released the signature edition of GT500 with an additional 40 horsepower.

Diagram of an exhaust manifold from a Kia Rio. 1. manifold; 2. gasket; 3. nut; 4. heat shield; 5. heat shield boltCeramic-coated exhaust manifold on the side of a performance car In automotive engineering, an exhaust manifold collects the exhaust gases from multiple cylinders into one tube. The word manifold comes from the Old English word manigfeald (from the Anglo-Saxon manig [many] and feald [fold]) and refers to the folding together of multiple inputs and outputs (in contrast, an inlet or intake manifold supplies air to the cylinders). Exhaust manifolds are generally simple cast iron or stainless steel units which collect engine exhaust gas from multiple cylinders and deliver it to the exhaust tube. For many engines, there are aftermarket tubular exhaust manifolds known as headers in American English, as extractor manifolds in British and Australian English,The Design and Tuning of Competition Engines, Philip H. Smith, pp. 137–138 and simply as \\"tubular manifolds\\" in British English. These consist of individual exhaust tubes for each cylinder, which then usually converge into one tube called a collector. Headers that do not have collectors are called zoomie headers. The most common types of aftermarket headers are made of mild steel or stainless steel tubing for the primary tubes along with flat flanges and possibly a larger diameter collector made of a similar material as the primaries. They may be coated with a ceramic-type finish (sometimes both inside and outside), or painted with a heat-resistant finish, or bare. Chrome plated headers are available but these tend to blue after use. Polished stainless steel will also color (usually a yellow tint), but less than chrome in most cases. Another form of modification used is to insulate a standard or aftermarket manifold. This decreases the amount of heat given off into the engine bay, therefore reducing the intake manifold temperature. There are a few types of thermal insulation but three are particularly common: * Ceramic paint is sprayed or brushed onto the manifold and then cured in an oven. These are usually thin, so have little insulatory properties; however, they reduce engine bay heating by lessening the heat output via radiation. * A ceramic mixture is bonded to the manifold via thermal spraying to give a tough ceramic coating with very good thermal insulation. This is often used on performance production cars and track-only racers. * Exhaust wrap is wrapped completely around the manifold. Although this is cheap and fairly simple, it can lead to premature degradation of the manifold. The goal of performance exhaust headers is mainly to decrease flow resistance (back pressure), and to increase the volumetric efficiency of an engine, resulting in a gain in power output. The processes occurring can be explained by the gas laws, specifically the ideal gas law and the combined gas law. Exhaust scavenging Cut through a 2-1 junction in an exhaust manifold showing pressure, which is nonhomogeneous due to centripetal forces, and flow. When an engine starts its exhaust stroke, the piston moves up the cylinder bore, decreasing the total chamber volume. When the exhaust valve opens, the high pressure exhaust gas escapes into the exhaust manifold or header, creating an \\"exhaust pulse\\" comprising three main parts: # The high-pressure head is created by the large pressure difference between the exhaust in the combustion chamber and the atmospheric pressure outside of the exhaust system # As the exhaust gases equalize between the combustion chamber and the atmosphere, the difference in pressure decreases and the exhaust velocity decreases. This forms the medium-pressure body component of the exhaust pulse # The remaining exhaust gas forms the low-pressure tail component. This tail component may initially match ambient atmospheric pressure, but the momentum of the high and medium-pressure components reduces the pressure in the combustion chamber to a lower-than-atmospheric level. This relatively low pressure helps to extract all the combustion products from the cylinder and induct the intake charge during the overlap period when both intake and exhaust valves are partially open. The effect is known as \\"scavenging\\". Length, cross-sectional area, and shaping of the exhaust ports and tubes influences the degree of scavenging effect, and the engine speed range over which scavenging occurs. The magnitude of the exhaust scavenging effect is a direct function of the velocity of the high and medium pressure components of the exhaust pulse. Performance headers work to increase the exhaust velocity as much as possible. One technique is tuned-length primary tubes. This technique attempts to time the occurrence of each exhaust pulse, to occur one after the other in succession while still in the exhaust system. The lower pressure tail of an exhaust pulse then serves to create a greater pressure difference between the high pressure head of the next exhaust pulse, thus increasing the velocity of that exhaust pulse. In V6 and V8 engines where there is more than one exhaust bank, \\"Y-pipes\\" and \\"X-pipes\\" work on the same principle of using the low pressure component of an exhaust pulse to increase the velocity of the next exhaust pulse. Great care must be used when selecting the length and diameter of the primary tubes. Tubes that are too large will cause the exhaust gas to expand and slow down, decreasing the scavenging effect. Tubes that are too small will create exhaust flow resistance which the engine must work to expel the exhaust gas from the chamber, reducing power and leaving exhaust in the chamber to dilute the incoming intake charge. Since engines produce more exhaust gas at higher speeds, the header(s) are tuned to a particular engine speed range according to the intended application. Typically, wide primary tubes offer the best gains in power and torque at higher engine speeds, while narrow tubes offer the best gains at lower speeds. Many headers are also resonance tuned, to utilize the low-pressure reflected wave rarefaction pulse which can help scavenging the combustion chamber during valve overlap. This pulse is created in all exhaust systems each time a change in density occurs, such as when exhaust merges into the collector. For clarification, the rarefaction pulse is the technical term for the same process that was described above in the \\"head, body, tail\\" description. By tuning the length of the primary tubes, usually by means of resonance tuning, the rarefaction pulse can be timed to coincide with the exact moment valve overlap occurs. Typically, long primary tubes resonate at a lower engine speed than short primary tubes. Some modern exhaust headers are available with a ceramic coating. This coating serves to prohibit rust and to reduce the amount of heat radiated into the engine bay. The heat reduction will help prevent intake manifold heat soak, which will decrease the temperature of the air entering the engine. Why a cross plane V8 needs an H or X exhaust tube Crossplane V8 engines have a left and right bank each containing 4 cylinders. When the engine is running, pistons are firing according to the engine firing order. If a bank has two consecutive piston firings it will create a high pressure area in the exhaust tube, because two exhaust pulses are moving through it close in time. As the two pulses move in the exhaust tube they should encounter either an X or H pipe. When they encounter the pipe, part of the pulse diverts into the X-H pipe which lowers the total pressure by a small amount. The reason for this decrease in pressure is that the fluid (liquid, air or gas) will travel along a pipe and when it comes at a crossing the fluid will take the path of least resistance and some will bleed off, thus lowering the pressure slightly. Without an X-H pipe the flow of exhaust would be jerky or inconsistent, and the engine would not run at its highest efficiency. The double exhaust pulse would cause part of the next exhaust pulse in that bank to not exit that cylinder completely and cause either a detonation (because of a lean air-fuel ratio (AFR)), or a misfire due to a rich AFR, depending on how much of the double pulse was left and what the mixture of that pulse was. Dynamic exhaust geometry Today's understanding of exhaust systems and fluid dynamics has given rise to a number of mechanical improvements. One such improvement can be seen in the exhaust ultimate power valve (\\"EXUP\\") fitted to some Yamaha motorcycles. It constantly adjusts the back pressure within the collector of the exhaust system to enhance pressure wave formation as a function of engine speed. This ensures good low to mid-range performance. At low engine speeds the wave pressure within the pipe network is low. A full oscillation of the Helmholtz resonance occurs before the exhaust valve is closed, and to increase low-speed torque, large amplitude exhaust pressure waves are artificially induced. This is achieved by partial closing of an internal valve within the exhaust—the EXUP valve—at the point where the four primary pipes from the cylinders join. This junction point essentially behaves as an artificial atmosphere, hence the alteration of the pressure at this point controls the behavior of reflected waves at this sudden increase in area discontinuity. Closing the valve increases the local pressure, thus inducing the formation of larger amplitude negative reflected expansion waves. This enhances low speed torque up to a speed at which the loss due to increased back pressure outweighs the EXUP tuning effect. At higher speeds the EXUP valve is fully opened and the exhaust is allowed to flow freely.

Covarrubias wrote about his friend: \\"The months went by as Rose and I roamed all over the island with Spies, watching strange ceremonies, enjoying their music, listening to fantastic tales, camping in the wilds of West Bali or on the coral reefs of Sanur. Walter loved to collect velvety dragonflies, strange spiders and sea-slugs, not in a naturalist's box, but in minutely accurate drawings. For days at a time he would be in his tent drawing them, because once dead, their beautiful colors disappeared. He was temperamental when he went into seclusion to paint, he would work incessantly for months on one of his rare canvases. (...). He also painted dreamlike landscapes in which every branch and every leaf is carefully painted, done with the love of a Persian miniaturist, a Cranach, a Breughel or a Douanier Rousseau\\". The knowledge of every aspect of Balinese culture that Spies provided for Covarrubias' research was well-acknowledged by the latter. \\"In his charming devil-may-care way, Spies was familiar with every phase of Balinese life and was the constant source of disinterested information to every archaeologist, anthropologist, musician or artist who has come to Bali. His assistance was given generously and without expecting even the reward of credit\\". \\"Spies was the first to appreciate and record Balinese music, he collected every pattern of Balinese art, contributed to Dutch scientific journals -the Dutch were the colonial power in Bali since 30 years earlier-, he created the Bali Museum of which he was the curator, and built a splendid aquarium\\". In 1937, Spies built what he described as a \\"mountain hut\\" at Iseh in Karangasem. Spies was the co-founder of the Pita Maha artists cooperative, through which he shaped the development of modern Balinese art and established the Westerner's image of Bali that still exists today. After living for nine years at the confluence of two rivers in Campuan (Ubud), Spies grew weary of his increasingly hectic social life, and retired to the tranquil mountain retreat that was to become the setting of some of his most beautiful and atmospheric paintings, including \\"Iseh im Morgenlicht 1938\\" Despite his desire to escape from a constant stream of visitors, Spies still used to receive guests at Iseh, including the musician Colin McPhee and his wife, anthropologist Jane Belo, the Swiss artist Theo Meier and the Austrian novelist Vicki Baum. Vicki Baum accredits Walter Spies with providing her the factual historical information and details on Balinese culture for her historical fiction novel \\"Love and Death in Bali\\" - dealing with the Dutch intervention in Bali (1906), and first published in German in 1937. In December 1938, Spies was arrested as part of a crackdown on homosexuals. With the influence of people such as Margaret Mead, he was released in September 1939. Spies was a paedophile, according to Australian documentary maker Kerry Negara. A reviewer of the novel Island of Demons, which is loosely based on Spies' life, has suggested that Spies' portrayal of an artistic paradise concealed predatory and exploitative relationships with young Balinese men. As a German national in the Dutch East Indies during World War II, Spies was arrested and deported by the Dutch authorities along with other 477 internees, on board of SS Van Imhoff. However, on 19 January 1942 a Japanese bomb hit the ship that was carrying the German internees to Ceylon, and because the crew had the order not to evacuate the Germans, most of the prisoners on the ship, including Spies, drowned.Van Imhoff memorial portal The novel \\"All the Lives We Never Lived\\" by Anuradha Roy (2018, ATRIA Books of Simon & Schuster) weaves Walter Spies into the plot by name and historic persona. Spies interacts with the plot's fabricated heroine, Gayatri, in fictional episodes. There are also recognizable real events in the novel, including his imprisonment and death at sea. Roy gives him a sympathetic portrayal. See also *Balinese art *Balinese dance *Hinduism in Indonesia References Bibliography * Elke Voss: \\"Walter Spies - Ein Leben für die balinesische Kunst\\".

Early symptoms may include a strong feeling of thirst, weakness, nausea, and loss of appetite. Severe symptoms include confusion, muscle twitching, and bleeding in or around the brain. Normal serum sodium levels are 135–145 mmol/L (135–145 mEq/L). Hypernatremia is generally defined as a serum sodium level of more than 145 mmol/L. Severe symptoms typically only occur when levels are above 160 mmol/L. Hypernatremia is typically classified by a person's fluid status into low volume, normal volume, and high volume. Low volume hypernatremia can occur from sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, diuretic medication, or kidney disease. Normal volume hypernatremia can be due to fever, extreme thirst, prolonged increased breath rate, diabetes insipidus, and from lithium among other causes. High volume hypernatremia can be due to hyperaldosteronism, excessive administration of intravenous 3% normal saline or sodium bicarbonate, or rarely from eating too much salt. Low blood protein levels can result in a falsely high sodium measurement. The cause can usually be determined by the history of events. Testing the urine can help if the cause is unclear. The underlying mechanism typically involves too little free water in the body. If the onset of hypernatremia was over a few hours, then it can be corrected relatively quickly using intravenous normal saline and 5% dextrose in water. Otherwise, correction should occur slowly with, for those unable to drink water, half-normal saline. Hypernatremia due to diabetes insipidus as a result of a brain disorder, may be treated with the medication desmopressin. If the diabetes insipidus is due to kidney problems the medication causing the problem may need to be stopped or the underlying electrolyte disturbance corrected. Hypernatremia affects 0.3–1% of people in hospital. It most often occurs in babies, those with impaired mental status, and the elderly. Hypernatremia is associated with an increased risk of death but it is unclear if it is the cause. Signs and symptoms The major symptom is thirst.Department of Health & Human Services, State Government of Victoria, Australia Better Health Channel: Salt Last updated: May 2014 The most important signs result from brain cell shrinkage and include confusion, muscle twitching or spasms. With severe elevations, seizures and comas may occur. Severe symptoms are usually due to acute elevation of the plasma sodium concentration to above 157 mmol/L (normal blood levels are generally about 135–145 mmol/L for adults and elderly). Values above 180 mmol/L are associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in adults. However, such high levels of sodium rarely occur without severe coexisting medical conditions. Serum sodium concentrations have ranged from 150–228 mmol/L in survivors of acute salt overdosage, while levels of 153–255 mmol/L have been observed in fatalities. Vitreous humor is considered to be a better postmortem specimen than postmortem serum for assessing sodium involvement in a death. Cause Management of hypernatremia Common causes of hypernatremia include: =Low volume= In those with low volume or hypovolemia: * Inadequate intake of free water associated with total body sodium depletion. Typically in elderly or otherwise disabled patients who are unable to take in water as their thirst dictates and also are sodium depleted. This is the most common cause of hypernatremia. * Excessive losses of water from the urinary tract – which may be caused by glycosuria, or other osmotic diuretics (e.g., mannitol) – leads to a combination of sodium and free water losses. * Water losses associated with extreme sweating. * Severe watery diarrhea (osmotic diarrhea results in hypotonic (dilute) watery diarrhea resulting in significant loss of free water and a higher concentration of sodium in the blood; this type of water loss can also be seen with viral gastroenteritis). =Normal volume= In those with normal volume or euvolemia: * Excessive excretion of water from the kidneys caused by diabetes insipidus, which involves either inadequate production of the hormone vasopressin, from the pituitary gland or impaired responsiveness of the kidneys to vasopressin. =High volume= In those with high volume or hypervolemia: * Intake of a hypertonic fluid (a fluid with a higher concentration of solutes than the remainder of the body) with restricted free water intake. This is relatively uncommon, though it can occur after a vigorous resuscitation where a patient receives a large volume of a concentrated sodium bicarbonate solution. Ingesting seawater also causes hypernatremia because seawater is hypertonic and free water is not available. There are several recorded cases of forced ingestion of concentrated salt solution in exorcism rituals leading to death. * Mineralcorticoid excess due to a disease state such as Conn's syndrome usually does not lead to hypernatremia unless free water intake is restricted. *Salt poisoning is the most common cause in children. It has also been seen in a number of adults with mental health problems. Too much salt can also occur from drinking seawater or soy sauce. Diagnosis Hypernatremia is diagnosed when a basic metabolic panel blood test demonstrates a sodium concentration higher than 145 mmol/l. Treatment The cornerstone of treatment is administration of free water to correct the relative water deficit. Water can be replaced orally or intravenously. Water alone cannot be administered intravenously (because of osmolarity issues leading to rupturing of red blood cells in the bloodstream), but rather can be given intravenously in solution with dextrose (sugar) or saline (salt). However, overly rapid correction of hypernatremia is potentially very dangerous. The body (in particular the brain) adapts to the higher sodium concentration. Rapidly lowering the sodium concentration with free water, once this adaptation has occurred, causes water to flow into brain cells and causes them to swell. This can lead to cerebral edema, potentially resulting in seizures, permanent brain damage, or death. Therefore, significant hypernatremia should be treated carefully by a physician or other medical professional with experience in treatment of electrolyte imbalance. Specific treatments such as thiazide diuretics (e.g., chlorthalidone) in congestive heart failure or corticosteroids in nephropathy also can be used.

Colluvium is typically composed of a heterogeneous range of rock types and sediments ranging from silt to rock fragments of various sizes. This term is also used to specifically refer to sediment deposited at the base of a hillslope by unconcentrated surface runoff or sheet erosion.  Location  Colluviation refers to the buildup of colluvium at the base of a hillslope.Jackson, JA, J Mehl, and K. Neuendorf (2005) Glossary of Geology American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia. 800 pp. Goodie, AS (2003) Colluvium in A. S. Goodie, ed., pp. 173, Encyclopedia of Geomorphology Volume 1, A–I. Routledge, New York, New York. 1200 pp. Colluvium is typically loosely consolidated angular material located at the base of a steep hill slope or cliff. Colluvium accumulates as gently sloping aprons or fans, either at the base of or within gullies and hollows within hillslopes. These accumulations of colluvium can be several meters in thickness and often contain buried soils (paleosols), crude bedding, and cut and fill sequences. talus accumulation is an example of colluvium  Importance  Thick accumulations of colluvium may preserve a rich record of long term paleoclimatic change based on the paleosols and the remains of plants and animals, invertebrate and vertebrates that they often contain. These fossils indicate previous geologic and environmental settings. Thick accumulations of colluvium often contain well- preserved and sometimes deeply buried archaeological deposits as excavated at the Cherokee Sewer Site, Cherokee County, Iowa, and the Koster Site, Greene County, Illinois.Anderson, D, and HA Semken (1980) The Cherokee Excavations: Holocene Ecology and Human Adaptations in Northwestern Iowa. Academic Press, New York.Angel JR (1990) Koster site archaeology I: stratigraphy and landscape evolution. Research Series. vol. 8. Center for American Archeology, Kampsville, Illinois. Colluvium can also be rocks that have been transported downward from glaciers and so can indicate past stages of cooler and/or wetter weather. Deposits of detrital colluvium can reveal the soil composition and signify processes of chemical weathering.  Compared to alluvium  The definitions of colluvium and alluvium are interdependent and reliant on one another. Distinctions between the two are important in order to properly define the geomorphic processes that have occurred in a specific geological setting. Alluvium is sand, clay, or other similar detrital material deposited by running water. The distinction between colluvium and alluvium relates to the involvement of running water. Alluvium specifically refers to the geomorphic processes involved with flowing water and so alluvium is generally fine-grained clay and silt material that has the capacity to be entrained in water currents and eventually deposited. For these same reasons, alluvium is also generally well sorted material while colluvium is not.

Germany had started experimenting with this technology early in the Second World War and developed it into the Walter cycle. They had built some experimental boats. One of these, the U-boat , which had been scuttled at the end of the war, was salvaged and eventually recommissioned into the Royal Navy as . This eventually led to the construction of the two Explorer-class experimental vessels, which used steam turbines, the steam being generated using heat from the catalysed interaction of HTP and diesel oil. They used the Porpoise-class hull, modified with retractable superstructure fittings to help streamlining. Being purely experimental craft they had no torpedo tubes or radar fitted, only one periscope and were equipped with backup diesel engines to recharge the batteries and propel them on the surface.Miller & Jordan. Page 63. The first, Excalibur, was commissioned in March 1958. They were very fast boats, with a top underwater speed of around for period up to 3 hours and for 15 hours on one turbine. Because of the use of hydrogen peroxide as a hair bleach, the submarines were nicknamed the Blonde class. As well as providing experience with this type of technology, they also allowed the Royal Navy to practise against fast moving underwater targets. However the use of HTP was not successful, and there were several explosions, which resulted in the second nickname of Exploder being applied to the class and Explorer in particular, while Excalibur had the nickname \\"Excruciater\\".Preston. Page 161. The subsequent use of HTP to power torpedoes led to the loss of and the loss of the . When the United States developed a nuclear reactor which could be installed in a submarine, the HTP project was abandoned. It was decided that it was not worth converting the class into normal diesel submarines. As a result, Explorer was sold for £13,500 to Thos W Ward for breaking up; Excalibur in turn was also subsequently sold to Thos W Ward.. Retrieved 7-3-2009. Other countries have since developed the concept of the non-nuclear air-independent propulsion submarine to the point where it is a safe technology albeit as an auxiliary power source to a conventional diesel- electric drive, although hydrogen peroxide has long been abandoned and liquid oxygen is generally now preferred.

Downhill creep, also known as soil creep or commonly just creep, is the slow, downward progression of rock and soil down a low grade slope; it can also refer to slow deformation of such materials as a result of prolonged pressure and stress. Creep may appear to an observer to be continuous, but it really is the sum of numerous minute, discrete movements of slope material caused by the force of gravity. Friction, being the primary force to resist gravity, is produced when one body of material slides past another offering a mechanical resistance between the two which acts to hold objects (or slopes) in place. As slope on a hill increases, the gravitational force that is perpendicular to the slope decreases and results in less friction between the material that could cause the slope to slide. Overview A group of Victorian headstones, England. Soil creep has led to the headstones being tilted at an angle over time. Water is a very important factor when discussing soil deformation and movement. For instance, a sandcastle will only stand up when it is made with damp sand. The water offers cohesion to the sand which binds the sand particles together. However, pouring water over the sandcastle destroys it. This is because the presence of too much water fills the pores between the grains with water creating a slip plane between the particles and offering no cohesion causing them to slip and slide away. This holds true for hillsides and creep as well. The presence of water may help the hillside stay put and give it cohesion, but in a very wet environment or during or after a large amount of precipitation the pores between the grains can become saturated with water and cause the ground to slide along the slip plane it creates. Creep has caused the soil to spread over this pavement. Creep can also be caused by the expansion of materials such as clay when they are exposed to water. Clay expands when wet, then contracts after drying. The expansion portion pushes downhill, then the contraction results in consolidation at the new offset. Objects resting on top of the soil are carried by it as it descends down the slope. This can be seen in churchyards, where older headstones are often situated at an angle and several metres away from where they were originally erected. Vegetation plays a role with slope stability and creep. When a hillside contains many trees, ferns, and shrubs their roots create an interlocking network that can strengthen unconsolidated material. They also aid in absorbing the excess water in the soil to help keep the slope stable. However, they do add to the weight of the slope giving gravity that much more of a driving force to act on in pushing the slope downward. In general, though, slopes without vegetation have a greater chance of movement. Design engineers sometimes need to guard against downhill creep during their planning to prevent building foundations from being undermined. Pilings are planted sufficiently deep into the surface material to guard against this behavior. Modeling regolith diffusion For shallow to moderate slopes, diffusional sediment flux is modeled linearly as (Culling, 1960; McKean et al., 1993) q_s = k_d S \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where k_d\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the diffusion constant, and S\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is slope. For steep slopes, diffusional sediment flux is more appropriately modeled as a non-linear function of slope q_s = \\\\frac{k_d S}{1 - (S/S_c)^2}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where S_c\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the critical gradient for sliding of dry soil. On long timescales, diffusive creep in hillslope soils leads to a characteristic rounding of ridges in the landscape.Roering, Joshua J., James W. Kirchner, and William E. Dietrich. \\"Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology.\\" Water Resources Research 35.3 (1999): 853–70.Rosenbloom, N.

The exclusion of eligible voters from the file was a central part of the controversy surrounding the US presidential elections in 2000, which hinged on results in Florida. The 'Florida Central Voter File' was replaced by the Florida Voter Registration System on January 1, 2006, when a new federal law, the Help America Vote Act, came into effect. Private involvement At the time, Florida was the only state that paid a private company to purge the voter file of ineligible voters, in effect allowing a private company to make the administrative decision of who is not eligible to vote. The State of Florida's Division of Elections was required to contract with a private entity to purge its voter file by chapter 98.0975 of the Florida statutes, which had been enacted by the Florida legislature to address voter registration fraud found during the 1997 Miami mayoral election. Previously, voter purging had been conducted (sometimes controversially) by local elections officials. During the Civil Rights Movement, local election officials in southern states including Florida were the subjects of lawsuits, marches and civil disobedience as African- Americans attempted to register to vote. This led to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, banning discriminatory practices that kept African-Americans off the voter rolls. The first firm hired in 1998 to purge the voter rolls was Professional Service Inc., which charged $5,700 for the job. Later the same year, the state placed an open request for tenders to bid for the job. The contract was assigned to DBT Online, despite the fact that its bid had the highest price. The state gave the job to DBT for a first-year fee of US $2,317,800; total fees eventually reached US $4 million.Greg Palast, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, 2nd edition. p. 50 The Florida Department of Elections terminated Professional Service Inc.'s contract in 1999. DBT Online was acquired by ChoicePoint in early 2000 (itself acquired in 2008 by RELX′s LexisNexis Risk Solutions). Problems in the cleansing process At first, Florida specified only exact matches on names, birthdates and genders to identify voters as felons. However, state records reveal a memo dated March 1999 from Emmett \\"Bucky\\" Mitchell, a lawyer for the state elections office who was supervising the felon purge, asking DBT to loosen its criteria for acceptable matches. When DBT representatives warned Mitchell that this would yield a large proportion of false positives (mismatches), Mitchell's reply was that it would be up to each county elections supervisor to deal with the problem. In a February 2001 phone conversation with the BBC's London studios, ChoicePoint vice-president James Lee said that the state \\"wanted there to be more names than were actually verified as being a convicted felon\\". =James Lee's testimony= On 17 April 2001, James Lee testified before the McKinney panel that the state had given DBT the directive to add to the purge list people who matched at least 90% of a last name. DBT objected, knowing that this would produce a huge number of false positives (non-felons). His testimony indicates the state then ordered DBT to shift to an even lower threshold of 80% match and also include name reversals (thus a person named Thomas Clarence could be taken to be the same as Clarence Thomas). Besides this, middle initials were skipped, Jr. and Sr. suffixes dropped, and some nicknames and aliases were added to puff up the list. \\"DBT told state officials\\", testified Lee, \\"that the rules for creating the [purge] list would mean a significant number of people who were not deceased, not registered in more than one county, or not a felon, would be included on the list. DBT made suggestions to reduce the numbers of eligible voters included on the list\\". According to Lee, the state's response to the company′s suggestion was \\"Forget about it\\". \\"The people who worked on this (for DBT) are very adamant ... they told them what would happen\\", said Lee. \\"The state expected the county supervisors to be the fail-safe.\\" Lee said his company will never again get involved in cleansing voting rolls. \\"We are not confident any of the methods used today can guarantee legal voters will not be wrongfully denied the right to vote\\", Lee told a group of Atlanta-area black lawmakers in March 2001. =Errors in the list= Florida has re-edited its felon list five times since 1998 to correct errors. The first list DBT Online provided to the Division of Elections in April 2000 contained the names of 181,157 persons. Of these, approximately 65,776 were identified as felons. In May 2000, DBT discovered that approximately 8,000 names were erroneously placed on the exclusion list, mostly former Texas prisoners who never had been convicted of more than a misdemeanor. Later that month, DBT provided a revised list to the Division of Elections (DOE) containing a total of 173,127 persons. Of those included on the \\"corrected list\\", 57,746 were identified as felons. Examples: *Thomas Cooper, Date of Birth September 5, 1973; crime, unknown; conviction date, January 30, 2007 *Johnny Jackson Jr., Date of Birth, 1970; crime, none, mistaken for John Fitzgerald Jackson who was still in his jail cell in Texas *Wallace McDonald, Date of Birth, 1928; crime, fell asleep on a bus-stop bench in 1959 *Reverend Willie Dixon, convicted in the 1970s at the latest; note, received full executive clemency *Randall J. Higginbotham, Date of Birth, August 28, 1960; crimes, none, mistaken for Sean David Higginbotham, born June 16, 1971 *Reverend Willy D. Whiting Jr., crime, a speeding ticket from 1990, confused with Willy J. Whiting who have birthdays 2 days apart =Demographics of the purge list= According to the Palm Beach Post (among other issues), though blacks accounted for 88% of those removed from the rolls, they made up only about 11% of Florida's voters. Voter demographics authority David Bositis, a former senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, DC, reviewed The Nation's findings and concluded that the purge-and-block program was \\"a patently obvious technique to discriminate against black voters\\". He noted that, based on nationwide conviction rates, African-Americans would account for 46% of the felon group wrongly disfranchised. Pre-election cleansing Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris At the time of the election, a purge list contained a number of false positives--people identified as felons who were not actually felons. Skeptical of the list's accuracy, elections supervisors in 20 counties (including Palm Beach) ignored it altogether, thereby allowing thousands of felons to vote. Statewide, a total of 19,398 voters were removed from the rolls. More than 18,600 of these removals matched a felon by name, birthdate, race and gender. More than 6,500 were convicted in counties other than where they voted, suggesting they would not have been found by local officials without the DBT list. Details about the errors There were many specific problems with the purge list regarding the verification of felons, including over 4,000 blank conviction dates and over 325 conviction dates in the future. DBT had decided in March 1999 not to include felon lists from South Carolina or Texas, which automatically restore voting rights, but that was overruled by the head of the Florida Office of Executive Clemency, Janet Keels, who ordered inclusion of any felon who did not have a written order of clemency, even from these states, wrongly placing 996 voters on the felon list. Florida did not restore their voting rights until three months after the election. Additionally, a number of persons listed as felons had been convicted of misdemeanors only, and therefore were eligible by law. Greg Palast, who has investigated this issue and identified occurrences of these problems, provides a sample of 23 names as they appear on the Florida 2000 felons list, with five examples of these erroneous listings highlighted (this represents a minimum rate of inaccuracy of 22% in this sample). Thomas Cooper, the second one in the list, was listed as being convicted on January 30, 2007. =Analysis= Database experts consulted by Greg Palast (including DBT's vice-president) told him that, to obtain 85% accuracy or better, one needs at least the following three things: * Social Security numbers; * Address history; * A check against other databases. ChoicePoint, in contrast, used virtually no Social Security numbers, did not check address histories, and used no database cross-checking, although it had 1,200 databases that could be employed for the task. Because some of the source databases used did not list race, the matching criteria did not require a match with the voter's race for inclusion in the felon list. However, the decision was also made to enlarge upon this decision, and rule as ineligible the voter in question even if there was an explicit disagreement between the races listed on the source database and the voter list. According to the Palm Beach Post, more than 1,300 registered voters were matched with felons although their races or sexes were different. The Palm Beach Post reported that > [C]omputer analysis has found at least 1,100 eligible voters wrongly purged > from the rolls before last year's election. ... At least 108 law-abiding > people were purged from the voter rolls as suspected criminals, only to be > cleared after the election. DBT's computers had matched these people with > felons, though in dozens of cases they did not share the same name, > birthdate, gender or race. One Naples man was told he couldn't vote because > he was linked with a felon still serving time in a Moore Haven prison. > Florida officials cut from the rolls 996 people convicted of crimes in other > states, though they should have been allowed to vote. Before the election, > state officials said felons could vote only if they had written clemency > orders, although most other states automatically restore voting rights to > felons when they complete their sentences. ... Records used to create the > felon list were sometimes wrong. A state database of felons wrongly included > dozens of people whose crimes were reduced to misdemeanors. Furthermore, > clemency records were incomplete. Additionally, there are other accuracy problems with the list. For example, Linda Howell, Madison County supervisor of elections, who is not a convicted felon and was never on the felon list provided by the Division of Elections or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, erroneously received a form letter referencing a prior felony conviction from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement stating. Election law violations, allegations, lawsuits The problems with the list, the process by which it was manufactured and deployed, and other issues related to the 2000 election controversy in Florida, triggered much criticism and allegations of fraud, which resulted in investigations, litigation, and reform measures. Phyllis Hampton, general counsel of the Florida Election Commission, testified that her office could investigate the wrongful removal of a Floridian from the voter rolls if there was evidence of a willful violation. On February 17, 2001, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, in collaboration with Florida Legal Services and the Florida Justice Institute, launched the Equal Voting Rights Project. In June 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a report and statements arguing that Florida was, on numerous counts, in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, recommending: *On 1 count that \\"The U.S. Department of Justice should immediately initiate the litigation process against the governor, secretary of state, director of the Division of Elections, specific supervisors of elections, and other state and local officials responsible for the execution of election laws, practices, and procedures ...\\" *On 1 count that \\"The U.S. Department of Justice should initiate the litigation process against the governor ...\\" *On 1 count that \\"The U.S. Department of Justice should initiate the litigation process against the secretary of State ...\\" *On 12 counts that \\"The U.S. Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division in the Office of the Florida Attorney General should initiate the litigation process against state election officials ...\\" * ... And so on, totaling 20 recommendations involving the phrase \\"should initiate the litigation process\\" or \\"should immediately initiate the litigation process\\" :(See also THE 2000 VOTE AND ELECTION REFORM) In February 2002, the NAACP and four other groups filed suit against Harris (NAACP v. Harris), the county elections supervisor and a former state election chief. The lawsuit cites the state, several counties and the contractor over procedures for voter registration, voter lists and balloting. The suit charges that Black voters were disenfranchised during the 2000 presidential election, and argued that Florida was in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the US Constitution's 14th Amendment. The parties reached a settlement wherein ChoicePoint will reprocess the voter file on the plaintiffs' terms and donate $75,000 to the NAACP. In August 2002, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a briefing summary regarding the progress of voting rights in Florida.

Fetal position (British English: also foetal) is the positioning of the body of a prenatal fetus as it develops. In this position, the back is curved, the head is bowed, and the limbs are bent and drawn up to the torso. This position is used in the medical profession to minimize injury to the neck and chest. Sometimes, when a person has suffered extreme physical or psychological trauma (including massive stress), they will assume the fetal position or a similar position in which the back is curved forward, the legs are brought up as tightly against the abdomen as possible, the head is bowed as close to the abdomen as possible, and the arms are wrapped around the head to prevent further trauma. This position provides better protection to the brain and vital organs than simply lying spread out on the ground, so it is clear as to why it is an instinctual reaction to extreme stress or trauma when the brain is no longer able to cope with the surrounding environment, and in essence \\"shuts down\\" temporarily. The fetal position has been observed in drug addicts, who enter the position when experiencing withdrawal. Sufferers of anxiety are also known to assume the fetal position during panic attacks. Many people assume this position when sleeping, especially when the body becomes cold. A study by Professor Chris Idzikowski, director of the Sleep Assessment and Advisory Service found that people who consistently sleep in the fetal position tend to have a shy and sensitive personality. Assuming this position and playing dead is often recommended as a strategy to end a bear attack.\\"Bear Attacks Their Causes and Avoidance\\" by Stephen Herrero, pg 24 Many baby mammals, especially rodents, remain in the fetal position well after being born. The fetal position is also one of the most comfortable and familiar positions to the human, as they remain in the position for the last two trimesters of pregnancy. Babies are most often found stretched out, however, because they do not have full control of their limbs, resulting in flailing and twitching.

The spindle checkpoint occurs during the M phase. Scheme showing cell cycle progression between prometaphase and anaphase. The spindle checkpoint, also known as the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), or the mitotic checkpoint, is a cell cycle checkpoint during mitosis or meiosis that prevents the separation of the duplicated chromosomes (anaphase) until each chromosome is properly attached to the spindle. To achieve proper segregation, the two kinetochores on the sister chromatids must be attached to opposite spindle poles (bipolar orientation). Only this pattern of attachment will ensure that each daughter cell receives one copy of the chromosome. The defining biochemical feature of this checkpoint is the stimulation of the anaphase-promoting complex by M-phase cyclin-CDK complexes, which in turn causes the proteolytic destruction of cyclins and proteins that hold the sister chromatids together.  Overview and importance  The beginning of metaphase is characterized by the connection of the microtubules to the kinetochores of the chromosomes, as well as the alignment of the chromosomes in the middle of the cell. Each chromatid has its own kinetochore, and all of the microtubules that are bound to kinetochores of sister chromatids radiate from opposite poles of the cell. These microtubules exert a pulling force on the chromosomes towards the opposite ends of the cells, while the cohesion between the sister chromatids opposes this force. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, this cohesion between sister chromatids is dissolved, and the separated chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell by the spindle microtubules. The chromatids are further separated by the physical movement of the spindle poles themselves. Premature dissociation of the chromatids can lead to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy in the daughter cells. Thus, the job of the metaphase checkpoint is to prevent this transition into anaphase until the chromosomes are properly attached, before the sister chromatids separate. In order to preserve the cell's identity and proper function, it is necessary to maintain the appropriate number of chromosomes after each cell division. An error in generating daughter cells with fewer or greater number of chromosomes than expected (a situation termed aneuploidy), may lead in best case to cell death, or alternatively it may generate catastrophic phenotypic results. Examples include: * In cancer cells, aneuploidy is a frequent event, indicating that these cells present a defect in the machinery involved in chromosome segregation, as well as in the mechanism ensuring that segregation is correctly performed. * In humans, Down syndrome appears in children carrying in their cells one extra copy of chromosome 21, as a result of a defect in chromosome segregation during meiosis in one of the progenitors. This defect will generate a gamete (spermatozoide or oocyte) with an extra chromosome 21. After fertilisation, this gamete will generate an embryo with three copies of chromosome 21.  Discovery of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)  Microscopy image showing two cells with their chromosomes stained with DAPI, one at anaphase (left) and the other in metaphase (right), with most of its chromosomes in the metaphase plate and some chromosomes still not aligned. Zirkle (in 1970) was one of the first researchers to observe that, when just one chromosome is retarded to arrive at the metaphase plate, anaphase onset is postponed until some minutes after its arrival. This observation, together with similar ones, suggested that a control mechanism exists at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Using drugs such as nocodazole and colchicine, the mitotic spindle disassembles and the cell cycle is blocked at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Using these drugs (see the review from Rieder and Palazzo in 1992), the putative control mechanism was named Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). This regulatory mechanism has been intensively studied since. Using different types of genetic studies, it has been established that diverse kinds of defects are able to activate the SAC: spindle depolymerization, the presence of dicentric chromosomes (with two centromeres), centromeres segregating in an aberrant way, defects in the spindle pole bodies in S. cerevisiae, defects in the kinetochore proteins, mutations in the centromeric DNA or defects in the molecular motors active during mitosis. A summary of these observations can be found in the article from Hardwick and collaborators in 1999. Using its own observations, Zirkle was the first to propose that \\"some (…) substance, necessary for the cell to proceed to anaphase, appears some minutes after C (moment of the arrival of the last chromosome to the metaphase plate), or after a drastic change in the cytoplasmic condition, just at C or immediately after C\\", suggesting that this function is located on kinetochores unattached to the mitotic spindle. McIntosh extended this proposal, suggesting that one enzyme sensitive to tension located at the centromeres produces an inhibitor to the anaphase onset when the two sister kinetochores are not under bipolar tension. Indeed, the available data suggested that the signal \\"wait to enter in anaphase\\" is produced mostly on or close to unattached kinetochores. However, the primary event associated to the kinetochore attachment to the spindle, which is able to inactivate the inhibitory signal and release the metaphase arrest, could be either the acquisition of microtubules by the kinetochore (as proposed by Rieder and collaborators in 1995), or the tension stabilizing the anchoring of microtubules to the kinetochores (as suggested by the experiments realized at Nicklas' lab). Subsequent studies in cells containing two independent mitotic spindles in a sole cytoplasm showed that the inhibitor of the metaphase-to- anaphase transition is generated by unattached kinetochores and is not freely diffusible in the cytoplasm. Yet in the same study it was shown that, once the transition from metaphase to anaphase is initiated in one part of the cell, this information is extended all along the cytoplasm, and can overcome the signal \\"wait to enter in anaphase\\" associated to a second spindle containing unattached kinetochores.  Background on sister chromatid duplication, cohesion, and segregation  = Cell division: duplication of material and distribution to daughter cells = Three types of cell division: binary fission (taking place in prokaryotes), mitosis and meiosis (taking place in eukaryotes). When cells are ready to divide, because cell size is big enough or because they receive the appropriate stimulus, they activate the mechanism to enter into the cell cycle, and they duplicate most organelles during S (synthesis) phase, including their centrosome. Therefore, when the cell division process will end, each daughter cell will receive a complete set of organelles. At the same time, during S phase all cells must duplicate their DNA very precisely, a process termed DNA replication. Once DNA replication has finished, in eukaryotes the DNA molecule is compacted and condensed, to form the mitotic chromosomes, each one constituted by two sister chromatids, which stay held together by the establishment of cohesion between them; each chromatid is a complete DNA molecule, attached via microtubules to one of the two centrosomes of the dividing cell, located at opposed poles of the cell. The structure formed by the centrosomes and the microtubules is named mitotic spindle, due to its characteristic shape, holding the chromosomes between the two centrosomes. Both sister chromatids stay together until anaphase; at this moment they separate from each other and they travel towards the centrosome to which they are attached. In this way, when the two daughter cells separate at the end of the division process, each one will receive a complete set of chromatids. The mechanism responsible for the correct distribution of sister chromatids during cell division is named chromosome segregation. To ensure that chromosome segregation takes place correctly, cells have developed a precise and complex mechanism. In the first place, cells must coordinate centrosome duplication with DNA replication, and a failure in this coordination will generate monopolar or multipolar mitotic spindles, which generally will produce abnormal chromosome segregation, because in this case, chromosome distribution will not take place in a balanced way. = Mitosis: anchoring of chromosomes to the spindle and chromosome segregation = Image of a human cell during mitosis; microtubules are shown in green (forming the mitotic spindle), chromosomes are in blue in the spindle equator and kinetochores in red. During S phase, the centrosome starts to duplicate. Just at the beginning of mitosis, both centrioles achieve their maximal length, recruit additional material and their capacity to nucleate microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to generate the mitotic spindle. In this way, the mitotic spindle has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules (MTs) are long proteic filaments, with asymmetric extremities: one end termed \\"minus\\" (-) end, relatively stable and close to the centrosome, and an end termed \\"plus\\" (+) end, with alternating phases of growth and retraction, exploring the center of the cell searching the chromosomes. Each chromatid has a special region, named the centromere, on top of which is assembled a proteic structure termed kinetochore, which is able to stabilize the microtubule plus end. Therefore, if by chance a microtubule exploring the center of the cell encounters a kinetochore, it may happen that the kinetochore will capture it, so that the chromosome will become attached to the spindle via the kinetochore of one of its sister chromatids. The chromosome plays an active role in the attachment of kinetochores to the spindle. Bound to the chromatin is a Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that stimulates cytosolic Ran near the chromosome to bind GTP in place of GDP. The activated GTP-bound form of Ran releases microtubule-stabilizing proteins, such as TPX2, from protein complexes in the cytosol, which induces nucleation and polymerization of microtubules around the chromosomes. These kinetochore-derived microtubules, along with kinesin motor proteins in the outer kinetochore, facilitate interactions with the lateral surface of a spindle pole-derived microtubule. These lateral attachments are unstable, however, and must be converted to an end-on attachment. Conversion from lateral to end-on attachments allows the growth and shrinkage of the microtubule plus-ends to be converted into forces that push and pull chromosomes to achieve proper bi-orientation. As it happens that sister chromatids are attached together and both kinetochores are located back-to- back on both chromatids, when one kinetochore becomes attached to one centrosome, the sister kinetochore becomes exposed to the centrosome located in the opposed pole; for this reason, in most cases the second kinetochore becomes associated to the centrosome in the opposed pole, via its microtubules, so that the chromosomes become \\"bi-oriented\\", a fundamental configuration (also named amphitelic) to ensure that chromosome segregation will take place correctly when the cell will divide. Occasionally, one of the two sister kinetochores may attach simultaneously to MTs generated by both poles, a configuration named merotelic, which is not detected by the spindle checkpoint but that may generate lagging chromosomes during anaphase and, consequently, aneuploidy. Merotelic orientation (characterized by the absence of tension between sister kinetochores) is frequent at the beginning of mitosis, but the protein Aurora B (a kinase conserved from yeast to vertebrates) detects and eliminates this type of anchoring. (Note: Aurora B is frequently overexpressed in various types of tumors and currently is a target for the development of anticancer drugs.)  Sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis  = Cohesin: SMC proteins = As it has been previously noted, sister chromatids stay associated from S phase (when DNA is replicated to generate two identical copies, the two chromatids) until anaphase. At this point, the two sister chromatids separate and travel to opposite poles in the dividing cell. Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and in egg's extracts in Xenopus laevis identified a polyprotein complex as an essential player in sister chromatids cohesion (see the review from Hirano in 2000). This complex is known as the cohesin complex and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of at least four subunits: Smc1p, Smc3p, Scc1p (or Mcd1p) and Scc3p. Both Smc1p and Smc3p belong to the family of proteins for the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC), which constitute a group of chromosomic ATPases highly conserved, and form an heterodimer (Smc1p/Smc3p). Scc1p is the homolog in S.cerevisiae of Rad21, first identified as a protein involved in DNA repair in S. pombe. These four proteins are essential in yeast, and a mutation in any of them will produce premature sister chromatid separation. In yeast, cohesin binds to preferential sites along chromosome arms, and is very abundant close to the centromeres, as it was shown in a study using chromatin immunoprecipitation. = The role of heterochromatin = Classical cytologic observations suggested that sister chromatids are more strongly attached at heterochromatic regions, and this suggested that the special structure or composition of heterochromatin might favour cohesin recruitment. In fact, it has been shown that Swi6 (the homolog of HP-1 in S. pombe) binds to methylated Lys 9 of histone H3 and promotes the binding of cohesin to the centromeric repeats in S. pombe. More recent studies indicate that the RNAi machinery regulates heterochromatin establishment, which in turn recruits cohesin to this region, both in S. pombe and in vertebrate cells. However, there must be other mechanisms than heterochromatin to ensure an augmented cohesion at centromeres, because S. cerevisiae lacks heterochromatin next to centromeres, but the presence of a functional centromere induces an increase of cohesin association in a contiguous region, spanning 20-50kb. In this direction, Orc2 (one protein included in the origin recognition complex, ORC, implicated in the initiation of DNA replication during S phase) is also located on kinetochores during mitosis in human cells; in agreement with this localization, some observations indicate that Orc2 in yeast is implicated in sister chromatid cohesion, and its removal induces SAC activation. It has also been observed that other components of the ORC complex (such as orc5 in S. pombe) are implicated in cohesion. However, the molecular pathway involving the ORC proteins seems to be additive to the cohesins' pathway, and it is mostly unknown. = Function of cohesion and its dissolution = Scheme showing sister chromatids cohesion, anchored to spindle microtubules via their kinetochores Centromeric cohesion resists the forces exerted by spindle microtubules towards the poles, which generate tension between sister kinetochores. In turn, this tension stabilizes the attachment microtubule- kinetochore, through a mechanism implicating the protein Aurora B (a review about this issue : Hauf and Watanabe 2004). Indeed, a decrease in the cellular levels of cohesin generates the premature separation of sister chromatids, as well as defects in chromosome congression at the metaphase plate and delocalization of the proteins in the chromosomal passenger complex, which contains the protein Aurora B. The proposed structure for the cohesin complex suggests that this complex connects directly both sister chromatids. In this proposed structure, the SMC components of cohesin play a structural role, so that the SMC heterodimer may function as a DNA binding protein, whose conformation is regulated by ATP. Scc1p and Scc3p, however, would play a regulatory role. In S. cerevisiae, Pds1p (also known as securin) regulates sister chromatids cohesion, because it binds and inhibits the protease Esp1p (separin or separase). When anaphase onset is triggered, the anaphase- promoting complex (APC/C or Cyclosome) degrades securin. APC/C is a ring E3 ubiquitin ligase that recruits an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme loaded with ubiquitin. Securin is recognized only if Cdc20, the activator subunit, is bound to the APC/C core. When securin, Cdc20, and E2 are all bound to APC/C E2 ubiquitinates securin and selectively degrades it. Securin degradation releases the protease Esp1p/separase, which degrades the cohesin rings that link the two sister chromatids, therefore promoting sister chromatids separation. It has been also shown that Polo/Cdc5 kinase phosphorylates serine residues next to the cutting site for Scc1, and this phosphorylation would facilitate the cutting activity. Although this machinery is conserved through evolution, in vertebrates most cohesin molecules are released in prophase, independently of the presence of the APC/C, in a process dependent on Polo- like 1 (PLK1) and Aurora B. Yet it has been shown that a small quantity of Scc1 remains associated to centromeres in human cells until metaphase, and a similar amount is cut in anaphase, when it disappears from centromeres. On the other hand, some experiments show that sister chromatids cohesion in the arms is lost gradually after sister centromeres have separated, and sister chromatids move toward the opposite poles of the cell. According to some observations, a fraction of cohesins in the chromosomal arms and the centromeric cohesins are protected by the protein Shugoshin (Sgo1), avoiding their release during prophase. To be able to function as protector for the centromeric cohesion, Sgo1 must be inactivated at the beginning of anaphase, as well as Pds1p. In fact, both Pds1p and Sgo1 are substrates of APC/C in vertebrates.  Spindle assembly checkpoint overview  The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is an active signal produced by improperly attached kinetochores, which is conserved in all eukaryotes. The SAC stops the cell cycle by negatively regulating CDC20, thereby preventing the activation of the polyubiquitylation activities of anaphase promoting complex (APC). The proteins responsible for the SAC signal compose the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which includes SAC proteins, MAD2/MAD3 (mitotic arrest deficient), BUB3 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazole), and CDC20. Other proteins involved in the SAC include MAD1, BUB1, MPS1, and Aurora B. For higher eukaryotes, additional regulators of the SAC include constituents of the ROD-ZW10 complex, p31comet, MAPK, CDK1-cyclin-B, NEK2, and PLK1. Scheme representing the different components of the spindle checkpoint in vertebrates. = Checkpoint activation = The SAC monitors the interaction between improperly connected kinetochores and spindle microtubules, and is maintained until kinetochores are properly attached to the spindle. During prometaphase, CDC20 and the SAC proteins concentrate at the kinetochores before attachment to the spindle assembly. These proteins keep the SAC activated until they are removed and the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment is made. Even a single unattached kinetochore can maintain the spindle checkpoint. After attachment of microtubule plus-ends and formation of kinetochore microtubules, MAD1 and MAD2 are depleted from the kinetochore assembly. Another regulator of checkpoint activation is kinetochore tension. When sister kinetochores are properly attached to opposite spindle poles, forces in the mitotic spindle generate tension at the kinetochores. Bi-oriented sister kinetochores stabilize the kinetochore-microtubule assembly whereas weak tension has a destabilizing effect. In response to incorrect kinetochore attachments such as syntelic attachment, where both kinetochores becomes attached to one spindle pole, the weak tension generated destabilizes the incorrect attachment and allows the kinetochore to reattach correctly to the spindle body. During this process, kinetochores that are attached to the mitotic spindle but that are not under tension trigger the spindle checkpoint. Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase of the chromosomal passenger complex functions as the tensions sensor in improper kinetochore attachments. It detects and destabilizes incorrect attachments through control of the microtubule-severing KINI kinesin MCAK, the DASH complex, and the Ndc80/Hec1 complex at the microtubule-kinetochore interface. The Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase is also critical in correcting merotelic attachments, where one kinetochore is simultaneously attached to both spindle poles. Merotelic attachments generate sufficient tension and are not detected by the SAC, and without correction, may result in chromosome mis-segregation due to slow chromatid migration speed. While microtubule attachment is independently required for SAC activation, it is unclear whether tension is an independent regulator of SAC, although it is clear that differing regulatory behaviors arise with tension. Once activated, the spindle checkpoint blocks anaphase entry by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex via regulation of the activity of mitotic checkpoint complex. The mechanism of inhibition of APC by the mitotic checkpoint complex is poorly understood, although it is hypothesized that the MCC binds to APC as a pseudosubstrate using the KEN-box motif in BUBR1. At the same time that mitotic checkpoint complex is being activated, the centromere protein CENP-E activates BUBR1, which also blocks anaphase. = Mitotic checkpoint complex formation = The mitotic checkpoint complex is composed of BUB3 together with MAD2 and MAD3 bound to Cdc20. MAD2 and MAD3 have distinct binding sites on CDC20, and act synergistically to inhibit APC/C. The MAD3 complex is composed of BUB3, which binds to Mad3 and BUB1B through the short linear motif known as the GLEBS motif. The exact order of attachments which must take place in order to form the MCC remains unknown. It is possible that Mad2-Cdc20 form a complex at the same time as BUBR1-BUB3-Cdc20 form another complex, and these two subcomplexes are consequently combined to form the mitotic checkpoint complex. In human cells, binding of BUBR1 to CDC20 requires prior binding of MAD2 to CDC20, so it is possible that the MAD2-CDC20 subcomplex acts as an initiator for MCC formation. BUBR1 depletion leads only to a mild reduction in Mad2-Cdc20 levels while Mad2 is required for the binding of BubR1-Bub3 to Cdc20. Nevertheless, BUBR1 is still required for checkpoint activation. The mechanism of formation for the MCC is unclear and there are competing theories for both kinetochore- dependent and kinetochore-independent formation. In support of the kinetochore-independent theory, MCC is detectable in S. cerevisiae cells in which core kinetocore assembly proteins have been mutated and cells in which the SAC has been deactivated, which suggests that the MCC could be assembled during mitosis without kinetochore localization. In one model, unattached prometaphase kinetochores can 'sensitize' APC to inhibition of MCC by recruiting the APC to kinetochores via a functioning SAC. Furthermore, depletions of various SAC proteins have revealed that MAD2 and BUBR1 depletions affect the timing of mitosis independently of kinetochores, while depletions of other SAC proteins result in a dysfunctional SAC without altering the duration of mitosis. Thus it is possible that the SAC functions through a two-stage timer where MAD2 and BUBR1 control the duration of mitosis in the first stage, which may be extended in the second stage if there are unattached kinetochores as well as other SAC proteins. However, there are lines of evidence which are in disfavor of the kinetochore-independent assembly. MCC has yet to be found during interphase, while MCC does not form from its constituents in X. laevis meiosis II extracts without the addition of sperm of nuclei and nocodazole to prevent spindle assembly. The leading model of MCC formation is the \\"MAD2-template model\\", which depends on the kinetochore dynamics of MAD2 to create the MCC. MAD1 localizes to unattached kinetochores while binding strongly to MAD2. The localization of MAD2 and BubR1 to the kinetochore may also be dependent on the Aurora B kinase. Cells lacking Aurora B fail to arrest in metaphase even when chromosomes lack microtubule attachment. Unattached kinetochores first bind to a MAD1-C-MAD2-p31comet complex and releases the p31comet through unknown mechanisms. The resulting MAD-C-MAD2 complex recruits the open conformer of Mad2 (O-Mad2) to the kinetochores. This O-Mad2 changes its conformation to closed Mad2 (C-Mad2) and binds Mad1. This Mad1/C-Mad2 complex is responsible for the recruitment of more O-Mad2 to the kinetochores, which changes its conformation to C-Mad2 and binds Cdc20 in an auto-amplification reaction. Since MAD1 and CDC20 both contain a similar MAD2-binding motif, the empty O-MAD2 conformation changes to C-MAD2 while binding to CDC20. This positive feedback loop is negatively regulated by p31comet, which competitively binds to C-MAD2 bound to either MAD1 or CDC20 and reduces further O-MAD2 binding to C-MAD2. Further control mechanisms may also exist, considering that p31comet is not present in lower eukaryotes. The 'template model' nomenclature is thus derived from the process where MAD1-C-MAD2 acts as a template for the formation of C-MAD2-CDC20 copies. This sequestration of Cdc20 is essential for maintaining the spindle checkpoint. = Checkpoint deactivation = Several mechanisms exist to deactivate the SAC after correct bi-orientation of sister chromatids. Upon microtubule-kinetochore attachment, a mechanism of stripping via a dynein-dynein motor complex transports spindle checkpoint proteins away from the kinetochores. The stripped proteins, which include MAD1, MAD2, MPS1, and CENP-F, are then redistributed to the spindle poles. The stripping process is highly dependent on undamaged microtubule structure as well as dynein motility along microtubules. As well as functioning as a regulator of the C-MAD2 positive feedback loop, p31comet also may act as a deactivator of the SAC. Unattached kinetochores temporarily inactivate p31comet, but attachment reactivates the protein and inhibits MAD2 activation, possibly by inhibitory phosphorylation. Another possible mechanism of SAC inactivation results from energy-dependent dissociation of the MAD2-CDC20 complex through non- degradative ubiquitylation of CDC20. Conversely, the de-ubiquitylating enzyme protectin is required to maintain the SAC. Thus, unattached kinetochores maintain the checkpoint by continuously recreating the MAD2-CDC20 subcomplex from its components. The SAC may also be deactivated by APC activation induced proteolysis. Since the SAC is not reactivated by the loss of sister-chromatid cohesion during anaphase, the proteolysis of cyclin B and inactivation of the CDK1-cyclin-B kinase also inhibits SAC activity. Degradation of MPS1 during anaphase prevents the reactivation of SAC after removal of sister-chromatid cohesion. After checkpoint deactivation and during the normal anaphase of the cell cycle, the anaphase promoting complex is activated through decreasing MCC activity. When this happens the enzyme complex polyubiquitinates the anaphase inhibitor securin. The ubiquitination and destruction of securin at the end of metaphase releases the active protease called separase. Separase cleaves the cohesion molecules that hold the sister chromatids together to activate anaphase.  New model for SAC deactivation in S. cerevisiae: the mechanical switch  A new mechanism has been suggested to explain how end-on microtubule attachment at the kinetochore is able to disrupt specific steps in SAC signaling. In an unattached kinetochore, the first step in the formation of the MCC is phosphorylation of Spc105 by the kinase Mps1. Phosphorylated Spc105 is then able to recruit the downstream signaling proteins Bub1 and 3; Mad 1,2, and 3; and Cdc20. Association with Mad1 at unattached kinetochores causes Mad2 to undergo a conformational change that converts it from an open form (O-Mad2) to a closed form (C-Mad2.) The C-Mad2 bound to Mad1 then dimerizes with a second O-Mad2 and catalyzes its closure around Cdc20. This C-Mad2 and Cdc20 complex, the MCC, leaves Mad1 and C-Mad2 at the kinetochore to form another MCC. The MCCs each sequester two Cdc20 molecules to prevent their interaction with the APC/C, thereby maintaining the SAC. Mps1's phosphorylation of Spc105 is both necessary and sufficient to initiate the SAC signaling pathway, but this step can only occur in the absence of microtubule attachment to the kinetochore. Endogenous Mps1 is shown to associate with the calponin-homology (CH) domain of Ndc80, which is located in the outer kinetochore region that is distant from the chromosome. Though Mps1 is docked in the outer kinetochore, it is still able to localize within the inner kinetochore and phosphorylate Spc105 because of flexible hinge regions on Ndc80. However, the mechanical switch model proposes that end-on attachment of a microtubule to the kinetochore deactivates the SAC through two mechanisms. The presence of an attached microtubule increases the distance between the Ndc80 CH domain and Spc105. Additionally, Dam1/DASH, a large complex consisting of 160 proteins that forms a ring around the attached microtubule, acts as a barrier between the two proteins. Separation prevents interactions between Mps1 and Spc105 and thus inhibits the SAC signaling pathway. It is important to note that this model is not applicable to SAC regulation in higher order organisms, including animals. A main facet of the mechanical switch mechanism is that in S. cerevisiae the structure of the kinetochore only allows for attachment of one microtubule. Kinetochores in animals, on the other hand, are much more complex meshworks that contain binding sites for a multitude of microtubules. Microtubule attachment at all of the kinetochore binding sites is not necessary for deactivation of the SAC and progression to anaphase. Therefore, microtubule-attached and microtubule-unattached states coexist in the animal kinetochore while the SAC is inhibited. This model does not include a barrier that would prevent Mps1 associated with an attached kinetochore from phosphorylating Spc105 in an adjacent unattached kinetochore. Furthermore, the yeast Dam1/DASH complex is not present in animal cells.  Spindle checkpoint defects and cancer  When the spindle checkpoint misfunctions, this can lead to chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and even tumorigenesis. Transformation occurs and is accelerated when maintenance of genomic integrity breaks down especially at the gross level of whole chromosomes or large portions of them. In fact, aneuploidy is the most common characteristic of human solid tumors and thus the spindle assembly checkpoint might be regarded as a possible target for anti-tumour therapy. This is a much underappreciated fact since mutations in specific genes known as oncogenes or tumor suppressor are primarily thought to be behind genetic instability and tumorigenesis. Usually the various checkpoints in the cell cycle take care of genomic integrity via highly conserved redundant mechanisms that are important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. Several spindle assembly checkpoint proteins act both as positive and negative regulators to ensure the proper chromosome segregation in each cell cycle preventing chromosome instability (CIN) also known as genome instability. Cytometric analysis of malignant carcinoma displaying aneuploidyGenomic integrity is now appreciated at several levels where some tumors display instability manifested as base substitutions, insertions, and deletions, while the majority displays gains or losses of whole chromosomes. Due to the fact that alterations in mitotic regulatory proteins can lead to aneuploidy and this is a frequent event in cancer, it was initially thought that these genes could be mutated in cancerous tissues. = Mutated genes in cancers = In some cancers the genes that underlie the defects resulting in transformation are well characterized. In the hematological cancers such as multiple myeloma cytogenetic abnormalities are very common due to the inherent nature of DNA breaks needed for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. However, defects in proteins such as MAD2 that function predominantly at the SAC also are characterized in multiple myeloma. Most solid tumors are also predominantly aneuploid. For colorectal cancer, BUB1 and BUBR1 and amplification of STK15 are key regulators that have been implicated in the genomic instability resulting in cancer. In breast cancer, the genetic form characterized by the BRCA-1 gene exhibits greater levels of genomic instability than sporadic forms. Experiments showed that BRCA-1 null mice have decreased expression of the key spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 . For other cancers, more work is warranted to identify the causes of aneuploidy. = Other genes not traditionally associated with the SAC in cancer = Clearly variations in the physiological levels of these proteins (such as Mad2 or BubR1) are associated with aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, and this has been demonstrated using animal models. However, recent studies indicate that what seems to happen is a more complicated scenario: aneuploidy would drive a high incidence of tumorigenesis only when alterations in the levels of specific mitotic checkpoint components (either reduction or overexpression) in tissues is also inducing other defects able to predispose them to tumors. That is, defects such as an increase in DNA damage, chromosomal rearrangements, and/or a decreased incidence of cell death. For some mitotic checkpoint components, it is known that they are implicated in functions outside mitosis: nuclear import (Mad1), transcriptional repression (Bub3), and cell death, DNA damage response, aging, and megakaryopoiesis for BubR1. All this supports the conclusion that increase in tumorigenesis is associated with defects other than aneuploidy alone. Cancer-associated mutations affecting known checkpoint genes like BUB1 or BUBR1 are actually rare. However, several proteins implicated in cancer have intersections to spindle assembly networks. Key tumor suppressors such as p53 also play a role in the spindle checkpoint. Absence of p53, the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer, has a major effect on cell cycle checkpoint regulators and has been shown to act at the G1 checkpoint in the past, but now appears to be important in regulating the spindle checkpoint as well. Another key aspect of cancer is inhibition of cell death or apoptosis. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, is localized in pools at microtubules of the mitotic spindle near the centrosomes and at the kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes. Not only does survivin inhibit apoptosis to promote tumorigenesis, but it has been implicated (through experimental knockout mice) as an important regulator of chromosome segregation, and late stage mitosis similar to its role in more primitive organisms. Other aspects of the spindle assembly checkpoint such as kinetochore attachment, microtubule function, and sister chromatid cohesion are likely to be defective as well to cause aneuploidy. Cancer cells have been observed to divide in multiple directions by evading the spindle assembly checkpoint resulting in multipolar mitoses. The multipolar metaphase-anaphase transition occurs through an incomplete separase cycle that results in frequent nondisjunction events which amplify aneuploidy in cancer cells. = SAC cancer therapies = The chemical structure of paclitaxel or TAXOL, a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy Advances in this field have led to the introduction of development of some therapies targeted at spindle assembly defects. Older treatments such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes target microtubules that accompany mitotic spindle formation via disruption of microtubule dynamics which engage the SAC arresting the cell and eventually leading to its death. taxol and Docetaxel both are still used in the treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other types of epithelial cancer. However, these treatments are often characterized by high rates of side effects and drug resistance. Other targets within the network of regulators that influence the SAC are also being pursued; strong interest has shifted towards the aurora kinase proteins. The kinase gene Aurora A when amplified acts as an oncogene overriding the SAC leading to abnormal initiation of anaphase and subsequent aneuploidy and also resistance to TAXOL . Excitingly, a small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A has shown antitumor effects in an in vivo model suggesting that this might be a good target for further clinical development. Aurora B inhibitors, which are also in clinical development lead to abnormal kinetochore to microtubule attachment and abrogate the mitotic checkpoint as well. Survivin is also an attractive molecular target for clinical therapeutic development as it acts as a major node in a multitude of pathways, one of which is spindle formation and checkpoint control. Even further approaches have included a look at inhibition of mitotic motor proteins like KSP. These inhibitors, which have recently entered clinical trials, cause mitotic arrest and by engaging the spindle assembly checkpoint and induce apoptosis.

Its population of 6,093 makes it the ninth largest town in Kildare and 76th largest in Ireland. The town is located 35 km (22 mi) west of Dublin, and is on the Royal Canal. Local industries include a large Musgrave Group distribution centre, which supplies SuperValu and Centra stores across much of the country. History Kilcock takes its name from the 6th century Saint Coca who founded a church beside the Rye River, a major tributary of the River Liffey. The saint is traditionally said to have been a sister of St. Kevin of Glendalough; by occupation, she was an embroiderer of church vestments, including those for St. Colmcille. A holy well dedicated to Coca, formerly thought to be lost in the back-yards of Kilcock, is believed locally to be in the area behind the Ulster Bank, and her feast is remembered on 6 June. However, this commemoration is a modern revival as when the Ordnance Survey of the area was being made in 1837 it was recorded that \\"there is no old church in ruins in this parish nor is any patron saint or day remembered... the meaning of the name Cille Choc is not remembered.\\" When the present parish church was dedicated in 1867 it was named for St. Coca, and it had cost £10,000 to build to the design of architect J.J. McCarthy. In the 8th century, there was a battle between rival kings near the church of St. Coca, then in the territory of Carbury and close to the border between Leinster and Meath. There is a gap of several hundred years until the next reference to Kilcock when, in 1303, it belonged to the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem at Kilmainham. In the 17th century, markets and fairs were held regularly in Kilcock. The tolls and duties of Kilcock Fairs were shared between the Wogans of Rathcoffey and the Eustaces of Castlemartin, Kilcullen, County Kildare. Kilcock had 70 acres (28 ha) of common land to which several inhabitants had a common right. There was also a Commons at Courtown (Bawnogue & Duncreevan) and Laragh Commons. The markets in Kilcock were probably the largest in North Kildare. A measure of oats in those times was referred to as a \\"Kilcock Measure.\\"  Transport  The M4 motorway opened in 1994 and bypasses Kilcock to the south of the town. The motorway connects Dublin to the west of the country. There is an NRA plan to create an outer orbital motorway, which would extend 80 km from Naas to Drogheda, via Kilcock. Bus Éireann has route 115 and 115A (Summerhill) running from Dublin to Mullingar passing through Kilcock. The railway arrived in Kilcock on 28 June 1847, but the station closed on 1 July 1848, as it was sited on a 1% (1 in 100) gradient which the locomotives of the day found difficult to start off from. This site was slightly east of the current Kilcock station. A replacement station opened in 1850 west of the town, where the old N4 crosses the Royal Canal and railway, but closed in 1963. The current Kilcock railway station, under Shaw Bridge, opened in 1998. , there is construction underway by the county council to pave a pedestrian path along the riverbank giving cyclists and avid walkers a safer route to traverse into surrounding areas such as Maynooth without having to venture onto the main road. Education Kilcock at present has three primary schools: Scoil Chóca Naofa, St. Joseph's BNS (which since September 2016 changed from single-sex schools to mixed schools and both schools are linked with each other), and Gaelscoil Uí Riada (an all-Irish school). The latter is located beside the Bánóg on the outskirts of the village. Kilcock is also home to the secondary school Scoil Dara. Located on Church Street, it accommodates over 900 students from Kilcock and surrounding areas including Donadea, Summerhill, Enfield, Moynalvey and Mulhussey. Places of interest The town's library features mementos of the poet Teresa Brayton who was born in Kilbrook. The Old Bog Road, 4.5 km west of the town, was the subject of her most successful verse. It was set to music by Madeline King O'Farrelly and recorded by Eileen Donaghy, Josef Locke, Johnny McEvoy, Hank Locklin, Finbar Furey, Anthony Kearns, Daniel O'Donnell, Finbar Wright and many other artists up to the present day. There is also the old manor where Lady Catherine McCormack was born in the 1800s. Also found locally in Calgath, Co Meath is \\"Bridestream\\" (an 18th-century house which is the headquarters to a local business), and \\"Larchill, an 18th-century Ferme Ornée (Ornamental Farm) which is the only surviving complete garden of its type in Europe\\". Larchill was restored from the mid-1990s, and scenic walks through beech avenues link several classical and gothic follies. There is also a lake with two island follies, a formal walled garden with shell-lined tower and a model gothic farmyard. Kilcock Art Gallery was established in 1978 by Breda Smyth and opened by George Campbell, RHA. Kilcock has a greenway cycle/walkway which runs from Maynooth through Kilcock for 38 km towards the Westmeath border. Community Kilcock Musical & Dramatic Society (KMDS) is an amateur musical society affiliated to the Association of Irish Musical Societies (AIMS), in existence since 1970. The society has produced a number of productions, both musical and non-musical since 1983. They include an award-winning version of Sweeney Todd and pantomime productions of Treasure Island, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty and others. Plays performed include Juno and the Paycock, The Memory of Water, The Plough and the Stars, Dancing at Lughnasa, and The Beauty Queen of Leenane. The society presented the musical Oklahoma! in 2012. Sport =GAA= Kilcock GAA Club is situated in the townland of Branganstown and was founded on May 1, 1887. A clubhouse was opened in 2002, consisting of a bar, sports hall and changing rooms. The town has won the Kildare Senior Football Championship five times. The club has had notable players such as Larry McCormack, Davy Dalton Jr., Davy Dalton Sr., Fred Gibbons, and Paddy Gibbons. The club caters to over 60 teams. =Canoeing and canoe polo= Kilcock's proximity to the Royal Canal makes it a prominent spot for canoeing. Kilcock Canoe Polo Club (KCPC) was founded in 1998, and occupies a site in the harbour at Kilcock on the Royal Canal with regular training sessions for boys and girls for canoe polo. The European Canoe Polo Championship was held there in 2003 and the Irish Open in 2013. =Basketball= Kilcock Tigers Basketball Club was established in 2000 and is based in Scoil Dara. The club has under 11 and under 18 teams for boys and girls. Annual summer camps are run for primary school children. Kilcock Tigers is based in the Dublin Leagues and is a member of the Dublin Ladies Basketball Board and the Dublin Men's Basketball Board. =Athletics= St. Coca's Athletic Club in Kilcock was established in the 70s and caters to athletes in the north of Kildare and the west of Meath. A number of club members have competed nationally and internationally. Training takes place at a running track in the Bawnogue. =Rugby, hockey and cricket= North Kildare RFC, which is a part of North Kildare Club, is located in the Maws, Kilcock, and was founded in 1928. Business Kilcock Business Association has in excess of 50 members. A committee works on behalf of the businesses in the area to promote Kilcock as the place to shop locally and encourage people to employ local tradespeople. The town has a Lidl store which opened in February 2013, and also a SuperValu store which opened in June 2016.

Like Spar and Londis, SuperValu is operated as a symbol group; each store is independently owned, with store owners using the SuperValu format and selling the chain’s own brand products. However, SuperValu outlets tend to be larger than the convenience shop formats used by Spar and Londis, and the larger SuperValu stores are on a par with full-service supermarkets. Their main competitors are Dunnes Stores and Tesco Ireland. History SuperValu Omagh The supermarket was founded on out of the larger outlets in Musgrave's VG chain (originally formed in 1960). The smaller VG stores became Centra. From a base of sixteen stores (mainly in Munster), SuperValu had 182 stores in the Republic of Ireland and 36 stores in Northern Ireland as of 2004. Along the way, Musgrave has pursued a policy of buying stores itself and then re-leasing them to franchisees, acquiring some of the insolvent H Williams stores in 1987, L&N; in 1995, and Wellworths (in Northern Ireland) in 1996. Wellworths- SuperValu was a trading name used briefly by Musgrave in Northern Ireland following its acquisition of small-to-medium Wellworths outlets in 1996. This was to distinguish from larger Wellworths stores which were acquired by Safeway Stores (Ireland), a joint venture between Fitzwilton and Safeway (UK). In due course, the Wellworths name was entirely dropped. SuperValu previously operated supermarkets in larger Roches Stores locations under the name \\"SuperValu at Roches Stores\\" for many years. Superquinn was bought by the Musgrave Group, parent of SuperValu, in 2011. In August 2013 it was announced that all Superquinn stores would be rebranded to SuperValu with all the existing stores eventually changed to SuperValu by February 2014.

It transferred to BBC Radio 1 (simulcast on BBC Radio 2) from 1967 to 1972. It was revived for six years in 1989. Its current production run started on BBC Radio 2 in 1997. Original format (1955–1972) Initially the show did not feature the charts, but in September 1957 Alan Dell introduced the format of running through the charts of the week, playing the top tens from various music papers plus entries to top 20s. David Jacobs brought the first averaged BBC Top 20 to the helm on Saturday, 29 March 1958. Alan Freeman took over in September 1961, taking the show to a regular Sunday slot in January 1962. The programme ended in September 1972, while the Top 20 continued as part of \\"Solid Gold Sixty\\". Freeman, who presented the longest and whose name is probably most closely associated with Pick of the Pops, had been a radio announcer in Melbourne, Australia. Freeman arrived in Britain in 1957 and joined the Light Programme in 1961 to present Records Around Five. That same year he replaced David Jacobs for Pick of the Pops, which was then part of a Saturday-evening programme called Trad Tavern, after traditional jazz which had a following at the time. Pick of the Pops became a separate programme in January 1962. It was produced by Derek Chinnery. Denys Jones (producer 1961–1972) and Freeman split the programme into four: chart newcomers, new releases, LPs and the Top 10. The programme attracted large audiences as the BBC had restrictions on \\"needle time\\" and could play relatively few commercially available recordings each week. Freeman continued with the show when it moved to Radio 1 and stayed until the programme ended in September 1972. Revivals Freeman revived Pick of the Pops on the local London station, Capital Radio, from 1982 to the end of 1988 as Pick of the Pops – Take Two, combining the new chart (Top 15s compiled successively by Record Business, the NME and MRIB) with a chart from the past. In 1989, Freeman returned to Radio 1 where the show featured three past charts each week, and was produced by Phil Swern through March 1992, and for the rest of 1992 by Sue Foster.BBC Genome listings Freeman's final programme, at the end of 1992, stated then that he would never present it again, and signed off with the Beatles' \\"The End\\". From April 1994 to January 1997 Freeman revived the show once more on Capital Gold as Pick Of The Pops – Take Three, featuring two vintage top 12s, and the \\"Battle Of The Giants\\", and on other occasions featuring three vintage top 10s, two vintage top 20s and a rock request, along with competitions on Saturday mornings. BBC Radio 2 era (1997–present) Pick of the Pops returned to the BBC as an independent production by Unique Broadcasting on BBC Radio 2 on 5 April 1997, with Freeman now counting down two archive charts each week featuring the top 10s and interspersing trivia about the records, again researched by producer Swern. =Dale Winton (April 2000–October 2010)= On 1 April 2000, Freeman presented his last show and retired for health reasons, and the show was taken over by Dale Winton, who joined him on this edition. Winton first presented the show solo on 8 April 2000. The regular weekly edition ended on 28 August 2004, with limited broadcast of special editions on Bank Holidays. Pick of the Pops then returned on a weekly basis in September 2005, on a Sunday afternoon, with Winton at the helm. The BBC then moved the show to a Saturday lunchtime slot in April 2009, where it remains today. Winton bowed out of Pick of the Pops on 30 October 2010 owing to other work. =Tony Blackburn (November 2010–February 2016)= On 24 September 2010, it was announced that Tony Blackburn would take over Pick of The Pops from Winton, and be continued to be produced by Swern. His first show aired on 6 November 2010. Although the show was pre-recorded during the Winton era, from 29 January 2011 the show was mostly broadcast live, which allowed Blackburn to interact with his listeners. In August 2015 Pick of the Pops got a new producer Tom Du Croz after 18 years of Swern producing on his own. Blackburn was dismissed by the BBC on 25 February 2016, having presented his last edition of the show just 5 days earlier. =Mark Goodier (February–July 2016)= Mark Goodier stepped in to present the show on a temporary basis. He was the youngest presenter on Pick of the Pops to feature charts before he was born. He was also the last presenter to feature texts & emails which began during Blackburn's reign of host of Pick of the Pops. Goodier hosted the show between 27 February to 2 July 2016. = Paul Gambaccini (July 2016–present)= Gambaccini took over Pick of The Pops on 9 July 2016, still produced by Swern and Tom Du Croz, later replaced by Heather Wall. Paul also features Billboard charts along with The UK 20 twenty normally in the first hour then the Billboard chart in the second hour, over the Christmas/ New Year period. He also tells listeners what was number one in America giving a nod to his long running show America's Greatest Hits. On 6 January and 24 February 2018, Paul missed Pick of the Pops due to snow and ill health, with former temporary host Mark Goodier covering on both occasions. In May 2018 Paul presented a special Pick Of The Pops to celebrate the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and featured their birth years in celebration: 1981 and 1984. On 25 August 2018, Paul presented another special on Prince & Madonna to celebrate their 60th birthdays and counted down their best selling singles. Currently from March 2020, due to COVID-19, the show is not currently being broadcast live but being voice-tracked due to Paul not being allowed to attend Wogan House for a while.

Josie and the Pussycats is a 1970 bubblegum pop album by a girl group designed to be the real-life incarnation of a fictional band in Archie Comics and Hanna-Barbera cartoons. The album was released by Capitol Records with Danny Janssen's La La Productions. Besides being both an Archie comic book and a Saturday morning cartoon series, Josie and the Pussycats is also the name of a bubblegum pop singing group from the early 1970s based on the fictional characters. The group was made up of Cathy Douglas (also known as Cathy Dougher, and whose real name was Kathleen Dougherty), Patrice Holloway, and Cherie Moor (later known as Cheryl Ladd). The group also released six singles in 1970 and 1971. All of the songs were re-released on a 2001 compilation, Stop, Look and Listen – The Capitol Recordings. Background In preparation for their upcoming cartoon series, Hanna-Barbera Productions began working on putting together a real-life \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" girl group, who would provide the singing voices of the girls in the cartoons and also cut an album. The \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" recordings were produced by La La Productions which included producer/songwriter Danny Janssen (who had written for Bobby Sherman and The Partridge Family), his business partner Bobby Young, and songwriters Austin Roberts, Sue Steward (now known as Sue Sheridan) and Bobby Hart (formerly one of the producers/songwriters for The Monkees). They held a talent search to find three girls who would match the three girls in the comic book in both looks and singing ability, and, after interviewing over 500 finalists, settled upon casting Dougher as Josie, Moor as Melody, and Holloway as Valerie. African-American with part-Hispanic background, Holloway was the younger sister of Motown legend Brenda Holloway. Having signed to the label as a solo artist in 1965, she was the only one of the three finalists with prior ties to Capitol Records (the label that released the Pussycats' album and singles). Her early Capitol singles, all highly collectible, include \\"Ecstasy,\\" \\"Stay With Your Own Kind\\" and \\"Stolen Hours\\" (released between 1965 & 1967). Most were produced by Hollywood-based writer/producers Billy and Gene Page. Cheryl Jean Stoppelmoor had come to Hollywood from her native South Dakota with a country and western band that broke up and went back home almost immediately upon arrival. Shortening her unwieldy last name and now going as Cherie Moor, she decided to stay and try her luck as a singer, dancer and actress on television. After marrying David Ladd, she would go on to replace Farrah Fawcett in Charlie's Angels prior to the filming of its second season in 1977. She would also release a Gold album and a Top 40 single (\\"Think It Over\\") on Capitol the following year. Janssen presented the newly formed band to William Hanna and Joseph Barbera to finalize the production deal, but was in for a major surprise. Hanna-Barbera wanted Janssen to recast Holloway, as they had decided to portray \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" as an all-White trio, altering Valerie's character to make her Caucasian. Janssen refused to recast Holloway, whose voice he felt he needed for the soul-inspired bubblegum pop songs he had written, and threatened to walk away from the project. After a three-week-long stand-off between Janssen and Hanna-Barbera, Hanna-Barbera finally relented, allowed Janssen to keep Holloway, and changed Valerie back to being an African-American. Valerie had been introduced in the \\"Josie\\" comic book in late 1969, and the character had been African-American from the start. Word quickly spread around Los Angeles about the stand Janssen had taken. To show their gratitude, a number of the most notable soul session players in the city offered their services to La La Productions and the Josie album at a fraction of their regular fees. Among them were Elvis Presley's drummer Ronnie Tutt, Elvis' bassist Jerry Scheff, keyboardist Clarence MacDonald, flutist Wilton Felder and guitarist Mike Stewart. Overview The Josie and the Pussycats sound is modeled after the late '60s Detroit acts such as Motown's The Jackson 5 and Hot Wax Records' Honey Cone. A cover of The Jackson 5's \\"I'll Be There\\" was featured on the soundtrack album while co-lead vocalist Patrice Holloway mimicked young Michael Jackson's singing style.Unterberger, Ritchie (2003). \\"[ Stop, Look, and Listen: The Capitol Recordings]\\" AllMusic Holloway also sings lead on the Josie and the Pussycats theme song, which was written by Hanna- Barbera musical director Hoyt Curtin, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The theme itself is based on a recurring score cue from The Jetsons Other lead vocals were performed by Cherie Moor. Although she was cast as the singing voice of Josie, Kathleen Dougherty only sings partial lead vocals on \\"If That Isn't Love\\" and \\"I'll Be There.\\" Also present on the album are covers of Bobby Sherman's \\"La, La, La (If I Had You)\\", The Carpenters' \\"(They Long To Be) Close To You\\", and Bread's \\"It Don't Matter to Me\\". Although Janssen used strings, horns, keyboards, and oscillators (electronic synthesizers) to create the band's sound, the on-screen cartoon band featured the trio of Josie on guitar, Valerie on bass, and Melody on drums. Josie and the Pussycats: From the Hanna-Barbera TV Show was released on December 15, 1970 by Capitol Records. Six 45 RPM singles were released, four of which contained non-album songs and were available only as part of a Kellogg's mail-order promotion. None of the singles charted, resulting in poor sales and a shelved national tour. Hanna-Barbera contracted producer Jimmie Haskell and a group of anonymous session singers to perform the music for Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, and La La Productions' Josie and the Pussycats group was officially disbanded. Danny Janssen and Patrice Holloway worked together on several songs after the demise of the band (\\"Black Mother Goose\\" and \\"Evidence,\\" both issued in 1971), and Sue Sheridan (as Sue Steward) cut two solo singles for Capitol under Janssen and Young's supervision. Several years later, Sheridan wrote a few songs for Cheryl Ladd's self-titled 1978 debut album, also released on Capitol Records. The album, plus several singles and alternate takes, were collected in a limited edition digitally remastered set entitled Josie and the Pussycats: Stop Look and Listen: The Capitol Recordings, released by Rhino Handmade on October 5, 2001. Rhino pressed 5000 copies of the album. Earlier that same year, Babyface produced a new Josie and the Pussycats album as the soundtrack for the motion picture released by Universal Pictures that same year. This new reincarnation of the Pussycats had a harder, punk-rock sound, as opposed to their Motown-ish 1970 counterparts. Letters to Cleo vocalist Kay Hanley performed all lead vocals.

The name Banagher comes from its Irish name, which translates to English as \\"the place of the pointed rocks on the Shannon\\".Trodd, Valentine, 1985, Banagher on the Shannon – A Historical Guide to the Town, p.5. Banagher was a town of 3,000 people at the height of its economic growth in the mid-19th century. As of 2016, the population was over 1,700. Banagher was historically an important strategic location on the River Shannon and was one of the few crossing points between the provinces of Leinster and Connacht. It thus became a natural focus for a number of historical buildings, including a 19th-century Martello Tower and a number of castles around the town, which were built in the 14th and 15th centuries. The town used to be the focus of thriving river business and was an important stop on the Dublin to Limerick navigation. It supported a number of industries, including a maltings and distillery, which are now defunct. Tourism has supplanted this to a certain extent with a modern marina providing support for river cruisers and watersports facilities and the town is an angling centre, with particular attraction for pike anglers.Offaly County Council – History of Banagher. Retrieved 3 November 2008. Neylon, Tina, Adventure Guide To Ireland, Hunter Travel Guides, 2004, p.163. Banagher is the centre of the Shannon Callows, grassy meadows which flood in winter and provide living space for waterfowl.  Governance and administrative units  Banagher lies in the local council area of Offaly County Council. Local authorities have responsibility for such matters as planning, local roads, sanitation, and libraries. The Council is an elected body of 21 members with councillors elected from four electoral areas in the county. Banagher lies in the Birr electoral area, which returns five members to the council.Offaly County Council Website – Meet Your Councillors. Retrieved 3 November 2008. The town lies in the Barony of Garrycastle (Garraí an Chaisleáin) and was in the poor law union of Birr. Divided by the road to Birr from Eyrecourt, its eastern part lies in the townland of Curraghavarna and Portavrolla and its western part in the townland of Banagher or Kylebeg.Lewis, S., A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, 1837. Banagher is in the Roman Catholic parish of Gallen and Rynagh (Reynagh) which lies in the diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise. The diocese is in the Archdiocese of Armagh in the ecclesiastical province of Armagh. It is in the Church of Ireland parish group of Clonfert Cathedral which is in the Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe, part of the ecclesiastical province of Dublin.  History  It is thought that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard.Offaly Historical And Archaeological Society (OHAS), Banagher Was Founded Fourteen Centuries Ago, 9 February 2007. Retrieved 3 November 2008. According to research, they came from a place near New Ross in County Wexford. It is known that contact was maintained between Rynagh's Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher, and her mother came to live there. It is recorded that Reynagh's mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but there does not seem to be an authoritative statement as to the date of St. Rynagh's death, although according to St. Rynagh's Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but it is likely to have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.Madden, J., St. Rynagh's Church, Banagher, St. Rynagh's Parish. = Origins = The settlement that grew to become Banagher originated at a ford on the east bank of the River Shannon. The river banks and surrounding countryside were flood-free all year round. Travellers intending to cross the Shannon converged on this point along tracks which were the forerunners of the modern roads, and a community grew at this crossing point.Banagher – A Brief History: Civic Week Booklet (1951). Retrieved 3 November 2008. Many of the early travellers were pilgrims. North- west of Banagher, on the Connacht side of the river, was the monastic establishment of Clonfert, with the more famous Clonmacnoise a short distance further north. Not far to the south-west on the same side was another monastic foundation, at Meelick. At Meelick, the three provinces, Leinster, Munster and Connacht meet and just south of Banagher in the direction of Birr, the four dioceses of Clonmacnoise, Meath, Killaloe and Clonfert meet. = Military history = At Banagher, there are ridges on both sides of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049.Moriarty, Christopher, Places to Visit – Banagher, The Sacred Heart Messenger, March 1997. It was a place of great strategic importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna. Clonony Castle The importance of Banagher as a military position on the Shannon and the highway from Leinster and Munster to Connacht was early appreciated by the English, whose forces seized it about the middle of the 16th century, coming up the river to do so. They constructed some fortifications which they called Fort Frankford (later Fort Falkland) and held the place in spite of the fact that the part of Offaly for some miles around Banagher was in the hands of the MacCoghlan clan. The MacCoghlans, aided by boundaries of bog and river, held their territories against all comers for about 500 years, even maintaining a footing by open defiance well into the 17th century. Garry Castle, Clonony Castle, and Moystown Castle are remains of MacCoghlan strongholds.Irish Midlands Ancestry, Banagher – The Midland Boroughs in the 1830s. Retrieved 3 November 2008. Sometime after 1554, when Queen Mary married Philip II of Spain, Offaly County was named King's County in honour of Philip, but it is doubtful if the royal jurisdiction extended to any of the MacCoghlan areas except Banagher. Ultimately, the MacCoghlans were overthrown and their lands were planted by order of James I issued in 1621. The town was incorporated by charter of Charles I on 16 September 1628. The corporation was allowed to elect two members to Parliament and hold two fairs per year, amongst other wide-ranging powers.OHAS, Banagher as a Corporate Town Retrieved 3 November 2008. In 1628, a permanent military garrison was established which continued with slight interruptions until 1863. The defences were further strengthened and it was officially named Fort Falkland, after Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland who was Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1622–29. The forces of the Confederate Catholics took Banagher in 1642, but it was retaken by the Cromwellian Army in 1650, under the command of Henry Ireton, Cromwell's son-in-law. By 1652 the Cromwellian conquest was completed and the transplantation of the Catholic landholders to Connacht began in 1654. The lands from which they were expelled were divided among the adventurers and the soldiers of Cromwell's army. During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the garrison espoused the cause of James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence of the presence of Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the Crank Road. The Irish garrison remained in Banagher without further molestation until the Battle of Aughrim, after which Banagher was evacuated. The English re-occupied the town, where they remained until the middle of the 19th century when Banagher ceased to be a garrison town. = Economic growth = In the 17th century, Banagher was the centre of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England practically killed the woollen trade. At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly. From 1800 to 1847, Banagher enjoyed a period of prosperity unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long been one of the chief agricultural activities of the district and the opening of the Grand Canal at the end of the 18th century gave easy access to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area around the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland. The canal arrived at Shannon Harbour in 1804, and the water transport facilities stimulated the growth of existing industries and encouraged the establishment of new ones. Neat two and three- storey houses were built on each side of the road in Banagher to provide shops and dwellings for the merchants and other people who came to live there for the canal business. In 1834, there was a distillery, a brewery, two tanyards, a malthouse and corn mills in full operation in the town. Several craftsmen carried on industries in smaller workshops and their homes. With the increase in trade and manufactures went a corresponding increase in population. In 1800, the population was estimated at 1500; in 1841, it was 2836, and in 1846, it was estimated at 3000. = Decline = Contrasted with the flourishing state of trade in the first half of the 19th century is the rapid and sustained decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that remained of the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely. Various causes contributed to this decline. The abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846 allowed the free importation of grain into these islands. Unable to compete with foreigners, the Irish farmer turned his land to pasture and grew only sufficient grain for his own use. The Banagher corn trade rapidly declined, and would have completely vanished were it not that barley growing was kept alive by Waller's malthouse. The clearances in East Galway in the years immediately succeeding the Great Irish Famine adversely affected the trade of the town while the smaller industries were unable to compete against the highly organised industries of Britain. The opening of Banagher Railway station in 1884, as the terminus of the Clara to Banagher branch of the Great Southern & Western Railway Company, brought some improvement, with several passenger and goods trains every day. However, the fuel crisis of 1947 caused passenger services to be withdrawn from the line and it closed altogether in 1963.Railscot – Irish Railways: Banagher Station. Retrieved 3 November 2008. Although the site of the station is now covered by the marina, the trackway can still be seen, minus the track, at the gateway at the eastern corner of the marina.Trodd 1985, p.8.  Geography  River Shannon from Banagher Bridge Banagher is situated in north-west County Offaly on the east bank of the River Shannon. It is south-west of Dublin, south-east of Ballinasloe, south of Athlone and north east of Limerick. It provides a crossing point between Offaly in Leinster and Galway in Connacht. Although Banagher is located in the flood-plain of the River Shannon, the town itself was developed on high ground and remains virtually flood-free all year round. North of Lough Derg, the River Shannon has a very shallow gradient and regularly floods parts of the surrounding countryside. The resultant wet grassland area, known as the Shannon Callows, is an internationally recognised wild bird and wildlife habitat and is classified as a Special Area of Conservation. The country on either side of the Shannon in the Offaly-Galway area has been described as \\"reminiscent of the Fens, cut off and intersected by waterways, by the wide meandering Shannon itself, by its tributaries, the Suck, the Brosna and the Little Brosna and by the Grand Canal; traversed by a maze of narrow roads.\\"Bence Jones, Mark, Trollope's Corner of Ireland, This Country Life, 13 July 1978. The travel writer and biographer, James Pope-Hennessy, described the River Shannon at Banagher in September in his biography of Anthony Trollope: \\"The month of September in Banagher, and all along the Shannon banks, is visually a glorious one, with golden autumn mornings, the low sun making long shadows of the houses in the street. At dusk the whole river reflects the varied sunsets as the days draw in – effects of palest pink, for instance, striped by cloudy lines of green, or an horizon aflame with scarlet and orange light.\\" The Slieve Bloom Mountains lie to the south of Banagher and the town is surrounded by the great bogs of the midlands, particularly to the east and west. The River Brosna is a major tributary of the River Shannon and meets the Shannon at Shannon Harbour, three kilometres north of Banagher.Feehan, J., The Landscape of Slieve Bloom, 1979, Blackwater Press. = Climate = Banagher has a temperate climate. Average daily high temperatures are in July and in January. Precipitation, at an average of 804 mm per annum, is similar to that in much of the midlands and east of Ireland, and is significantly less than the precipitation on the west coast, which averages between 1000 mm and 1250 mm per annum.Met Éireann – Rainfall in Ireland. Retrieved 3 November 2008. = Wildlife = Corncrake In autumn and winter, the extensive flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports a large number of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the Eurasian coot, common moorhen and little grebe. The kingfisher is widespread as are the meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, common sandpiper and black- tailed godwit.Trodd, V., Birds of Brosnaland, 1983, Offaly Vocational Educational Committee. The corncrake can be seen at the bridge of Banagher in the summer. Once a common summer visitor to Ireland, corncrakes have suffered drastic population declines over the last few decades and are threatened with global extinction.Birdwatch Ireland – Corncrake. Retrieved 3 November 2008. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – one of the few places in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.Banagher Along The Shannon. Retrieved 3 November 2008. In winter, the resident bird population is increased by visitors from north-east Europe, in particular the Eurasian wigeon and the Greenland subspecies of the white-fronted goose.OHAS, Landscape of Offaly, 9 January 2007. Retrieved 3 November 2008. Riverside mammals are seen frequently and Eurasian otter, American mink and red fox are common. Trout and salmon are less common in the Shannon than they once were, however pike is still plentiful and attracts anglers.  Demographics  Banagher was extensively planted by the English, particularly during the periods 1621–1642 and 1650–1690. The plantations had a profound impact on Ireland in several ways. The first was the destruction of the native ruling classes and their replacement with the Protestant Ascendancy, of British-origin (mostly English) Protestant landowners. Their position was buttressed by the Penal Laws, which denied political and land-owning rights to Roman Catholics. The dominance of this class in Irish life persisted until the late 18th century, and it voted for the Act of Union with Britain in 1800. As a result, by the early 20th century, Banagher had a mix of Irish of native descent and Irish of English descent and supported two churches, one Catholic and one Protestant, both of which still exist. During the late 1960s to the early 1980s, several German, Dutch and Swiss settlers were attracted to Banagher, mainly because of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. A number of these are still resident in Banagher. In the early 21st century a number of people from Eastern Europe (for example Poland) moved to the area, and these now make up approximately 4% of the population. According to the 2011 Census, Banagher had a population of 1,653 (a 1.0% increase on the 2006 Census) with 801 male and 852 female residents.CSO Census 2011 Results. Retrieved 24 September 2012. By 2016, the population had increased further to 1,760 inhabitants.  Economy  The demise of the once-thriving canal and maltings businesses brought about a serious decline in Banagher's fortunes, including a significant population decrease. However, a number of businesses kept many people in the locality employed during lean times. The most notable of these was Bord na Móna, a semi-state company founded in 1946 to manage the harvesting of peat from Ireland's bogs, the most extensive of which are located in the midlands. However, the advancement of mechanised harvesting, the exhaustion of the bogs and the closure of a number of peat-fired power stations, means that this is no longer a significant employer in the region. Green Isle Foods had a facility just outside Banagher and provided good employment during the 1970s and 1980s. It was taken out of production some years ago and is now used as a storage facility only. The largest industry in Banagher these days is Banagher Precast Concrete Limited, a company specialising in precast concrete structures. The company employs approximately 150 people and was one of the largest concrete firms in the country, employing over 400 people at its peak in 2008. It has supplied components for many major projects, including the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park, Channel Tunnel, the Dublin Port Tunnel, Thomond Park and the Limerick Tunnel,Banagher Concrete Profile on Birrnet.com – Birrs' Community Website. Retrieved 3 November 2008. and most recently Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. Other notable employers include Banagher Sawmills and the cruise liner businesses located at the marina.  Transportation  Banagher is an important crossing point on the River Shannon and consequently experiences a large volume of through traffic. Two regional roads meet in Banagher; the R356, which links the N62 and N65 national primary roads and is known as Harbour Street in Banagher and the R439 which links Birr with Banagher and is known as Main Street in Banagher. Harbour Street leads to the road to Shannon Harbour and Main Street begins at the hill at the southern entrance to the town and leads down to the bridge crossing the Shannon.Google Map of Banagher. Retrieved 3 November 2008. A railway station opened in Banagher in 1884 as the terminus for the Clara to Banagher line of the Great Southern & Western Railway Company. It operated both a passenger and goods service until 1947 when the passenger service was withdrawn. The station closed completely in 1963. Banagher was once a centre for river transportation on the Shannon system. River transportation fell into decline with the advent of rail and road transportation improvements. Banagher is still a centre for river cruisers, with a number of hire companies operating the town's marina.  Culture  = Banagher Fair = As part of the charter of incorporation of 1628, the corporation was given powers to: \\"hold two fairs, one on the Feast of St. Philip and Jacob, the other on the Feast of St. Simon and Jude, each to continue for two days.\\" These feast days equated to 1 May and 28 October. However, a fair was already in existence in Banagher since 1612 and was held in September. These three fairs were certainly still in existence in the mid-1830s, as they were described in a government-commissioned report in 1835. The fairs established by the first corporation continued to gain in size and importance during the 18th century and the early part of the 19th century. In 1826, the enormous number of 43,000 sheep was offered for sale at the September fair, with three-quarters of that number being sold. Pigot's Directory of 1824 described the workings of the fair: \\"...and there are three fairs; the principal one commences on the 15 September and continues for four days, the first for sheep, the second for horned cattle, the third for horses, and the last day is the country fair for linen, woollens and other merchandise.\\"OHAS, Offaly Towns in 1824 – Pigot's Directory. Retrieved 3 November 2008. It seems that the fair held in September was the main fair and is the one that has survived to the present. Pope Hennessy described the granting of the charter by Charles I which \\"empowered them to hold the famous Banagher Great Fair, at which everything from cattle and sheep to boots and basket chairs was on sale. This Fair, the greatest in all the Irish Midlands, began on September 15 and lasted four days. The line of horses tethered on each side of Banagher Main Street stretched from the Shannon river bridge to the crossroads two and a half miles outside the town known as Tailor's Cross.\\"Pope-Hennessy, James, Anthony Trollope, 1971, p.73. The fair had achieved an international reputation by the early 20th century and a local newspaper report of 1909 states \\"The Banagher Great Fair was a huge success and among those present were Senor Gelline of Milan to make purchase on behalf of the Italian Government, while Mr Rodzanko bought for the Russian Government.\\" The report also stated that \\"Eighty-nine wagons of horses were entrained at Banagher Railway Station...this representing in round numbers about 500 horses.\\"Midland Tribune, 18 September 1909. = Architecture, buildings and structures =  Banagher Bridge  Banagher Bridge The first bridge that is known to have been built at this point was erected as a \\"spacious stone bridge of 18 arches\\" by Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair (Anglicised Roderic O'Connor), the King of Connacht, around 1049. However, medieval sources tell of a \\"bridge of 27 arches of divers(e) architectural form, each different from its fellow\\", which stood here for over 500 years.Trodd 1985, p.10.Delaney, Ruth, The Shannon Navigation, 2008, The Lilliput Press, Dublin, p.88. A stone bridge of 17 arches was certainly constructed in 1685 and this was detailed in profile drawings by Thomas Rhodes in 1833. Banagher Bridge The bridge of 1685 featured prominently in the Williamite War in Ireland of the 17th century and was used by Patrick Sarsfield to retreat to Connacht after his ambush of a Williamite convoy at Ballyneety in Co. Limerick during the Siege of Limerick. Because of its affording Sarsfield and his army a method of advance and retreat, the old bridge was often referred to as Sarsfield's Bridge.Trodd 1985, p.12. This bridge was blown up in 1843 by gunpowder by a section of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The abutment of this bridge can still be seen adjacent to Cromwell's Castle on the Connacht side of the river. Banagher Bridge in the 19th century The present bridge of seven arches was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The engineer was Thomas Rhodes, one of the commissioners of the Shannon Navigation, whose name can be seen on many of the bridges over the Shannon and on surviving lock mechanisms, notably at Victoria and Athlone locks. This bridge was reconstructed and widened jointly by Offaly County Council and Galway County Council in 1971. Their work included replacing massive stone parapets on either side of the bridge with aluminium railings, and the removal of a swivel arch which had allowed passage for masted boats. A heritage review of the bridges of County Offaly in 2005 described Banagher Bridge as of national heritage significance, of high architectural merit and demonstrative of mid-19th century construction work by a government body. It states \\"This is the only six-arch masonry span in the county. It is an interesting contrast with the 1750s bridge at Shannonbridge. Although both are approximately the same length, Banagher Bridge achieves the crossing with fewer spans (six as opposed to 16). It also has the longest masonry arch spans of all the county's bridges, averaging 17.88 m\\".Hamond, F., Bridges of County Offaly – An Industrial Heritage Review, Offaly County Council, 2005, OFIAR-021-006. Retrieved 3 November 2008. All of the castellations around and near the bridge were built to protect it, including Cromwell's Castle, The Salt Battery (Fort Eliza), Fort Falkland and the Martello Tower. However, the guns mounted on these forts could be used to destroy the bridge if necessary, as well as to bombard attacking forces on the river. A narrow quay passes under the old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn handrail offers the pedestrian some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was known for some time after as the Duke of York's Route.Trodd 1985, p.20.  Barracks  Old Barracks Wall (Fort Falkland) This former constabulary barracks was built around 1800. Irregular in plan and now in ruins, it comprises a partially roughcast rendered rubble limestone enclosing wall with a cut stone segmental-headed entrance to the east and is situated to the south of the River Shannon, adjacent to the bridge. Remains of structures within the enclosure include a barrel-vaulted powder magazine built around 1806, with a gun platform above. These walls are thought to be the perimeter walls of Fort Falkland from 1642.County Development Plan 2009–2015: Record of Protected Structures., Offaly County Council, 2008. Retrieved 14 June 2010. According to Pigot's Directory of 1824, the barracks housed two companies of foot, had apartments for three officers, a bomb and waterproof magazine and an artillery battery mounting three 12-pound guns. The Directory also states that the barracks was formerly a nunnery (possibly that of Saint Rynagh, which would have been founded around 580) and communicated with Saint Rynagh's Old Abbey by a subterranean passage of some 400 yards.Trodd 1985, p.21. Although the British garrison had left the town in 1863, the barracks were looted and burned shortly after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921–22.  Bow-fronted Georgian houses  The Shannon HotelBanagher has two bow-fronted Georgian buildings dating from the mid-to-late 18th century and both are listed as protected structures. One is a detached seven-bay, two-storey building, called Crank House, due to its location on the corner of Main Street and Crank Road. It was restored in the early 1990s by the Offaly West Enterprise Co-operative Society and opened in 1992.Banagher Review 1993, St. Rynagh's Parish Review Committee, 1993, p.14. It was formerly used as the headquarters for Crann, an NGO dedicated to planting native trees and protecting Ireland's woodlands. It is now used by the West Offaly Partnership as a Community Enterprise Centre which includes an exhibition hall, tourist office, retail and enterprise units and a hostel. The building is also the location of the Midlands branch office of Birdwatch Ireland. The second of these buildings is a terraced, three-bay, three-storey house with an adjoining four-bay, two-storey coach house, which still has its original limestone carriage arch. It has been used as a hotel since the early 19th century and was home to Anthony Trollope during his stay in Banagher in the 1840s. It has a prominent location next to the marina and close to the bridge. Long called the 'Shannon Hotel', the name was changed to 'The Royal Shannon' in the 1990s. It has ceased to trade as a hotel and is now falling into neglect.  Charlotte's Way  Charlotte's Way (Hill House) Charlotte's Way, formerly known as Hill House, is located close to Saint Paul's Church of Ireland church. This house was once the home of Charlotte Brontë's husband, Mr Nicholls, who returned to Banagher after Charlotte's death. Nicholls remarried and lived at Hill House until his death in 1906. The house was sold to a Major Bell in 1919. He died in 1944 and his wife inherited the property. Florence Bell died in 1959. This connection to Charlotte Brontë and the Brontë family is revealed in its present name. It is a detached three-bay two-storey house, built in 1753, with a gabled central bay to the façade with modern porch and single-bay two-storey wing to the south and two-bay two-storey wing to the north. It is now used as a bed and breakfast.Byrne, Michael, Charlotte Brontë – and her association with Banagher, OHAS. Retrieved 3 November 2008.  Cromwell's Castle  Cromwell's Castle The structure that stands on what is known locally as the Canal Bank, called Cromwell's Castle, primarily derives its current form from the Napoleonic Wars. Similar to the Martello Tower that stands opposite it, on the same bank of the river, Cromwell's Castle was largely reconstructed as a defensive position to repel any invading fleet coming upstream towards Banagher. The English had established many forts on the Leinster bank of the river, including Fort Frankford and, later, Fort Falkland (see Military History). The garrison at Fort Falkland was overrun by the forces of the Confederate Catholics in 1642 but was recaptured by Cromwell's army in 1650. The Cromwellians established a new fortification on the Connacht bank of the river leading up to the plantation of Connacht in 1654. The castle was modified in 1817 to enable it to mount artillery with a platform for a 24-pound traversing gun constructed on its roof. Its interior became a powder magazine and housed a garrison of 20 soldiers. Having fallen somewhat into disrepair, the structure came under the care of the Banagher Branch of the Offaly Historical Society in the 1980s and considerable restoration work has been undertaken since then.Trodd 1985, p.17. The Canal Bank on which it stands is the property of the people of Banagher and is held in trust as a public amenity. Considerable works around the castle have also taken place and the castle, park and riverside walk are open to the public.  Cuba Court  Cuba Court, also known as Cuba House, was a house dating from the 1730s and may have been constructed by one George Frazer, a former Governor of Cuba and perhaps to a design of Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, who designed the Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin. It is certainly known to have been constructed with money from the sugar plantations in Cuba.Ireland of the Welcomes, Vol. 28 no.6, November – December 1979. In his biography of Anthony Trollope, James Pope-Hennessy describes Cuba Court as \\"a fine example of an Irish country-house of the mid-eighteenth century in the manner of the Dublin architect, Pierce (sic). The building contained...two circular rooms...and an avenue of lime trees led to the front door.\\"Pope-Hennessy, p. 74. The Belfast writer, Maurice Craig, in his 1976 book Classic Irish Houses of the Middle Size, describes Cuba Court as \\"perhaps the most splendidly masculine house in the whole country.\\"Craig, Maurice, J., Classic Irish Houses of the Middle Size, 1976, Ashfield Press, Dublin, p.94. Towards the end of the 18th century, Cuba Court was the home of Denis Bowes Daly, who was a prominent member of the local ascendancy. Prior to his death in 1821 he had leased Cuba Court to the Army Medical Board on a 61-year lease. The building was little used as a hospital and the Medical Board was quite happy to give it up to the Commissioners of Education for the Royal School, which had eventually been established as a result of the Royal Charter of 1621.Byrne, Michael, Banagher's Royal School, OHAS. Retrieved 3 November 2008. Charlotte Brontë spent her honeymoon at Cuba Court in 1854 following her marriage to Arthur Bell Nicholls (See Charlotte Brontë). She noted of Cuba Court: \\"It is very large and looks externally like a gentleman's country seat – within most of the rooms are lofty and spacious, and some – the drawing room and dining room are handsomely and commodiously furnished. The passages look desolate and bare – our bedroom, a great room of the ground floor, would have looked gloomy when we were shown into it but for the turf fire that was burning in the wide old chimney.\\" During the 1820s, the Royal School at Cuba Court was attended by Sir William Wilde, who later married the poet Jane Francesca Agnes Elgee. The couple had two sons: Willie and Oscar Wilde, and a daughter, Isola Francesca, who died in childhood.Ó Broin, Gearóid, Banagher's Remarkable Associations, Ireland's Own Summer Annual, 1988. Another pupil at the school was William Bulfin, the journalist and writer associated with Argentina through his work Tales of the Pampas, who attended in the 1870s. His son, Eamon Bulfin was one of the main participants in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to deportation to Argentina where he had been born.Kiely, B, 1948, William Bulfin – Man from the Pampas, The Capuchin Annual 1948. Due to the Irish policy on rates at the time, the house was unroofed in 1946 and this hastened its demise. Pope Hennessy described Cuba Court in 1971: \\"Like so many of Ireland's great houses, Cuba Court is now being slowly but deliberately demolished. The lime trees have long since been hacked down.\\" In spite of this, it was described as \\"a superb ruin that could tell the history of Ascendancy Ireland\\", as late as 1979. It was eventually acquired by a local businessman and demolished in the 1980s. Craig describes the loss of Cuba Court as \\"particularly to be lamented\\".Craig, p.vii.

An archaeological survey revealed nothing of significance.Noonan, Daniel, Cuba House – Archaeological Survey Report on excavations.ie – Database of Irish Excavation Reports. Retrieved 3 November 2008.  Fort Eliza  Fort Eliza, also known as the Salt Battery, is a freestanding five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing on the east side of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.  Martello Tower  Martello Tower at Banagher Martello towers (or simply Martellos) are small defensive forts built in several countries of the British Empire during the 19th century, from the time of the Napoleonic Wars onwards. They stand up to high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15–25 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy artillery piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse a 360° arc. Fear of an invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte reached panic proportions amongst the authorities in Ireland and England in 1804 and the first towers were built in Ireland that year.Enoch, Victor J., The Martello Towers of Ireland, 1970, Eason & Son Ltd. In case an invasion fleet tried to sail up the River Shannon, two towers were built on the middle reaches of the river to defend its crossing points. One of these was located at Meelick and the other at Banagher. The tower at Banagher is located on the west (Galway) bank of the river and measures in diameter and height. The tower was described in 1970 as having \\"...no corbels, a ridge around the top, much vegetation growing around it, and its general condition is fair.\\" Memorials and sculptures Barnes & McCormack Memorial A memorial in the form of a stone Celtic Cross is situated at the eastern side of the town. It is known as the Barnes & McCormack Memorial and dedicated to two local men who were executed in Birmingham in 1940 for their involvement in the Coventry Explosion of 1939 in which five people died. The executions caused a public outcry in Britain and internationally as the men had admitted to constructing the bomb, which was intended to be used to destroy a power station, but claimed not to be involved in planting it. The cross was erected in 1963 by The Barnes & McCormack Memorial Committee in association with The National Graves Committee and bears an inscription in both Irish and English: \\"In commemoration of Staff Captain James McCormack and Company Captain Peter Barnes, Irish Republican Army, who for love of country, were executed by the British Government at Winson Green Prison, Birmingham on the 7th February 1940.\\" The monument was sculpted by Desmond Broe of Dublin and features images of the two men, a female head representing Ireland and symbols of the four provinces. In December 2011 the Zimbabwean artist, Parazai Havatitye, a sculptor who specialises in wood carving, created a sculpture from a tree stump, entitled The Musician, which is dedicated to the musician Johnny McEvoy, who was born in Banagher in 1945. The sculpture is located on the main road, at the gate of the marina. = Places of worship = St. Paul's Church of Ireland Arising from its history as a plantation garrison town, Banagher has active Catholic and Church of Ireland communities. The lane between Market Square and Pucka Lane (formerly Queen Street) is called Church Lane and it is here that the first church in Banagher was sited. The 6th-century abbey of St. Rynagh is now in ruins. This church later became the Church of the Blessed Mary in the 16th century,Trodd 1985, p.36. and was also known as the Church of Banagher. According to tradition, the Cross of Banagher once stood next to a crystal spring in the Market Square. The surviving sandstone shaft of the cross was found in the churchyard by a Birr antiquarian named Thomas Cooke in the 1840s and was in reasonable condition then as he described it in great detail in an article in the Transactions of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society in 1853. The stone that he found appears to have been part of a sepulchral or commemorative cross, set up at Banagher well to record the death of Bishop William O'Duffy, who was killed by a fall from his horse in 1297. Cooke had become so perturbed by the deterioration of the stone by 1852 that he had it removed to his residence in Birr.Cooke, T., 1853, The Ancient Cross of Banagher, King's County, Transactions of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society, Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 277–280. It is now housed in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. St. Rynagh's Catholic Church The Church of Ireland community had worshipped at the old church, which was in a ruinous state by 1829 when the new St. Paul's Church was built at the top of the hill, overlooking the town. The new Catholic church of St. Rynagh's had been constructed some three years earlier and on land given by the Armstrongs, the most influential and wealthiest Protestant family in the area, who consistently and energetically advocated Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Penal Laws.Madden, p.2. This situation demonstrated the friendly relations that existed between the two communities in Banagher during those difficult times for Catholics in Ireland. St. Rynagh's Church houses a work by the well- known German sculptor, Imogen Stuart, called The Madonna and Child, a mandorla carved in 1974. The most outstanding feature of St. Paul's Church is the Window of the Resurrection, a stained-glass window commemorating the Bell family that was originally intended for Westminster Abbey in London.Madden, J, Banagher Heritage Trail, Tourist Guide to Banagher. = Literature and the arts = Literary figures to have stayed at Banagher include Anthony Trollope, who used the town as an inspiration for his first novel The Macdermots of Ballycloran and Charlotte Brontë who married a curate who was raised in Banagher.

In the past Banagher was noted for a number of crafts, including pottery and a popular pottery company, called Crannóg Pottery, was established at the West End by Valerie Landon in the early 1950s. It closed down in the 1980s.  Anthony Trollope  Anthony Trollope by Napoleon Sarony Banagher's greatest literary association is probably with Anthony Trollope, who had been employed by the General Post Office in 1835 and was sent to Ireland in September 1841 at the age of 26. Trollope had had an unhappy life up to that point and remarked in his autobiography: \\"This was the first good fortune of my life.\\"Pope Hennessy, p.70. After landing in Dublin on 15 September, he travelled by canal-boat to Shannon Harbour and then on to Banagher, arriving on 16 September, which coincided with the second day of the annual Great Fair. Although very much smaller than the town of Birr, which is only eight miles away, Banagher had been chosen as the base of a Postal Surveyorship, probably because its position on the Shannon offered easy access by can boat to Dublin and Limerick. Trollope established himself at The Shannon Hotel, a long bow- fronted Georgian building, which was over 100 years old at that time. The hotel, which still exists, is located at the bottom of the town, close to the river. The post office where Trollope worked was at the top of the town, which is a few minutes away on foot. Next to the post office was a two-roomed bungalow which was used by the Postal Surveyor and his new deputy as their working headquarters. This building is often erroneously considered to have been the residence of Trollope himself. Although Trollope's initial knowledge of Ireland was limited, he soon noted that the Irish were good-humoured and clever – \\"...the working classes very much more intelligent than those in England. They were not, as they were reputed to be, spendthrifts, but were economical, hospitable and kind.\\" Their chief defects, he judged, were that they could switch to being very perverse and very irrational and that they were \\"but little bound by the love of truth.\\" Trollope remained stationed at Banagher until late 1844 when he was transferred to Clonmel. It was while in Banagher that Trollope began to write his first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He had begun to contemplate this novel whilst walking outside Drumsna in County Leitrim where the ruins of Ballycloran House stood into the 1840s and were still there in the 1970s. Trollope had been up in Leitrim inspecting the accounts of an errant postmaster. He thought the ruins of Ballycloran \\"one of the most melancholy spots I had ever visited\\" and he later described it in the first chapter of his novel.Pope Hennessy, p.105. Although his first novel was initially unsuccessful, Trollope was undeterred and in all, went on to write forty-seven novels, as well as dozens of short stories and a few books on travel. He returned to England in 1856 and by the mid-1860s had reached a fairly senior position within the Post Office hierarchy. Postal history credits him with introducing the pillar box (the ubiquitous bright red mail-box) to Britain. Anthony Trollope died in London in 1882 and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.  Charlotte Brontë  George Richmond, 1850 Charlotte Brontë had a brief association with Banagher in the mid-1850s when she married one Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father's curate. Nicholls was born of Scottish parents in County Antrim in 1818. He was orphaned early and subsequently brought up by his uncle, Alan Bell, in Banagher. Alan Bell was headmaster at the Royal School at Cuba Court at that time. The couple honeymooned in Ireland and stayed at Cuba Court for a period in June 1854. According to Pope Hennessy, Mrs Nicholls disliked both Banagher and its inhabitants, although she greatly admired the surrounding countryside.Pope Hennessy, p.103. If Bell Nicholls was a poor unknown curate in England – in Banagher he was a member of a respectable family. In a letter quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in her book The Life of Charlotte Brontë, Charlotte wrote: \\"My dear husband, too, appears in a new light in his own country. More than once I have had deep pleasure in hearing his praises on all sides. Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person; for that I have got one of the best gentlemen in the country... I trust I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice; and I pray to be enabled to repay as I ought the affectionate devotion of a truthful, honourable man.\\"Gaskell, Elizabeth, The Life of Charlotte Brontë, 1857. In January 1855, Brontë discovered she was pregnant. It was accompanied by severe illness and she died on 31 March 1855, officially from tuberculosis. Mr Nicholls remained with Brontë's father for a further six years before returning to Banagher in 1861, taking with him his wife's portrait, her wedding dress (of which a copy has been made), some of Charlotte's letters and other mementoes. Forty years later, when the critic Clement Shorter prepared to write Charlotte Brontë and Her Circle, he found at Banagher among other relics, two diaries of Emily and Anne, in a tin box, and some of Charlotte's minute childhood writings wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a drawer.  James Pope Hennessy  James Pope-Hennessy came to Banagher in 1970 to write his biography of Anthony Trollope. Pope Hennessy had published his first book, London Fabric in 1939, for which he was awarded the Hawthornden Prize and was a well-established biographer and travel writer by the time he arrived in Banagher.List of Hawthornden Prize Winners from The Book Centre.

Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took rooms at The Shannon Hotel, near the river and set about trying to capture the essence of the town which had inspired Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced by the fact that he was asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair.Quennell, p.xviii. Pope Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work.Pope Hennessy, p.10.

Retrieved 3 November 2008. Pope Hennessy grew very fond of Banagher and returned to stay at The Shannon Hotel several times before his premature death in 1974. This is illustrated by his description of Banagher in Anthony Trollope: \\"...in Trollope's words, Banagher then seemed 'little more than a village'. It retains a quality of friendly village life to this day and can have changed little since Trollope's time, save that its population has declined to eleven hundred.\\"  Sir Jonah Barrington  Sir Jonah Barrington was born in 1760 near Abbeyleix in the Queen's County (Co. Laois). He was first elected to Parliament as a member for Tuam in 1790. He lost this seat in 1798 and was elected as a member for Banagher in 1799. He voted against the Act of Union in 1801 and as a result, he was deprived of his £1,000 a year sinecure in the Customs House and this also stopped his further advancement. In 1809 he published, in five parts, the first volume of the Historic Memoirs of Ireland. It is thought that he was induced to delay the second volume – the English government shrinking from the exposure of their conduct in carrying the Act of Union, and it was understood that to purchase his silence he was permitted to reside in France from about 1815.Barrington, Jonah, Personal Sketches of His Own Times, 1853, Redfield, New York. In 1827, he published two volumes of Personal Sketches of His Own Times. In 1830, by an address from both Houses of Parliament, he was removed from the Bench, in consequence of well-proven misappropriation of public money. The third volume of Personal Sketches appeared in 1833 as did the delayed volume of his Historic Memoirs. This book was subsequently reproduced in a cheaper form as The Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation. His works are interesting, racy, and valuable – although his statements of fact cannot always be depended on – containing much of personal incident, related in a fascinating style.Webb, Alfred, A Compendium of Irish Biography: Comprising Sketches of Distinguished Irishmen, Eminent Persons Connected With Ireland By Office or By Their Writings, 1878, M.H. Gill & Son, Dublin. He died at Versailles on 8 April 1834.  In popular culture  The town of Banagher is most likely the source of a phrase that is widely known in many English speaking countries in the world. \\"That beats Banagher!\\" is a common reaction to something extraordinary or to describe something that surpasses everything. The most commonly proposed explanation is that Banagher was entitled to send two members to Parliament following its charter of incorporation in 1628. It was known as an infamous pocket borough where the members were representative of the landed class, or indeed nominated by the local lord, without a vote taking place at all. When a member of the house spoke of a family (or rotten) borough, it was not unusual for someone to reply \\"Well, that beats Banagher!\\" An alternative explanation is suggested, whereby there was an Irish minstrel called Bannagher, who was famous for telling wonderful stories; and a line from W.B. Yeats gives this theory some credence: \\"'Well', says he, 'to gratify them I will. So just a morsel. But Jack, this beats Bannagher.'\\"Yeats, William B. (Editor), 1888, Fairy Tales Of An Irish Peasantry, p.196. There is also an entry in Captain Francis Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue of 1785 which says: \\"He beats Banaghan; an Irish saying of one who tells wonderful stories. Perhaps Banaghan was a minstrel famous for dealing in the marvellous\\". There are numerous uses of the phrase in literature, including Trollope's The Kelly's and the O'Kellys (1848), p. 221; James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (1939), p. 87.31; James Plunkett's Farewell Companions (1977), p. 293 and Edna O'Brien's Down by the River (1996), p. 1\\\\. The phrase has a riposte: \\"And Banagher beats the Devil!\\". The origins of this are more difficult to trace but it does feature in a work by the Irish writer Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne, Messer Marco Polo (1925), p. 25, and it is in common usage in Ireland. Trollope asserted on his arrival in Ireland, \\"I was to live at a place called Banagher on the Shannon which I had heard of because of its having once been conquered, though it had heretofore conquered everything, including the Devil\\".Trollope, Anthony, An Autobiography (1883), Chapter IV. John O'Donovan, in an Ordnance Survey letter for King's County in 1838, attempts to trace the origins of the name Banagher. He states: \\"Of all the words which enter into Irish nomenclature Beannchair seems the most difficult of explanation\\" and goes on to say \\"This name 'beats the Devil.'\\"O'Donovan, John, The Name Banagher – Ordnance Survey Letter, 26 January 1838, OHAS.

Born in Berlin as the daughter of a dancing master at the court of Frederick II of Prussia, she returned to Paris with her parents in 1765. She made her stage debut at the age of twelve as a dancer, but it was as an actress \\"with songs\\" that she made her debut at the Comédie Italienne in 1774 in Grétry's Sylvain. She was at once admitted pensionnaire and in 1775 sociétaire. She became a star of the Comédie Italienne (which became the Opéra-Comique), where she created over 60 roles. She was married to the actor Jean-Henri Gourgaud, who went by the stage name Dugazon. Together they had a child, Gustave Dugazon. The couple soon divorced, but continued to perform at the Comédie Italienne for more than twenty years. The two kinds of parts with which she was especially identified—young mothers and women past their first youth—are still called \\"jeunes dugazons\\" and \\"mères dugazons\\" in French opera. Examples of the first are Jenny in La dame blanche and Berthe de Simiane in Les mousquetaires de la reine; of the second, Marguerite in Le Pré aux clercs and the queen in La part du diable. The type of voice for these roles is a light mezzo-soprano or a dark-colored soprano leggero, and they are generally less demanding technically.

Early life Princess Sibylla. Margaretha was born on 31 October 1934 at Haga Palace in Haga Park, Stockholm as the first child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten and his wife Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha; Paternal granddaughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden and his late wife Princess Margaret of Connaught; Maternal granddaughter of Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his wife Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein; she was born during the reign of her paternal great- grandfather King Gustav V of Sweden. In January 1947, her father died in an airplane crash. Although the eldest child, as a female, she was never in line to the throne according to the Swedish constitution current at the time. She was educated privately at the Haga Palace and then at the Stockholm dressmaking school, Märthaskolan (Martha School). Courtship and marriage Margaretha at her wedding in 1964. In the 1950s Margaretha had a relationship with Robin Douglas-Home, a Scottish aristocrat and the nephew of the future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Alec Douglas-Home. He came to visit her in Sweden, but they never married. There was speculation in the press that this was due to Sibylla forbidding the match, but Margaretha's nanny and confidante Ingrid Björnberg states categorically in her memoirs that the breakup between the two was caused by Margaretha's reluctance to enter into an engagement with Douglas-Home.Björnberg, Ingrid. 1975. Dagbok från Haga och Stockholms slott. Stockholm: Bonniers. p 163 She met her future husband, the businessman John Ambler, ten years her elder, at a dinner party in the United Kingdom in 1963 and their engagement was announced on 28 February 1964. They were married on 30 June 1964, in Gärdslösa Church, on the island of Öland. The Princess wore a wedding gown from the Stockholm couture school, Märtaskolan, where she had previously been a student, and a traditional wedding crown from Öland. The couple settled at Chippinghurst Manor in Oxfordshire. As a result of her unequal marriage, she lost her style of Royal Highness and the King gave her the courtesy title of Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler. Under the Swedish constitution of that time, she, as a woman, and her descendants were not eligible to inherit the throne. Thus they still are not. Ambler and her husband separated in 1994, but never divorced. He died on 31 May 2008. Margaretha and John Ambler's marriage produced three children: Sibylla (b. 1965), Edward (b. 1966), and James (b. 1969). Her daughter married Baron Henning von Dincklage and has two children, of whom Madeleine Charlotte Margaretha von Dincklage is the goddaughter of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and was a bridesmaid at her wedding. Later life In June 1960, Margaretha, with her first cousin Princess Margrethe of Denmark and Princess Astrid of Norway, toured the United States on the occasion of the first transatlantic flight by Scandinavian Airlines. During their visit, the three Scandinavian princesses toured Disneyland and Hollywood and also visited Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles where they met Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, and Elvis Presley.

It is located at the foot of the Curlew Mountains near Lough Key in the north of the county. Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery, the Drumanone Dolmen and the lakes of Lough Arrow and Lough Gara are also close by. , the population of the town was 2,568. History =Early history= On 15 August 1599, the Battle of Curlew Pass between English and Irish forces was fought in the Curlew mountains during the Nine Years' War, between an English force under Sir Conyers Clifford and a native Irish force led by Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill (Red Hugh O'Donnell). The English were ambushed and routed while marching through a pass in the Curlew Mountains, with the English forces suffering heavy casualties. Losses by allied Irish forces were not recorded. The Queen's principal secretary, Sir Robert Cecil, rated this defeat (and the simultaneous defeat of Harrington in Wicklow) as the two heaviest blows suffered by the English in Ireland. Boyle suffered hardship during the famine years (1847–49). The following quote from the novel Woodbrook is one example: A retired herd, Mick Maxwell, speaking to Thompson about his grandfather during the famine, related the following: 'when his grandfather, the only man strong enough, brought fifty and sixty corpses on a barrow, one by one, two miles from Cootehall near his home to the graveyard at Ardcarne'. =19th century= In 1859, Fraser's Ireland described Boyle as including a \\"sessions-house [courthouse], hospitals, schools, the houses and offices for the agents of the Lorton Estate, the police barracks, Church, Methodist chapel, public garden\\". The entry also noted the \\"preservation of the fine ruins of the Abbey of Boyle, one of the most interesting of all our ecclesiastical structures\\", and that the town was \\"one of the principal towns of County Roscommon, and carries on a considerable retail trade in the supply of necessaries for the surrounding district\\".Handbook for travellers in Ireland, descriptive of its scenery, towns, seats, antiquities etc. by James Fraser. (Dublin, 1859), By 1881 Slater's directory reported the town had a dispensary, three banks, three hotels and two newspapers. Boyle also had a post office, 40 grocery shops, 25 pubs (sixteen of which were also groceries), 12 bakeries and an assortment of businesses including fire insurance companies, booksellers, ironmongers and hardware stores, butchers, an auctioneer and churches for both Protestants and Catholics. =20th century= In 1917, Sinn Féin won their first ever seat in parliament for the constituency of Roscommon North, centred on Boyle, with the election of George Noble Plunkett. Plunkett's son, Joseph Mary Plunkett, had been executed by the British in May 1916 for his association with the 1916 Rising. Michael Collins campaigned on the candidate's behalf, as did Michael O'Flanagan, later to become President of Sinn Féin. A plaque on the courthouse, on The Crescent in Boyle, commemorates this. This was the first by-election following the Easter Rising of 1916 and it was crucial that the democratic mandate be obtained by Sinn Féin. Landmarks =King House= King House is an early Georgian mansion located in the centre of the town and was restored in 1989 after some years of neglect, including surviving potential demolition for a car park. The house was built for Sir Henry King (d. 1839) MP, 3rd. Lord Kingston, between 1720 and 1740, whose family were one of the most wealthy in Ireland. It was subsequently home to Edward King MP (1726–97), first earl of Kingston. The design is attributed to William Halfpenny (d. 1755) who was an assistant to Edward Lovett Pearce. The large 'U' shaped house may incorporate walls from an earlier 17th century house which was burnt.Mark Bence-Jones, Burke's Guide to Country Houses It is unusual in Ireland for the 'big house' to be located in the town, as most houses are situated in a demesne. It is also unusual for the floors to be vaulted. Perhaps, according to Rev. Daniel Beaufort, this is a response to the earlier fire. Since 1810, when the King Family moved to Rockingham, the house had been used as a military barracks. Throughout the nineteenth century, it was the home of the Connaught Rangers, adapted as a barracks for twelve officers and 260 soldiers. On the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922, the newly formed Irish National Army took possession of the house and it was renamed Dockery Barracks in honour of a commanding officer killed in Boyle during the Civil War. Roscommon County Council purchased the building in 1987 and began a restoration project in 1989 following years of neglect. Using artisans and local craftsmen who employed traditional techniques and materials, the three floors and basement were restored. Included in the restoration were the main entrance gallery with its tripartite windows and original fireplace, the vaulted ceilings on all floors, and the main salon which is in use again as a venue for recitals and banquets. The other rooms in the house are used for temporary exhibitions and these are open to visitors. In The Kings of Connaught exhibition, visitors are led through a series of tableaux. The displays, ranging all over the floors, cover four main themes: The Kingdom of Connaught - from the earliest recorded times showing the importance of the clans and their kings; The King Family - meet the families who lived in the house from Sir John King who came to Boyle in 1603 to the fascinating accounts of life, both for the family and the staff, at Rockingham Estate (now Lough Key Forest Park); The Restoration - a room left partially restored so that visitors can see the fabric of the house. =Boyle Abbey= Boyle Abbey - restored gatehouse, centre The Cistercian abbey was founded in the 12th century under the patronage of the local ruling family, the MacDermotts and is one of the best preserved in Ireland. It was colonised from Mellifont in 1161. The building of the chancel and the transepts with their side-chapels probably began shortly after this date, though the lancet windows in the east gable were inserted in the 13th century. There is a combination of rounded and pointed arches in the transepts and crossing. The existing large square tower formed part of the church from the beginning, though it was raised in height at a later stage. The five eastern arches of the nave and their supporting pillars were built at the end of the 12th century, and have well-preserved capitals typical of the period. Although built at the same time, the arches of the northern side of the nave are different in type and have differently shaped columns and capitals. The three westernmost arches in the south arcade which have leafed and figured capitals were built after 1205, as was the west wall before the church was finally consecrated in 1218. Nothing remains of the cloister, but on the eastern side, there are two doorways of c.1200, now blocked up. On the west side, there is a two-storey gatehouse, which acts as an interpretative centre. The rest of the buildings surrounding the cloister are largely 16th or 17th century. The Abbey was one of the most important in Connacht, and was invaded by Richard de Burgo, Maurice Fitzgerald, and Justiciar, in 1235. In 1659, the Cromwellians occupied the monastery and did a great deal of destruction. Though damaged during the 17th and 18th centuries when it was used to accommodate a military garrison, Boyle Abbey is one of the best preserved structures of its type, and attracts thousands of visitors per year. A restored gatehouse 16th/17th century vintage houses an exhibition. The Abbey is now a national monument in state care. There is a Sheela na gig hidden above one of the central Romanesque arches. It can be seen from ground level, just at the top of the column, where the arch begins. =Lough Key Forest Park= First Arch Entrance to Rockingham Estate Situated off the N4 is Lough Key Forest Park, a parkland area that has a visitor centre and activity facilities, including Boda Borg, a puzzle solving activity centre which is a Swedish concept originally unique to Sweden but now has locations in Ireland and the United States. The park covers , and was formerly part of the Rockingham estate. This was the seat of the Stafford-King-HarmanEdward Robert King-Harman family who at the end of the nineteenth century held over in north County Roscommon and County Sligo. Rockingham House was designed by John Nash in the early 19th century for the English landlord John King. It had a domed front and 365 windows. Rockingham House was suspiciously destroyed by fire in 1957, after which it was taken over by the Irish Land Commission. Declared as unsafe in 1970, it was demolished. The tunnels to Rockingham House are still accessible to this day. A viewing tower was built in 1973. In the town park, known locally as the Pleasure Grounds behind King House stood a statue of William of Orange. This was pulled down and destroyed by locals in 1945, though the base of the statue remains.http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/personal/YvonneWhelan/HistoricalGeographyArtice.pdf There are several islands on Lough Key. Castle Island is among the better known islands, while Trinity Island contains the ruins of a chapel, linked to the Cistercian monastery in the town. There are two trees growing on the island with interlinked branches, said to mark the graves of Una Bhan Mac Diarmid and Tomás Láidir Mac Coisdealbhaigh, two ill-fated lovers, celebrated in the poem Una Bhan. =Other places of interest= Abbeytown bridge, dated to the 12th Century Abbeytown bridge is a five-arch stone bridge across the Boyle River close to the abbey. Originally built in the late 12th Century, it is one of the oldest surviving stone bridges in Ireland. It has been widened but still carries a 5-ton load. The Drumanone Dolmen (portal tomb) is just west of the town. It is a site of Irish and European historic archaeological significance. This Dolmen located outside Boyle, is an example of a portal dolmen and was built before 2000 BC. The capstone of the tomb, 4.5m x 3m wide, is one of the largest to be seen in Ireland. Drumanone Dolmen has portal stones more than 2m high and a doorstone about 2m high. The capstone is about 4m square and has slipped back to cover the polygonal chamber. The sides of the chamber are each composed of a single stone. It is located in pasture land approximately 300m north of the Boyle River. Transport Boyle railway station opened on 3 December 1862. Boyle lies on the railway line from Dublin to Sligo, and the N4 Dublin-Sligo main road skirts the town. The town is linked to the River Shannon navigation system via the Boyle canal, the Boyle River and Lough Key. The town was once on the N4 national primary road from Dublin to Sligo but was bypassed in 1999. It is connected to the N4 by the R294 regional road (which also connects it to Ballina, County Mayo) and the N61 national secondary road which links Boyle to Athlone via Roscommon. Boyle River Bridge Boyle has a Locallink bus service to Roscommon three times daily. People Boyle is the birthplace of actress Maureen O'Sullivan (Jane in the Tarzan movies), writer Patrick Chapman, Suffragette and women's rights campaigner Margaret Cousins, physician Robert Cryan, and hometown of actor and comedian Chris O'Dowd. O'Dowd filmed segments of his comedy Moone Boy in the town during 2012 and 2013. Neville Knott, interior designer and television personality also lives locally, and orchestral conductor Michael Bowles (1909–1998) grew up in Boyle. The writer John McGahern grew up near Boyle and Boyle is mentioned in several of his books. In his novel The Dark, a scene is played out in the dining room of the former Royal Hotel, overlooking the river. Singer John Reilly lived in Boyle, and is credited by Christy Moore as a source of several well-known folk standards. Other local recording artists include The Grehan Sisters, who hosted Christy Moore's first broadcast as a guest on their BBC radio series. London-born John Carty is an Irish traditional musician and has lived in Boyle since 2003. Arts festival Boyle Arts Festival is a summer event and has been held since 1990 - with the 2016 event billed as the 27th festival.

The building has been named a National Historic Landmark which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As the primary office building of Georgia's government, the capitol houses the offices of the governor, lieutenant governor, and secretary of state on the second floor, chambers in which the General Assembly, consisting of the Georgia State Senate and Georgia House of Representatives, meets annually from January to April. The fourth floor houses visitors' galleries overlooking the legislative chambers and a museum located near the rotunda in which a statue of Miss Freedom caps the dome. History The capitol site was occupied previously by the first Atlanta City Hall. To encourage the state government to relocate the capital city to rapidly growing and industrialized Atlanta from rural Milledgeville, the city donated the site. The first capitol in Louisville no longer stands, while in Augusta and Savannah the legislature met in makeshift facilities, perhaps causing (or caused by) the alternation of those two cities as capital. The legislature also met at other places, including Macon, especially during and just after the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War, which resulting in the capture and burning of Atlanta. Architecture Detail of the dome and statue of Miss Freedom. Like many U.S. state capitols, the Georgia State Capitol is designed to resemble the Neoclassical architectural style of the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C. Former Confederate general Philip Cook. was a member of the commission that oversaw planning and construction of the building. The commission engaged architects Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Franklin Pierce Burnham, of Chicago to design the building and Miles and Horne of Toledo, Ohio for construction. Work completed in March 1889. Sculptor George Crouch executed all the ornamental work on the building. The Capitol faces west on Washington Street. The façade features a four-story portico, with stone pediment, supported by six Corinthian columns set on large stone piers. Georgia's coat of arms, with two figures on each side, is carved on the pediment. The Capitol's interior represents the 19th-century style of its time. It was among the earliest buildings to have elevators, centralized steam heat, and combination gas and electric lights. Classical pilasters and oak paneling are used throughout the building. The floors of the interior are marble from Pickens County, which still produces marble today. The open central rotunda is flanked by two wings, each with a grand staircase and three-story atrium crowned by clerestory windows. The Capitol building has undergone frequent renovations to adapt to the growth and change of government. Originally constructed from terra cotta and covered with tin, in a 1958 renovation the present dome was gilded with native gold leaf from near Dahlonega in Lumpkin County, where the first American gold rush occurred during the 1830s. For this reason, legislative business is often referred to as what is happening \\"under the Gold Dome\\" by media across the state. The statue Miss Freedom has adorned the dome since the building's opening. In 1997, the House and Senate chambers were restored to their 1889 appearance with replicated decoration and color schemes. This included the demolition of damaged plaster, the reinstallation of flat plaster at the dome, columns, and walls, and a decorative painting in the House and Senate Chambers. Georgia Capitol Museum Georgia State Capitol with Turner Field in background The museum within the Capitol, in existence since 1889, houses extensive collections representing the natural and cultural history of Georgia. Native American artifacts, animals, rocks and minerals, and fossils illustrate the diversity of the collections. Removed during restoration or renovation, most of the collection remains in storage. The portraits of governors, statues of famous Georgians, and historic flags from many wars are displayed throughout the Capitol. The portraits of all governors elected since 1850 are there, except for Rufus Bullock.Atlanta Journal Constitution article The Georgia Capitol Museum is a public education institution housed in the Capitol building under the administration of the University of Georgia Libraries. The museum seeks to preserve and interpret the history of the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta, the functions of the government, and the events that have occurred in the Capitol. To accomplish this, the museum collects, preserves, and interprets artifacts relating to the Capitol or associated with the events that have occurred there.  Liberty Plaza  In 2015, the state of Georgia unveiled a large public plaza just east of the Capitol named Liberty Plaza. After its opening, numerous monuments were relocated from other parts of the Capitol grounds to the plaza, including replicas of the Liberty Bell and Statue of Liberty.

The poem is a ballad in fourteen stanzas. Story The poem begins as an old sorcerer departs his workshop, leaving his apprentice with chores to perform. Tired of fetching water by pail, the apprentice enchants a broom to do the work for him, using magic in which he is not fully trained. The floor is soon awash with water, and the apprentice realizes that he cannot stop the broom because he does not know the magic required to do so. The apprentice splits the broom into many pieces with an axe, but each of the pieces becomes a whole broom that takes up a pail and continues fetching water, now at twice the speed. At this increased pace, the entire room quickly begins to flood. When all seems lost, the old sorcerer returns and quickly breaks the spell. The poem concludes with the old sorcerer's statement that only a master should invoke powerful spirits. German culture Goethe's is well known in the German-speaking world. The lines in which the apprentice implores the returning sorcerer to help him with the mess he created have turned into a cliché, especially the line ' (\\"The spirits that I called\\"), a garbled version of one of Goethe's lines ('), which is often used to describe someone who summons help or allies that the individual cannot control, especially in politics.

Folklorist Stith Thompson suggested an Oriental origin for the tale, supposedly India.Thompson, Stith. The Folktale. University of California Press. 1977. p. 69. He also remarked on the popularity of the tale, which has spread throughout Asia and Europe, to Africa and the Americas.Thompson 1977, pp. 69–70  Similar stories  Some versions of the tale differ from Goethe's, and in some versions the sorcerer is angry at the apprentice and in some even expels the apprentice for causing the mess. In other versions, the sorcerer is a bit amused at the apprentice and he simply chides his apprentice about the need to be able to properly control such magic once summoned. The sorcerer's anger with the apprentice, which appears in both the Greek Philopseudes and the film Fantasia, does not appear in Goethe's \\"Der Zauberlehrling\\". =Philopseudes= Lover of Lies () is a short frame story by Lucian, written c. AD 150. The narrator, Tychiades, is visiting the house of a sick and elderly friend, Eucrates, where he has an argument about the reality of the supernatural. Eucrates and several other visitors tell various tales, intended to convince him that supernatural phenomena are real. Each story in turn is either rebutted or ridiculed by Tychiades. Eucrates recounts a tale extremely similar to Goethe's \\"Zauberlehrling\\", which had supposedly happened to him in his youth. It is, indeed, the oldest known variation of this tale type. There are several differences: * The sorcerer is, instead, an Egyptian mystic – a priest of Isis called Pancrates. * Eucrates is not an apprentice, but a companion who eavesdrops on Pancrates casting his spell. * Although a broom is listed as one of the items that can be animated by the spell, Eucrates actually uses a pestle. (Pancrates also sometimes used the bar of a door.) =Other related stories= Similar themes (such as the power of magic or technology turning against the insufficiently wise person invoking it) are found in many traditions and works of art. Linguist Patrice Lajoye argues for a parallel between the Brythonic legend of Taliesin and a Russian fairy tale, Le savoir magique, collected by Alexander Afanasyev\\"Le savoir magique\\" (Contes 193, 194).

Nonfiction books with this title include a travel book, Sorcerer's Apprentice by Tahir Shah. Christopher Bulis wrote the 1995 novel The Sorcerer's Apprentice based on the TV series Doctor Who. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels alluded to Goethe's poem in The Communist Manifesto, comparing modern bourgeois society to \\"the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.\\"Marx, Karl; Engels, Friedrich (1848). The Communist Manifesto. The story was given a literary treatment as a short story, titled The Magician and His Pupil, by one A. Godin, and published in the American magazine Short Stories (1897). The tale was later published as part of a compilation of literary fairy tales named The Diamond Fairy Book.[no known authorship] The Diamond Fairy Book. Illustrations by Frank Cheyne Papé and H. R.

The poem's story is alluded to in several episodes of the fairy-tale drama Once Upon a Time, especially in \\"The Apprentice\\". A variation of the Dukas piece also plays in certain scenes. The apprentice himself is a recurring character, while the sorcerer is shown to be Merlin. =In film= There is a live action film, The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010), featuring a scene based on Goethe's poem (and the Fantasia version), produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and starring Nicolas Cage. =In animation= \\"Top Secret Apprentice\\", a segment of the Tiny Toon Adventures episode broadcast on February 1, 1991, is a modern version of the story, with Buster Bunny messing around with Bugs Bunny's cartoon scenery machine and getting himself into a big heap of trouble. Like the Fantasia segment, there is no dialogue, save for a line by Buster in the end. Fantasia The animated 1940 Disney film Fantasia popularized the story from Goethe's poem, and the 1897 Paul Dukas symphonic poem based on it, in one of eight animated shorts based on classical music. In the piece, which retains the title \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", Mickey Mouse plays the apprentice, and the story follows Goethe's original closely, except that the sorcerer (\\"Yen Sid\\", or Disney backwardsFantasia (2001) DVD commentary) is stern and angry with his apprentice when he saves him. Fantasia popularized Goethe's story to a worldwide audience. The segment proved so popular that it was repeated, in its original form, in the sequel Fantasia 2000. =In video games= The Fantasia version appears in the video game series Kingdom Hearts, with the sorcerer Yen Sid serving as an adviser to the heroes, teaching Mickey, Sora, and Riku the Keyblade skills needed to guard the universe from his former friend Xehanort's plan. A world based on the Fantasia version also appears throughout the series, serving as Yen Sid's home.

The population of the municipality is 393,079 (2014) in an area of 3,648 km².Census 2014, preliminary results The municipality consists of the communes Canjala, Egipto Praia and Lobito. =Portuguese rule= Lobito, was built on a sandspit and reclaimed land, with one of Africa's finest natural harbours, protected by a 5 km long sandspit. The old municipality (concelho) was created in 1843 by the Portuguese administration. The town was also founded in 1843 by order of Maria II of Portugal, and its harbour works were begun in 1903. It wasn't until 1843 that Maria II of Portugal approved the birth of the town, which had by then been known as Catumbela das Ostras (Catumbela of Oysters) Lobito coast. Large developments, however, were not stimulated until the completion in 1928 of the important Benguela Railway, which connected Portuguese Angola with the Belgian Congo. Under Portuguese rule, the port was one of Angola's busiest, exporting agricultural produce from the interior and handling transit trade from the mines of southeastern Belgian Congo and of Northern Rhodesia. Fishing, tourism and services were also important. The carnival in Lobito was also one of the most renowned and popular in Portuguese Angola.LobitoAnosOuro.wmv, a film of the Lobito in Portuguese Angola, before independence from Portugal =Post-independence= After the April 25, 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, Angola was offered independence. Lobito's port activities were highly limited by disruptions to railway transit and high insecurity during the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002). With peace and stability, in the 2000s, Lobito started the process of reconstruction and resumed its path to development.  Climate  Lobito experiences a mild tropical semi- arid climate with few temperature extremes. The winters are extremely dry and warm, while summers are relatively wet and hotter. Transportation Port of Lobito. Lobito is the terminus of the Benguela Railway =Port= The Port of Lobito is located in Lobito Bay on a sandspit approximately 4.8 km long. The port is administered by the Empresa Portuaria do Lobito. The Port of Lobito handles 2,000,000 tonnes of cargo and 370 ships annually, and along with economic development in the Benguala region, port facilities are under expansion. =Airports= Lobito does not have its own airport.

As of the 2016 CSO census, the town had a population of 1,041. Geography Cahersiveen is on the slopes of 376-metre-high Bentee, and on the lower course of the River Ferta. It is the principal settlement of the Iveragh Peninsula, near Valentia Island, and is connected to the Irish road network by the N70 road. History Cahersiveen was where the first shots of the Fenian Rising were fired in 1867. Railway Cahersiveen was served from 1893 to 1960 by the Cahersiveen railway station on the Great Southern and Western Railway. Mentions in Literature Patrick O'Brian's novel \\"Post Captain\\" gives Cahersiveen as the location of the character Stephen Maturin's childhood home in Ireland. :At present two Highlanders were talking slowly to an Irishman in Gaelic ... as he lay there on his stomach to ease his flayed back. 'I follow them best when I do not attend at all,' observed Stephen, 'it is the child in long clothes that understands, myself in Cahirciveen.\\" Places of Interest Royal Irish Constabulary barracks in Cahersiveen The Catholic church in the town is the only one in Ireland named after a layperson, Daniel O'Connell. The decommissioned Royal Irish Constabulary barracks, dating to the 1870s and now a heritage centre, was built in the distinctive ”Schloss” style favoured by its architect, Enoch Trevor Owen. Because of this, it is often claimed to have been mistakingly built from the plans for a British barracks in India – a common myth heard in many Irish garrison towns. The stone forts of Cahergall and Leacanabuaile stand close to each other a short distance from the town. The ruins of Ballycarbery Castle are near to Cahergall and Leacanabuaile. The town falls within the Kerry International Dark-Sky Reserve, the first Gold Tier Reserve in the northern hemisphere and one of only four Gold Tier Dark- Sky Reserves on earth. Education The town's primary school, Scoil Saidbhín, opened in September 2015. This is an amalgamation of Scoil Mhuire, a boys' primary school and St Joseph's Convent, a girls' primary school. There are four primaries in the parish of Cahersiveen, including those in the town's hinterland: Aghatubrid National School, Coars National School, and Foilmore National School. Aghatubrid was established in 1964 and has about 90 students. Coláiste Na Sceilge is the town’s co-educational secondary school. Over 530 pupils attend from all around the Iveragh Peninsula. An t-Aonad Lán-Ghaeilge is the local Gaelscoil - an all Irish-speaking class for 1st to 3rd-year students, where students do all their learning through Irish.

Instead of being built with large standing stones, as is the case with the original Stonehenge, Carhenge is formed from vintage American automobiles, all covered with gray spray paint. Built by Jim Reinders, it was dedicated at the June 1987 summer solstice. In 2006, a visitor center was constructed to serve the site. Structure Carhenge and Stonehenge Carhenge consists of 39 automobiles arranged in a circle measuring about in diameter. Some are held upright in pits deep, trunk end down, and arches have been formed by welding automobiles atop the supporting models. The heelstone is a 1962 Cadillac. Three cars were buried at Carhenge with a sign stating: \\"Here lie three bones of foreign cars. They served our purpose while Detroit slept. Now Detroit is awake and America's great!\\" Carhenge replicates Stonehenge's current dilapidated state, rather than the original stone circle erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC. In addition to the Stonehenge replica, the Carhenge site includes several other artworks created from autos covered with various colors of spray paint. History The Fourd Seasons in the Car Art Reserve Carhenge was conceived in 1987 by Jim Reinders as a memorial to his father. While living in England, he studied the structure of Stonehenge, which helped him to copy the structure's shape, proportions, and size. Other automobile sculptures were subsequently added to the location of Carhenge, which is now known as the Car Art Reserve. Reinders donated the 10-acre site to the Friends of Carhenge. In 2011 the Friends of Carhenge listed the attraction for sale for $300,000. In 2013 the Friends of Carhenge donated the site to the Citizens of Alliance. Carhenge has appeared in film, popular music, television programs and commercials.For example: Film - Omaha, The Movie (1995); Popular music - Steely Dan (album cover, Remastered, The Best of Steely Dan, 1993); P.O.D.

This tool incorporates a lockring spanner for securing a reverse threaded lockring against the sprocket. A fixed-gear bicycle (or fixed-wheel bicycle, commonly known in some places as a fixie) is a bicycle that has a drivetrain with no freewheel mechanism. The freewheel was developed early in the history of bicycle design but the fixed-gear bicycle remained the standard track racing design. More recently the \\"fixie\\" has become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists, offering the advantage of simplicity compared with the standard multi-geared bicycle. Most bicycle hubs incorporate a freewheel to allow the pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to the hub of the back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards. As a general rule, fixed-gear bicycles are single-speed. A derailleur for gear selection would introduce chain slack, which would interfere with braking. Gear selection can, however, be accomplished with the use of an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed- gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brakes at all. Uses A track bicycle or track bike is a form of fixed-gear bicycle optimized for racing at a velodrome or at an outdoor track. Some road racing and club cyclists use a fixed-gear bicycle for training during the winter months, generally using a relatively low gear ratio, believed to help develop a good pedalling style. In the UK until the 1950s it was common for riders to use fixed-gear bicycles for time trials. The 1959 British 25 mile time trial championship was won by Alf Engers with a competition record of 55 minutes 11 seconds, riding an 84-inch fixed-gear bicycle. The fixed-gear was also commonly used, and continues to be used in the end of season hill climb races in the autumn. A typical club men's fixed- gear machine would have been a \\"road/path\\" or \\"road/track\\" cycle. In the era when most riders only had one cycle, the same bike when stripped down and fitted with racing wheels was used for road time trials and track racing, and when fitted with mudguards (fenders) and a bag, it was used for club runs, touring and winter training. By the 1960s, multi-gear derailleurs had become the norm and riding fixed-gear bicycles on the road declined over the next few decades. Recent years have seen renewed interest and increased popularity of fixed-gear cycling. In urban North America and similar areas in other Western cities, fixed-gear bicycles have achieved significant popularity, with the rise of discernible regional aesthetic preferences for finish and design details. Dedicated fixed-gear road bicycles are being produced in greater numbers by established bicycle manufacturers. They are generally low in price and characterized by relaxed road geometry, as opposed to the steep geometry of track bicycles. Fixed-gear bicycles are also used in cycle ball, bike polo and artistic cycling. A fixed-gear bicycle is particularly well suited for track stands, a maneuver in which the bicycle can be held stationary, balanced upright with the rider's feet on the pedals.  Advantages and disadvantages  One of the perceived main attractions of a fixed gear bicycle is low weight. Without the added parts required for a fully geared drive train—derailleurs, shifters, cables, cable carriers, multiple chain rings, freewheel hub, brazed-on mounting lugs—a fixed gear bicycle weighs less than its geared equivalent. The chain itself is subject to less sideways force and will not wear out as fast as on a derailleur system. Also, a fixed gear drivetrain is more mechanically efficient than any other bicycle drivetrain, with the most direct power transfer from rider to the wheels. Thus, a fixed gear requires less energy in any given gear to move than a geared bike in the same gear. In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below). Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel. Selected extract. Riding fixed is considered by some to encourage a more effective pedaling style, which it is claimed translates into greater efficiency and power when used on a bicycle fitted with a freewheel. It allows for the rider to engage in and practice proper cadence, which is the balanced and rhythmic flow of pedaling, enhancing performance for both cyclist and bicycle. When first riding a fixed gear, a cyclist used to a freewheel may try to freewheel, or coast, particularly when approaching corners or obstacles. Since coasting is not possible this can lead to a \\"kick\\" to the trailing leg, and even to loss of control of the bicycle. Riding at high speed around corners can be difficult on a road bike converted into a fixed-gear bicycle, as the pedals can strike the road, resulting in loss of control. Proper track bikes have a higher bottom bracket to compensate for the constantly spinning cranks and largely mitigate this problem. Perhaps the most obvious disadvantage is the lack of multiple gears, and the flexibility in pedaling cadence and resistance made available through gear shifting. Hilly or uneven mountainous terrain with steep grades can be particularly challenging, as the rider cannot adjust the gearing to match the terrain. Brakeless Cyclist riding a fixed gear bike without brakes Many urban fixed-gear riders think brakes are not strictly necessary, and brakeless fixed riding has a cult status in some areas. Brakes and their cables are said to add extra bulk to the simple appearance of a fixed gear bicycle, and they prevent trick manoeuvres that involve spinning the front wheel in a full circle, unless equipped with special 360° freedom \\"detangler\\" system already known on BMX bicycles. Other riders dismiss riding on roads without brakes as an affectation, based on image rather than practicality. Riding without brakes can be dangerous, is prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and may jeopardize the chances of a claim in the event of an accident. =Technique= It is possible to slow down or stop a fixed-gear bike in two ways. The first, most efficient, and least stressful on the rider's body is by resisting the turning cranks as they come up and around, shedding speed with each pedal rotation. The second way, less efficient but more showy, is to bump or skid the rear wheel along the riding surface. Such a move is initiated by shifting the rider's weight slightly forward and pulling up on the pedals using clipless pedals or toe clips and straps. The rider then stops turning the cranks, thus stopping the drivetrain and rear wheel, while applying body weight in opposition to the rotation of the cranks. This causes the rear wheel to skid, and slow the bike. The skid can be held until the bicycle stops or until the rider desires to continue pedaling again at a slower speed. The technique requires practice and is generally considered dangerous when used during cornering. On any bike with only rear wheel braking, the maximum deceleration is significantly lower than on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle brakes, weight is transferred towards the front wheel and away from the rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases rear wheel braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard. =Legality= Austria – Brakeless bicycles are not legal to be driven on public roads. Every bike has to have two independent brakes, several reflectors and front and back lighting when conditions require it. Australia – Bicycles are regarded as vehicles under the Road Rules in every state. A bike is required by law to have at least one functioning brake. Belgium – All bicycles are required to have easy-to-hear bells and working brakes on both wheels. Lights and reflectors are not required on race, mountain, and children's bikes when not used after dark. Other (normal) bikes need reflectors and lights. These lights may be attached to the body and may blink. Brazil – Brazilian Traffic Law, article 105, subheading VI, says that, for bicycles, \\"bells, rear, front, sides and pedals signaling, and rear-view mirror on the left\\" are mandatory. Albeit, nothing is explicitly said about bicycle brakes. Canada – Laws vary by province, and are controlled by highway and traffic acts. In Ontario and in Québec, a rear brake is required, and not having one may subject the rider to a fine. Denmark – All bicycles are required to have working brakes on both wheels, reflectors, and bells. France – A bike must have 2 brakes, 2 lights, numerous reflectors, and a ringer to be approved for road traffic. The laws are rarely enforced, however, and the sight of all kinds of non-officially-approved bikes is common. Germany – All bicycles are required to have working brakes on both wheels, reflectors, and bells. A local court in Bonn accepted that the fixed- gear mechanism was a suitable back brake, but high-profile crackdowns specifically targeted fixed-gear bicycles in Berlin in an attempt to control what police described as a \\"dangerous trend\\". Hungary – All bicycles are required to be equipped with two independent sets of brakes. Front and rear lamps, reflectors and a bell are also required. Italy – All bicycles must have tires, two independent sets of brakes, a bell, a front white lamp, a rear red lamp and reflector, amber reflectors on pedals and sides. The laws however are rarely enforced. Netherlands – All bicycles are required to have an adequate brake system. New Zealand – By law all bicycles must have a minimum of \\"...a good rear brake...\\"–and those made since 1 January 1988 must also have \\"...a good front brake...\\" Poland – All bicycles must have at least one functional brake. Spain – All bicycles are required to have an adequate brake system on front and rear wheels, plus a bell. Sweden – Bicycles are required to have a brake and bell. Additionally, when it's dark outside they are required to have lights facing forward and back as well as reflectors facing forward, back and to the sides. United Kingdom – The Pedal Cycles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1983 require pedal cycles \\"so constructed that one or more of the wheels is incapable of rotating independently of the pedals, be equipped with a braking system operating on the front wheel\\"; riding a fixed-gear bicycle with no front brake on the street is illegal. Following the conviction of UK cyclist Charlie Alliston, who knocked over and killed a woman whilst riding a fixed-gear bicycle with no front brake, the UK Government announced a review of the laws covering \\"dangerous cycling\\" in September 2017. A brake on the rear wheel is only required for free-wheel bicycles. United States – The use of any bike without brakes on public roads is illegal in many places, but the wording is often similar to \\"...must be equipped with a brake that will enable the person operating the cycle to make the braked wheels skid on dry, level and clean pavement...\\" which some have argued allows the use of the legs and gears. The retail sale of bikes without brakes is banned by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission – but with an exception for the \\"track bicycle\\" (...a bicycle designed and intended for sale as a competitive machine having tubular tires, single crank-to-wheel ratio, and no free-wheeling feature between the rear wheel and the crank...). Conversion Many companies sell bicycle frames designed specifically for use with fixed-gear hubs. A fixed- gear or track-bike hub includes special threads for a lockring that tightens in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction compared with the sprocket. This ensures that the sprocket cannot unscrew when the rider \\"backpedals\\" while braking.. A horizontal dropout on a steel frame road bicycle converted to a single-speed. The derailleur hanger (below the axle) and an eyelet (above the axle) for mounting a fender or rack, both integral parts of the original frame, are now unused. For a variety of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert freewheel bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another is to use a hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the sprocket and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the sprocket unscrews while backpedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the sprocket and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or \\"frame whipping\\") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket. =Chain tension= Bicycles with vertical dropouts and no derailleur require some way to adjust chain tension. Most bicycles with horizontal dropouts can be tensioned by moving the wheel forward or backward in the dropouts. Bicycles with vertical dropouts can also be converted with some additional hardware. Possibilities include: * An eccentric hub or bottom bracket allows the off center axle or bottom bracket spindle to pivot and change the chain tension. * A ghost or floating chainring is an additional chainring in the drive train between the driving chainring and sprocket. The top of the chain moves it forward at the same speed that the bottom of the chain moves it backwards, giving the appearance that it is floating in the chain. * A magic gear—the right math can calculate a gearing ratio to fit a taut chain between the rear dropout and bottom bracket. Also, using a chain half link and slightly filing the dropouts to increase the width of the slot increases the chances of finding a magic gear. It is worth noting that the magic gear setup is controversial, due to inevitable chain stretch and subsequent slippage that can lead to serious injury. Separate chain tensioning devices, such as the type that attaches to the dropout (commonly used on single speed mountain bikes) cannot be used because they are damaged as soon as the lower part of the chain becomes tight. =Chainline= Additional adjustments or modification may be needed to ensure a good chainline. The chain should run straight from the chainring to the sprocket, therefore both must be the same distance away from the bicycle's centerline. Matched groupsets of track components are normally designed to give a chainline of 42 mm, but conversions using road or mountain bike cranksets often use more chainline. Some hubs, such as White Industries' ENO, or the British Goldtec track hub, are better suited to this task as they have a chainline greater than standard. Failure to achieve good chainline, at best, leads to a noisy chain and increased wear, and at worst can throw the chain off the sprocket. This can result in rear wheel lockup and a wrecked frame if the chain falls between the rear sprocket and the spokes. Chainline can be adjusted in a number of ways, which may be used in combination with each other: * Obtaining a bottom bracket with a different spindle length, to move the chainring inboard or outboard * Choosing a bottom bracket with two lockrings, which gives fine adjustment of chainring position * Respacing and redishing the rear wheel, where permitted by the hub design * Placing thin spacers under the bottom bracket's right-hand cup (Sturmey-Archer make a suitable 1/16\\" spacer) to move the chainring outboard * Placing thin spacers between the chainring and its stack bolts to move it inboard (if the chainring is on the inside of the crank spider) or outboard (if the ring is on the outside of the spider) * Placing thin spacers between the hub shoulder and the sprocket. This is recommended in the case of a freewheel-threaded hub, which has sufficiently deep threads for this operation. Usually, the rear hub is the best component on which to perform chainline adjustments, especially on threaded hubs. If a track hub is used, it is better to operate on the bottom bracket or - for minor shifts - on the crankset. The same occurs if a flip- flop hub is used, because the chainline should be the same in both sides (freewheel and fixed gear).. =Gear ratio= A commonly used gear ratio that works well in most situations is 2.75:1, which can be implemented with a 44-tooth chainring and a 16-tooth rear sprocket.. Competition There are many forms of competition using a fixed gear bike, most of the competitions being track races. Formal track races most often take place in a velodrome, a circular track that is constructed of concrete or wood and can be indoor or outdoor. Race types such as common scratch races or more complex omnium races take place in these arenas.Track race taking place at the Hellyer Park Velodrome in San Jose, California Keirin is a form of motor-paced cycle racing on a track with fixed-gear bicycle that meet a strict system of standards. Moreover, bike messengers and other urban riders may ride fixed gear bicycles in alleycat races, which are normally held in city streets, including New York City's famous fixed-gear-only race Monstertrack alleycat. Similarly, Wolfpack Hustle began in 2005 simply as ride bringing together fast-paced bicycle riders with the common love for riding and has expanded to an internationally known race series that takes place in Los Angeles, California. The group has managed to receive sponsorships from several well-known companies including Castelli, which is an over-130-year-old Italian cycling clothing brand, helping spread interest and knowledge about the group and the races they hold. In San Francisco, California, Red Bull holds Red Bull Ride + Style events, which bring together both track and freestyle fixed-gear riders from around the world for competitions. There are also events based on messenger racing, such as Mixpression, which has been held nine times in Tokyo. Trick demonstrations have been held since the late 1800s in the US and Europe; while they continued into a competitive form in Europe (artistic cycling), subsequent to the recent widespread popularity and advancement of fixed gear bikes, trick competitions have also now established themselves at venues in the US and Asia. European competitions include solo and team balletic movements on a controlled, flat surface; US and Asian competitions often include \\"park\\" and \\"flatland\\" styles and venues, a la BMX. Other competitions include games of \\"foot down\\" and bike polo. In 2006, Adventures for the Cure made a documentary film on riding across the United States on fixed gears; they repeated this feat as a 4-man team at the 2008 Race Across America. Fixed gear riders sharing the specific philosophy are also seen at the Single Speed World Championships. Maintenance and upkeep Maintaining a fixed gear is relatively easy because it has fewer parts than a geared bicycle. The sprocket should be checked regularly to make sure there is no damage to any teeth and that no object is grinding it as it turns with the rear wheel. The chainring should be checked similarly for any damage. There is an advantage to selecting a number of chainring teeth that is not a round multiple of the number of sprocket teeth (e.g. 3) because this avoids coincidence of the same chainring and sprocket teeth, and tyre contact patch, on each of the rider's power strokes. For riders who perform brakeless skid-stops, it is best to select prime-numbered chainrings (e.g. 41, 43 or 47 teeth) to guarantee that rear tyre wear is spread evenly. It is imperative (for road riding, at least) that the chain is sufficiently tight that it is impossible for it to derail from either the chainring or sprocket. This generally equates to \\"no visible slack\\". A derailed chain can cause a variety of undesirable consequences, such as a locked rear wheel or, worst of all, destruction of the frame if the chain becomes caught around the pedal spindle and pulls the rear triangle forwards. On a fixed-gear bicycle without hand brakes, even a relatively benign derailment means a total loss of braking ability. Tensioning aside, a chain is significantly less likely to derail if the chainline is accurate and the chain is a traditional \\"full bushing\\" type with limited lateral flexibility. Because the difference between a tight and a slack chain equates to only very minor elongation of the links, chain tension should be visually checked at least weekly, especially if the bicycle is ridden in wet or dirty conditions. As with any other bicycle, the chain should be checked making sure the master link is securely latched. The chain can be lubricated monthly for smooth riding. Also, as needed, the brakes should be tightened as they wear and tire condition observed for possible puncture locations. Air pressure in the tires, tire alignment, brake handle placement, and rust should be monitored on a daily basis because they can change very easily during a jarring ride. Subculture =Australia= Until recently, the Australian fixie culture has been small. However, with the strong Australian dollar and cost effective manufacturing and importing from China, Australia has seen many new online stores capitalise on the cheap steel frames commonly imported to the UK and US. Online stores in Australia ship partially-assembled bikes directly to consumers, considerably undercutting prices at typical brick and mortar stores.http://www.singlespeedcycles.com.au/faqs/ = Canada = Fixed gear bikes have become much more popular in Canada within the last couple years. Cities like Toronto, Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal have many fixed gear riders, mostly in the downtown areas. =China= A fixed-gear bike in China. Fluorescent colors are typical, and part of the trend. Around 2012, throughout China, fixed gear bikes became a popular trend among teenagers. The bikes are typically painted in fluorescent colors. =Russia= Fixed Gear Moscow In 2007, a few activists started assembling and riding fixed gear bikes in Moscow.. There had been people riding fixed gear bikes on the street in Moscow prior that time, but it had never developed into any feasible subculture. Appearances of the design in foreign media began increasing around that time, attracting more people to the concept. A Fixed Gear Moscow LiveJournal blog community was formed, which allowed riders to communicate with each other and share ideas for rides. As interest grew, a separate web site was created to host the blog and the forum. Fixed Gear Moscow has organized numerous alleycat races, tournaments, and other events to keep the community growing. Several side projects have been initiated by members of Fixed Gear Moscow and are still in development. Red Bull Fix Boulevard In September 2013 Red Bull and Moscow government organized first race for fixed gear bikes in Moscow city center on the Boulevard ring. Distance that participants had to overcome was about 50 kilometers. The race was repeated in 2014 and is planned for 2015. =Sweden=  Community  The fixed-gear movement is growing in Sweden. A cornerstone of the Swedish fixed-gear society is the Internet-based forum Fixedgear.se, with over 6000 registered members . This makes up for the main meeting ground and discussion forum for Swedish fixed-gear riders and enthusiasts. There are also several bicycle clubs throughout Sweden with a fixed-gear niche. Komet Club Rouler is a club based in Gothenburg, annually arranging Svart Katt and other fixed-gear oriented activities. Svart Katt has been internationally recognized and is considered Sweden's largest alley cat by number of participators, according to Cog Magazine. KCR's equivalent in Malmö is called Pista Malmø,. arranging ”Thursday's rides” every Thursday, for all bikes and riders. Stockholm also has its own informal fixed gear bicycle club, called Fista Sthlm. Popularity factors Several factors contribute to the recent rise in popularity of fixed-gear bicycle. A rider from Stockholm interviewed for an article about the phenomenon notes that riding a bike imparts a feeling of freedom to the rider. One is free to go wherever one wants, whenever one wants. A sense of belonging is also important; as the rider says, \\"all who cycle are my friends\\". Riders unknown to each other commonly greet each other when on bikes. As in many subcultures, this feeling of belonging is a key factor in recruiting and retaining participants.. The fact that many fixie riders ride brakeless in defiance of local law could also be viewed as a contributing factor to its popularity; it provides an outlet for minor rebellion.. =UK= A relatively new movement in the UK, fixie bikes are on the rise. = United States = California A Cinelli MASH Histogram Frame California's fixed gear community stretches throughout the state with groups in all of the major urban areas that come together for riding and racing. Beginning in the north, Sacramento has a rising fixed-gear community as popular bicycle shops such as The Bicycle Business are beginning to carry fixed gear bikes and groups of riders are forming. Moving to the Bay Area, San Francisco and San Jose have well established fixed gear communities who host several established races and community rides. Companies such as Chrome Industries, who make bags and apparel catered toward bike messengers and urban cyclists, have been able to rise to worldwide prominence thanks to San Francisco and California's biking community. Also, stores such as MASH SF based in San Francisco, and IMINUSD based in San Jose accommodate fixed-gear cyclist specifically with riding gear, parts, and a center for the fixed-gear riding community in their respective cities. MASH SF collaborates with the Italian bicycle manufacturing company, Cinelli, to make several fixed gear bike framesets, including what is known as the Cinelli MASH Histogram. Furthermore, Macaframa is a group of riders from San Francisco who release movies dedicated to fixed-gear riding that encompass the fast-paced lifestyle that comes along with riding fixed. Lastly, Southern California is home to a very large fixed community, particularly in the greater Los Angeles area. Los Angeles based TRAFIK is a group dedicated to global fixed gear culture, as they boast the motto “TRAFIK is Global Fixed Gear Culture” and work towards bringing the fixed-gear movement to a worldwide audience.  Circus bikes  A circus performer standing on a fixed-gear bicycle A fixed gear bike is also used in the circus arts (artistic cycling). When the saddle and handlebars are at the same height, an acrobat can stand on the handlebars and saddle and perform acrobatic exercises, sometimes involving multiple people, while continuing to circle the circus ring. It can be found as a niche sport in many countries. In addition to better speed control, the use of a fixed gear bike allows the artist to ride the bike backwards and/or only on the back wheel. In popular culture The 2012 film Premium Rush uses a \\"fixie\\" as a running plot device. Wilee, the lead character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, works as a bike messenger in Manhattan, and his fellow riders rib him about his enthusiasm for his fixed-gear steel-frame bike with no brakes. He avoids one confrontation by pedaling the bicycle backward, and he successfully weaves through dangerous traffic, but he also gets into accidents because the fixed- gear style abets his avidity for speed. Wilee says, \\"I like to ride. Fixed gear. No brakes. Can't stop. Don't want to, either.\\" The 2018 Tomb Raider film starts with a fixies race in London. In its early years the Tour de France only ever featured bikes with a fixed gear. Once coasting and gears were developed, the Tour founder Henri Desgrange is quoted to have said: “Come on, fellows! Let’s say that the test was a fine demonstration – for our grandparents! As for me: Give me a fixed gear.”https://www.bikecitizens.net/fixie-and-hipsters/ See also *Artistic cycling *Flip-flop hub *List of bicycle parts * Outline of cycling *Track bicycle *Keirin References Cycling in Sweden Cycle types ","title":"Fixed-gear bicycle"},{"id":"996423","text":"Inhassoro is a small fishing port in Inhassoro District of Inhambane Province in Mozambique.

As a warrior, he fought in the Cherokee–American wars against American frontiersmen. Later, Major Ridge led the Cherokee in alliances with General Andrew Jackson and the United States in the Creek and Seminole Wars. Along with Charles R. Hicks and James Vann, Ridge was part of the \\"Cherokee triumvirate,\\" a group of younger chiefs in the early nineteenth century Cherokee Nation who supported acculturation and other changes in how the people dealt with the United States. All were of mixed race and had some exposure to European-American culture, but identified as Cherokee. Ridge became a wealthy planter, slave owner and ferryman. Under increasing pressure for removal from the federal government, Ridge and others of the Treaty Party signed the controversial Treaty of New Echota of 1835. They believed removal was inevitable and tried to protect Cherokee rights. It required the Cherokee to cede their remaining lands in the Southeast to the US and relocate to the Indian Territory. Opponents protested to the US government and negotiated a new treaty the following year, but were still forced to accept removal. Blamed for the Trail of Tears tragedy and the loss of land, Ridge was assassinated in 1839 by members of the Ross faction who believed they were acting in accordance with the Cherokee Blood Law and who saw the murder as revenge for the Trail of Tears. Background =Early life= Ridge was born about 1772 into the Deer clan of his mother, Oganotota (O-go- nuh-to-tua), a Scots-Cherokee woman, in the Cherokee town of Great Hiwassee, along the Hiwassee River (an area later part of Tennessee).Thurman Wilkins, Cherokee Tragedy: The Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People, University of Oklahoma Press, 1989, p. 7 His father was believed to be full-blood Cherokee. Ridge's maternal grandfather was a Scots trader who returned to Europe and left a Cherokee wife and daughter behind in America.Langguth, p. 29. Ridge was the third son born, but the first to survive to adulthood. He had two younger brothers, one of whom became known as David Uwatie (or Watie). From his early years, Ridge was taught patience and self-denial, and to endure fatigue. On reaching the proper age, he was initiated as a warrior. The Cherokee believed that a man's achievements as a warrior were a sign of his spiritual power and part of his leadership. Until the end of the Cherokee – American wars, the young man was known as Nunnehidihi, meaning \\"He Who Slays The Enemy In His Path\\" or \\"The Pathkiller\\" (not the same as another chief of the same name). Later Ridge was named Ganundalegi (other spellings include Ca- Nun-Tah-Cla-Kee, Ca-Nun-Ta-Cla-Gee, and Ka-Nun-Tah-Kla-Gee), meaning \\"The Man Who Walks On The Mountain Top Ridge.\\" White men knew him by the simplified English name, \\"The Ridge\\".Hicks, p. 19 =Marriage and family= In 1792, Ridge married Sehoya, also known as Suzannah Catherine Wickett, a mixed-blood Cherokee of the Wild Potato clan.Johansen, Bruce Elliot and Barry Pritzker. Encyclopedia of American Indian History, Volume 2. ABC-CLIO, 2007. Her name was also spelled Sehoyah; she was the daughter of Kate Parris and Ar-tah-ku- ni-sti-sky (\\"Wickett\\"). The couple had several children, including John Ridge. They sent him in 1819 as a young man to Cornwall, Connecticut to be educated in European-American classical studies at the Foreign Mission School. After the Cherokee–American wars, the Ridges lived in Oothcaloga, near what developed as the modern city of Calhoun, Georgia. About 1819, they moved near the Cherokee town of Chatuga (modern-day Rome) at the confluence of the Oostanaula and Etowah rivers, which forms the Coosa River. Ridge acquired 223 acres that fronted on the Oostanaula River, upstream of the confluence. Starting with a log dogtrot house on the property, Ridge expanded the house to a two-story white frame house with extensions on either end. and Ridge used enslaved African Americans to work the cotton fields on his plantation. Nearby was the home and plantation of Ridge's protégé, John Ross. Ridge had no formal education and could neither read nor write. But he was known as a noted orator and dynamic speaker. Ridge appreciated the value of education and believed that the Cherokee must learn to communicate with European Americans and to understand their ways in order to survive as a nation. He sent his son John to a mission boarding school at Springhill. =Young warrior= Besides small raids and other actions, Nunnehidihi took part in the attack on Gillespie's Station and in Watts' raids in the winter of 1788–1789; the attack on Buchanan's Station in 1792; the campaign against the settlements of Upper East Tennessee in 1793 (that resulted in the massacre and destruction of Cavett's Station); and the so-called \\"Battle of Hightower\\" at Etowah. (Before the 1793 campaigns, he had taken part in a horse-stealing raid against the Holston River settlements, where two pioneers were killed.) At age 21, Nunnehidihi was chosen as a member of the Cherokee Council. He proved a valuable counselor, and at the second session proposed many useful laws. After the Cherokee–American wars, he changed his name to Ganundalegi, which in English was translated as \\"He Who Walks On The Ridge\\". With the massacre at Cavett's Station, a personal feud developed between The Ridge and Chief Doublehead. The latter had promised to spare the post if the three white men who lived there surrendered. But, after the men agreed to surrender, Doublehead changed his mind and ordered that all the inhabitants be killed, including thirteen women and children. This act disgusted The Ridge, who felt it dishonored the tribe.Langguth, p. 31. Frontiersmen pursued Ridge's band, catching them at Coyatee (near the mouth of the Little Tennessee River). They killed several leading Chickamauga Cherokee and wounded others, including Hanging Maw, the chief headman of the Overhill Towns. In 1807, Doublehead was bribed by white speculators to cede some Cherokee communal land without approval by the Cherokee National Council. The Council determined this to be a capital crime against the nation, and directed Ridge, James Vann, and Alexander Sanders to execute Doublehead. (Vann became too drunk to participate. The other two men used guns, knives, and a tomahawk to kill the old chief on August 9, 1807 at the Hiwassee Garrison in Tennessee).Hicks, pp. 20-28 Shortly before the War of 1812, Shawnee chief Tecumseh and his brother, Tenskawatawa (also called \\"The Prophet\\"), came south to recruit other tribes to unite and together prevent the sale of their lands to white immigrants. Tecumseh urged his listeners to reject subservience to the United States, reject the white man's agrarian lifestyle, return to their traditional lifestyles and take up weapons to defend their land. Ridge attended as an observer when Tecumseh spoke to the Creek living nearby. Ridge allegedly confronted Tecumseh after the meeting and warned that he would kill Tecumseh if he tried to spread that message to the Cherokee.Langguth, p. 32. =Later life= Ridge acquired the title \\"Major\\" in 1814, during his service leading the Cherokee alongside the United States General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend during the Creek War against the Red Sticks. This was a civil war within the Creek Nation between the Upper Towns and Lower Towns, who differed in their interaction with European Americans and hold on tradition. Ridge had joined the campaign as an unofficial militia lieutenant. (Jackson was involved with the larger War of 1812 against Great Britain.) Ridge used Major as his first name for the rest of his life.Langguth, p. 34. He also served with Jackson in the First Seminole War in 1818, leading Cherokee warriors on behalf of the US government against the Seminole Indians. His war achievements added to his stature among the Cherokee. After the war, Ridge moved his family to the Cherokee town of Head of Coosa (present-day Rome, Georgia). He developed a plantation, owned 30 African-American slaves as laborers, and became a wealthy planter. The plantation consisted of nearly three hundred cleared acres whose main cash crops were corn, tobacco and cotton. He built his house. Major Ridge also developed and owned a profitable ferry that carried wagons and their teams across the Oostanuaula River. As another business, Ridge founded a trading post in partnership with George Lavender, a white man; the post provided staples and luxury European-American goods such as calico and silk fabrics.Langguth, p.31. In 1816, Andrew Jackson tried to get the Chickasaw and Cherokee to sell their lands in the Southeast and move west of the Mississippi River. He was rebuffed by most of the Cherokee chiefs at a council in Mississippi. They told him that he must meet with Chief Pathkiller at a Cherokee council in Turkeytown.Hicks, p. 89 Cherokee removal Ridge had long opposed U.S. government proposals for the Cherokee to sell their lands and remove to the West. But, Georgia efforts to suppress the Cherokee government and the pressure of rapidly expanding European-American settlements caused him to change his mind. Advised by his son John Ridge, Major Ridge came to believe the best way to preserve the Cherokee Nation was to get good terms from the U.S. government and preserve their rights in Indian Territory. On December 29, 1835, Ridge made his mark on the Treaty of New Echota, which ceded the remainder of Cherokee tribal land east of the Mississippi River for land in Indian Territory, to be supplemented by the payment of annuities for a period of time, plus support from the government in terms of supplies, tools and food. The tribe was bitterly divided over this decision. Reportedly, Ridge said as he finished, \\"I have signed my death warrant.\\"Hicks, p. 282 The National Party of Chief John Ross and a majority of the Cherokee National Council rejected the treaty, but it was ratified by the US Senate. The next year Ross negotiated changes with the US government, but essentially Cherokee removal was confirmed. Ridge, his family, and many other Cherokee emigrate to the West in March 1837. The treaty had been signed in December 1835 and was amended and ratified in March 1836. Georgia put Cherokee lands in a lottery and auctioned them off before the Cherokee removal date; settlers started arriving and squatting on Cherokee-occupied land. Georgia supported the settlers against the Cherokee. After 1838, the US government forcibly rounded up the remaining Cherokee (along with their slaves) on tribal lands. They were the last people to make the journey that became known as the \\"Trail of Tears,\\" during which nearly 4,000 Cherokee died. Accompanied by his wife, daughter, and one of son John's children, Major Ridge traveled by flatboat and steamer to a place in Indian Territory called Honey Creek, near the Arkansas-Missouri Border. The land Ridge had chosen was fifty miles from the territory assigned to the Cherokee. He no longer wished to live among his people. His son John Ridge and Major Ridge's cousin Elias Boudinot followed six months later.Hicks, pp. 294-295 Execution In the West, the Ross faction blamed Ridge and the other signers of the Treaty of New Echota for the 4,000 deaths along the trail in the Removal as well as the loss of communal lands. In June 1839, Major Ridge, his son John, and nephew Elias Boudinot, were executed in accordance with the Cherokee Blood Law by Cherokee of the Ross faction. They tried to kill Elias' brother Stand Watie, but he survived. Other Treaty Party members were later killed, starting a wave of violence within the nation.Wilkins, pp. 329-339 Among Ridge's killers was Bird Doublehead. Ridge had killed his father Chief Doublehead under orders by the National Council. Another of his killers was James Foreman, Bird's half-brother. In 1842 Stand Watie, Ridge's nephew, killed Foreman. In 1845 opponents killed his younger brother, Thomas Watie. The cycle of retaliatory violence within the Cherokee resulted in the deaths of all the other Watie family males of that generation. Stand Watie survived the violence of the 1840s, when the Cherokee conflict descended into virtual civil war. In the 1850s, Watie was tried in Arkansas for Foreman's murder but was acquitted on grounds of self-defense; he was defended by his brother Elias' son, Elias Cornelius Boudinot. Tribal divisions were exacerbated by the outbreak of the American Civil War. Many Cherokee supported the Confederacy, despite the Southern governments having pushed them out. The Confederacy officials now suggested they would recognize an independent Indian state if successful in creating an independent nation. Stand Watie served as Principal Chief (1862-1866) of the pro-Confederate Cherokee after Ross and many Union- supporters withdrew to another location. He served as a Confederate general and was the last to surrender to Union troops.\\"The Civil War's final surrender.\\" Tory Altman. Smithsonian. June 22, 2015. Accessed January 30, 2016.

The town and environs had a population of 5,032 according to the 2016 census, making it the second- largest town in the county. Carrickmacross is a market town which developed around a castle built by the Earl of Essex in 1630. The town won the European Entente Florale Silver Medal Award in 1998. The local Gaelic football and hurling club is Carrickmacross Emmets. The local soccer team is Carrick Rovers. History =Foundation and development= Carrickmacross is a market town which developed around a castle built by the Earl of Essex in 1630. The Convent of St Louis now stands on the original castle site, as the castle itself was destroyed in the late 17th century during the Williamite Wars. The town developed further as a market town during the 18th century, and a number of large municipal and religious buildings were built to serve the growing population during the 19th century. The town experienced population decline in mid- to late-19th century, during the Great Famine, with the population decreasing from 2,063 in 1861 to 1,779 inhabitants by 1891. The town's Poor Law Union Workhouse and Fever Hospital were built in this period - the latter later becoming the offices of the Urban District Council which was originally formed in 1899. =Built heritage= Among the historic buildings in the town is the Roman Catholic church which was completed in 1866 and is dedicated to Saint Joseph. It contains ten stained-glass windows which were designed by the artist Harry Clarke in 1925. The town's Church of Ireland church, dedicated to Saint Finbarr, is older, and was built c.1770 before being remodelled c.1845. Magheross Church, located on the outskirts of the town, is also of historical interest, and originally dates from c.1550. Other notable buildings include the Carrickmacross Courthouse (built in 1837) and the restored Poor Law Union Workhouse (built in 1841). The grave of Patrick Byrne (1794–1863), the last major exponent of the Gaelic harp and the first Irish traditional musician ever photographed, is in the area. =Lacemaking= The town is known for the lace bearing its name. Carrickmacross lace is worked in an individual style, devised by Mrs Grey Porter, wife of the rector of Donaghmoyne, who introduced it in 1820. When she left the district the teaching of Carrickmacross lacemaking was continued by Miss Reid of Rahans, but it was only after the Great Famine in 1846, when a lace school was set up by the managers of the Bath and Shirley estates at Carrickmacross as a means of helping their starving tenants, that the lace became known and found sales. Subsequently, the lacemaking declined, but in the last decade of the 19th century the Sisters of St Louis founded their own lace school to revive the craft, and this was quite profitable for several years. Although the outbreak of the 1914–18 war marked the virtual end of commercial production of hand- made lace in Europe, the lace school kept the technique alive throughout most of the 20th century. In 1984 the St Louis Sisters assisted in the formation of the Carrickmacross Lace Co-operative, which maintains the tradition to this day. =Luftwaffe attack= Although Ireland was neutral during World War Two, there were some incidents during the period. On 20 December 1940, as well as two bombs falling on Sandycove in Dublin, two more fell on Shantonagh near Carrickmacross, causing minor damage to house property.The day they bombed Dublin Transport Carrickmacross railway station opened on 31 July 1886, closed for passenger traffic on 10 March 1947, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960. Education St. Joseph's RC Church, Carrickmacross =Primary schools= There are three primary schools in Carrickmacross. St. Josephs Boys National School, situated near St. Macartans Villas, is an all- boys national school which was previously run by the Patrician Brothers. Bunscoil Lughaidh Naofa, which is in Cloughvalley, is an all-girls school, was run by the St. Louis nuns who came to Carrickmacross in 1888. Scoil Rois is a Gaelscoil (an Irish language-medium school) in Carrickmacross. It is a mixed school that, having moved from the Convent Avenue, now occupies newer premises built across from Bunscoil Lughaidh Naofa. =Secondary schools= The Patrician High School (or PHS) is one of three secondary schools in Carrickmacross. It was set up by the Patrician Brothers, and was previously situated next to the Church on O'Neills street; that building is now the Scout Hall. It moved to Rockdaniel Road in 1970, and a new extension was opened in 2007. As of 2015 it had approximately 500 pupils enrolled. Inver College, called the TEC by students and townspeople due to its being a technological school, is a mixed school situated on the Castleblayney Road. As of 2017, it had approximately 300 students enrolled. Inver College won the U16 VEC GAA County Championship for the second consecutive year in January 2011. St. Louis Convent is an all-girls secondary school set up by the St. Louis nuns in the 19th century. There were approximately 570 pupils enrolled in the school as of 2017. The school was set up in honour of St. Louis (Louis IX of France). The motto of the school is Ut Sint Unum, Latin for 'that they may be one'. The school is situated on the Convent Avenue. Town twinning Carrickmacross is twinned with the commune of Carhaix, Brittany, in France. Governance and politics Carrickmacross town council elects 9 members and is responsible for the provision of local services. At the last local elections in 2009 three members were elected from Fine Gael and two each from Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. It forms part of the five-seat Carrickmacross Local Electoral Area for elections for Monaghan County Council. In February 2010, the town council voted 5:4 to remove a page signed by the Israeli ambassador from the town's visitors' book in response to the illegal use of Irish passports by agents of Mossad in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh.

Like many mines in the area, the property probably started as a placer mine during the Georgia Gold Rush. Once the placer deposits had been exhausted, an open pit gold mine was established in 1847 and commercial operations continued until the early 1980s. A small stamp mill was also established here. Much of the gold used for the gold leaf dome of the Georgia State Capitol was mined at this mine, which was among the most productive mines in the Georgia Gold Belt. The mine is located just north of the site of the Consolidated Mine, which is itself north of the Calhoun Mine. In 1969, the owners of Crisson Mine opened to the public to allow tourists to pan for gold. The ore sold for panning is still crushed by the stamp mill, which is now well over 100 years old.

It was formerly called the Charles River between its source and the mouth of the Wood River near Bradford, Rhode Island. On April 20, 2006, an Atlantic white-sided dolphin swam several miles up the river to Westerly, Rhode Island from Little Narragansett Bay at the east end of Fishers Island Sound. It spent several hours at Westerly- Pawcatuck, near the bridge connecting Rhode Island and Connecticut, while several hundred spectators gathered to see it. According to the Mystic Aquarium, the dolphin may have become separated from its pod at sea and had been searching for it.

It is located at the intersection of the N2, N52, and N33 roads. The town shows evidence of development from the thirteenth century onward but as a result the continued development of the town since then much of the fabric of the medieval town has been removed. Ardee is on the banks of the River Dee and is equidistant between the county's two biggest towns - approximately 20 km (12 mi) from Dundalk and Drogheda, while it is also close to Slane and Carrickmacross. In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, the population of Ardee increased by approximately 30%, from 3,791 to 4,928 inhabitants. History = Origins = Originally called Atherdee, the towns name is from (the Ford of Ferdia) which itself is derived from the fabled four-day battle between Cúchulainn and Ferdia, for the defense of Ulster from Queen Maeve of Connacht. It is said Ferdia fell after four days of battle, and is buried on the southern banks of the river alongside the Riverside Walk. A depiction of the pair is located on Bridge Street in the town as a bronze statue.Ross. Noel (2011). \\"The Walled Town of Ardee: Selected Extracts.\\" Journal of the County Louth Archaeological and Historical Society, 27 339-365. - via JSTOR Ardee is an example of a medieval \\"walled town\\", a number of which can be found across Ireland. The town itself is situated in the southern part of the ancient territory known as the Plain of Muirheimhne. The town lies along the 15th century Pale frontier between Dundalk and Kells. The town comprises the townlands or townparks – the greater portion of which is made up of Ardee bog, and a small portion of Dawson's Demesne, which takes in the southeastern quadrant of the town on the northern side of the River Dee. = Smith schools = A philanthropic trust founded by Erasmus Smith in the 17th century funded the establishment of a boys' school in 1806 and a girls' school in 1817. Both Protestant and Catholic children were allowed to attend. At the time there were other schools but in 1824 they became the sole schools in the area. The Smith schools amalgamated into a combined-sex establishment by 1858, by which time the National School movement was leading to the creation of denominational schools there. The school remained a non-denominational institute but the school decreased in numbers and in 1868 had a roll of only 16 Protestant boys. It was fully integrated into the National School system in 1954, when it became known as Saint Mary's Church of Ireland National School.  Administration  Ardee lies in the local council area of Louth County Council. Members of the council are elected from five electoral areas in the county. Ardee lies in the Ardee electoral area, which returns six of the council's 29 members. Ardee is in the Roman Catholic parish of Ardee & Collon which lies in the Archdiocese of Armagh in the ecclesiastical province of Armagh.  Media  Newspapers include the Mid-Louth Independent, a regional edition of the Drogheda Independent newspaper, which is published weekly. It is distributed and sold in Ardee, Collon, Dunleer and Tallanstown. The Dundalk Democrat is the regional edition of the weekly newspaper, which covers Ardee and its surrounds. LMFM Radio is the local radio station for the North East covering Ardee as well as the rest of Louth, Meath, Monaghan and North Dublin.  Transport  Ardee Railway station, previously serving the town, was linked to the main Belfast-Dublin railway line at Dromin Junction station, along a five mile long (8 km) branch line. The Ardee Railway station opened on 1 August, 1896 and passenger services ended on 3 June, 1934. The line continued as a freight service until finally closed on 3 November, 1976, serving the local fertiliser factory, sugar beet and livestock transport. The trackbed was lifted in the late 1980s, and much of the short route is now a designated walkway. Ardee's transport network consists of the N2, which runs directly through the town, and the M1 motorway, which is connected to Ardee through a bypass/linkroad.  Culture  = Built heritage =  Ardee Castle  Ardee Castle Ardee's identity of a walled town is further enhanced by surviving medieval buildings and some of the features that survive within the town, including the intact medieval street pattern and the castle itself. Previously known as St. Leger's Castle, Ardee Castle is the largest fortified medieval tower house in Ireland. Built circa 15th century, the castle was used as a prison during the 17th and 18th centuries, before going on to become Ardee's district courthouse until June 2006 when a specialised facility was built as it \\"could no longer meet the official needs of court users in the 21st century\\".  Chantry College  280x280px Founded a short time prior to 1487, it consists of a gabled tower, four storeys in height, which has an adjoining two-storey hall to the north. Although the Chantry College was defensible, it is not classified as a fortified town house. It was an ecclesiastical building, and as such differs from the two castles in the town. The small section of the original building shares similarities to another surviving building in Howth, Dublin. 347x347px  Hatch's Castle  A gift given to the Hatch family by Oliver Cromwell, Hatch's Castle is still in use as a private family home and as a Bed and Breakfast. A late 14th century urban fortified house, it is the older of the town's two castles. It was modernised in the 19th century with large windows placed in the east and west faces. The southern corner has a projecting turret which houses a spiral stairway to roof level.  Jumping Church of Kildemock  The west gable that \\"jumped\\" The Jumping Church of Kildemock (also known as Millockstown Church) is a tourist attraction in Ardee which claims to be an \\"unsolved mystery\\". The site was restored in 1954 after the site was cleared of debris by archaeologists the previous year. Legend surrounding the church states that a non-Christian was believed to be buried inside the church walls in 1715, and that the church \\"jumped\\" later that night to leave his remains outside of the sacred grounds. A plaque on the site reads: > \\"Is léir ar an bhfalla seo gur aisbrigh sé tuairm 3 troithe isteach óna > bhonn. Tá trácht i gcúntais i 1715 ar stoirm mhór sa bhliain sin o'ardaigh > an falla as a ionad ach do reir seanchais na ndaoine is amhlaidh a léim an > falla isteach thar uaigh dhuine a cuireadh faoi choinneallbhádh.\\" and is accompanied by a translation in English: > \\"This wall by its pitch, tilt and position can be seen to have moved three > feet from its foundation. Contemporary accounts mention a severe storm in > 1715 when the wall was lifted and deposited as it now stands but local > tradition states that the wall jumped inwards to exclude the grave of an > excommunicated person.\\" All that remains at Kildemock today is a small ruin, containing the wall that for a reason unknown moved three feet. It is believed to be caused by a storm but this cannot be confirmed.280x280px  Nativity of our Lady Church  The church is a detached multi-bay Roman Catholic church, built 1974. The church replaced a previously existing Catholic church built 1829, which is now a furniture store. It is a post-Vatican II church, designed by Guy Moloney and Associates. The leaded light clerestory windows introduce colour to what is otherwise a plain interior.  Saint Mary's Church  Built in the early 19th century on the site of an earlier church, St Mary's Church was substantially repaired and rebuilt preserving portions of a tower belong to a previous church. This site has been the focus of Christian worship for at least eight hundred years. = Arts and festivals = Cuchulainn and Ferdia Statue Founded in 1860, Ardee Concert Band is the third oldest concert band in Ireland. Ardee has an annual St Patrick's Parade on March 17. The first parade began in Ardee in 1962 and has run almost every year since then, exceptions include 2001's cancelation due to the foot-and-mouth crisis, 2020's cancellation due to COVID-19. Since 2004, the town has hosted the Ardee Baroque Festival, which includes performances by the Irish Baroque Orchestra and others.left The \\"Turfman Festival\\", launched in Ardee in 2009, was held on the August bank holiday weekend and included a number of community events and a Festival Queen competition.

He was considered the finest Hamlet of the Victorian era and one of the finest actors of his time, despite his dislike of the job and his lifelong belief that he was temperamentally unsuited to acting. Early life Forbes-Robertson as Caesar Born in London, he was the eldest of the eleven children of John Forbes- Robertson, a theatre critic and journalist from Aberdeen, and his wife Frances. One of his sisters, Frances (1866–1956), and three of his brothers, Ian Forbes-Robertson (1859–1936), Norman Forbes-Robertson (1858–1932) and John Kelt (Eric Forbes-Robertson) (1865–1935), also became actors.

He was educated at Charterhouse. Originally intending to become an artist, he trained for three years at the Royal Academy. He began a theatrical career, out of a desire to be self-supporting, when the dramatist William Gorman Wills, who had seen him in private theatricals, offered him a role in his play Mary Queen of Scots. His many performances led him into, among other things, travel to the U.S., and work with Sir Henry Irving. He was hailed as one of the most individual and refined of English actors. He was a personal friend of the Duke of Sutherland and his family and often stayed with them at Trentham Hall; he is known to have recommended to them various writers and musicians in dire need of assistance. Hamlet at the grave site Forbes- Robertson first came to prominence playing second leads to Henry Irving before making his mark in the role of Hamlet. One of his early successes was in W. S. Gilbert's Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith. In 1882, he starred with Lottie Venne and Marion Terry in G. W. Godfrey's comedy The Parvenu at the Court Theatre.Culme, John.

Forbes-Robertson's other notable roles were Romeo, Othello, Leontes in The Winter's Tale, and the leading role in The Passing of the Third Floor Back; performed on Broadway 1908 (filmed in 1916, released 1918). He did not play Hamlet until he was 44 years old, but after his success in the part he continued playing it until 1916, including a surviving silent film (1913).

Forbes- Robertson acted in plays with the actress Mary Anderson in the 1880s. He became smitten with her, fell in love with her and asked her hand in marriage. She kindly turned him down though they remained friends. Later he and actress Beatrice Campbell enjoyed a brief affair during the time she starred with him in a series of Shakespearean plays in the mid-1890s. Marriage and family Memorial plaque, Bedford Square, London In 1900, at age 47, he married American-born actress Gertrude Elliott (1874–1950), sister of Maxine Elliott, with whom he had four daughters. Their first daughter was Maxine Forbes- Robertson known as 'Blossom',\\"Biography of Blossom Miles.\\" \\"Museum of Berkshire Aviation\\" Retrieved:25 April2012. who married the aircraft designer F. G. Miles and became a director and designer of the Miles Aircraft company. She previously married Inigo Freeman-Thomas, 2nd Marquess of Willingdon, in 1924; they divorced in 1932. Their second daughter Jean Forbes-Robertson became an accomplished actress. Their third daughter was Chloe Forbes- Robertson (1909–1947), an artist. Diana Forbes-Robertson (1914–1988), their fourth daughter, was a writer who later wrote a biography of her aunt Maxine Elliott. Through his daughter Jean he is the grandfather of actress Joanna Van Gyseghem. Johnston Forbes-Robertson was knighted in 1913 at the age of 60, at which point he retired briefly from acting.Peter Thomson, \\"Forbes-Robertson, Johnston\\" in The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, ed. Martin Banham, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 383). He returned to the stage, however, for his first farewell tour of the US in 1914–1915. It began in with a three month run in New York, then traveled the country using eight rail road freight cars to carry the sets, costumes and properties for eight shows; and two passenger cars for the actors and personnel.Forbes-Robertson, Johnston. A Player Under Three Reigns. Boston, Little Brown & Company. 1925. p. 297-320. His last appearance was at the Sanders Theatre in Boston with a performance of Hamlet.\\"Forbes-Robertson Will Act Hamlet in Sanders: Noted Actor to Make Farewell Appearance on American Stage Here\\", The Harvard Crimson 9 December 1915. Web. The second farewell tour followed; it traveled to 122 towns, beginning in Detroit in October 1915, with four plays. The tour traveled to Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco — where he learned of the birth of his fourth daughter, Diana. At this point they decided to reduce the itinerary to only three plays, by eliminating Caesar and Cleopatra from the repertoire. In his autobiography he describes how, on one early morning, the set, including the sphinx, was piled onto a beach and set on fire. The tour continued into Canada. His last performance as both Hamlet and as an actor, was in 1916 at the Sheldon Lecture Theatre of the University of Harvard, the stage of which had been made to replicate the stage of the Elizabethan Fortune Theatre especially for the Forbes-Robertson’s performance.Forbes-Robertson, Johnston.

Conceived by the commander-in-chief of the British Middle East Command, General Archibald Wavell, Brevity was intended to be a rapid blow against weak Axis front-line forces in the Sollum–Capuzzo–Bardia area of the border between Egypt and Libya. Although the operation got off to a promising start, throwing the Axis high command into confusion, most of its early gains were lost to local counter-attacks, and with German reinforcements being rushed to the front the operation was called off after one day. Egypt had been invaded by Libyan-based Italian forces in September 1940, but by February of the following year a British counter-offensive had advanced well into Libya, destroying the Italian Tenth Army in the process. British attention then shifted to Greece, which was under the threat of Axis invasion. While Allied divisions were being diverted from North Africa, the Italians reinforced their positions and were supported by the arrival of the German Afrika Korps under Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel. Rapidly taking the offensive against his distracted and over-stretched opponent, by April 1941 Rommel had driven the British and Commonwealth forces in Cyrenaica back across the Egyptian border. Although the battlefront now lay in the border area, the port city of Tobruk— inside Libya—had resisted the Axis advance, and its substantial Australian and British garrison constituted a significant threat to Rommel's lengthy supply chain. He therefore committed his main strength to besieging the city, leaving the front line only thinly held. Wavell defined Operation Brevity's main objectives as the acquisition of territory from which to launch a further planned offensive toward Tobruk, and the depletion of German and Italian forces in the region. With limited battle- ready units to draw on in the wake of Rommel's recent successes, on 15 May Brigadier William Gott attacked in three columns with a mixed infantry and armoured force. The strategically important Halfaya Pass was taken against stiff Italian opposition, and deeper inside Libya Fort Capuzzo was captured, but German counter-attacks under Colonel Maximilian von Herff regained the fort during the afternoon causing heavy casualties amongst its defenders. Gott—concerned that his forces were in danger of being caught by German armour in open ground—conducted a staged withdrawal to the Halfaya Pass on 16 May, and Brevity was closed down. The importance of the Halfaya Pass as a safe supply route was highlighted to Rommel, and 11 days later it was recaptured during Operation Skorpion, a German counter-attack. Background In early September 1940, the Italian 10th Army based in Libya conducted the Italian invasion of Egypt and three months later, the British and Commonwealth troops of the Western Desert Force began a counter-offensive, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of supply shortages and to give priority to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Lustre. The 7th Armoured Division, with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn and sent to the Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; parts of the 2nd Armoured Division and 9th Australian Division were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped and in the case of the 2nd Armoured Division, well under strength, after detachments to Greece. Marmon- Herrington Mk II armoured car, as operated by the 11th Hussars The Italians responded by despatching the 132nd Armoured Division Ariete and 102nd Motorised DivisionTrento to North Africa. From February 1941 until early May, Operation Sonnenblume saw the arrival of the German Afrika Korps in Tripoli to reinforce their Italian allies. Commanded by Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel and consisting of the 5th Light and 15th Panzer Division, the Afrika Korps was to block Allied attempts to drive the Italians out of the region. Rommel seized on the weakness of his opponents and without waiting for his forces fully to assemble, rapidly went on the offensive. During March and April, the remaining units of the 2nd Armoured Division were destroyed as the Axis forces advanced, which also forced the British and Commonwealth forces into retreat. Neame and the General Officer Commanding British Troops Egypt—Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor—were captured and the British command structure had to be reorganised. HQ Cyrenaica was dissolved on 14 April and its command functions taken over by a new HQ Western Desert Force (Lieutenant-General Noel Beresford-Peirse). The 9th Australian Infantry Division fell back to the fortress port of Tobruk and the remaining British forces withdrew a further east to Sollum on the Libyan–Egyptian border. With the main Axis force conducting the Siege of Tobruk a small battlegroup (Kampfgruppe) commanded by Colonel Maximilian von Herff continued to press eastward. Capturing Fort Capuzzo and Bardia in passing, it then advanced into Egypt; by the end of April had taken Sollum and the tactically important Halfaya Pass. Rommel garrisoned these positions, reinforced the Kampfgruppe and ordered it onto the defensive. The Tobruk garrison received supplies from the Royal Navy and Rommel was unable to take the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum were at the end of an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies had regained the initiative. Prelude The battlefield over which Operation Brevity was fought General Archibald Wavell—the commander-in-chief of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell intended to create advantageous conditions from which to launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although only as far as supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation. =Allied force= Operation Brevity would be carried out by the 22nd Guards Brigade and elements of the 7th Armoured Division. Its armoured component consisted of 29 cruiser tanks of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment (2RTR) and 24 infantry tanks of the 4th Royal Tank Regiment (4RTR). The Royal Air Force (RAF) allocated all available fighters and a small force of bombers to the operation. Brigadier William Gott—in command of all Allied front-line forces since the retreat—was to lead the operation in the field, and his plan was to advance in three parallel columns. British Cruiser Mk IV (foreground) and Matilda infantry tanks On the desert flank to the south, the 7th Armoured Brigade group was to move from Bir el Khireigat to Sidi Azeiz destroying any opposition encountered en route. This group included three small mobile forces (\\"Jock columns\\") of the 7th Support Group, the cruiser tanks of 2RTR, and the armoured cars of the 11th Hussars, whose task was to patrol the open desert on the left flank and monitor the Sidi Azeiz–Bardia road. In the centre, the 22nd Guards Brigade group was to clear the top of the Halfaya Pass, secure Bir Wair, Musaid, and Fort Capuzzo, and conduct a company-sized probe toward Bardia. The group included two infantry formations (1st Battalion Durham Light Infantry and 2nd Battalion Scots Guards), and the infantry tanks of 4RTR. In the north, the \\"coast group\\" was to advance along the coast road, capturing the lower Halfaya Pass, Sollum barracks, and the town of Sollum. The group included elements of the 2nd Battalion The Rifle Brigade, and the 8th Field Regiment Royal Artillery. =Axis force= The main Axis opposition was , positioned on the desert plateau. It included 30–50 tanks of the 2nd Battalion, Panzer Regiment 5, an Italian motorised infantry battalion of the Trento Division, and supporting arms. The front line area around Halfaya Pass was defended by two companies of —well trained Italian motorised infantry—with artillery support. On 9 May, the Germans intercepted a British weather report over the radio. The war diary noted that \\"In the past, such reports had always been issued prior to the important enemy offensives to capture Sidi Barrani, Bardi, Tobruk, and the Gebel\\". Rommel strengthened the eastern side of his cordon around Tobruk as a precaution against sorties from the garrison and to order to adopt a more aggressive posture. On 13 May, Axis aircraft bombed British tank concentrations and Herff expected an imminent British attack. On the following day aircraft were unable to locate the British, and it was reported that the \\"enemy intentions to attack were not known\\". Battle =Centre column= On 13 May, Wavell's infantry battalions began to concentrate at their start lines, followed by the tank regiments during the early hours of 15 May. At 06:00, the three columns began their advance, supported overhead by a standing patrol of Hawker Hurricane fighters. Reaching the top of the Halfaya Pass, the 22nd Guards Brigade group ran into heavy opposition from a company of company, supported by anti-tank guns, under the command of Colonel Ugo Montemurro. This unit fought tenaciously, doing much to repair the poor impression Rommel had of his Italian allies. Opening fire upon the attacking British tanks, the found their 47 mm anti-tank guns could not penetrate the armour of the Matilda infantry tanks. At , the gunners shifted targets, aiming at the tracks and undercarriages, when the tanks raised up crossing low stone walls and rocks, seven tanks were disabled. For his conduct during this action, Rommel recommended that Montemurro be awarded the Iron Cross First Class. At the cost of the seven tanks, the position was taken by C Squadron 4RTR and G Company 2nd Scots Guards and the brigade group pushed on towards the Bir Wair-Musaid road. At around 08:00, it received the surrender of a large German-Italian camp, and by 10:15 Bir Wair and Musaid had been taken in the face of sporadic opposition. Fort Capuzzo, the focal point of much of the day's fighting. A Squadron 4RTR and the 1st Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) continued the advance toward Fort Capuzzo. Concealed in hull down positions behind a ridge near the fort were 20–30 German tanks, supported by anti tank guns. These engaged A Squadron, disabling five tanks, but were forced to withdraw as the squadron pressed its attack. On the final approach to Fort Capuzzo, contact was lost between 4RTR's tanks and 1DLI's leading C Company, and the attack on the fort began without armoured support. The fort was vigorously defended, and it was not until just before midday that C Company, reunited with A Squadron 4RTR and reinforced by A and B Companies 1DLI, eventually took the position. D Company 1DLI—which had been in reserve during the attack—then made a wide left hook to capture a small landing ground to the north of the fort. In the afternoon, one company of the 2nd Scots Guards probed toward Bardia, the infantry coming under heavy machine gun fire from three positions as they neared Sollum barracks. A group of Universal Carriers—commanded by Sergeant F. Riley—charged the gun positions and quickly neutralised them, but one carrier was disabled when the group was subsequently engaged by anti-tank guns. Riley executed a second charge, silencing these too and taking their crews prisoner. His carrier was hit three times; for his actions Riley was awarded the Military Medal, the battalion's first decoration of the war. =Desert column= On the desert flank, 2RTR advanced with the 7th Armoured Brigade group. During the morning, reports were received of up to 30 German armoured vehicles operating nearby, and A Squadron 2RTR moved to investigate. Most of the German force had pulled back, but three tanks were located and brought under fire. One Panzer IV was disabled and the other two driven off, for the loss of one British tank due to mechanical failure. A second force of 15 German tanks was engaged by two tanks of No 2 Troop, destroying a Panzer III and forcing the remainder to withdraw. By midday, the brigade group had reached a position west of Fort Capuzzo, and in the afternoon the nine remaining cruisers of A Squadron 2RTR began a reconnaissance patrol towards Sidi Azeiz. =Coastal column= The advance along the coastal road—which lacked tank support—was held up all morning by determined Italian resistance at the bottom of Halfaya Pass. This objective was finally achieved toward evening when S Company 2nd Rifle Brigade—supported by Australian anti-tank gunners fighting as infantry—overran the Italian positions taking around 130 prisoners. =Axis reactions= A Panzer II (right) and a Panzer III (left), the main tanks in use by the Afrika Korps during 1941, advance across the open desert. Although the German and Italian commands in North Africa knew that a British offensive was imminent, Operation Brevity nevertheless caught them unprepared, and Rommel recorded in his diary that the initial attacks had caused him considerable losses. By midday on 15 May, Axis command was showing signs of confusion. It was erroneously believed that the offensive involved more than 100 tanks, and repeated requests were made to both the and the for a concerted effort to defeat it. Forces around Tobruk were redeployed east of the besieged city, to block any attempt at relief and to prevent the garrison from breaking out to meet the British advance. Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Cramer was sent to reinforce with a tank battalion from Panzer Regiment 8 and a battery of anti-aircraft guns, and additional reinforcements under General Hans-Karl Freiherr von Esebeck were despatched the following day. The Germans concentrated their riposte against the central column. Herff—who had been prepared to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo during the afternoon of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 5\\\\. At around 13:30, D Company 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall back toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment 5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners. On the desert flank, A Squadron 2RTR's patrol toward Sidi Azeiz was being monitored by Panzer Regiment 5, but the Germans misidentified the light cruiser tanks as heavily armoured Matilda infantry tanks, and reported that an attack was not possible. Herff—believing the British had two divisions operating in the area—had grown uneasy. A Squadron's patrol was interpreted as an attempt to concentrate south of Sidi Azeiz, in preparation for a thrust north the next day; such a move threatened to sweep aside Herff's force and unhinge the German front in the Sollum–Bardia area. Herff broke contact with the British; his plan was to join up with Cramer's Panzer Regiment 8 to mount a concentrated counter-attack the following morning. =British withdrawal= British troops captured by the Italians Realising that the 22nd Guards Brigade group would be vulnerable to German armoured counterattacks in the open ground around Bir Wair and Mussaid, Brigadier Gott withdrew it during the early hours of the morning of 16 May. By 10:00, the infantry had taken up new positions back at Halfaya Pass, although the 7th Armoured Brigade group was ordered to remain west of Fort Capuzzo for the time being. Cramer's reinforcements arrived in the Sidi Azeiz area at 03:00 and reached Fort Capuzzo at 06:30. At around 08:00, he made contact with but by mid-morning both groups had run out of fuel. The German advance resumed at 16:00 before being stopped by around 17 tanks of 2RTR. The British reported one German tank set alight and another disabled and that an advance of up to fifty tanks had been halted, while the Germans believed that they had repulsed a strong British tank attack. As nightfall approached, Herff broke off the action and went on to the defensive. He intended to repair his damaged machines, reorganise, and resume offensive operations on 18 May. 2RTR pulled back to Bir el Khireigat, initially followed by two German tanks, one of which withdrew after the other was destroyed. The regiment arrived at Bir el Khireigat, from where it had set out two days previously, at around 02:30 on 17 May. Aftermath Pencil drawing of Halfaya Pass by New Zealand artist, Jack Crippen Operation Brevity failed to achieve most of its objectives, succeeding only in retaking the Halfaya Pass. The British lost five tanks destroyed and a further 13 were damaged but the tank regiments suffered no losses in personnel. Total casualties amounted to at least 206 men. The 1st Durham Light Infantry suffered the most during the operation losing 196 men killed, wounded or captured. The 2nd Scots Guards lost one man killed and four wounded, the 3rd Coldstream Guards lost one man killed and the 11th Hussars suffered four men wounded. Losses among the 2nd Rifle Brigade are unknown. German casualties numbered three tanks (a Panzer II and two Panzer IIIs, although several more suffered minor damage) and 258 men killed, wounded or captured. Jack Greene and Alessandro Massignani place total Italian losses at 395. Allied accounts record the capture of 347 of these men. On 5 August, Herff praised the Bersaglieri, who had defended Halfaya Pass \\"...with lionlike courage until the last man against stronger enemy forces. The greatest part of them died faithful to the flag.\\" Lieutenant Giacinto Cova, a platoon commander in the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, received a posthumous Gold Medal of Military Valour, Italy's highest award for bravery. The medal citation reported that Cova had organised a counter-attack and was killed attempting to throw a hand-held bomb at a British tank. The British received plaudits from Winston Churchill, who sent a telegram to Wavell betraying his ignorance of events by stating: \\"Without using the Tiger cubs you have taken the offensive, advanced , captured Halfaya and Sollum, taken 500 German prisoners and inflicted heavy losses in men and tanks. For this twenty I tanks and 1,000 or 1,500 casualties do not seem too heavy a cost.\\" Churchill ended the message by asking Wavell \\"What are your dates for bringing Tiger cubs into action?\\", in reference to the reinforcements that had arrived at Alexandria on 12 May as part of a convoy code-named Operation Tiger. The 11th Hussar's regimental history notes that \\"it was clear that no further offensive action would be possible before 7[th] Arm[oured Division] was fully prepared\\". The Tiger convoy brought 238 tanks and made it possible to refit the 7th Armoured Division, which had been out of action since February as a result of the losses it sustained during Operation Compass. Preparations could now be made for Operation Battleaxe and the relief of Tobruk. In the system of British and Commonwealth battle honours, units that served in the Halfaya Pass area between 15 and 27 May were awarded the honour Halfaya 1941 in 1957. Historian Thomas Jentz suggests that Brevity could have ended in victory for the British. While their tank forces were fighting ineffectively, the \\"gutsy\\" actions by 2RTR and their patrol toward Sidi Azeiz had convinced the Germans that the battle was lost by the evening of 15 May. Because of their failure to engage 2RTR late that day, several German commanders from Panzer Regiment 5, including its commanding officer, were removed from their posts after the battle. Jentz notes that a feint by the 1st and 7th RTR out of Tobruk might have caused a realignment of the Axis forces, weakening their overall position and perhaps even forcing them to give up the Sollum area. Operation Brevity highlighted to Rommel the importance of the Halfaya Pass; whichever side held it would have a \\"comparatively safe route for his supplies\\" during offensives in the area. On 27 May, he launched Operation Skorpion, during which Herff recaptured the pass and reversed the last British territorial gain from Brevity.

As the largest town in the region, it is often referred to as \\"the Capital of Connemara\\". Frequented by tourists, Clifden is linked to Galway city by the N59. History =19th century= The town was founded at the start of the 19th century by John D'Arcy (1785–1839) who lived in Clifden Castle (built around 1818, now a ruin) west of Clifden. He had inherited the estate in 1804 when it was mostly inhabited by fishermen and farmers. The idea of establishing a town on the coast was first voiced by him in 1812. Bad communications and a lack of private capital prevented fast progress until the 1820s when the potato crop failed in 1821–22 and D'Arcy petitioned the government in Dublin for assistance. The engineer Alexander Nimmo was sent to the area in 1822. He constructed a quay at Clifden (finished in 1831) and started a road to Galway. With these improvements to its infrastructure, the town began to grow. The Monster Meeting at Clifden in 1843 by Joseph Patrick Haverty. Daniel O'Connell is depicted in the centre addressing the gathered masses. It prospered until, in 1839, John D'Arcy died. By that time, Clifden had grown from virtually nothing to a town of 185 dwellings, most of them three-floored, two churches, two hotels, three schools, a police barracks, courthouse, a gaol, a distillery and 23 pubs. The population had grown to 1,100 and the town already sported the (as yet unpaved) triangle of streets still visible today. Products that were shipped out from Clifden Harbour included marble, corn, fish and kelp. However, John's son and heir, Hyacinth, lacked his father's abilities and confrontations with his tenants became commonplace. In 1843, Daniel O'Connell held a 'Monster Meeting' at Clifden, attended by a crowd reportedly numbering 100,000, at which he spoke on repeal of the Act of Union. The town's surging growth and prosperity came to an end when the famine started in 1845. Large numbers of people died, as government help proved insufficient to deal with starvation, scurvy and other diseases. By 1848 90% of the population were on relief (receiving government money). Landlords went bankrupt as rents dried up. Many people emigrated to America. On 18 November 1850, Hyacinth D'Arcy put up his estates for sale and most of them were purchased by Charles and Thomas Eyre of Somerset. Hyacinth pursued a church career and became Rector of Omey and Clifden. Charles Eyre sold his share to his brother, who gave the estates to his nephew (Charles' son) John Joseph in 1864. In 1855, Sisters of Mercy from Galway came to Clifden and established St. Joseph's Convent, followed by an orphanage and St. Joseph's Industrial School in 1858. =Early 20th century= Remains of the Marconi transatlantic wireless station Clifden gained prominence after 1905 when Guglielmo Marconi decided to build his first high power transatlantic long wave wireless telegraphy station four miles (6 km) south of the town to minimize the distance to its sister station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. The first point-to-point fixed wireless service connecting Europe with North America opened for public service with the transmission of 10,000 words on 17 October 1907. At peak times, up to 200 people were employed by the Clifden wireless station, among them Jack Phillips, who later perished as Chief Radio Operator on the Titanic. On 15 June 1919 the first non-stop transatlantic flight by Alcock and Brown crashlanded in Derrygimlagh bog, close to Marconi's transatlantic wireless station. When Captain Alcock spotted the green bog he thought it was a meadow where he could safely land his Vickers Vimy biplane. The plane's landing gear sank into the soft bog and was destroyed. Alcock and Brown were later transported back to Clifden town by stagecoach with only minor injuries. When they returned using the Marconi Railway, the locals had helped themselves to parts of the plane as souvenirs.Alcock and Brown Museum in Clifden & Nora Thornton O'Donnell eyewitness War of Independence (1920–1921) Alcock and Brown landing site Events that would lead up to the \\"Burning of Clifden\\" began on 21 November 1920, Bloody Sunday. On that day, IRA members in Dublin attacked British officers and civilians believed to work for intelligence, killing eleven and wounding four. Later that day, British paramilitary auxiliary forces opened fire at Croke Park, killing twelve and injuring sixty. Thomas Whelan, born in 1899 in Clifden, was arrested and charged with the 21 November murder of Captain G.T. Bagelly. Although he maintained his innocence, Whelan was found guilty and executed on 14 March 1921. Following its Two for one policy that required the killing of two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) for every Republican executed, members of the IRA shot and killed Constable Charles Reynolds and Constable Thomas Sweeney at Eddie King's Corner in Clifden on 16 March 1921. In response to the RIC's request for assistance, a trainload of Black and Tans arrived from Galway in the early hours of St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1921, and proceeded to \\"burn, plunder and murder\\". They killed one civilian, seriously injured another, burned 14 houses, and damaged several others. Civil war (1922) When the Civil War started in June 1922, Connemara was controlled by the Republicans. In Clifden, the population tolerated the Republicans but did not support them. The Republicans occupied several buildings. In addition, all petrol was confiscated, roads barricaded and made impassable, railway bridges were blown up and telegraph lines cut. Newspapers were forbidden. The Republicans burned the buildings they evacuated. In Clifden, the workhouse was burned in July. In addition, on 25 July, the Republicans set fire to the Marconi Station and fired shots at it because they considered the station \\"a British concern\\", and because the RIC had used the station to marshall reinforcements in March 1921. Transatlantic wireless serviceThe Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System, Scientific American, 23 November 1907 was transferred from Clifden to the more modern Marconi wireless station near Waunfawr, Wales. By one reckoning, the station's closure caused an estimated 1,000 people to lose their livelihood. The National Army sent 150 men, and in the night of 14/15 August, the National Army marched to town. However, the Republicans retreated and there was only minimal fighting. The National troops were warmly welcomed by the people of Clifden. The Republicans still controlled the mountains and waged a guerrilla war against the National Army. The Irregulars attacked Army posts and patrols, mainly by sniping, and attacked motor cars. On 13 October, Republicans burned down the Recess Hotel and nearby Glendalough House to prevent the National troops from using them as billets. On 29 October, the Republicans recaptured Clifden from the around 100 National troops stationed there. The attacking force consisted of around 350 men. They also had with them an \\"armoured car\\", called The Queen of the West. This was used to advance towards a defended barracks building. Eventually, the National troops surrendered. However, the Republicans did not occupy the town, which had sustained some damage during the fighting. Communications were once again severed, and the Irregulars took up positions around the town. Finally, on 16 December, the National Army returned to Clifden and the Republicans once again slipped away before its arrival. The townspeople again welcomed the Army and soon repairs started on bridges and the railway line. Soon the first train in seven months arrived in Clifden. Transport =Road= The N59 road from Galway (77 km away) to Westport, County Mayo (64 km) passes through the town. Regular coach services are provided by Bus Éireann and Citylink, connecting Clifden with Galway city. Some bus services operate through Oughterard, to the south of Lough Corrib, while others operate via Clonbur / Headford to the north of Lough Corrib. =Rail= A train at Clifden railway station Beginning 1 July 1895, Clifden railway station was the western terminus of the Midland Great Western Railway Galway to Clifden line. The line closed in 1935. =Airport= In 1989, a group of Clifden businessmen issued shares for a company and applied for planning permission for a 1,200 metre runway and associated buildings at Ardagh. A group of locals began to campaign against this proposal, later calling themselves \\"Save Roundstone Bog\\". Galway County Council refused planning permission for the airport due to feared damage to the natural beauty of the area, and because it was designated an 'Area of International Scientific Importance' (ASI). The 'Clifden Airport Co.' appealed and as a consequence of the legal proceedings, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, ASI designations were found to be unconstitutional. The company later proposed to exchange the site at Ardagh for part of the Marconi site at Derrygimlagh. However, this also failed due to local and nationwide opposition. Eventually, a smaller 600-metre runway was suggested at Cloon near Cleggan. This runway was built in 2008 and the airfield was supposed to be used for flights to Inishbofin. It has been assigned the airport code EICD but by 2012 it had not been opened for traffic. Economy Clifden is the main town in Connemara; therefore it is home to a range of services. The HQ for the Connemara Garda service is in Clifden and the main fire station for Connemara is in Clifden. There is a public library serving the area which offers material relating to local history. The library hosts an ongoing programme of exhibitions, readings and other cultural events. There are three supermarkets in Clifden and 13 pubs. Tourism Clifden Castle Clifden is a tourist destination for people exploring Connemara. Places of interest in and around Clifden include: * Twelve Bens * Connemara National Park * Sky Road: an 11 km drive along Clifden Bay and Streamstown Bay rising more than 150 m above sea level at Slyne Head, with views of the Atlantic, Clifden Castle, coast-guard station, the islands of Inishturk and Turbot and the town. * Derrygimlagh Bog: a natural wilderness of blanket bog 6 km south of Clifden and the site of the Alcock and Brown crash-landing and the Marconi transatlantic wireless station. * Inishbofin * Slyne Head Lighthouse * The Station House includes a hotel, shops, museum, and flats. The Station House was Clifden's railway station from 1 July 1895 to 29 April 1935. * St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church Events The Connemara Pony Show is organised by the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society and has been held on the third Thursday in August since 1924. Since 1947 the show has been held in Clifden. Community Arts Week in late September offers poetry reading, lectures, recitals and traditional music. The festival was first started by teachers in Clifden Community School in 1979 to bring creative arts into the classroom. During the Omey Island Races, horse racing occurs on the beach. In honour of Jon Riley, on 12 September the town of Clifden flies the Mexican flag. Clifden main street Religion Clifden lies within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tuam and the Church of Ireland Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry, and its Omey Union Parish. Clifden has two churches: St. Joseph's (Roman Catholic), completed in 1879, and Christ Church (Church of Ireland), built in 1853, replacing an earlier structure dating to 1810. Sports Clifden is home to Naomh Feichin's GAA club. Clifden is also home to the Connemara Blacks, a rugby that draws team members from Connemara. In literature James Mylet's debut novel Lex is set in Clifden. In 2011 the British newspaper The Guardian described the novel as being set in \\"the fictional town of Clifden on Ireland's west coast\\", leading to at least one letter pointing out the inaccuracy of this statement. Notable people * John Patrick Riley (c.1817–c.1850), a Clifden native, formed and led the Saint Patrick's Battalion, a unit of almost 200 immigrants and expatriates who defected from the US army and fought with Mexico in the Mexican–American War of 1846–48. The town commemorates him with a bronze street sculpture. * John Bamlet Smallman (1849–1916), an Irish-Canadian businessman, was born in Clifden .

He wrote numerous books on this subject, dealing notably with the races of his own country, while an important general work was Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche (Stuttgart, 1878). Biography Andree was born in Braunschweig, the son of geographer Karl Andree (1808–1875). He followed in the footsteps of his father, studied natural sciences at the Braunschweig Collegium Carolinum and Leipzig University, and temporarily worked in a Bohemian ironworks. As a director of the geography bureau of publisher Velhagen & Klasing in Leipzig from 1873 to 1890, he also took up cartography, having a chief share in the production of the Physikalisch-Statistischer Atlas des Deutschen Reichs (together with Oscar Peschel, Leipzig, 1877) and the Allgemeiner Historischer Handatlas, (with Gustav Droysen, son of Johann Gustav Droysen, Leipzig, 1886) as well as school atlases.

Andree became an elected member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1886. In 1890 he moved to Heidelberg, where he continued the editorship of the academic journal Globus from 1891 until 1903. Andree made important contributions to comparative ethnographic studies of countries and people, advocating Adolf Bastian's ideas of a common basic mental framework shared by all humans. His work also influenced Arnošt Muka's studies of the Sorbian culture. In 1903, Andree married Marie Eysn who became known as Marie Andree-Eysn.

The name was historically written in English as Dunnagall or Dunagall. Although Donegal gave its name to the county, now Lifford is the county town. From the 1470s until the very early 17th century, Donegal was the 'capital' of Tyrconnell (), a Gaelic kingdom controlled by the O'Donnell dynasty of the Northern Uí Néill. Donegal sits at the mouth of the River Eske and Donegal Bay, which is overshadowed by the Blue Stack Mountains ('the Croaghs'). The Drummenny Burn, which flows along the eastern edge of Donegal Town, flows into the River Eske on the north-eastern edge of the town, between the Community Hospital and The Northern Garage. The Ballybofey Road (the R267) crosses the Drummenny Burn near where it flows into the River Eske. The town is bypassed by the N15 and N56 roads. The centre of the town, known as The Diamond, is a hub for music, poetic and cultural gatherings in the area. History Donegal Abbey. Approaching Donegal Town by sea There is archaeological evidence for settlements around the town dating to prehistoric times, including the remains of ringforts and other defensive earthworks. Saint Patrick was captured by raiders from the clans governed by Niall of the Nine Hostages, and this region is that to which Patrick returned, being familiar with the people, language, customs and lands. The first clan to convert to Christianity as the result of St Patrick's efforts was Cenel Chonaill, the principal branch of which are the O'Donnells also known at one time as Clan Dálaigh. Connall was a son of Niall of the Nine Hostages. As a result of their acceptance of Christianity, Patrick blessed the clan members; the sign of the cross appeared on the chieftain's shield and this became not only the heraldic device for the clan but also for County Donegal. Donegal Town itself is famous for being the former centre of government of the O'Donnell dynasty, the great Gaelic royal family who ruled Tír Chonaill in west Ulster for centuries and who played a pivotal rôle in Irish history. Their original homeland lay further to the north in the area of Kilmacrennan. From the 15th to the 17th century, they were an important part of the opposition to the colonisation of Ireland by England. The town itself contains Donegal Castle, on the banks of the River Eske, and the remains of Donegal Abbey, a Franciscan abbey which dates back to the 15th century on the Southern shore of the Bay. The Annals of the Four Masters may have been partially written in the old abbey in the 1630s. The story of Hugh Roe O'Donnell (, also known as \\"Red\\" Hugh II), Lord of Tyrconnell, was the inspiration behind many books and films, not least, Disney's The Fighting Prince of Donegal. In 1601 the Siege of Donegal took place during the Nine Years' War. After the Flight of the Earls from near Rathmullan in September 1607, the castle and its lands were seized by the English Crown and given to an Englishman, Captain Basil Brooke, as part of the Plantation of Ulster. Captain (later Sir) Basil Brooke (ancestor of the Viscounts Brookeborough) was granted the castle around 1611 and he proceeded to carry out major reconstruction work and added a wing to the castle in the Jacobean style. The current plan of the town was also laid out by Brooke, including an attractive town square known as The Diamond. From the late 17th until the early 20th centuries, Donegal Town formed part of the vast estates of the Gore family (from 1762 Earls of Arran in the Peerage of Ireland) and it was during their ownership that the town took on its present appearance. Donegal Borough returned two members to the Irish House of Commons, the lower house of the Parliament of Ireland, until the Acts of Union 1800 came into force in January 1801. Evidence of the Great Famine still exists, including a workhouse, whose buildings are now part of the local hospital, and many famine graves. Buildings of note =Donegal Castle= Donegal Castle was the stronghold of the O'Donnells.

It lies on Donegal's North West coast, specifically the west side of Sheephaven Bay, on the N56 road (the West Donegal Coastal Route). The town has its own dedicated website, which gives information about the town and the surrounding area. Description The centre of Dunfanaghy is a small square with a market house built in 1847 and a quay built in 1831 and formerly used to export corn. There are four churches: the early 17th-century Clondehorky Old Church (now ruined), constructed during the Plantation of Ulster; Dunfanaghy Presbyterian Church; Holy Cross Church (Catholic and known locally as 'the Chapel'); and Holy Trinity Church of Ireland Church. The village is also home to a golf club, several art galleries and craft shops, and a museum, situated in part of a former workhouse, which describes the effects of the Great Famine on Dunfanaghy. Dunfanaghy is also home to C.L.G. Naomh Mícheál, a Gaelic football club. View of Dunfanaghy from Horn Head. Local area Just outside the village is a three-mile-long sandy beach known as Killahoey Strand. On 16 June 1942, a RAF Ferry Command Hudson aircraft (42-66130) was forced to land on a beach near Dunfanaghy. (Irish Army archive reports call this 'Hill Strand'.) It was feared the rising tides would swallow the plane, but 200 locals came out to pull it to safety. The aircraft was refuelled and the crew of four accommodated nearby overnight. They departed the next day to continue their delivery flight of the aircraft. This event became confused with another aircraft landing in 1943 when, in the early 1990s, an American Harry X. Ford made an effort to find the town in which he crashed landed on 10 May 1943. Having visited the town in 1993 it was finally discovered he had not actually landed there but had been on a B-17 Flying Fortress which force landed on a beach at Bundoran on 10 May 1943. Irish Army Archive reports confirm Harry X Ford's presence in Bundoran and not anywhere near Dunfanaghy or Portnablagh. Some sources published around 1993 attribute a landing on 2 May 1943 to have taken place on Killahoey Strand but this is an error confirmed by Irish Army Archives and the archives of the United States Air Force. A disused anchor on display in the centre of the village West of Dunfanaghy are New Lake and Tramore Strand, a two-mile-long beach. New Lake was formerly a salt water marsh, but during the First World War, over-cutting of the grass on the surrounding sand dunes led to their destabilisation and the movement of the sand to block up the river. As a result, the marsh filled with fresh water and became a lake. The sand also silted up Dunfanaghy harbour. The New Lake became a haven for seabirds and is now a Special Protection Area. Also nearby is Sessiagh Lough, a small lough with a crannog in the middle. Across the bay from Dunfanaghy is Horn Head, which shelters Dunfanaghy from the Atlantic Ocean and is an Irish Natural Heritage Area. Dunfanaghy is close to Portnablagh and Marble Hill, both of which also have popular beaches. Other sights in the vicinity include: Ards Forest Park, Ards (Capuchin) Friary, Glenveagh National Park, Doe Castle and the Derryveagh Mountains, the most prominent being Muckish Mountain and Errigal. =Workhouse= Dunfanaghy Workhouse Heritage Centre As in many parts of Ireland in the mid nineteenth century, a Workhouse was constructed nearby for the detention and maintenance of destitute local people. The first occupants were admitted in June 1845, at the beginning of the Great Famine. Parts of the original building have recently been restored and now function as an interpretive centre of the Famine and its impact on the local inhabitants. Near the workhouse, on the Falcarragh road, is the former Union fever hospital. Closed in 1922, it was reopened as a national school in the 1930s and fulfilled this role until the 1960s. Since 1968 it has been used as an artists studio and gallery. Transport Dunfanaghy Road was previously a stop on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway although the station was in fact six miles from Dunfanaghy itself. Dunfanaghy Road railway station opened on 9 March 1903, closed for passenger traffic on 3 June 1940 and finally closed altogether on 6 January 1947. Lough Swilly Buses served the area with four buses per day going from Dunfanaghy to Letterkenny and vice versa. Lough Swilly Buses also provided school transport to primary schools and the main secondary schools St Eunan's College and Loreto Convent Secondary School, Letterkenny during school terms until April 2014 when the company ceased trading. In 2018, Dunfanaghy is very well served by bus services to and from Letterkenny, the largest town in County Donegal.

The road also passed through Reate (Rieti) and Asculum (Ascoli Piceno). The Via Salaria owes its name to the Latin word for \\"salt\\", since it was the route by which the Sabines living nearer the Tyrrhenian sea came to fetch salt from the marshes at the mouth of the Tiber, the Campus Salinarum, while those nearer the Adriatic Sea used it to fetch it from production sites there.

His only surviving work is the 17-book Punica, an epic poem about the Second Punic War and the longest surviving poem in Latin at over 12,000 lines. A painting by Joseph Wright of Derby depicting Silius Italicus at the tomb of Virgil. Life =Sources and birthplace= The sources for the life of Silius Italicus are primarily Letter 3.7 of Pliny the Younger, which is a description of the poet's life written on the occasion of his suicide, some inscriptions,von Albrecht, p. 960 n.1 and several epigrams by the poet Martial. Silius is believed to have been born between AD 23 and 35,M. von Albrecht, A History of Latin Literature, vol. 2 p. 959. but his birthplace has not been securely identified. Italica, in the Roman province of Hispania, (modern Spain), was once considered the prime candidate, based on his cognomen Italicus, but, if that were the case, Latin usage would have demanded the form Italicensis, and it is highly improbable that Martial would have failed to name him among the literary celebrities of Spain in the latter half of the 1st century. The city of Patavium, Padua in northern Italy, has been suggested by J. D. Campbell based on a seeming bias in favor of the region in the Punica and the prevalence of the name Asconius in inscriptions from the region.D. J. Campbell, \\"The Birthplace of Silius Italicus\\", The Classical Review (1936), pp. 55-58. =Political career= In early life Silius was a renowned forensic orator, later a safe and cautious politician. Silius was generally believed to have voluntarily and enthusiastically become an informer under Nero, prosecuting in court persons whom the emperor wished condemned.Pliny 3.7.3 He was consul in the year of Nero's death (AD 68), and afterward became a close friend and ally of the emperor Vitellius, whom he served, according to Pliny sapienter et comiter, wisely and amicably. He is mentioned by Tacitus as having been one of two witnesses who were present at the conferences between Vitellius and Flavius Sabinus, the elder brother of Vespasian, when the legions from the East were marching rapidly on the capital.Tacitus Histories 3.65 Silius became proconsul of Asia AD 77-78 as attested in an inscription from Aphrodisias which describes his activities in maintaining the institutions of the city.W. Calder, \\"Silius Italicus in Asia\\", Classical Review, (1935), pp. 216-217. According to Pliny (Ep. 3.7), he performed his duties well and earned himself a place of importance in the empire. =Campanian retirement and suicide= After his proconsulship in Asia, Silius seems to have left politics in favor of a leisurely life; despite his wealth and importance in the state, he seems to have exercised little power and avoided offense.Pliny Ep. 3.7.4 Thus, he outlived the Flavian dynasty without incident. Pliny depicts him spending time in learned conversation at his villas, writing, passionately collecting books and sculpture,Martial remarks in 6.64 that Silius read his epigrams. and giving recitations of his works. Silius was evidently writing poems as early as AD 88.Martial 4.14. It is firmly believed that the Punica was written during this retirement period of Silius' life.von Albrecht p. 960 n.4 Martial 7.63 indicates that some of the Punica had been published by AD 92 and that Silius was no longer making speeches in court. Book 14 has been dated tentatively to after AD 96 based on the poet's treatment of Domitian.W. MacDermott and A. Orentzel, \\"Silius and Domitian\\", American Journal of Philology, (1977) pp. 24-34 His poem contains several passages relating to the Flavians, and Domitian is eulogized as a warrior and as a singer whose lyre is sweeter than that of Orpheus himself.Punica 3.607-29 and 14.686-88. The poem mentions primarily Domitian but later seems to discuss the emperor Nerva, although Domitian may be meant by the latter reference.W. MacDermott and A. Orentzel pp. 30-31. The poet's attitude to Domitian tends to be laudatory and friendly, employing the full spectrum of Virgilian panegyrical language and imagery.W. MacDermott and A. Orentzel, pp. 29-34 Silius was considered highly educated by contemporaries. The philosopher Epictetus judged him to be the most philosophic spirit among the Romans of his time,Epict. Diss. 3.8.7 and Cornutus, the Stoic, rhetorician and grammarian, dedicated to Silius a commentary upon Virgil.Char. Gramm. 1.125.16-18. He had two sons, one of whom, Severus, died young. The other, Decianus, went on to become consul.Martial 8.66 As he aged, he moved permanently to his villas in Campania, not even leaving to attend the accession ceremony of Trajan.Pliny, Ep. 3.7.5 Silius idealized and almost worshipped two great Romans of the past, Cicero and Virgil. He purchased Cicero's estate at TusculumMartial 11.48. and the tomb of Virgil in Naples, which he restored.Martial 11.49. Pliny records that Silius especially revered Virgil, celebrating Virgil's birthday more lavishly than his own and treating the poet's tomb as a shrine.Pliny, Ep. 3.7.8-9. His dual interests in composing epic poetry and discussing philosophical questions have been compared to the intellectual efforts of his heroes, Virgil and Cicero, respectively. Silius was one of the numerous Romans of the early empire who had the courage of their opinions, and carried into perfect practice the theory of suicide developed in Stoicism; Punica 11.186-88 contains a praise of suicide. Stricken by an incurable tumour after the age of 75, he starved himself to death around 103 AD, keeping a cheerful countenance to the end. Pliny remarks that Silius was the last person to die who was consul under Nero.Pliny, Ep. 3.7.10. Works Whether Silius committed his philosophic dialogues and speeches to writing or not, we cannot say. His only preserved work is his epic poem entitled Punica, about the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) in seventeen books, comprising some twelve thousand lines, making it the longest preserved poem in Latin literature. =The Punica= Vision of a Knight by Raphael is based on an episode in Book 15 of the Punica, the choice of Scipio. The dating of the Punica has been a difficult issue for classical scholars, but two passages, 3.594 and 14.680ff., along with several poems of Martial cited above, indicate that it was composed sometime between 83 and 103, with Book 3 being dated to AD 84 and Book 14 around AD 96.E. Wistrand, Die Chronologie der Punica des Silius Italicus Goeteborg, 1956. Other books cannot be dated with any precision. The poem is divided into 17 books and is composed in dactylic hexameter. It has been thought that the poem was initially planned in hexads and that the original intent was to round off the composition in 18 books.von Albrecht, p. 964 The poem takes Virgil as its primary stylistic and dramatic inspiration throughout; from its opening, the Punica is configured as the continuation of Juno's grudge against Rome developed in the Aeneid.von Albrecht, pp. 962ff. for a discussion of sources. Livy and EnniusPun. 12.342-419 is a passage in praise of Ennius. are important sources for historical and poetic information, and Homer specifically is declared an important model by Silius who remarks of him at 12.788-9, \\"his [Homer's] poetry embraced the earth, sea, stars, and shades and he rivaled the Muses in song and Phoebus in glory.\\"von Albrecht, p. 962 for a list of Homeric episodes in Silius which are not found in Virgil. Lucan is also an important model for the writing of historical epic, geographical excursus, and Stoic tone, although Silius' approach toward the gods in much more traditional.von Albrecht, p. 984. The poem opens with a discussion of Juno's wrath against Rome on account of Aeneas' treatment of Dido and of Hannibal's character and upbringing. Hannibal attacks Saguntum and receives a Roman embassy. In Book 2, the Roman legation is heard at Carthage, but Hannibal takes the city after the defenders heroically commit suicide. The Carthaginians are catalogued, Hannibal crosses the Alps, and Jupiter reveals that the Punic War is a test of Roman manliness in Book 3. In 4 and 5 the Romans suffer defeat at Ticinus, Trebia, and Lake Trasimene. Book 6 looks back to the exploits of Marcus Atilius Regulus in the First Punic War, while Book 7 describes Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus' delaying strategy. Books 8-10 describe in vivid detail the battle of Cannae; Juno prevents Hannibal from marching on Rome. In Book 11, Hannibal's army winters in Capua, where Venus enfeebles them with luxury. Hannibal is defeated at Nola in 12, emboldening the Romans. He makes an attempt on the city, but Juno stops him, revealing that the gods are against him. Book 13 reports the Romans' invasion of Capua and the death of two Scipios, which leads to Scipio Africanus' journey to the underworld (nekyia), his meeting with famous dead heroes, and a prophecy by the Sibyl of Hannibal's defeat. In 14 the Marcellus' successful Sicilian campaign and the siegecraft of Archimedes are described. In 15, Scipio, choosing Virtue over Vice, has a successful campaign in Spain, while at the Battle of the Metaurus, Hannibal's brother is killed. 16 describes the alliance between Rome and Masinissa and Scipio's crossing into Africa, while 17 describes the bringing of the statue of Cybele to Rome, Hannibal's stormy crossing into Africa, Juno's appeal to Jupiter for the life of Hannibal, and the Battle of Zama. The poem ends with Scipio's triumphal return to Rome. Silius' style is unlike Virgil in that he does not focus on a few central characters but divides his action up between many significant heroes.von Albrecht, p. 965. This encourages him to present important events from the Roman past as a reflection on the characters and their actions in the poem's present, echoing the Roman tradition of using exempla. While many important set pieces of epic are included, such as elaborated similes, ekphrases of objects, such as Hannibal's shield in 2.391-456, a nekyia, and divine participation in and prophecy of events, there are also important elements of historiography such as paired contrasting speeches and detailed geographical description. Allegory is particularly important in Silius, and he includes such figures as Fides, faith, in Book 2, Italia in 15, and Virtus and Voluptas also in Book 15, continuing a trend towards allegory which was significant in Statius, Silius' contemporary.Feeney, D. The Gods in Epic (Oxford, 1991) Silius' metrics and language can be closely compared to Virgilian usage, especially his use of spondees.von Albrecht, p. 967. Stoicism and stoic ethical thought are significant themes in the Punica. The war is configured as a trial of Roman virtus which must be overcome with hard work, akin to the Stoic ideal of overcoming adversity with inner courage and trial.von Albrecht, pp. 967ff. for a discussion of Silius' stoicism with references. The \\"choice of Hercules\\", a favorite Stoic parable, is given to Scipio in Book 15, and everywhere the war brings out moral lessons and discussions of Stoic concepts like emotion, reason, and destiny. Influence The only ancient authors to refer to Silius are Martial, Pliny, and Sidonius Apollinaris. Pliny's judgment that Silius wrote poetry maiore cura quam ingenio (with more eagerness than genius) has encouraged the view that Silius is a talented but mediocre and uninspired poet. The poem seems to have been mostly unknown in the Middle Ages. Petrarch's Africa was composed independently of the Punica, as the manuscript was discovered by Poggio Bracciolini in 1417 at the Abbey of Saint Gall during the Council of Constance.G. B. Conte A History of Latin Literature (Baltimore, 1994) p. 495. Julius Caesar Scaliger's harsh opinion of Silius damaged his reputation.von Albrecht, p. 969. Many authors were familiar with Silius' work, such as Montaigne, Milton, Dryden (who considered him better than Lucan), Gibbon, and Alexander Pope.E. Bassett \\"Silius Italicus in England\\" in Classical Philology 1953, pp. 155-168. Joseph Addison particularly includes many quotations of Silius in his Dialogue on Medals as does Thomas Macaulay in his works.E. Bassett pp. 166-168. Interest in Silius mostly vanished in the 19th century.E. Bassett, p. 168 As for visual arts, Raphael's Vision of the Knight is a treatment of Silius' choice of Scipio. Despite Silius' poor reputation, classical scholars with their renewed interest in later Imperial epic seem to be finally turning their attentions to Silius' poetry.

The barges that at one time lined the quaysides are now replaced by pleasure craft. Near to the town are the ruined remains of the early Christian church of Ullard, founded by Saint Fiachra in the seventh century. St Fiachra subsequently moved to France, where he is known as St Fiacre, and founded the celebrated monastery at Meaux. He is the patron saint of gardeners and taxi drivers; French cabs are often known as fiacres in his honour. Some few miles downstream from Graiguenamanagh the ruins of the ancient monastic establishment at St. Mullins are situated in an area of great beauty and historic interest. Graiguenamanagh.

It is located near Drogheda on the R132 regional road. In 1641, the Battle of Julianstown was fought here during the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Julianstown is situated on the River Nanny () which flows into the sea at Laytown, about 3 km away. The village has both Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland churches, a National Primary school and a public house. History The Parish of Julianstown is situated in the Barony of Lower Duleek and County Meath, and the parish is part of the Roman Catholic Union of Stamullen. Julianstown is significant in that it contains a bridge across the river Nanny on the road between Dublin and Belfast.Peter O'Reilly. Rivers of Ireland: A Flyfisher's Guide. Stackpole Books, Apr 1, 2003, p. 226. One of the earliest mentions of Julianstown commemorates the Battle of Julianstown in 1641, which took place near the bridge. Indeed, there is a commemorative plaque on the bridge erected by Billy Butlin in the 1960s. Towards the south of the village is the smaller river Bradan (), which flows into the sea at Mosney. Julianstown was the seat of the Moore family who lived in Julianstown House and occupied the land that now contains the townland of Julianstown West. Taylor and Skinner's 1783 Road Map of Ireland refers to the Moore seat and also shows the Church of Ireland Church which still stands today. There is little evidence of any other habitation at that time. Taylor and Skinner also show the milestone in the centre of the village marking 20 Irish miles to Dublin. This milestone can still be seen today. There is further mention of William Moore in Lewis' Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837). The Moores leased the land from Anglo-Irish landlords, including Anna Disney, the wife of Brabazon William Disney, Dean of Armagh. The land on which the present village sits was leased to Francis and Mary Thornburgh (née Moore) in 1763 by William Moore. In the lease the land was described as > ….. all that dwelling house offices orchard and garden thereunto adjoining > known by the name of the Blackhorse Head Inn situate near Julianstown Bridge > aforesaid together with the piece of parcel of ground opposite said house > containing by common estimation 300 feet in length and 73 feet in depth more > or less formerly known by the name of the Malt House bounded on the East by > the Turnpike Road and on the North by the said William Moore's ground > adjoining the lands called the Corroge with two cabins or tenements standing > thereon all of which lands and premises are situate in the Barony of Duleek > and County of Meath. The land was further subleased to Major Charles Pepper of nearby Ballygarth Castle in 1801. In 1856 Pepper made his lease perpetual under legislation of the time, with much of the village center being built by the Pepper family. Around 1889 the cottages in the village, known as the Swiss Cottages, were built for the estate workers. The original public house in Julianstown was called the Black Horse Inn, and was mail coach inn, where the Lime Kiln pub and restaurant are now situated. An important part of Julianstown heritage is the history of milling. In the 19th century fourteen mills operated along the Nanny either flax or cornmills. The village became inhabited in the early 19th century and in 1869 a forge was established by Bartholomew Tiernan on land adjacent to the Nanny River, some of his metalwork, commissioned for the cottages can still be seen to this day in Julianstown. Indeed, in the past Julianstown had a dispensary, courthouse, telephone exchange, a shop, a quarry, a lime kiln and a Garda barracks. Local legends The history of East Meath and Julianstown, is very much interwoven with that of St. Patrick who is reputed to have put a curse on the river Nanny, for which reason no salmon are found in the river. Tradition also has it that the Saint made his first convert, who was named Benignus, now Benignus of Armagh, in Mosney Wood, using water from a nearby well to baptise him. Located within the parish of Julianstown, about 3 kilometers outside of the village, near where the Nanny enters the sea, there is a bee-hive shaped tumulus on the north bank, locally known as Laogh's Tomb. Education Julianstown has one primary school, Whitecross National School, founded in 1826 (). , a new state-of-the-art building is being constructed, with the 1980s extensions being demolished. Churches, crosses, and holy wells The Keenogue cross is an interesting portion of a 15th century cross, whose original site is unknown. The shaft of the cross is carved on each of its four sides, framing at the bottom, the Crucifixion, Mary embracing the dead Christ, St. Lawrence, and St. James. Whitecross is the name of the townland within Julianstown, where the school is located, and derives its name from what was most likely a termon or boundary cross. It has since been destroyed. St. Patrick's well is a small natural spring just east of the railway embankment, roughly 100 metres south of Mosney station. St. Columcille's well is situated in Calliaghstown and is attributed the cure of warts and sores. There is a small statue surmounting the well, and it dates from the 14th century, and is carved from oolite stone brought from England.

It was the first of three movements in England associated with the charismatic artist and writer John Hargrave (1894–1982). The Kindred was founded in 1920. Some members continued into Hargrave's Green Shirt Movement for Social Credit, which was established in 1931–32, and which became in 1935 the Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This was wound up in 1951. Hargrave claimed all three organisations to be part of one mission, telling his followers after the last title-change: 'We are the Green Shirts – indeed we are the Kindred – calling ourselves the Social Credit Party of Great Britain officially, but knowing full well who and what we are. \\"Whelm on me ye Resurrected Men!\\" – I give you that outcry of the Kin in 1927.' The mission was the belief that Kibbo Kift training would produce a core of healthy and creative individuals through whom the human race would evolve into a society without war, poverty and wasted lives. The Kibbo Kift held that individual character strengthened by mental discipline was the key to the future, not mass movements based on groups defined by class, race or nation states. Origins The Kindred was formed at a meeting held on 18 August 1920 at the offices of the Charity Organisation Society. Besides Hargrave, the movers were Mrs Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, a former suffragette and Theosophist-inclined pacifist; and Dr C. K. Cullen, socialist-inclined medical officer in East London and a youth leader at the Camelot Youth Club in Poplar. All three shared a broad vision of creating a new model for character–building youth groups, a progressive, co-educational and non- militaristic alternative to the Boy Scouts. However, there were differences. In the early years of the Kibbo Kift, there were ideological and personal wranglings over the new organisation, from which Hargrave emerged in 1924 as the 'Head Man'. Hargrave (aka 'White Fox'), artist, author and Boy Scout Commissioner for Woodcraft and Camping, had become disenchanted with the increasingly militaristic tendency in the Scout movement after World War I. Soon after the formation of the Kindred, Hargrave was expelled from the Scouts by Scout founder Robert Baden-Powell. According to Hargrave, Baden-Powell acted with extreme reluctance and only after some wealthy backers had threatened to withdraw funding from the Scouts unless he was expelled.Hargrave, in an interview with the historian James Webb. Webb, James The Occult Establishment, Richard Drew, 1981. The Kibbo Kift did indeed offer an alternative to the Scouts: it was open to both sexes and all ages. The ideas of world peace and the regeneration of urban man through the open-air life replaced the nationalism and militarism Hargrave had detested in the post-World War I Scouts. In its mixture of woodcraft, ritual and handicraft, it had much in common with the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry and the British Camp Fire Girls, which Hargrave knew through his wife, Ruth Clark, who led a Camp Fire Girls group at the Garden School run by the Theosophical Educational Trust in St John's Wood. The school moved in 1920 to Ballinger Grange in Buckinghamshire where it became something of a Kibbo Kift centre.  Beliefs  The words Kibbo Kift come from archaic Cheshire dialect used to indicate 'proof of great strength'.Pollen, Annebella, 'The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift: Intellectual Barbarians', Donlon Books, 2015. The group's initials have led some to assume a relationship to the Ku Klux Klan but this has no basis in fact (and Hargrave took great pains to correct this misapprehension in the popular press during the group's lifetime). Kibbo Kift had interests in regional geography and world culture that coexisted with passionate ideas about national identity. The group has been claimed to be 'the only genuine English national movement of modern times'.Professor L.P. Elwell-Smith, Introduction to John Hargrave, The Confession of the Kibbo Kift, London, 1927; facsimile 1979. In 1920 Hargrave explained what the distinctive words meant: :Kibbo Kift is an old English expression meaning literally proof of great strength – or The Strong. So today, in the woodcraft camp we speak of: :KIBBO KIFT – meaning the Idea and Ideal of the Great Outdoor Trail and Open Air Education :THE KIBBO KIFT – meaning the Woodcraft Kindred, or the people who follow the great Woodcraft Trail :TO BE KIBBO KIFT – meaning to be a good camper and woodcrafter, to be a clean, strong, upright man (woman or child). The movement drew heavily on the woodcraft ideas of naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton (also a key part of the early Scout programme). Hargrave also imported into the movement his fondness for 'symbology', art and ritual – drawing his ideas on art from Jane Ellen Harrison, and on education from G.Stanley Hall's then fashionable theory of 'recapitulation'. Kibbo Kift was also strongly influenced by ideas about myth and religion from James Frazer's popular anthropological study, The Golden Bough. In the second half of the 1920s the Kindred's educational ideas tended to be swamped by Hargrave's enthusiasm for the economic theory of Social Credit, but the faith in ritual and ceremony remained strong. According to Hargrave in 1924: 'The Ceremonial System of the Kibbo Kift with all its Colour and Symbolism, has been, is, and must always remain vital to the expression of our ideals and to our method of propaganda. Other movements can go on with their everlasting, excessively dull and too often fruitless meetings, manifestos, reports and resolutions. They are not for us.' Inspiration for the more concealed of Kibbo Kift rituals came from a range of hermetic sources including the writings of Aleister Crowley. Activities Those who joined the Kibbo Kift had to sign up to a lengthy covenant, which set out some great Utopian ideals. In many aspects it resembled American President Woodrow Wilson's fourteen-point blueprint for world peace at the close of the Great War. The establishment of a League of Nations Union as well as H. G. Wells's more far-reaching call for a World State were key touchstones for Kibbo Kift policies. A shorter, more personal, 'Declaration' abbreviated the covenant and was used especially for younger members: :I wish to be Kibbo Kift and to :#Camp out and keep fit :#Help others :#Learn how to make things :#Work for world peace and brotherhoodCovenant forms and recruitment leaflets held in the Kibbo Kift archive at the Museum of London'' Kinsmen and women were organised into 'Things' (districts), Clans (groups), Tribes (groups with children, such as scout patrols or classes from a school) and Lodges (groups of adults). There was also room for 'Lone Kinsmen', who kept up with the movement through newsletters: The Mark (1922–23), The Nomad (1923–25), and Broadsheet (1925–38).Copies are in the British Library; the Museum of London (Kibbo Kift Collection); and the British Library of Political and Economic Science (Youth Movement Archive) Each individual took a 'woodcraft name': thus Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence was 'Lotosa' (Look to the Stars'). The correct costume had to be hand-made by each individual or 'rooftree' (family group), according to designs laid down by Hargrave. The everyday 'habit' of Saxon hood, jerkin, shorts and long cloak must have seemed outlandish in the English countryside of the early 1920s. The popular press also drew attention to the group's skimpy exercise costumes; these included brassiere-type tops for women and gee-strings or breech-clouts for men. By the late 1920s the movement's ceremonial occasions required brilliantly coloured surcoats or silk-embroidered robes, worn by the various office-holders such as the Tallykeeper, Campswarden, Ritesmaster and Gleeman. Hargrave himself was 'Head Man'.The Mark of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift is typical of the symbolism that can be seen in many of their designs. Its meaning is: Worship (The K sign) Forever (the Circle of Unity and Eternity) Life (the Flame) through Knowledge (the Tree). Or again, 'Worship Life Forever with Knowledge'. Groups devised their own local activities, such as mumming plays, weekend camps, weekly meetings and excursions to museums. All groups came together for the annual Althings (assemblies), Spring hikes and Autumn Gleemotes (festivals). The Kibbo Kift's central activities, hiking and camping, were elevated to the level of a spiritual exercise: all marked by colourful and impressive ritual, couched in language reminiscent of Norse Sagas and rich in Saxon archaisms. Hikes could be turned into 'pilgrimages', as for example in 1924 when the Kibbo Kift made a pilgrimage to Piltdown in Sussex, in homage to 'Dawn Man', a supposed early humanoid whose skull had recently been unearthed (later found to be a hoax). At the site the Kindred performed a ceremony, complete with fire rituals, psalm singing, ritual chanting and a plaster cast replica of the skull.The skull and its carved plinth can be seen in the 2015–2016 Whitechapel Gallery exhibition, Intellectual Barbarians: The Kibbo Kift Kindred. Kinsmen were not only required to make their own lightweight, one-man hiking tents (the first seen in England) but to decorate them with vivid, symbolic designs of their own devising. The movement included several talented art and craft teachers, including Kathleen Milnes ('Blue Falcon'), Winifred Tuckfield ('Iarmailteach'), a co-founder of the Knox Guild of Design and Craft, and C.W. Paul Jones ('Old Mole'). Consequently, the robes, regalia, tents, totems and artefacts can display an extremely high standard of craftsmanship.Many artefacts from the Museum of London's Kibbo Kift collection are now viewable online through the Museum's website: www.museumoflondon.org.uk/collections/collectionsonline Hargrave designed most of the movement's official visual symbols, including the striking banners and the 'sigils' (symbols) which were made into embroidered badges by Ruth Clark for the coloured surcoats of mandated officials. His designs for Kibbo Kift banners from the late 1920s are stronger and more graphic, probably a consequence of his work as a freelance advertising artist and copywriter, principally for Lever Brothers and Carlton Studios. The direct influence of commercial designers such as Edward McKnight Kauffer and Ashley Havinden is evident in Hargrave's style.  Members  The Kibbo Kift were never more than a few hundred strong at any one time but over a thousand members signed a covenant in total. Kinsmen and Kinswomen included former suffragettes Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Mary Neal and May Billinghurst, Evelyn Sharp (her husband, the journalist Henry Nevinson, was a passive supporter), the photographer Angus McBean, Ruth Clark, the mountaineer Mabel Barker (Patrick Geddes' god- daughter, through whom the Kindred became involved in Regional Survey work), the explorer Millican Dalton, Roland Berrill – later a founder of Mensa, and Rolf Gardiner – a folk-dance revivalist. Many teachers and art teachers were attracted by the movement's educational aspirations. Kibbo-Kift friendly schools included Matlock Modern School in Derbyshire and the King Alfred School in North London. A major Kibbo Kift Educational Exhibition was held at Whitechapel Gallery in 1929. The 'Advisory Committee' named on the Kindred's stationery did little more than lend their names to the organisation: they included Havelock Ellis, Maurice Maeterlinck, the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, H. G. Wells and Professor Julian Huxley. Patrick Geddes was the exception in taking a more active interest in the group. D. H. Lawrence followed the progress of the Kindred via the letters of Rolf Gardiner, and it has been suggested that Mellors in Lady Chatterley's Lover is based on an archetypal Kinsman. T.E. Lawrence is also said to have allowed Kinsmen to camp on his land. Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and Rolf Gardiner tried to link the Kindred with European youth groups (arranging for Hargrave's woodcraft books to be translated and published in Germany in the early 1920s). Although international Kibbo Kift groups appeared sporadically (the White Fang Tribe in Russia, for example) the only lasting European group was in Belgium, the Lawerce Lodge in Antwerp.  Changes  The growth of the Kibbo Kift had setbacks. In 1924, the South London co-operative lodges seceded from the movement. This was the culmination of a growing dissatisfaction with Hargrave's top-down decision-making structure and his tendency to make outlandish public claims for the organisation that deviated from the covenant and risked ridicule. in June 1924, a group of 32 signatories produced a circular leaflet stating 'That the administration of Kibbo Kift during recent months has been profoundly unsatisfactory'. At the 1924 Althing, Dr. Cullen, Gordon Ellis, and Joseph Reeves from the Royal Arsenal Cooperative Society, which had supported the Kindred financially, led the formal walk out. One of the departing members, Leslie Paul, formed The Woodcraft Folk, which outlived its parent organisation and still exists . In 1924, Hargrave was introduced to the theory of Social Credit. The theory was first put forward by C.H. Douglas, as early as the First World War. It was taken up by The New Age magazine which, under the radical leadership of A R Orage, enjoyed an influence out of proportion to its circulation.Wallace Martin, The 'New Age' under Orage, Manchester University, 1967. In the second half of the 1920s, Hargrave became progressively more preoccupied with Social Credit, seeing the Kindred as the megaphone, through which these esoteric ideas could reach the general public.For the megaphone metaphor, see the Kibbo Kift cartoon, no.96, 6 November 1928, reproduced on p.108 of Ross and Bennett (2015) By 1931, the Kibbo Kift was well on the way towards becoming a political movement with a single-minded mission: focussing on the state of the British nation and spreading the Social Credit Gospel to the unemployed ('surplus labour' in Hargrave's terms) in Britain's industrial cities. Again, the movement was split from top to bottom, but by 1932, the transformation was complete, and Kibbo Kift was no more. The Anglo-Saxon costume, camping, hiking and woodcraft were replaced by military uniform, marching and propagandising. The name was changed to the Green Shirt Movement for Social Credit, and later to the Social Credit Party of Great Britain. As the Green Shirts, the Social Credit Party played a role in the political street culture of the 1930s: marching, meeting and often clashing with the Black Shirts and the Red Shirts. The Public Order Act 1936, which banned the wearing of uniforms by political groups, was a great setback for a movement that relied on agit-prop, but it was World War II that provided the deathblow. The organisation was wound up in 1951.  Legacy  In 1976 The Kibbo Kift a rock musical, was put on at the Traverse Theatre for the Edinburgh Festival.Scottish Theatre Archive The musical, created by Judge Smith and Maxwell Hutchinson, transferred to Sheffield's Crucible Theatre, where, produced by Mel Smith, it played to great acclaim. This flurry of interest led to the formation of the Kibbo Kift Foundation, dedicated to preserving the documentary and material archive of the movement. The surviving artefacts, costume and regalia were lent to the National Trust Museum of Childhood at Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire, but in 1982 they were deposited with the Museum of London. The documentary archive went first to the University of Cardiff and then the British Library of Political and Economic Science. In 2015 over 300 items from the Museum of London's collection were made accessible online through the museum's website. The collection features strongly in Designing Utopia: John Hargrave and the Kibbo Kift by Cathy Ross and Oliver Bennett, published by the museum in 2015. An exhibition, \\"Intellectual Barbarians: The Kibbo Kift Kindred\\", exploring the group's artistic output, ran at Whitechapel Gallery, London from October 2015 to March 2016, co-curated by Annebella Pollen and Nayia Yiakoumaki. The exhibition showcased original garments, sculptures, furniture, paintings, photographs and ephemera from public and private collections, and was accompanied by a series of public events. The exhibition coincided with the first full-length book to examine the organisation's visual style and occult beliefs. Featuring over a hundred images, The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift: Intellectual Barbarians, written by Annebella Pollen, designed by Roland Brauchli, and published by Donlon Books, won a Most Beautiful Swiss Books award in 2015. A new generation of creative practitioners have found inspiration in Kibbo Kift. Artists and designers including Olivia Plender, Steven Claydon and Liam Hodges, as well as novelists (Matthew De Abaitua, Kate Atkinson) and musicians (Ganser), have used Kibbo Kift ideas and imagery in their work.

It is located at the junction of the N5 National primary route and the R368 in the north of the county. Notable features include the second-widest street in Ireland and the Strokestown Park House, an 18th-century mansion with the longest herbaceous border in Ireland. History Strokestown was the site of the estate of the Anglo-Irish Mahon family from about 1671 until 1982. On 2 November 1847 the patriarch of the family and landlord of the surrounding estate, Major Denis Mahon, was assassinated by several local men in an incident that became infamous across Ireland and Britain at the time. The killing was motivated by the removal of starving tenant farmers from the estate lands during the Great Famine of 1845. The killing of Denis Mahon did not halt the evictions, and eventually over 11,000 tenants were removed from the Mahon estate during that period. There is a museum commemorating the Great Famine of 1845 in the town. Mary Lenahan, of Elphin Street, Strokestown, an ancestor of former Irish President Mary McAleese, was among 16 people recorded in the Strokestown Estate Famine Archive as having received grain meal gratuitously on 23 June 1846. The archive was deposited in November 2008 in the Maynooth Archive and Research Centre in Celbridge, County Kildare. Name The Irish name of the town was originally Béal Atha na mBuillí and was anglicised as Bellanamully and Bellanamullia. The Irish name was edited down to the current Béal na mBuillí in the 1990s. This was done to fit the Irish town name on road signage. The town's name means \\"the mouth of the ford of the strokes\\", with the “mouth” referring to the Bumlin River that runs through the demesne and \\"strokes\\" referring to ancient clan battles that took place there. Others believe that \\"strokes\\" signifies the use of agricultural instruments, which would have been widely used in the past. Strokestown on Film Strokestown on Film, The Billy Chapman (1902-59) Collection is a DVD which consists of 31 short films of people and events in and around Strokestown. The films were shot over a five-year period starting in 1948. Included are sports days, Corpus Christi processions, weddings, agricultural shows, livestock fairs and FCA and fire brigade training. Annual events Strokestown hosts a number of events throughout the year. Around April/May, Strokestown hosts the Strokestown Poetry Festival, a prestigious event that is known throughout the literary world. The second weekend in September, the Strokestown Agricultural Show is held, including horse competitions such as dressage, arts and craft competitions, handwriting competitions, and more. During October, the Féile Strokestown, a traditional music festival is held. During December, the Outdoor Christmas Market is held on Bawn Street.

Originally, mincemeat always contained meat. Many modern recipes contain beef suet, though vegetable shortening is sometimes used in its place. Variants of mincemeat are found in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, northern Europe, Ireland, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. In other contexts mincemeat refers to minced or ground meat. Variants and history Homemade mincemeat English recipes from the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries describe a fermented mixture of meat and fruit used as a pie filling. These early recipes included vinegars and wines, but by the 18th century, distilled spirits, frequently brandy, were being used instead. The use of spices like clove, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon was common in late medieval and renaissance meat dishes. The increase of sweetness from added sugar made mincemeat less a savoury dinner course and helped to direct its use toward desserts. =A 16th- century recipe= > Pyes of mutton or beif must be fyne mynced & seasoned with pepper and salte > and a lytel saffron to colour it / suet or marrow a good quantitie / a > lytell vynegre / pruynes / great reasons / and dates / take the fattest of > the broath of powdred beefe.

A recipe for apple mincemeat appears in a 1910 issue of The Irish Times, made with apples, suet, currants, sugar, raisins, orange juice, lemons, spice and brandy.Weekly Irish Times (Saturday, December 3, 1910), page 49. 20th century By the mid-twentieth century the term \\"mincemeat\\" was used to describe a similar mixture that does not include meat, but that might include animal fat in the form of suet or butter, but could also substitute solid vegetable fats, making it vegetarian and vegan. Many recipes continue to include suet, venison, minced beef sirloin or minced heart, along with dried fruit, spices, chopped apple, and fresh citrus peel, Zante currants, candied fruits, citron, and brandy, rum, or other liquor. Mincemeat is aged to deepen flavours, with alcohol changing the overall texture of the mixture by breaking down the meat proteins. Preserved mincemeat may be stored for up to ten years. Mincemeat can be produced at home, often using a family recipe that varies by region or ancestry. Commercial preparations, primarily without meat, packaged in jars, foil lined boxes, or tins are commonly available. Mincemeat is frequently consumed during the Christmas holiday season when mince pies or mincemeat tarts are served. In the northeast United States, mincemeat pies are also a traditional part of the Thanksgiving holiday, sometimes served with a piece of Cheddar cheese, like apple pie. Etymology The \\"mince\\" in mincemeat comes from the Middle English mincen, and the Old French mincier both traceable to the Vulgar Latin minutiare and Latin minutia meaning smallness. The word mincemeat is an adaptation of an earlier term minced meat, meaning finely chopped meat. Meat was also a term for food in general, not only animal flesh. \\"Making mincemeat\\" of someone means defeating them easily and soundly at something.

It is the largest fishing port in the country and on the island of Ireland. It is located on the south coast of the county, north of Donegal Bay, near Donegal Town. Its Irish name Na Cealla Beaga means 'little cells', a reference to early monastic settlements. The town is situated at the head of a scenic harbour and at the base of a vast mountainous tract extending northward. In the summer, there is a street festival celebrating the fish catches and incorporating the traditional \\"Blessing of the Boats\\". , the population was 1,236. History Killybegs is the most important fishing port in Ireland, and its harbour is often full with trawlers. In 1588, Killybegs was the last port of call for the Spanish vessel La Girona, which had dropped anchor in the harbour when the Spanish Armada fetched up on the Irish coast during Spain's war with England. With the assistance of a Killybegs chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, the Girona's personnel were fed, her rudder repaired, and she set sail for Scotland, but was wrecked off the Antrim coast with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives. Fishing industry Killybegs is a natural deepwater harbour with a depth of 12 metres at low water spring tide at the new €50 million pier completed in 2004. The harbour is home to all the largest Irish midwater pelagic trawlers and a modest whitefish fleet, but it handles many other types of shipping as well. These include passenger cruise liners and mixed specialist cargoes. In recent years Killybegs has become the favoured port for the importation of wind turbines and is a service port for the offshore gas/oil drilling rigs. The town is the centre of the Irish pelagic fishing and processing industries, as it specialises in the processing and freezing of species such as mackerel, herring, scad, and blue whiting. The finished processed fish is exported to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Europe by freezer ships. However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town. This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.

It consists entirely of fine golden sand and receives large numbers of day-trippers during the peak of the tourist season. It is lifeguarded throughout the bathing season and is regarded as one of the safest beaches in Ireland. Donegal Carpets Killybegs is famous for its tapestries and carpets, some of which were produced on the biggest carpet loom in the world at the \\"Donegal Carpet Factory\\". The carpets, known as Donegals, are hand-knotted in the Turkish style. The carpets have adorned many important buildings in Ireland such as Dublin Castle, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Áras an Uachtaráin and internationally the Vatican, The White House, Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street and most state buildings around the world. The factory in Killybegs closed in 2003 and has been open since 2006 as the Maritime & Heritage Centre. The Centre provides information on the carpet making and the fishing industry. Tours are conducted daily and visitors can watch smaller carpets being made and try making a knot. There is also a ship simulator which is the most modern in Ireland.

Swainson was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He moved to Port Huron, Michigan, at the age of two, with his family. His father, John A. C. Swainson, of Port Huron, was a Democratic presidential elector for Michigan in 1964 and an alternate Michigan delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention. He was captain of his high school football team and an Eagle Scout. Swainson served in the United States Army during World War II with the 95th Infantry Division and lost both legs by amputation following a landmine explosion November 15, 1944, near Metz, Alsace-Lorraine. He was awarded France's Croix de Guerre, the Presidential Unit Citation with two battle stars, and the Purple Heart, all before his twentieth birthday. After months of convalescence and rehabilitation at the Percy Jones Army Hospital in Battle Creek, Swainson learned to walk upright and unassisted. Swainson received a B.A. from Olivet College, where he also met and married his wife, Alice Nielson. She accompanied him to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received a law degree in 1951. While there, he was elected student president of the law school. Politics Swainson was elected to the Michigan State Senate from the 18th District in 1954 and was reelected in 1956. In 1958, when Philip Hart was elected to the United States Senate, Swainson succeeded Hart as Lieutenant Governor of Michigan under Governor G. Mennen Williams. When the long-serving and popular Williams announced he would not seek re-election in 1960, Swainson decided to enter the race. He did so despite being pressured by influential Democratic Party members, including Williams, not to run in deference to three-term Michigan Secretary of State, James M. Hare. Swainson won the primary against the party favorite, largely due to strong support from labor unions. On November 8, 1960, Swainson narrowly (1.28% margin) defeated Republican Paul D. Bagwell, a Michigan State University professor, in the 1960 Michigan gubernatorial election. As a result, the 35-year-old Swainson became the youngest governor of Michigan in the 20th century.The \\"Boy Governor\\", Stevens T. Mason, elected at 24 in 1835, was younger. He was also the state's second foreign-born governor. Swainson's Lieutenant Governor was T. John Lesinski. His opponent in the Democratic primary, Hare, continued to serve as Michigan Secretary of State until 1971. During his two years in office, a tax was secured on the usage of telegraphs, telephones, and leased wires; court procedures and medical care for the elderly were improved, legislative pensions were excluded from both local and state taxes; and taxes on liquor, beer, and cigarettes were raised to fund educational programs. When the Bluewater International Bridge (which spans the St. Clair River between Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario) was paid off, Swainson used an executive order to cancel the $0.25 toll that had been collected. \\"Stoically\\", he effectively cancelled his own father's \\"$6,115-a-year toll-collector's job,\\" which John A. C. Swainson held since 1957. He appointed the first African American to sit on the Michigan Supreme Court. In 1962, Swainson was defeated by Republican George W. Romney, the chairman of the American Motors Corporation, who had never before held elected office. The win was attributed in part to Romney's appeal to independent voters, as well as to the increasing influence of suburban Detroit voters, who, by 1962, were more likely to vote Republican than the heavily Democratic city. (It also marks the only time in US history that a governor born in Canada was replaced by one born in Mexico.) Later years On June 23, 1963, Swainson accompanied the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Detroit mayor Jerome Cavanagh, and approximately 125,000 people on a \\"Walk for Freedom\\" march down Detroit's Woodward Avenue. The same year, he was also a member of Democratic National Committee from Michigan. He served as Michigan Circuit Court judge of the 3rd Circuit from 1965 to 1971 and as a Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court from 1971 to 1975. In 1975, he was accused of accepting a $20,000 bribe from a felon, who was seeking review by the Supreme Court. He was found not guilty but was convicted of perjury over his testimony to the grand jury. As a result, he resigned from the Supreme Court, was sentenced to 60 days in a minimum-security facility, and lost his license to practice law for three years.Michigan Supreme Court Historical Society John Swainson The criminal charges derailed his expected run to replace the retiring senator, Phil Hart. There are pundits who maintain that he was the \\"victim of an overzealous prosecutor.\\" He later became an antiques dealer and became president of the Michigan Historical Commission. In the later years, he often represented the state at the Detroit Highland Games and apologized for not wearing a kilt: \\"I don't have the legs for it.\\" His life's journey was described as being an inspirational story of personal redemption: \\"By 1985, his reputation was restored when he was appointed president of the Michigan Historical Commission. (Michigan Supreme Court. Michigan Reports: Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of Michigan. Rochester, N.Y.: Lawyers Co-operative Publishing Co., 1949 - 1998, Vol. 419.)\\" Death and legacy At the age of 68, Swainson died of a heart attack in Manchester, Michigan, and he is interred there at Oak Grove Cemetery. His wife, Alice, died on September 5, 2004 in Manchester at 77. During his life, he was a member of American Legion, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Elks, Lions International, Delta Theta Phi, and Boy Scouts of America. In the Boy Scouts, Swainson was an active leader of the local Order of the Arrow lodge and served as secretary. The Michigan Historical Commission established the Governor John B. Swainson Award in 1996 to honor him for his love of history and as one of the few public officials to have served in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of state government. The commission presents the award to state, county, or municipal employees who have contributed to the preservation of Michigan history even if such activities are not part of their primary job responsibility. Swainson's last public office was president of the Michigan Historical Commission as an appointee of Governor James Blanchard. His papers are 75.1 ft, collected at the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan. Particularly represented are documents regarding research, public policy, and programs concerning poliomyelitis and the Salk vaccine. Swainson was honored by an official portrait painted by Dorthea R. Stockbridge. The portrait was dedicated at a Special Session of the Michigan Supreme Court's Special Session.http://www.micourthistory.org/wp- content/uploads/pdf/2012/spring12.pdf The portrait hangs on the fourth floor of the Michigan Hall of Justice. Hanging in the Michigan State Capitol on the second floor 'Hall of Governors' is \\"his gubernatorial portrait [that] is notable for appearing unfinished.\\" It is said to be one of the most unusual portraits, a portent that Swainson's political career was not yet finished. The Republican legislature even authorized the painting of a more traditional replacement, which has not yet been accomplished. At the dedication of his judicial portrait, Swainson said he left the final judgement of his public career to history.

He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1922 to 1932. He was a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1938 to 1944, 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957. Background O'Connell was born near Knock, County Mayo as Thomas J. Connell, the second child of Mary Biesty and Tom Connell. As part of the Gaelic revival, his family adopted the prefix \\"O\\" to their surname in the early 20th Century. His father was a farmer who was politically active and a community leader. Family lore held that his father had been a Fenian who had taken part in the Fenian Rising of 1867. He was also an activist in the Land League and a member of the United Irish League. One of Thomas's aunts, Mary O'Connell, had been one of the first witnesses of the Marian Apparition at Knock in 1879. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this may have influenced the fact that Thomas was a devout Catholic throughout his life. From 1902 to 1916 he worked first as a national teacher and then as a school principal. In 1926 he became general secretary of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. In 1906 married Kathleen O'Connor, a fellow national school teacher. They had four children in the first five years of their marriage. A fifth child died shortly after birth. When Kathleen arranged for a substitute teacher to cover for her while she recovered from the loss of their child, she received a financial penalty from her employers for doing so. O'Connell was furious, and as a leading member of the INTO set upon a vigorous campaign to have the rule that prompted the fine removed. The campaign threw O'Connell into the national spotlight. O'Connell was able to use the old UIL connections of his father to contact John Dillon and other Irish MPs to raise the issue in the House of Commons, and eventually, the rule was dropped. The campaign was hailed as a great victory for the INTO and women teachers in Ireland. Political career At the 1922 general election, he was elected as Teachta Dála (TD) for Galway, and he was re-elected at the 1923 general election. O'Connell was able to utilise a strong grassroots organisation in the constituency as well as the vote of teachers to secure victory. At the June 1927 election he stood instead in the new five-seat Mayo South constituency, where he topped the poll, and he was re-elected at the September 1927 election. In Mayo, O'Connell relied on the support of Teachers, migrant workers on Achill Island who were reckoned to better understand what a labour party stood for than other parts of Ireland, and the support of the area around his family's homeland of South Mayo: Bekan, Knock and Ballyhaunis. A critical blunder for O'Connell and the Labour Party occurred during the 5th Dáil. In August of 1927, Fianna Fáil decided to enter the Dáil and it gave its support to the Labour Party's motion of no confidence in the Cumann na nGaedheal government. The plan was to replace it with a Labour-led coalition with Labour leader Thomas Johnson as President of the Executive Council. O'Connell was envisioned to be the new Minister for Education. The Labour Party was supported by Fianna Fáil and the National League Party. On the other hand, the Cumann na nGaedheal government had the backing of the Farmers' Party and most of the Independent TDs. When the vote was taken, John Jinks, a National League TD, failed to attend. O'Connell himself was also missing, as he was away in Canada attending a conference on behalf of the INTO. The vote of no-confidence was a tie, and thus the Ceann Comhairle was allowed to cast the deciding vote, siding with the government. A rare chance in Irish history to place a labour led coalition in government has been missed. =As Labour Party Leader= The 5th Dail collapsed after just four months in office, resulting in the September 1927 Irish general election. The election did not go well for Labour, and they lost all the seats they had gained in the June 1927 Irish general election plus an additional one. One of the casualties was Labour Leader Thomas Johnson. The Labour Party's rule stated the leader must be sitting Teachta Dála. As such, O'Connell was unanimously elected the new leader of the party, a position he would hold until 1932. O'Connell inherited from Johnson a not particularly disciplined Labour Party. Johnson himself commented privately that between 13 TDs and 5 senators, no two of them could ever agree on the fundamental values of the party. Labour TDs not voting in line with the rest of the party was more common than with the other parties. In October of 1931, the Cumann na Gaedhael government rushed to pass the Public Safety Act 1931. The act would allow the government to establish a military tribunal for hearing political cases as well as the right to suspend constitutional guarantees on their own discretion. It came in response to rising Irish Republican Army activity across the country but Labour and its members feared greatly it would trample civil liberties. An internal labour vote was held on the bill and by a margin of 3 to 1 they voted to oppose the bill. O'Connell denounced the bill in the Dáil, declaring it made a farce of the institution and that Cumann na Gaedhael might as well establish a military dictatorship in Ireland while they were at it. However, when the votes were cast on the bill, two Labour TDS broke ranks and voted with the government. Given the magnitude of such a fundamental vote, O'Connell felt he was forced to expel the two TDs from the party for their actions. Another issue O'Connell dealt with during his tenure was in 1930 with the Letitia Dunbar-Harrison affair, perhaps better known as the \\"Mayo Librarian Affair\\". Dunbar-Harrison had applied to become county librarian in Mayo, a position was that was vacant at the time. Ultimately the County Council refused to offer the position, on the stated reason she could not speak Irish but, as many felt, with the subtext being she was denied on account of being a Protestant. The issue ballooned and escalated into a national political issue with Cumann na Gaedhael supporting her appointment but the Catholic Bishops and many of the opposition parties opposing it. Perhaps surprisingly, the normally avowed non- sectarian Labour was amongst those opposing the appointment, with O'Connell working with the likes of the Archbishop of Tuam to advocate against it. From 1929 to 1930 he was president of the Irish Labour Party and the Irish Trades Union Congress. In 1935 he founded the Educational Building Society. Later political life He lost his seat at the 1932 election, did not contest the 1933 general election, and in 1941 he was elected to 3rd Seanad. In 1943, he was elected to the 4th Seanad by the Cultural and Educational Panel, but did not contest the 1944 Seanad election. The Cultural and Educational Panel re- elected him in 1948 to the 6th Seanad and in 1954 to the 8th Seanad.

It is in the parish of Kilkee, formerly Kilfearagh. Kilkee is midway between Kilrush and Doonbeg on the N67 road. The town is popular as a seaside resort. The horseshoe bay is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by the Duggerna Reef. History A mural on the strand of Kilkee commemorating the 1962 visit of Che Guevara. During the early part of the 19th century, Kilkee was just a small fishing village but in the 1820s when a paddle steamer service from Limerick to Kilrush was launched, it began to attract visitors. It has been a resort since then and was featured on the front page of The Illustrated London News as the premier bathing spot in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Gradually the town grew as the demand for holiday homes by the sea increased, resulting in a building boom in the 1830s. As demand for lodgings in Kilkee grew, several hotels were built. Along with these, three churches were built, a Roman Catholic church in 1831, a Protestant church in 1843 and a Methodist church in 1900, reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of the town in that era. Descriptions of Kilkee during the Irish Famine can be found in John Manners's travel narrative Notes of an Irish Tour, in 1846 and Sidney Godolphin Osborne's Gleanings in the West of Ireland published in 1850. Manners emphasises Kilkee's popularity as a seaside resort and comments on its overcrowded beach and dangerous waves:\\"Kilkee itself is the quaintest collection of little whitewashed cottages, some distinguished by the name of 'lodges,' that ever aspired to the dignity of a bathing-place. . . .The lodges are built round a little sandy creek, and here . . . plies the one bathing- machine which the decent liberality of Lady Chatterton presented to this Clare Herne Bay; and if you don't choose to wade a quarter of a mile among a hundred fellow-bathers over the said sands, you must do as I did, look out for some cranny among the black rocks, and trust to the mercifulness of the Atlantic waves, or to your own strength and skill, to avoid being knocked up against those scarifiers of sides and shins: may you fare better than I did this morning!\\" (Manners, 1849, pp. 55–61). Osborne extols Kilkee's scenic beauty: \\"Kilkee, [is] a small sea-bathing place about eight miles . . . [from Kilrush]. No traveller through this part of Ireland, should omit a visit to this little town; there is a very comfortable hotel, and within a walk of it, some scenery, which in its own way, can hardly be surpassed. I do not know that I ever saw a sea-view, that struck me more for its wild beauty, than that which is to be seen from the cliffs, which command the entrance to the bay, on which Kilkee is situated. The rocks are of a very dark stone; in places, quite perpendicular, and of great depth; the waves of the Atlantic rolling in huge breakers upon them, throwing up vast clouds of white spray against and over them, had a most magnificent effect\\" (Osborne, 1850, p. 20). On 30 January 1836 the Intrinsic, a ship from Liverpool bound for New Orleans, was blown into a bay near Bishops Island in Kilkee. The ship was dashed repeatedly against the cliffs and sank along with her crew of 14, of whom none survived. The shipwreck site is now called 'Intrinsic Bay'. A chartered passenger sailing vessel named the Edmond sank at Edmond Point on 19 November 1850. The ship was sailing from Limerick to New York City but was driven into Kilkee Bay by a storm. As the tide was very high, the ship was driven all the way to Edmond Point, where it split in two. Of the 216 on board, 98 drowned in the disaster. Exactly 50 years to the day after the Intrinsic sank, on 30 January 1886, the Fulmar sank just north of Kilkee in an area known as Farrihy Bay. The ship was a cargo vessel transporting coal from Troon in Scotland to Limerick, but never reached its destination. Of the 17 crew members aboard only one body was ever recovered. At some point during 28 and 29 December 1894, the Inishtrahull went missing somewhere near the Kilkee coast. At the time of the disappearance the ship was transporting a consignment of coal from Glasgow to Limerick but never reached its intended destination. The ship was only confirmed to have sunk on 3 January 1985, when a section of a port bow from a ship with a brass plate marked \\"Glasgow\\" was picked up by the Kilkee coastguards. In the 1890s, Kilkee had yet again another boom, when the West Clare Railway opened up to goods transport, improving commercial life in the area, as well as providing a relatively fast means of travel to and from the town. Many prominent people in society travelled to Kilkee including Sir Aubrey de Vere, Charlotte Brontë (who spent her honeymoon here), Sir Henry Rider Haggard, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In 1896, the Crown Princess of Austria visited the town. The entertainer Percy French was a regular performer in the town and an incident on the West Clare Railway on the way to Kilkee prompted him to write the song \\"Are Ye Right There Michael\\". Although it has become more developed and modern in recent years, the town retains some of its 19th-century Victorian feel. Kilkee has regularly been awarded the Blue Flag by the European Commission. In 2006, a statue of Richard Harris was unveiled in Kilkee by actor Russell Crowe. Economy Over the more recent years, during a period of rapid economic growth in Ireland known as the 'Celtic Tiger', Kilkee underwent considerable expansion with the development of hotels, estates and other forms of housing. During this period, the beach or \\"horse shoe\\" bay was crowded as the population expanded to 25,000 during the summer months, although this peak has fallen significantly from 2008 onwards as the Irish financial crisis has prevented as much people from visiting the town for the summer. The town's main source of income is still the tourism sector and therefore many recreational places have been established, including restaurants, pubs and cafés. After the last weekend of August the town empties and many businesses close until the next summer, creating a much slower pace of life compared to the hectic summer months. This means that if the local businesses do not have a good summer in terms of sales, they might suffer financially for the rest of the year. Summer holidays in 1950s Kilkee are evocatively described in Homan Potterton's memoir, Rathcormick (2001). Sport Along with bathing on the strand, swimmers can choose from the Pollock Holes, New Found Out and Byrnes Cove. The Pollock Holes, which is also known as Duggerna Reef, are three natural rock-enclosed pools, with water that is changed by every tide. This not only brings in fresh water, but replenishes the marine life in the many rock pools surrounding it. The diving boards at New Found Out allow for dives of up to 13 metres (45 feet) into the open sea. The annual diving competition is held at these boards. Every year there are many participants in the Bay Swim, a race of roughly a mile from the east end of the town to the west across the bay. The race starts at Byrnes Cove, a sheltered cove situated close to George's Head, a prominent headland in the town. In 2011 nearly 200 people took part in the swim. There is also a mini bay swim for children under fourteen, from Sandy Cove to the Pier. The last weekend in June sees an influx of triathletes as Kilkee hosts the \\"Hell of the West Triathlon\\", the longest-running triathlon in the country. This is one of the biggest and toughest triathlons on the Irish Triathlon calendar with upwards of 600 athletes taking part in a 1500-metre swim, 45 km cycle and finishing with a 10 km road race. Kilkee has a reputation as a place to enjoy diving. Jacques Cousteau declared that it was the best place in Europe for diving, and one of the top five in the world. The Kilkee Dive Centre is a fully equipped SCUBA diving centre which caters to both beginners and experts. Divers can go to depths from 10 metres (32 feet) to 45 metres (147 feet). The diverse marine life in the reefs around the bay attract divers from around the world. A version of racquetball (not squash, as is often incorrectly stated) has been played against the high sandstone walls in the West End for generations, and it is possible that the rules were codified in Kilkee before racquetball was standardised anywhere else. The main trophy, the Tivoli cup, was first competed for in Kilkee in 1935; racquetball in its current form was not codified internationally until 1950. Richard Harris, who would go on to become an internationally known actor, won the cup four years in a row, from 1948 to 1951, a record surpassed by no one to this day. The Strand Races are horse races contested annually on the Kilkee strand. They first began in the 19th century on the sand-hills where the golf club is now. The races are normally held over two days in September, when the summer season is drawing to a close. The course is made by placing poles on the beach and when the tide goes out the races begin. Traditionally it was a celebration for farmers when the harvesting season is over. Kilkee has a strong GAA tradition, where the local team is known as St. Senan's. The club has won many county finals at all levels and has reached two Munster Senior Football Final deciders. The people of the town are proud of their strong history with Gaelic sports, particularly in football as the club has won many titles over the years. Kilkee is popular with walkers as different routes stretch out in every direction from the bay. The most popular walk is the cliff walk, which involves walking up the Dunlicky Road and then turning right onto the cliffs by Intrinsic Bay, following the path until you eventually end up at the Pollack Holes. The East End of the town is home to an 18-hole golf course. The first and second tees overlook the Atlantic Ocean and the third tee overlooks Chimney Bay. A short lived greyhound racing track was opened by the Kilkee Greyhound Racing Company on 2 July 1936. The land and assets of the track (behind the Olympia Hall and Merton Square) were put up for sale in 1942. Transport Kilkee Strand Before the West Clare Railway opened in 1887, the only way to get to the town was by paddle steamer from Limerick to Kilrush and then by horse and cart from there. This service ran from 1816 until 1918 but was stopped after World War I due to the popularity of the railway, although for many years the railway and steamer services ran together with a special \\"Steamer Express\\" train to and from Kilkee. After the railway closed in 1961, the only way to get to the resort was by car but as the mainline rail system now connects Limerick and Galway to Ennis, it is still possible to get the train as far as Ennis. Although the only bus routes offered by Bus Éireann from Kilkee are to Kilrush, Ennis and Limerick (via Shannon Airport), it is possible to get to Cork or even Dublin through connecting buses or trains. For international visitors the closest airport is in Shannon. Shannon airport offers services to Europe, the USA and Canada. Cois Fharraige Kilkee hosted the former Cois Fharraige festival in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Each year the festival was held over three days in September and consisted of live music and water sport events including a surf competition in Spanish Point. It was notable as Ireland's first surfing and music festival. Although Cois Fharraige was a new event it managed to attract some well-known bands over the three years it was organised, such as Republic of Loose, The Coronas, The Blizzards, Noah and the Whale, Ocean Colour Scene, Laura Izibor and Delorentos.

Toneilli's ms Elogi delli uomini illustri Toscani, noted by William Shepherd, The Life of Poggio Bracciolini – 30 October 1459), usually referred to simply as Poggio Bracciolini, was an Italian scholar and an early Renaissance humanist. He was responsible for rediscovering and recovering many classical Latin manuscripts, mostly decaying and forgotten in German, Swiss, and French monastic libraries. His most celebrated finds are De rerum natura, the only surviving work by Lucretius, De architectura by Vitruvius, lost orations by Cicero such as Pro Sexto Roscio, Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria, Statius' Silvae, and Silius Italicus's Punica, as well as works by several minor authors such as Frontinus' De aquaeductu, Ammianus Marcellinus, Nonius Marcellus, Probus, Flavius Caper, and Eutyches.  Birth and education  Poggio di Guccio (the surname Bracciolini was added during his career)Paolo Piccardi. \\"Alcuni contratti di Poggio Bracciolini\\" was born at the village of Terranuova, since 1862 renamed in his honour Terranuova Bracciolini, near Arezzo in Tuscany. Taken by his father to Florence to pursue the studies for which he appeared so apt, he studied Latin under Giovanni Malpaghino of Ravenna, the friend and protégé of Petrarch. His distinguished abilities and his dexterity as a copyist of manuscripts brought him into early notice with the chief scholars of Florence: both Coluccio Salutati and Niccolò de' Niccoli befriended him. He studied notarial law, and, at the age of twenty-one he was received into the Florentine notaries' guild, the Arte dei giudici e notai.  Career and later life  In October 1403, on high recommendations from Salutati and Leonardo Bruni (\\"Leonardo Aretino\\") he entered the service of Cardinal Landolfo Maramaldo, Bishop of Bari, as his secretary, and a few months later he was invited to join the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs in the Roman Curia of Pope Boniface IX, thus embarking on eleven turbulent years during which he served under four successive popes (1404–1415); first as scriptor (writer of official documents), soon moving up to abbreviator, then scriptor penitentiarius, and scriptor apostolicus. Under Martin V he reached the top rank of his office, as Apostolicus Secretarius, papal secretary. As such he functioned as a personal attendant (amanuensis) of the Pope, writing letters at his behest and dictation, with no formal registration of the briefs, but merely preserving copies. He was esteemed for his excellent Latin, his extraordinarily beautiful book hand, and as occasional liaison with Florence, which involved him in legal and diplomatic work. Throughout his long office of 50 years, Poggio served a total of seven popes: Boniface IX (1389–1404), Innocent VII (1404–1406), Gregory XII (1406–1415), Antipope John XXIII (1410–1415), Martin V (1417–1431), Eugenius IV (1431–1447), and Nicholas V (1447−1455). While he held his office in the Curia through that momentous period, which saw the Councils of Constance (1414–1418), in the train of Pope John XXIII, and of Basel (1431–1449), and the final restoration of the papacy under Nicholas V (1447), he was never attracted to the ecclesiastical life (and the lure of its potential riches). In spite of his meager salary in the Curia, he remained a layman to the end of his life. The greater part of Poggio's long life was spent in attendance to his duties in the Roman Curia at Rome and the other cities the pope was constrained to move his court. Although he spent most of his adult life in his papal service, he considered himself a Florentine working for the papacy. He actively kept his links to Florence and remained in constant communication with his learned and influential Florentine friends: Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de' Niccoli (1364–1437), Lorenzo de' Medici (1395–1440), Leonardo Bruni (Chancellor, 1369–1444), Carlo Marsuppini (\\"Carlo Aretino\\", Chancellor, 1399–1453), and Cosimo de' Medici (1389–1464). = In England = After Martin V was elected as the new pope in November 1417, Poggio, although not holding any office, accompanied his court to Mantua in late 1418, but, once there, decided to accept the invitation of Henry, Cardinal Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, to go to England. His five years spent in England, until returning to Rome in 1423, were the least productive and satisfactory of his life.David Rundle, \\"The Scribe Thomas Candour and the making of Poggio Bracciolini’s English reputation\\", in English Manuscript Studies 1100–1700, xii (2005), pp. 1–25. = In Florence = Historia Florentina, 1478 Poggio resided in Florence during 1434−36 with Eugene IV. On the proceeds of a sale of a manuscript of Livy in 1434, he built himself a villa in the Valdarno, which he adorned with a collection of antique sculpture (notably a series of busts meant to represent thinkers and writers of Antiquity), coins and inscriptions, works that were familiar to his friend Donatello. In December 1435, at age 56, tired of the unstable character of his single life, Poggio left his long-term mistress and delegitimized the fourteen children he had had with the mistress, scoured Florence for a wife, and married a girl not yet eighteen, Selvaggia dei Buondelmonti, of a noble Florentine family. In spite of the remonstrances and dire predictions of all his friends about the age discrepancy, the marriage was a happy one, producing five sons and a daughter. Poggio wrote a spate of long letters to justify his move, and composed one of his famous dialogues, An Seni Sit uxor ducenda (On Marriage in Old Age, 1436).A silver-gilt reliquary bust in the form of a mitred bishop, bearing Poggio's and his wife's arms, made to contain relics of Saint Lawrence in 1438 or 1439, is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (James J. Rorimer, 'A Reliquary Bust Made for Poggio Bracciolini\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin New Series, 14.10 (June 1956), pp. 246−251) From 1439 to 1442 during the Council of Florence, Poggio also lived in Florence. =Dispute with Valla= In his quarrel against Lorenzo Valla—an expert at philological analysis of ancient texts, a redoubtable opponent endowed with a superior intellect, and a hot temperament fitted to protracted disputation—Poggio found his match.Lodi Nauta, \\"Lorenzo Valla\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP, 2009) Poggio started in February 1452 with a full-dress critique of the Elegantiae, Valla's major work on Latin language and style, where he supported a critical use of Latin eruditio going beyond pure admiration and respectful imitatio of the classics. At stake was the new approach of the humanae litterae (profane classical Greek and Latin literature) in relation to the divinae litterae (biblical exegesis of the Judeo-Christian \\"sacred scriptures\\"). Valla argued that biblical texts could be subjected to the same philological criticism as the great classics of antiquity. Poggio held that humanism and theology were separate fields of inquiry, and labeled Valla's mordacitas (radical criticism) as dementia.\\"Poggio concentrates all his literary skill on the task of leading Valla through a carnivalesque triumph whose itinerary goes from earth (the streets of imperial Rome) to the inferno (of Satan and his demons) to the Elysian fields of immortal heroes, and finally back on earth into Valla's miserable hut.\\" Described in Salvatore I. Camporeale, \\"Poggio Bracciolini versus Lorenzo Valla: The Orationes in Laurentium Vallam\\" in Joseph Marino & Melinda Schlitt eds., Perspectives on Early Modern & Modern Intellectual History – Essays in Honor of Nancy S. Struever (Un. of Rochester Press, 2001) p. 27−48; which is an extension of a previous article in Italian, \\"Poggio Bracciolini contro Lorenzo Valla: Le Orationes in L. Vallam\\" in Poggio Bracciolini 1380–1980 (Firenze, 1982), p. 137−161 Poggio's series of five Orationes in Laurentium Vallam (re-labeled Invectivae by Valla) were countered, line by line, by Valla's Antidota in Pogium (1452−53). It is remarkable that eventually the belligerents acknowledged their talents, gained their mutual respect, and prompted by Filelfo, reconciled, and became good friends. Shepherd finely comments on Valla's advantage in the literary dispute: the power of irony and satire (making a sharp imprint on memory) versus the ploddingly heavy dissertation (that is quickly forgotten). These sportive polemics among the early Italian humanists were famous, and spawned a literary fashion in Europe which reverberated later, for instance, in Scaliger's contentions with Scioppius and Milton's with Salmasius. Erasmus, in 1505, discovered Lorenzo Valla's Adnotationes in Novum Testamentum (New Testament Notes), which encouraged him to pursue the textual criticism of the Holy Scriptures, free of all academic entanglements that might cramp or hinder his scholarly independence—contributing to Erasmus's stature of leading Dutch Renaissance humanist.Marvin Anderson, \\"Erasmus the Exegete\\" (1969), Concordia Theological Monthly 40 (11): 722–746. In his introduction, Erasmus declared his support of Valla's thesis against the invidia of envious scholars such as Poggio, whom he unfairly described as \\"a petty clerk so uneducated that even if he were not indecent he would still not be worth reading, and so indecent that he would deserve to be rejected by good men however learned he was.\\" (Quoted in Salvatore I. Camporeale in his essay on the Poggio–Lorenzo dispute). = Later years and death = After the death, in April 1453, of his intimate friend Carlo Aretino, who had been the Chancellor of the Florentine Republic, the choice of his replacement, mostly dictated by Cosimo de' Medici, fell upon Poggio. He resolved to retire from his service of 50 years in the Chancery of Rome, and returned to Florence to assume this new function. This coincided with the news of the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans. Urb. lat. 224, 15th century Poggio's declining days were spent in the discharge of his prestigious Florentine office—glamorous at first, but soon turned irksome—conducting his intense quarrel with Lorenzo Valla, editing his correspondence for publication, and in the composition of his history of Florence. He died in 1459 before he could put the final polish to his work, and was buried in the church of Santa Croce. A statue by Donatello and a portrait by Antonio del Pollaiuolo remain to commemorate a citizen who chiefly for his services to humanistic literature deserved the notice of posterity. During his life, Poggio kept acquiring properties around Florence and invested in the city enterprises with the Medici bank. At his death, his gross assets amounted to 8,500 florins, with only 137 families in Florence owning a larger capital. His wife, five sons and daughter all survived him.  Search for manuscripts  After July 1415—Antipope John XXIII had been deposed by the Council of Constance and the Roman Pope Gregory XII had abdicated—the papal office remained vacant for two years, which gave Poggio some leisure time in 1416/17 for his pursuit of manuscript hunting. In the spring of 1416 (sometime between March and May), Poggio visited the baths at the German spa of Baden. In a long letter to Niccoli (p. 59−68) he reported his discovery of an \\"Epicurean\\" lifestyle—one year before finding Lucretius—where men and women bathe together, barely separated, in minimum clothing: \\"I have related enough to give you an idea what a numerous school of Epicureans is established in Baden. I think this must be the place where the first man was created, which the Hebrews call the garden of pleasure. If pleasure can make a man happy, this place is certainly possessed of every requisite for the promotion of felicity.\\" (p. 66) Poggio was marked by the passion of his teachers for books and writing, inspired by the first generation of Italian humanists centered around Francesco Petrarch (1304–1374), who had revived interest in the forgotten masterpieces of Livy and Cicero, Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375) and Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406). Poggio joined the second generation of civic humanists forming around Salutati. Resolute in glorifying studia humanitatis (the study of \\"humanities\\", a phrase popularized by Leonardo Bruni), learning (studium), literacy (eloquentia), and erudition (eruditio) as the chief concern of man, Poggio ridiculed the folly of popes and princes, who spent their time in wars and ecclesiastical disputes instead of reviving the lost learning of antiquity. The literary passions of the learned Italians in the new Humanist Movement, which were to influence the future course of both Renaissance and Reformation, were epitomized in the activities and pursuits of this self-made man, who rose from the lowly position of scribe in the Roman Curia to the privileged role of apostolic secretary. He became devoted to the revival of classical studies amid conflicts of popes and antipopes, cardinals and councils, in all of which he played an official part as first-row witness, chronicler and (often unsolicited) critic and adviser. Thus, when his duties called him to the Council of Constance in 1414, he employed his forced leisure in exploring the libraries of Swiss and Swabian abbeys. His great manuscript finds date to this period, 1415−1417. The treasures he brought to light at Reichenau, Weingarten, and above all St. Gall, retrieved from the dust and abandon many lost masterpieces of Latin literature, and supplied scholars and students with the texts of authors whose works had hitherto been accessible only in fragmented or mutilated copies. In his epistles he described how he recovered Cicero's Pro Sexto Roscio, Quintilian, Statius' Silvae, part of Gaius Valerius Flaccus, and the commentaries of Asconius Pedianus at St. Gallen. He also recovered Silius Italicus's Punica, Marcus Manilius's Astronomica, and Vitruvius's De architectura. The manuscripts were then copied, and communicated to the learned. He carried on the same untiring research in many Western European countries. In 1415 at Cluny he found Cicero's complete great forensic orations, previously only partially available.Kenneth R. Bartlett, \\"The Italian Renaissance. Part 1. Lecture 6\\" [sound recording], in Great courses, (Teaching Company, 2005) At Langres in the summer of 1417 he discovered Cicero's Oration for Caecina and nine other hitherto unknown orations of Cicero's.\\"Classical Scholarship\\"; Poggio's manuscript codex of eight of the orations, Vatican Library lat. 11458. Poggio's Latin colophon to one may be translated \\"This oration, formerly lost owing to the fault of the times, Poggio restored to the Latin-speaking world and brought it back to Italy, having found it hidden in Gaul, in the woods of Langres, and having written it in memory of Tully [Marcus Tullius Cicero] and for the use of the learned.\\" At Monte Cassino, in 1425, a manuscript of Frontinus' late first century De aquaeductu on the ancient aqueducts of Rome. He was also credited with having recovered Ammianus Marcellinus, Nonius Marcellus, Probus, Flavius Caper and Eutyches. If a codex could not be obtained by fair means, he was not above using subterfuge, as when he bribed a monk to abstract a Livy and an Ammianus from the library of Hersfeld Abbey. =De rerum natura= Poggio's most famous find was the discovery of the only surviving manuscript of Lucretius's De rerum natura (\\"On the Nature of Things\\") known at the time, in a German monastery (never named by Poggio, but probably Fulda), in January 1417. Poggio spotted the name, which he remembered as quoted by Cicero. This was a Latin poem of 7,400 lines, divided into six books, giving a full description of the world as viewed by the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (see Epicureanism). The manuscript found by Poggio is not extant, but fortunately, he sent the copy to his friend Niccolò de' Niccoli, who made a transcription in his renowned book hand (as Niccoli was the creator of italic script), which became the model for the more than fifty other copies circulating at the time. Poggio would later complain that Niccoli had not returned his original copy for 14 years. Later, two 9th-century manuscripts were discovered, the O (the Codex Oblongus, copied c. 825) and Q (the Codex Quadratus), now kept at Leiden University.The Earliest Surviving Text of Lucretius's De rerum natura (ca. 825); and The Rediscovery of Lucretius's De rerum natura\\", both in Jeremy Norman's From Cave Paintings to the Internet The book was first printed in 1473. The Pulitzer Prize-winning 2011 book The Swerve: How the World Became Modern by Stephen Greenblatt is a narrative of the discovery of the old Lucretius manuscript by Poggio.Stephen Greenblatt, \\"The Answer Man: An ancient poem was rediscovered—and the world swerved\\", The New Yorker, (August 8, 2011) Greenblatt analyzes the poem's subsequent impact on the development of the Renaissance, the Reformation, and modern science.Jimmy So, \\"The Book That Changed the World\\", The Daily Beast, (October 7, 2011)David Quint, \\"Humanism as Revolution\\", a review of The Swerve - How the World Became Modern by Stephen Greenblatt (The New Republic, September 28, 2011)Anthony Grafton, \\"The Most Charming Pagan\\", a review of The Swerve - How the World Became Modern by Stephen Greenblatt (The New York Review of Books, December 8, 2011). Friends Poggio cultivated and maintained throughout his life close friendships with some of the most important learned men of the age: Niccolò de' Niccoli (the inventor of the italic script), Leonardo Bruni (\\"Leonardo Aretino\\"), Lorenzo and Cosimo de' Medici, Carlo Marsuppini (\\"Carlo Aretino\\"), Guarino Veronese, Ambrogio Traversari, Francesco Barbaro, Francesco Accolti, Feltrino Boiardo, Lionello d'Este (who became Marquis of Ferrara, 1441–1450), and many others, who all shared his passion for retrieving the manuscripts and art of the ancient Greco-Roman world. His early friendship with Tommaso da Sarzana stood Poggio in good stead when his learned friend was elected pope, under the name of Nicolas V (1447−1455), a proven protector of scholars and an active sponsor of learning, who founded the Vatican library in 1448 with 350 codices. These learned men were adept at maintaining an extended network of personal relations among a circle of talented and energetic scholars in which constant communication was secured by an immense traffic of epistolary exchanges. They were bent on creating a rebirth of intellectual life for Italy by means of a vital reconnection with the texts of antiquity. Their worldview was eminently characteristic of Italian humanism in the earlier Italian Renaissance, which eventually spread all over Western Europe and led to the full Renaissance and the Reformation, announcing the modern age. Legacy 1597 engraving of Poggio Bracciolini = Works = Poggio, like Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (who became Pius II), was a great traveller, and wherever he went he brought enlightened powers of observation trained in liberal studies to bear upon the manners of the countries he visited. We owe to his pen curious remarks on English and Swiss customs, valuable notes on the remains of ancient monuments in Rome, and a singularly striking portrait of Jerome of Prague as he appeared before the judges who condemned him to the stake. In literature he embraced the whole sphere of contemporary studies, and distinguished himself as an orator, a writer of rhetorical treatises, a panegyrist of the dead, a passionate impugner of the living, a sarcastic polemist, a translator from the Greek, an epistolographer and grave historian and a facetious compiler of fabliaux in Latin. His cultural/social/moral essays covered a wide range of subjects concerning the interests and values of his time: * De avaritia (On Greed, 1428−29) - Poggio's first major work. The old school of biographers (Shepherd, Walser) and historians saw in it a traditional condemnation of avarice. Modern historians tend, on the contraryespecially if studying the economic growth of the Italian Trecento and Quattrocentoto read it as a precocious statement of early capitalism, at least in its Florentine form — breaking through the hold of medieval values that disguised the realities of interest and loans in commerce to proclaim the social utility of wealth. It is the voice of a new age linking wealth, personal worth, conspicuous expenditure, ownership of valuable goods and objects, and social status, a voice not recognized until the late 20th century.;Ann P. Lang, De Avaritia, p. 109-114 * An seni sit uxor ducenda (On Marriage in Old Age, 1436); * De infelicitate principum (On the Unhappiness of Princes, 1440); * De nobilitate (On Nobility, 1440): Poggio, a self-made man, defends true nobility as based on virtue rather than birth, an expression of the meritocracy favored by the rich bourgeoisie; * De varietate fortunae (On the Vicissitudes of Fortune, 1447); * Contra hypocritas (Against Hypocrisy, 1448); * Historia disceptativa convivialis (Historical discussions between guests after a meal) in three parts (1450): : 1) on expressions of thanks : 2) on the dignity of medical versus legal profession (a reprise of Salutati's 1398 treatment of the same subject, De Nobilitate Legum et Medicinae): Niccolo Niccoli, appealing to the lessons of experience, is arguing that laws are imposed by the will of the stronger to hold the state together − not God-given to rulers, nor a fact of nature − leading biographer Ernst Walser to conclude that \\"Poggio, in his writing, presents Machiavellism before Machiavelli.\\"\\"Poggio Braccioline legt in seiner Schrift Machiavellismus vor Machiavelli dar.\\" (Ernst Walser, Leben und Werke, p. 258) : 3) on literate Latin versus vernacular Latin in classical Rome; Poggio concludes that they were both the same language, not two distinct idioms. * De miseria humanae conditionis (On the Misery of Human Life, 1455), reflections in his retirement in Florence inspired by the sack of Constantinople. These compositions, all written in Latin − and reviving the classical form of dialogues, between himself and learned friendsDavid Marsh, The Quattrocento Dialogue: Classical Tradition and Humanist Innovation (Harvard Un. Press, 1980) − belonged to a genre of socratic reflections which, since Petrarch set the fashion, was highly praised by Italian men of letters and made Poggio famous throughout Italy. They exemplify his conception of studia humanitatis as an epitome of human knowledge and wisdom reserved only to the most learned, and the key to what the ancient philosophers called \\"virtue\\" and \\"the good\\". And thus, they are invaluable windows into the knowledge and Weltanschauung of his age − geography, history, politics, morals, social aspects — and the emergence of the new values of the \\"Humanist Movement\\". They are loaded with rich nuggets of fact embedded in subtle disquisitions, with insightful comments, brilliant illustrations, and a wide display of historical and contemporary references. Poggio was always inclined to make objective observations and clinical comparisons between various cultural mores, for instance ancient Roman practices versus modern ones, or Italians versus the English. He compared the eloquence of Jerome of Prague and his fortitude before death with ancient philosophers. The abstruse points of theology presented no interest to him, only the social impact of the Church did, mostly as an object of critique and ridicule. On the Vicissitudes of Fortune became famous for including in book IV an account of the 25-year voyage of the Venetian adventurer Niccolo de' Conti in Persia and India, which was translated into Portuguese on express command of the Portuguese King Emmanuel I. An Italian translation was made from the Portuguese. Poggio's Historia Florentina (History of Florence), is a history of the city from 1350 to 1455, written in avowed imitation of Livy and Sallust, and possibly Thucydides (available in Greek, but translated into Latin by Valla only in 1450–52) in its use of speeches to explain decisions. Poggio continued Leonardo Bruni's History of the Florentine People, which closed in 1402, and is considered the first modern history book. Poggio limited his focus to external events, mostly wars, in which Florence was the defensor Tusciae and of Italian liberty. But Poggio also pragmatically defended Florence's expansionist policies to insure the \\"safety of the Florentine Republic\\", which became the key motive of its history, as a premonition of Machiavelli's doctrine. Conceding to superior forces becomes an expression of reason and advising it a mark of wisdom. His intimate and vast experience of Italian affairs inculcated in him a strong sense of realism, echoing his views on laws expressed in his second Historia disceptativa convivialis (1450). Poggio's beautiful rhetorical prose turns his Historia Florentina into a vivid narrative, with a sweeping sense of movement, and a sharp portrayal of the main characters, but it also exemplifies the limitations of the newly emerging historical style, which, in the work of Leonardo Bruni, Carlo Marsuppini and Pietro Bembo, retained \\"romantic\\" aspects and did not reach yet the weight of objectivity later expected by the school of modern historians (especially since 1950).Frederick Krantz, \\"Between Bruni and Machiavelli: History, Law, and Historicism in Poggio Bracciolini\\", in Phyllis Mack & Margaret C. Jacob, Politics & Culture in Early Modern Europe - Essays in Honour of H.G. Koenigsberger (Cambridge Un. Press, 1987), pp. 119–152 His Liber Facetiarum (1438−1452), or Facetiae, a collection of humorous and indecent tales expressed in the purest Latin Poggio could command, are the works most enjoyed today: they are available in several English translations. This book is chiefly remarkable for its unsparing satires on the monastic orders and the secular clergy. \\"The worst men in the world live in Rome, and worse than the others are the priests, and the worst of the priests they make cardinals, and the worst of all the cardinals is made pope.\\" Poggio's book became an internationally popular work in all countries of Western Europe, and has gone through multiple editions until modern times. In addition Poggio's works included his Epistolae, a collection of his letters, a most insightful witness of his remarkable age, in which he gave full play to his talent as chronicler of events, to his wide range or interests, and to his most acerbic critical sense. =Revival of Latin and Greek= In the way of many humanists of his time, Poggio rejected the vernacular Italian and always wrote only in Latin, and translated works from Greek into that language. His letters are full of learning, charm, detail, and amusing personal attack on his enemies and colleagues. It is also noticeable as illustrating the Latinizing tendency of an age which gave classic form to the lightest essays of the fancy. Poggio was a fluent and copious writer in Latin, admired for his classical style inspired from Cicero, if not fully reaching the elegance of his model, but outstanding by the standards of his age. Italy was barely emerging from what Petrarch had termed the Dark Ages, while Poggio was facing the unique challenge of making \\"those frequent allusions to the customs and transactions of his own times, which render his writings so interesting... at a period when the Latin language was just rescued from the grossest barbarism... the writings of Poggio are truly astonishing. Rising to a degree of elegance, to be sought for in vain in the rugged Latinity of Petrarca and Coluccio Salutati...\\"William Shepherd, Life of Poggio Bracciolini (1837), p. 461–2 His knowledge of the ancient authors was wide, his taste encompassed all genres, and his erudition was as good as the limited libraries of the time allowed, when books were extremely rare and extraordinarily expensive.Poggio sold 2 volumes of Jerome's epistles for 100 ducats to Lionello d'Este, marquis of Ferrara, which was a quarter of a top university professor's annual salary. When Niccolo Niccoli, who had the largest private collection of manuscripts and copies, died, his library contained 800 books. Good instruction in Greek was uncommon and hard to obtain in Italy. Proficient teachers, such as Ambrogio Traversari, were few and highly valued. Manuel Chrysoloras used to be occasionally credited as having instructed Poggio in Greek during his youth, but Shepherd cites a letter by Poggio to Niccolò Niccoli stating that he began the study of Greek in 1424, in Rome at age 44 (Shepherd, p. 6). Poggio's preface to his dialogue On Avarice notes that his task was made the harder \\"because I can neither translate from the Greek language for our benefit, nor are my abilities such that I should wish to discuss in public anything drawn from these writings\\"Poggio, On Avarice in Benjamin G. Kohl, Ronald G. Witt and Elizabeth B. Welles, The Earthly Republic: Italian humanists on government and society, (1978), p. 242. Consequently, his knowledge of Greek never attained the quality of his Latin. His best-efforts translation of Xenophon's Cyropaedia into Latin cannot be praised for accuracy by modern standards. But he was the first critic to label it a \\"political romance\\", instead of history. He also translated Lucian's Ass, considered an influence of Apuleius's Latin masterpiece, The Golden Ass. =Invectives= Among contemporaries he passed for one of the most formidable polemical or gladiatorial rhetoricians; and a considerable section of his extant works is occupied by a brilliant display of his sarcastic wit and his unlimited inventiveness in \\"invectives\\". One of these, published on the strength of Poggio's old friendship with the new pontiff, Nicolas V, the dialogue Against Hypocrites, was actuated by a vindictive hatred at the follies and vices of ecclesiastics. This was but another instance of his lifelong obstinate denouncing of the corruption of clerical life in the 15th century. Nicholas V then asked Poggio to deliver a philippic against Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, who claimed to be the Antipope Felix V — a ferocious attack with no compunction in pouring on the Duke fantastic accusations, unrestrained abuse and the most extreme anathemas. Invectivae (\\"Invectives\\") were a specialized literary genre used during the Italian Renaissance, tirades of exaggerated obloquy aimed at insulting and degrading an opponent beyond the bounds of any common decency. Poggio's most famous \\"Invectives\\" were those he composed in his literary quarrels, such as with George of Trebizond, Bartolomeo Facio, and Antonio Beccadelli, the author of a scandalous Hermaphroditus, inspired by the unfettered eroticism of Catullus and Martial. All the resources of Poggio's rich vocabulary of the most scurrilous Latin were employed to stain the character of his target; every imaginable crime was imputed to him, and the most outrageous accusations proffered, without any regard to plausibility. Poggio's quarrels against Francesco Filelfo and also Niccolo Perotti pitted him against well-known scholars. = Humanist script = a sample of Poggio's handwriting Poggio was famous for his beautiful and legible book hand. The formal humanist script he invented developed into Roman type, which remains popular as a printing font today (his friend Niccolò de' Niccoli's script in turn developed into the Italic type, first used by Aldus Manutius in 1501).Berthold Louis Ullman, The origin and development of humanistic script, Rome, 1960, p. 77  Works  * Poggii Florentini oratoris et philosophi Opera : collatione emendatorum exemplarium recognita, quorum elenchum versa haec pagina enumerabit, Heinrich Petri ed., (apud Henricum Petrum, Basel, 1538) * Poggius Bracciolini Opera Omnia, Riccardo Fubini ed., 4 vol.

Kilrush is one of the listed Heritage Towns of Ireland. The area was officially classified as part of the West Clare Gaeltacht, an Irish- speaking community, until 1956. History Kilrush has existed since the 16th Century but an older church ruin at the local churchyard suggests a much older history. It is thought the name Cill Rois is derived from Church of the Wood, which would fit with the church ruins location. It was not until the 18th century that it underwent major development. This development coincided with the succession of John Ormsby Vandeleur as the wealthiest landlord in the district. Of Dutch origin, the Vandeleur family was the most prominent landlord family in West Clare. They designed the layout of the town and many of the present day street names derive from Vandeleur family names. The Vandeleurs had settled in the area, as tenants to the Earl of Thomond on land at Ballynote, Kilrush, in about 1656. Giles, the first Vandeleur in the area was the father of the Rev. John Vandeleur who was appointed prebend of Iniscathaigh in March 1687. He was buried at Kilrush in 1727. In 1749, John Vandeleur, son of the Rev. John, purchased lands in West Clare to the value of £9,826.0.6, from the fortune that had been acquired as one of the Commissioners for applotting quit rents in Ireland John Ormsby Vandeleur built the large family home, Kilrush House in 1808. He owned much of Kilrush. With wealth achieved from a financially beneficial marriage and some political skulduggery, he decided to develop the town. A Scots businessman James Paterson, who had been a gunboat lieutenant until 1802, assisted him in this project. Paterson entered the oats trade in west Clare and in 1802 he was given a site on the square from Vandeleur and erected a six-storey building. The Napoleonic Wars (1799–1815) led to an improvement in agricultural prices. As Kilrush and the neighbouring countryside began to prosper, Hely Dutton reported in 1808 that the town was 'rising fast into some consequence'. He also acknowledged Paterson's role as a 'very active and intelligent inhabitant, who has been of the utmost benefit to Kilrush, and the adjoining counties'. In 1812 Paterson went into the shipping business and by 1817 he had a steamboat operating regularly between Limerick and Kilrush. The increasing popularity of Kilkee as a bathing resort brought many transit travellers to Kilrush. Monument to the Manchester Martyrs in the town In 1837 Samuel Lewis described Kilrush as a seaport, market and post town. The main industries, chiefly for home consumption, were flannels, stockings and bundle cloth. The main trade was corn, butter, pigs, agricultural products and hides. There were works for refining rock salt for domestic use, a tan-yard, a soap factory and a nail factory. Branches of the national and agricultural banks had been opened in the town and a constabulary police force was also stationed there. A small prison was built in 1825 and a court house in 1831. However the famine years (1845–1849) brought much hardship to Kilrush. Famine, evictions, fever and cholera reduced the population of south-west Clare to such an extent that it never again attained its pre-famine numbers. This was vividly dramatised for radio in 1980. In the post-famine era, the Vandeleur name became synonymous with the worst of landlord evictions, with over 20,000 evicted in the Kilrush Union. The Kilrush workhouse witnessed terrible deprivation and deaths. By that stage Hector Vandeleur had succeeded John Ormsby Vandeleur. Irish Eviction Vandeleur estate-T.Birmingham's house, Moyasta, Co.Clare with Battering Ram and soldiers outside July 1888 Kilrush commercially survived the setbacks of the Great Famine to a great extent as a result of the arrival of the West Clare Railway towards the end of the 19th century, developed into a bustling market town. There is a 1500-year-old monastic settlement at Scattery Island in the Shannon estuary which is about 15 minutes from Kilrush by boat. The settlement was founded by St. Senan. It features one of the oldest and tallest round towers in Ireland. Kilrush today The old port of Kilrush is now home to a 120 berth marina with automatic lock gate access to the Shannon Estuary, Scattery Island and the wild Atlantic Ocean. An impressive walled garden on the grounds of the old Vandeleur estate can still be visited today, though Kilrush House was gutted by fire in the late 19th century and finally demolished in the 1970s due to safety hazard. It stood where the main central car park now stands. The nearby Moneypoint power station began construction in 1979 and was commissioned between 1985 and 1987. This brought a large economic boost to the town and wider region, with Moneypoint establishing itself as one of the primary employers in West Clare. However, due to a governmental climate change plan to cease burning coal in Moneypoint by 2025, electricity production has fallen massively, at times producing nothing. https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/no-power-produced-at-moneypoint-for- seven-weeks-38973446.html In 2019, it was announced that the workforce would be cut by more than half, raising fears for the economic health of the area. https://www.irishtimes.com/business/energy-and-resources/esb-to-cut-jobs-at- coal-fired-moneypoint-power-plant-in- clare-1.3950579#:~:text=Up%20to%20100%20positions%20could,plant%2C%20which%20currently%20employs%20194&text;=Close%20to%20100%20jobs%20are,in%20demand%20for%20it's%20resources. The retail scene of Kilrush has changed massively in recent times, being almost unrecognizable to 2 decades previous. Large retailers such as Tesco (Opened 2008)) and Aldi (Opened 2009) https://clarechampion.ie/free-parking- aids-aldi-and-tesco/ have opened in the town, however a significant amount of smaller retailers have closed since the turn of the decade, almost decimating streets such as Moore Street. Kilrush was the host venue for the 2013 National Famine Commemoration. Offshore resides a large pod of Bottlenose dolphins who are resident year-round in the estuary. Dolphin-watching tour boats depart daily from the Kilrush marina, and the Shannon Dolphin and Wildlife Foundation has an information centre nearby. Kilrush has been twinned with the town of Plouzané in Brittany, France since 1982. In 2015, Kilrush won an Entente Florale gold medal, a European-wide horticultural and environmental competition. Kilrush represented Ireland in the ‘Village’ category of the competition for population centres of less than 5,000 people. Sport =Current sport= The town has an 18-hole golf course on the Ennis Road. The Western Yacht Club has in the last decades been rejuvenated, being one of the oldest yacht clubs in the world. Tennis, football (soccer) and athletics are catered for at the Cooraclare Road complex (under age and junior clubs). The rugby club is based on the Doonbeg Road. Kilrush Shamrocks GAA Club is located on the Killimer Road. The ground, Captain Tubridy Memorial Park is traditionally called \\"The Cricket Field\\", since it was used for that sport during the 19th century. The club was founded in 1886 and has recorded 21 county titles. Kilrush is home to the West Clare Triathlon Club, a multi- discipline sports club, which trains and competes in the following sports – swimming, cycling and running. Kilrush was the birthplace of a number of renowned sportspeople listed in the Notable People section below. =Former Sport= A short lived greyhound racing track operated from 1947 until 1950. A licence was granted on 1 October 1946 and the track opened on 31 May 1947, on the Cooraclare Road. Schools Kilrush has two primary schools and one secondary school. St. Senans NS is an English speaking school, the other is an Irish speaking Gaelscoil, which is called Gaelscoil Uí Choimin. The secondary school is called Kilrush Community School. Transport Kilrush is on the N67 (Kilcolgan – Tarbert) and N68 (Ennis – Kilrush). Kilrush is about 30 minutes drive from Ennis (40km). Close by is a ferry between Killimer and Tarbert (County Kerry). The town is serviced by buslines run by Bus Éireann and Clare Bus. The nearest airport is Shannon Airport. Kilrush was once one of the twin termini of the West Clare Railway from Ennis, the neighbouring town of Kilkee being the other (see Irish railway history). The railway closed in 1961 but a short section of the railway has been re-opened at Moyasta as a tourist attraction. One of the original steam engines on the route, the Slieve Callan has been lovingly restored. Kilrush Creek Marina is at the Atlantic Ocean end of the Shannon Estuary, with its lock gates providing protection from the tidal estuary.

Catholic parish Stained glass windows in Saint Senan's Church Kilrush, created by the Harry Clarke Studios in 1932 St. Senan's Well, Leadmore, Kilrush The town of Kilrush is in the parish of Kilrush in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. The parish churches are St Senan's in Kilrush and Little Senan Church in Monmore. The Catholic Emancipation resulted in restoration and construction of churches across Ireland. In Kilrush Colonel Crofton Moore Vandeleur donated a site in Toler Street and ₤500 for construction of St. Senan's. The foundation stone was laid in November 1839. The magnificent St. Senan's Church was erected under the stewardship of Fr. John Kenny, whose family lived at Tirmana in Kilmurry Ibrickane and completed under the guidance of Fr. Tim Kelly, who is commemorated on the centre aisle. The church was sufficiently complete for it to be opened on 29 November 1840. Rev. Theobald Mathew, who had been invited by Fr. Kelly, preached on 7 December 1840 at this, the largest church in the County. Kilrush was filled by an estimated 20,000 people, including many from County Kerry who had crossed on the steamer, the 'Garryowen'. Funds were raised for improvements over the years that included plastering the walls, improving the ceiling, altars, floors and seats, and building a wall and railing outside the church. In 1861 the spire was erected, the first in County Clare. The present sanctuary was built in 1881. The church was completely restored in 1906, with the addition of the wooden pulpit. Three stained glass windows on the west wall were commissioned in 1932 from the Harry Clarke Studios in Dublin.

There is a Dominican Priory in the town and King's Castle (or King John's Castle). The remains of medieval walls which encircled the settlement are still visible.  History  Kilmallock Priory Sarsfield Street Saint Mocheallóg built a church in the area in 6th or 7th century, and the town's name derives from the Irish Cill Mocheallóg meaning \\"the church of Mocheallóg\\". The town was of considerable importance in the late medieval period, ranking as one of the main urban areas in Ireland at the time. The Collegiate Church of St Peter and St Paul was built by 1241. Kilmallock was located in a position of some strategic importance, and in consequence the town frequently became a target during times of war. In 1571, the town was burned by the rebel Earl of Desmond during the Desmond Rebellions. Seventy years later, during the Irish Confederate Wars, the Dominican Priory of Kilmallock was attacked and destroyed by a Parliamentary Army under Lord Inchiquin in 1648. Its ruins are the best known historic landmark of Kilmallock. The local cemetery is the burial place of the noted eighteenth- century poet Andrias Mac Craith. Better known as An Mangaire Súgach, his best known poem is \\"Slán le Máigh\\", a song in praise of the entire Maigue valley when he was temporarily exiled from it. The house where he died still stands at the bottom of Wolfe Tone Street near the River Loobagh. The house known as Tigh An Fhile has information panels about the poet at the doorway. The town also has a small museum depicting the historic past of this once great Geraldine fortress town. It is located on the way to the Dominican Priory. During the battle of Killmallock the town saw bitter fighting in July 1922 during the Irish Civil War, when it was held by anti-Treaty forces under Liam Deasy and eventually taken by Free State troops under Eoin O'Duffy, which was an event which among others contributed to the dissolution of the short-lived Munster Republic. As part of a brief but vicious sectarian campaign in July 1935, arsonists burnt the Church of Ireland building to the ground, causing damage costing thousands of pounds.Article by Tim Fanning, page 20, Sunday Independent, 22 February 2009  Sports  The area is home to the Kilmallock Cycling Club, Kilmallock Athletic Club and also a centre for genetic horse breeding - with several stallion farms located in the district. Members of the local Kilmallock GAA club have represented Limerick in the Munster hurling and All-Ireland hurling championships. The club have won 11 senior county hurling titles, most recently in 2014. The club also won the Limerick Minor Hurling Championship last in 2010.  Economy  Kilmallock is twinned for socio- economic purposes with Croom in County Limerick, and has a wide range of services and businesses operating in the town. Transport The Dublin-Cork railway line passes by the town, but the station is now closed. The nearest train station is in Charleville, 5 miles south west of Kilmallock. Annalistic references From The Annals of the Four Masters: * M1571.4. James Mac Maurice took Kilmallock, not from a desire of obtaining its riches and various treasures, though its riches were immense, but because it had always been the rendezvous and sally-port of the English and Geraldines in their contests against him. Before sunrise in the morning those who had gone to sleep happily and comfortably were aroused from their slumber by a furious attack made by the warlike troops of the Clann-Sweeny and Clann-Sheehy, who were along with James Mac Maurice; and they proceeded to divide among themselves its gold, silver, various riches, and valuable jewels, which the father would not have acknowledged to his heir, or the mother to her daughter, on the day before. They were engaged for the space of three days and nights in carrying away the several kinds of riches and precious goods, as cups and ornamented goblets, upon their horses and steeds, to the woods and forests of Etharlach, and sending others of them privately to their friends and companions. They then set fire to the town, and raised a dense, heavy cloud, and a black, thick, and gloomy shroud of smoke about it, after they had torn down and demolished its houses of stone and wood; so that Kilmallock became the receptacle and abode of wolves, in addition to all the other misfortunes up to that time.

This lay on the west bank of the Owenbeg. Uí Ruairc (anglicised as O'Rourke) was the local Gaelic chieftain, based in nearby Dromahair, whose land was seized by the British and then granted to Sir Frederick Hamilton for his services in the European wars of the 17th century. As a result of his actions, Hamilton to this day is considered to have been a tyrant by the local people. He began building a new town on the east bank of the river, in the townland of Clonmullen, which he renamed 'Manorhamilton'. After the town emerged, the name Baile Hamaltuin was adopted by Irish speakers and its anglicised form 'Ballyhamilton' was for a time used by English speakers. ;Manorhamilton Castle The ruins of Manorhamilton Castle is a renovated castle ruin and tourist attraction. The castle was erected in 1634 by Sir Frederick Hamilton, who had been granted land in north Leitrim by the British government. The land had been confiscated from the O'Rourkes, the ruling clan of Breifne. Hamilton was a very unpopular overlord and faced frequent native rebellion before the Castle was burned by the Earls of Clanrickard (Burkes) in 1652.

Niccolò de' Niccoli (1364 – 22 January 1437) was an Italian Renaissance humanist. He was born and died in Florence, and was one of the chief figures in the company of learned men which gathered around the patronage of Cosimo de' Medici. Niccoli's chief services to classical literature consisted in his work as a copyist and collator of ancient manuscripts; he corrected the text, introduced divisions into chapters, and made tables of contents. His lack of critical faculty was compensated by his excellent taste; in Greek (of which he knew very little) he had the assistance of Ambrogio Traversari. Many of the most valuable manuscripts in the Laurentian library are by his hand, amongst them those of Lucretius and of twelve comedies of Plautus. The pursuit of ancient manuscripts was a dangerous and expensive task, agents working in the field at the time included Poggio Bracciolini. Niccoli's private library was bettered only by that of Cosimo de' Medici who was the pioneer of the first Florentine public library which was the largest in Europe at that time. Niccoli also possessed a small but valuable collection of ancient works of art, coins and medals. He regarded himself as an infallible critic, and could not bear the slightest contradiction; his quarrels with Francesco Filelfo, Guarino da Verona and especially with Traversari created a great sensation in the learned world at the time. His hypercritical spirit (according to his enemies, his ignorance of the language) prevented him from writing or speaking in Latin; his sole literary work was a short tract in Italian on Latin Orthography, which he withdrew from circulation after it had been violently attacked by Guarino. His fame as a Latin stylist was extensive, and many authors would submit to him their manuscripts prior to publication for correction; Leonardo Bruni called him the \\"censor of the Latin tongue\\". He is also regarded as the inventor of the cursive script, known today as Italic or Cancelleresca. This came about from his enduring study of ancient manuscripts and the numerous copies he made. Niccoli decided he would vary his copied manuscripts by using tilted lettering and as a result later on, when Italian printers first used Italic type, they chose Niccoli's lettering style. Niccoli was buried in the Basilica of Santo Spirito in Florence. He was in a great deal of debt prior to his death, after which Cosimo offered to cover all of his outstanding payments to debtors in exchange for control over his collection of 800 manuscripts valued at around 6,000 florins.

He was a Rōshi of the Rinzai school and was abbot of both Kenchō-ji and Engaku-ji temples in Kamakura, Japan. Soyen was a disciple of Imakita Kosen. Biography Soyen Shaku was an exceptional Zen monk. He studied for three years at Keio University. In his youth, his master, Kosen, and others had recognized him to be naturally advantaged. He received dharma transmission from Kosen at age 25, and subsequently became the superior overseer of religious teaching at the Educational Bureau, and patriarch of Engaku temple at Kamakura.Fields 1992, pg. 110 In 1887, Soyen traveled to Ceylon to study Pali and Theravada Buddhism and lived the wandering life of the bhikkhu for three years. Upon his return to Japan in 1890, he taught at the Nagata Zendo. In 1892, upon Kosen's death, Soyen became Zen master of Engaku-ji.Fields 1992, pg. 111 In 1893 Shaku was one of four priests and two laymen, representing Rinzai Zen, Jōdo Shinshū, Nichiren, Tendai, and Esoteric schools,Fields 1992, pg. 124 composing the Japanese delegation that participated in the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago organized by John Henry Barrows and Paul Carus. He had prepared a speech in Japan, and had it translated into English by his (then young and unknown) student D. T. Suzuki. It was read to the conference by Barrows. The subject was \\"The Law of Cause and Effect, as Taught by Buddha\\". Subsequently, Shaku delivered \\"Arbitration Instead of War\\".Fields 1992, pp. 126-7 At this conference he met Dr. Paul Carus, a publisher from Open Court Publishing Company in La Salle, Illinois. Before Shaku returned to Japan, Carus asked him to send an English-speaker knowledgeable about Zen Buddhism to the United States. Shaku, upon returning to Japan asked his student and Tokyo University scholar D. T. Suzuki to go to the United States, where he would eventually become the leading academic on Zen Buddhism in the West, and translator for Carus's publishing company.Fields 1992, pg. 128 Soyen served as a chaplain to the Japanese army during the Russo-Japanese War. In 1904, the Russian author Leo Tolstoy wrote Shaku to join him in denouncing the war. Shaku refused, concluding that \\"...sometimes killing and war becomes necessary to defend the values and harmony of any innocent country, race or individual.\\" (quoted in Victoria, 1997) After the war, Shaku attributed Japan's victory to its samurai culture. In 1905, Soyen Shaku returned to America as a guest of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Russell. He spent nine months at their house outside San Francisco, teaching the entire household Zen. Mrs. Russell was the first American to study koans.

The population was 626 in 2016. It is located on the west coast of Ireland, along the shore of Clew Bay, north of Westport. The N59 road passes through the town. The county town of Castlebar is approx 18 km east of Newport. The Black Oak River flows through the centre of the town and there are walking paths along its banks. Transport =Bus= Bus Éireann route 440, via Westport and Ireland West Airport Knock, operates once a day in each direction. On Sundays route 440 does not operate however Expressway route 52 provides an evening journey each way to/from Westport and Galway. =Rail access= The nearest train station is Westport railway station approximately 14 km distant. History Newport was established in the early 18th century by the Medlycott family. James Moore, working for the Medlycott Estate, designed the quay at Newport in a formal layout. The Medlycott family's land agent was a Captain Pratt. Pratt introduced linen manufacturing to the town under the management of immigrant Quakers who relocated to County Mayo from Ulster. It would appear that, although the immigrant Quakers found living conditions in Mayo difficult, the linen industry picked up in the mid-18th century and for the next forty years or so the town prospered around the industry.Land and Popular Politics in Ireland: County Mayo from the Plantation to the ... By Donald E. Jordan By the early 19th century it again fell into decline, and it was superseded as a port by the town of Westport seven miles to the south. At the end of the 18th century, the Medlycott Estate was taken over by the O'Donel family who built Newport House, now a hotel, overlooking the harbour. =Quakers in Newport= In 1719 a community of Quakers came to Newporthttp://www.cuanmodh.ie/newporthistsoc/quakerweavers.pdf under a Captain Pratt who established a colony of linen weavers in the town which was known as Ballyvaughan at that time. Quakers, due to their reputation of being honest and hard-working tenants, were sought after by the landlords of estates at the time. Quaker communities usually prospered wherever they went, but the Quakers in Newport were reported to be in poor circumstances, and they needed support and help from other Quakers across Ireland and further afield from whom they were now far removed geographically by their remote location. The nearest community of Quakers was based in Ballymurray, County Roscommon. The Newport Quakers appear to have had no meeting house, instead meeting for religious worship in each other's homes. With many deaths of their young people occurring within the community in the years after resettling in Mayo, a burial ground had to be established for them in the town. The linen business interests fell on hard times and life was a struggle with constant assistance having to be brought to Newport by visiting Quakers. By 1736 the Newport Quakers started to think about moving from their settlement. They were unable to find suitable marriage partners from within their own community as they were all closely related and this caused them concern. The Newport Quaker community struggled on for a few more years and eventually bought some land in Roscommon where they would be closer to the Quaker community at Ballymurray. During the winter of 1739/1740 the last of the Newport Quakers left their Newport land and homes and moved to County Roscommon where their lives would be less wretched. Some Quakers went to America to make new lives for themselves in the years that followed. =Convent of Mercy= The O'Donel family, who took over from the Medlycotts, were Protestant. However, George O'Donel's wife was a Catholic and he donated three acres of land on Barrack Hill to the Sisters of Mercy to build a convent in Newport. It was noted that when the foundations were being dug out for the new convent in 1884, many coins and buttons were unearthed, the buttons bearing the inscription of \\"Pratt\\". In 1887 the convent was completed and St. Joseph's Convent National School opened with a roll of 211 girls and 34 boys. The school was a success and numbers continued to grow. The nuns were a popular addition to Newport and local merchants donated gifts to the convent. In 1894, a lace school to train girls in the lacemaking industry opened and provided some industry - until the lace market collapsed after World War II. Due to rationalisation, the sisters vacated the convent in 1977 and took up residence in a rented building in the town. The convent managed Newport secondary school which opened in September 1956.http://www.irishidentity.com/extras/gaels/stories/reunion.htm However following the introduction of free education and free transport for second level pupils in the late sixties, the secondary school which had always experienced some difficulties in attracting a sufficiently large number of pupils was finally closed in June 1969.http://www.irishidentity.com/extras/gaels/stories/reunion.htm Since 1969 then, Newport pupils again travel to secondary schools in Westport. = Irish War of Independence = In May 1921, the town's coach-building factory - Kilroy Bros - was burnt by the IRA.

It is the largest town in the county, excluding Limerick city, and sits on the River Arra which flows into the River Deel. Newcastle West is in the middle of a great bowl-shaped valley in West Limerick, known one time as the valley of the Wild Boar, apparently due to the abundance of this animal here when the area was thickly wooded. The crest of the town carries the image of a wild boar. Newcastle West is on the N21 road from Limerick to Tralee, between Rathkeale and Abbeyfeale. In 2016, the population of the town was 6,619.  History  = Foundation and development = Newcastle West grew up around a castle, the ruins of which are located off the town square. The large castle ruins are well maintained. The castle was built by the FitzGerald family who arrived at some point after 1194, by 1298 the castle had been completed in stone. The town then came to be known as Newcastle, West Limerick, but over time the 'west' became part of Newcastle and the town was known by the current name Newcastle West. According to Begley, the parish was called Newcastle and Ardagh in 1704. Newcastle was joined with Monagea from 1722 until 1764 when it became a separate parish. Lewis stated that parts of Monagea and Killeedy were in the parish of Newcastle West. Two notable mentions included in the history of the diocese of Limerick were the first Monsignor in the diocese, Richard Baptist O'Brien in 1881, and Denis Hallinan who was P.P. here and later became Bishop. Sir William Courtenay, the local landlord, held of land in Newcastle West in the late 16th century. He was a staunch Catholic, and suffered persecution for his beliefs. His son George may have practiced his faith in secret. Their home was reputed to have had a room in which priests were hidden. William Courtenay was denounced in the House of Commons as a papist recusant in 1624. During the reign of Elizabeth I, three battles were fought near here. Tradition has it that the locals killed many of the Knights Templar. The town was sacked in 1302 and destroyed in 1315. Two of the Earls of Desmond died here. Garrett (better known as Gearóid Iarla) in 1399, and James, the 8th earl, in 1462. Markets were held on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Large numbers used to attend Thursday's hiring fairs for farm workers. Fairs were held on April 1, May 3, July 12, August 20, October 1, and December 10. The motto that goes with the town coat of arms is \\"As Dúchas Dóchas\\", which may be translated as 'Our Hope springs from our Traditions'. The town now has a population of around 6,600. The urban area has passed well beyond the old town boundaries which are due for redefinition. = 2008 flooding = On 1 August 2008, up to 20 homes were badly affected by overnight flash flooding in Newcastle West, in an incident described as a 'freak' occurrence. A number of people had to be rescued from their houses after the River Arra burst it banks following heavy rain. There were few injuries, however an elderly woman was taken to hospital after she was airlifted from her home suffering from hypothermia. 3,000 homes in Newcastle West temporarily lost power. The Killarney Road (N21) was temporarily closed as was the R522 to Dromcolliher and the Bruff line.  Business and commerce  The West Limerick and Newcastle West area has traditionally had a strong dairy and agricultural contribution to the local economy. Huge changes have occurred during the last 20 – 30 years seeing the expanding of the town as a services centre for West Limerick, also bringing an increase in population. Many people who work in Limerick City live in Newcastle West and its environs and commute the daily. However, Newcastle West itself is now a large centre of employment itself. Employers include Pallas Foods, Rettig Myson, Ballygowan Spring Water and Filtertek. There are dozens of businesses employing 10-50 including PSE Power Systems, Brian A Flynn, Brian Scully Services and Nolan Products. Hundreds are employed in the retail stores including local and international multiples. In recent times, there has been national success stories in e-business from local companies like HuntOffice.ie.Who are HuntOffice.ie at HuntOffice.ie Website and IrishTourism.com,IrishTourism.com Retail outlets and supermarkets in the area include Dooley's SuperValu, a Tesco, an Aldi, and a Lidl. The town is also has a number of clothes shops and fashion boutiques. A Street by the River  Education  Newcastle West has three primary schools: Courtenay Boys' School, Scoil Iosaf (an all girls school), and Gaelscoil O'Doghair (an Irish language school). The town also has three secondary schools, named Scoil Mhuire Agus Ide (English translation: the School of Mary and Ita), Desmond College and Gaelcholáiste Uí Chonba ( All Irish Second level school on the grounds of Desmond College).  Transport  Newcastle West is situated on the Irish national primary road N21, where it is joined by the R520, R521 and R522 regional roads. Newcastle West is forty minutes drive from Limerick City and an hour from Killarney. It is within a one hour drive of Shannon, and Kerry International Airports, and two hours from Cork Airport. The town is serviced by regular Bus Éireann buses and Dublin Coaches to Tralee, Killarney, Limerick and Dublin. The town was connected to the railway network until 1975, as part of the \\"North Kerry\\" line, from Limerick city to Tralee, via Rathkeale and Listowel. Newcastle West railway station was on Bishop Street and opened on 1 January 1857. It closed for passenger traffic on 4 February 1963, regular goods traffic on 2 December 1974 and finally closed on 3 November 1975, although occasional passenger special trains, diesel and steam hauled, had operated into the 1970s. The station had an unusual layout, with two turntables and water columns for steam locomotives, the result of the lines from the Rathkeale and Abbeyfeale directions having been built by different companies. After the tracks were lifted in the late 1980s, in 1999, the former station house was restored as a private house within the Bishop Court development of the station area. The Great Southern Trail walking and cycling route follows the line of the railway, passing the site of the demolished twin arch road bridge which spanned the lines to Rathkeale/Limerick and Abbeyfeale/Tralee just before they diverged.  Sport  Newcastle West is home to numerous sports clubs, including Newcastle West GAA club, Newcastle West Rugby Football club,http://www.newcastlewestrfc.com/ and had two association football clubs: Newcastle West A.F.C. and Newcastle West Rovers F.C., which amalgamated in 2018 to form Newcastle West Town AFC.

In Japan, the relationship between senpai (, \\"senior\\") and kōhai (, \\"junior\\") is an informal hierarchical interpersonal relationship found in organizations, associations, clubs, businesses, and schools. The concept has its roots in Confucian teaching, and has developed a distinguished Japanese style, ultimately becoming part of Japanese culture. Concept The relationship is an interdependent one, as a senpai requires a kōhai and vice versa, and establishes a bond determined by the date of entry into an organization. Senpai refers to the member of higher experience, hierarchy, level, or age in the organization who offers assistance, friendship, and counsel to a new or inexperienced member, known as the kōhai, who must demonstrate gratitude, respect, and occasionally personal loyalty. The kōhai defers to the senpais seniority and experience, and speaks to the senpai using honorific language. The senpai acts at the same time as a friend. This relation is similar to the interpersonal relation between tutor and tutored in Eastern culture, but differs in that the senpai and kōhai must work in the same organization. The relation originates in Confucian teaching, as well as the morals and ethics that have arrived in Japan from ancient China and have spread throughout various aspects of Japanese philosophy. The senpai–kōhai relation is a vertical hierarchy (like a father–son relation) that emphasizes respect for authority, for the chain of command, and for one's elders, eliminating all forms of internal competition and reinforcing the unity of the organization. Over time this mechanism has allowed the transfer of experience and knowledge, as well as the expansion of acquaintances and the building of institutional memory. It also allows the development of beneficial experiences between both, as the kōhai benefits from the senpais knowledge and the senpai learns new experiences from the kōhai by way of developing a sense of responsibility. This comradeship does not imply friendship; a senpai and kōhai may become friends, but such is not an expectation. The Korean terms seonbae and hubae are written with the same Chinese characters and indicate a similar senior–junior relationship. Both the Japanese and Korean terms are based on the Chinese terms xianbei (先輩/先辈) and houbei (後輩/后辈), written in the same Chinese characters (however in Chinese, the term qianbei (前輩/前辈) is more common for seniors). History Demonstrating the use of the naginata at a sports festival in Hamamatsu in 1911. Discipline training in school clubs historically has influenced the senpai–kōhai system with students. The senpai–kōhai system is deeply rooted in Japanese history. Three elements have had a significant impact on its development: Confucianism, the traditional Japanese family system, and the Civil Code of 1898. Confucianism arrived from China between the 6th and 9th centuries, but the derived line of thought that brought about deep social changes in Japan was Neo-Confucianism, which became the official doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867). The precepts of loyalty and filial piety as tribute ( ') dominated the Japanese at the time, as respect for elders and ancestor worship that Chinese Confucianism taught were well accepted by the Japanese, and these influences have spread throughout daily life. Like other Chinese influences, the Japanese adopted these ideas selectively and in their own manner, so that the \\"loyalty\\" in Confucianism was taken as loyalty to a feudal lord or the Emperor. The Japanese family system ( ') was also regulated by Confucian codes of conduct and had an influence on the establishment of the senpai–kōhai relation. In this family system the father, as male head, had absolute power over the family and the eldest son inherited the family property. The father had power because he was the one to receive an education and was seen to have superior ethical knowledge. Since reverence for superiors was considered a virtue in Japanese society, the wife and children had to obey it. In addition to the hereditary system, only the eldest son could receive his father's possessions, and neither the eldest daughter nor the younger children received anything from him. The last factor influencing the senpai–kōhai system was the Civil Code of 1898, which strengthened the rules of privilege of seniority and reinforced the traditional family system, giving clear definitions of hierarchical values within the family. This was called koshusei (, \\"family- head system\\"), in which the head of the household had the right to command his family and the eldest son inherited that position. These statutes were abolished in 1947, after the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II. These ideals nevertheless remained during the following years as a psychological influence in Japanese society. Terminology The seniority rules are reflected in various grammatical rules in the Japanese language. A person who speaks respectfully to a superior uses honorific language ( '), which is divided into three categories: * ' (, \\"respectful language\\"): Used to denote respect towards a superior with or of whom one speaks, including the actions, objects, characteristics, and people related to this person. * ' (, \\"humble language\\"): In contrast to sonkeigo, with kenjōgo the speaker shows respect to a superior by lowering or deprecating him or herself. * ' (, \\"polite language\\"): Differs from the other two in that the deference is afforded only to the person being addressed, rather than those being spoken about. Use of the verb desu (\\"to be\\") and the verb ending -masu are examples of teineigo. Sonkeigo and kenjōgo have expressions (verbs, nouns, and special prefixes) particular to the type of language; for example, the ordinary Japanese verb for \\"to do\\" is suru, but in sonkeigo is nasaru and in kenjōgo is itasu. Another rule in the hierarchical relation is the use of honorific suffixes of address. A senpai addresses a kōhai with the suffix -kun after the kōhais given name or surname, regardless if the kōhai is male or female. A kōhai similarly addresses a senpai with the suffix -senpai or -san; it is extremely unusual for a kōhai to refer to a senpai with the suffix -sama, which indicates the highest level of respect to the person spoken to. Prevalence At the international level the senpai–kōhai relation has spread through martial arts, in which the members of different kyū and dan levels are sorted by belt colour. One place the senpai–kōhai relation applies to its greatest extent in Japan is in schools. For example, in junior and senior high schools (especially in school clubs) third-year students (who are the oldest) demonstrate great power as senpais. It is common in school sports clubs for new kōhais to have to perform basic tasks such as retrieving balls, cleaning playing fields, taking care of equipment, and even wash elder students' clothes. They must also bow to or salute their senpais when congratulated, and senpais may punish kōhais or treat them severely. The main reason for these humble actions is that it is believed that team members can become good players only if they are submissive, obedient, and follow the orders of the trainer or captain, and thus become a humble, responsible, and cooperative citizen in the future. Relations in Japanese schools also place a stronger emphasis on the age than on the abilities of students. The rules of superiority between a senpai and a kōhai are analogous to the teacher–student relation, in which the age and experience of the teacher must be respected and never questioned. The senpai–kōhai relation is weaker in universities, as students of a variety of ages attend the same classes; students show respect to older members primarily through polite language (). Vertical seniority rules nevertheless prevail between teachers based on academic rank and experience. The senpai–kōhai system also prevails in Japanese businesses. The social environment in Japanese businesses is regulated by two standards: the system of superiority and the system of permanent employment. The status, salary, and position of employees depend heavily of seniority, and veteran employees generally take the highest positions and receive higher salaries than their subordinates. Until the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, employment was guaranteed for life and thus such employees did not have to worry about losing their positions. The senpai–kōhai relation is a cornerstone in interpersonal relations within the Japanese business world; for example, at meetings the lower-level employee should sit in the seat closest to the door, called shimoza (, \\"lower seat\\"), while the senior employee (sometimes the boss) sits next to some important guest in a position called kamiza (, \\"upper seat\\"). During meetings, most employees do not give their opinions, but simply listen and concur with their superiors, although they can express opinions with the prior consent of the employees of greater rank and influence in the company. Outside Japan, the senpai–kōhai relation is often found in the teaching of Japanese martial arts, though misunderstandings arise due to lack of historical knowledge, and as the vertical social hierarchy of Japan does not exist in cultures such as those in the West. Issues Despite the senpai–kōhai relation's deep roots in Japanese society, there have been changes since the end of the 20th century in academic and business organizations. Kōhais no longer show as much respect to the experience of their senpais, the relation has become more superficial, and the age factor has begun to lose importance. The student body has diversified with Japanese students, who have spent a large part of their lives overseas and have returned to Japan, as well as foreign students without a mentality rooted in the Japanese hierarchical system. The collapse of the economic bubble in the early 1990s caused a high level of unemployment, including the laying off of high-ranked employees. Companies since then first began to consider employees' skills rather than age or length of service with the company, due to which many long-serving employees lost their positions over being incapable of fulfilling expectations. Gradually many companies have had to restructure their salary and promotion systems, and seniority has thus lost some influence in Japanese society. Attitudes towards the senpai–kōhai system vary from appreciation for traditions and the benefits of a good senpai–kōhai relationship; to reluctant acquiescence; to antipathy. Those who criticize the system find it arbitrary and unfair, that senpais were often pushy, and that the system results in students who are shy or afraid of standing out from the group. For example, some kōhais fear that if they outperform their senpais in an activity, their senpai will lose face, for which kōhais must apologize. In some cases, the relation is open to violence and bullying.

While the nearby Great Connell Priory was founded in the 13th century, the town itself formed from the 18th century onwards, and grew rapidly alongside a military barracks which opened in the early 19th century. Taking on the name Newbridge (An Droichead Nua) in the 20th century, the town expanded to support the local catchment, and also as a commuter town for Dublin. Doubling in population during the 20 years between 1991 and 2011, its population of 22,742 in 2016 makes it the largest town in Kildare and the fifteenth-largest in Ireland. Map of Newbridge Name The Irish language name of the town is the official name, \\"An Droichead Nua\\", meaning simply \\"The New Bridge\\" and was introduced in the 1930s. Noble and Keenan's map of Kildare 1752, drawn before the town was started, marks 'The New Bridge' in the vicinity of 'Old Connel'. A number of other places marked on this map, including Ballymany and Morristown Biller, are represented in the names of modern housing estates and streets. History =Early settlement= Settlement in the area dates from the 13th century (with the foundation of Great Connell Abbey) and the current town is made up of six ancient civil parishes along with portions of others. The parishes are Ballymany, Great Connell, Killashee, Morristown Biller, Old Connell, and Carnalway. Great Connell Priory was an important Priory, founded in 1202 by the Augustinian Canons. =Beginning of the modern town= The earliest known mention of Newbridge was by traveller and bookseller John Dunton in 1698, though he does not refer to any settlement other than at Ballymany. A mass house (Roman Catholic Chapel) was built beside the bridge about 1730 and an inn, called New Bridge Inn, was in existence in 1750. The first bridge was destroyed by floods in 1789 and William Chapman, engineer on the Grand Canal extension to Naas, was employed to rebuild it the following year. He moved the site from the 'Watering Gates' to its present location and redirected the high road from Buckley's Cross (roundabout at Pfizer) to the new bridge, and continuing as what is today Main Street and Edward Street to the turnpike at Gandogue Lane (behind the modern Credit Union building). The old high road continued in use to serve the village and mass house, which was taken down in 1852 upon the opening of the new church (St Conleth's). Stables at Newbridge Barracks, c.1910 The origin of the modern town lies in the establishment of Cavalry Barracks (1815–1819) on land purchased from three local landlords: Eyre Powell of Great Connell, Ponsonby Moore of Moorefield and William Hannon of Kilbelin. This barracks originally extended from the River Liffey to Cutlery Road, and from Main Street to Military Road, however little of the barracks remains today except the old walls and gateways which can be found on the Athgarvan Road, and to a lesser degree on Cutlery Road. The \\"Watering Gates\\" located at the entrance to the Town Park was also constructed as part of the original Barrack building (and as the name suggests this \\"gate\\" was used to facilitate access to the river for the horses from the barracks). At the same time, Eyre Powell gave land north of the new high road for building houses and shops to serve the new Barracks. Main Street took shape at the same time as the Barracks were being built. From 1819 various Cavalry Regiments were stationed at Newbridge and brought much business to the town. Newbridge expanded rapidly after the Curragh Camp was established in 1855. Eyre Street (named after the local landlord Eyre Powell) and Edward Street (named after Prince Edward, later King Edward VII, who was stationed on the Curragh at the time) were built between 1855 and 1870. The new railway opened in 1846 and churches were built at Rosberry Common (1819 – St. Eustace', Dominican), at Moorefield (1828 – St Patrick's, Church of Ireland) and at Chapel Lane (1852 – St Conleth's, Roman Catholic) to cater for the increasing population. A National School was opened on the Railway Road in 1842 (now the Parish Office) and a boarding school at the Dominican Friary in 1852. The town continued to prosper until the withdrawal of the cavalry in May 1922 on the establishment of the Free State. It went into a period of decline thereafter, but since the 1960s has seen considerable growth and has become a shopping catchment and commuter town. Location The town is located on the banks of the River Liffey. Upriver are towns such as Athgarvan, Kilcullen and Blessington, while downriver are the towns of Caragh, Clane and Celbridge. Newbridge is bounded by the Curragh Plains to the west, Pollardstown Fen and the Bog of Allen and Moulds Bog to the north west. Around the Curragh, and to the east are a number of stud farms. To the south the motorway now forms a boundary to the town. Industry The area's industrial history includes rope making (at Irish Ropes PLC, established 1933, now closed) and carpet manufacturing (Curragh Tintawn Carpets Limited, established 1937, closed 2012). Cutlery and silverware is crafted at the Newbridge Silverware plant. Pharmaceutical companies such as Oral-B and Pfizer have also based themselves in the town, and the latter is located at Little Connell. Irish chocolatier Lily O'Briens is based in the IDA Business Park on Green Road, Bord na Móna has its headquarters in the centre of Newbridge, and the Department of Defence has a base on Station Road. The Kildare/Leixlip Branch of general workers union SIPTU has its headquarters at Georges Street. Many people living in Newbridge commute to work in Dublin. Transport =Rail= The town is situated on the main Dublin-Cork railway line which connects the town to Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Westport.

It is located in the north- west of the county near the border with Cavan, approximately 13 miles (21 km) from Kells. The R154 and R195 regional roads cross in the town's market square. As of the 2016 census the town's population stood at 1,383, a growth rate of more than 60% in the 20 years since the 1996 census (which recorded a population of inhabitants). History The area was the birthplace of St Oliver Plunkett, the last Irish Catholic martyr to die in England. Oldcastle is the 18th century creation of the Naper family who had received parts of the Plunkett estate following the Cromwellian wars. St. Oliver Plunkett, who served as Lord Archbishop of Armagh in the seventeenth century, and who was hung, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in Middlesex (now in the Marble Arch area of the City of Westminster in London) in 1681 on false charges, was the most famous member of this family. It was also the birthplace of Isaac Jackson, son of Anthony Jackson III (who some say was a yeoman son in turn of the Charles II courtier, Sir Anthomy Jackson II, of Killingswold Grove, East Yorkshire, England) of Eccleston, Lancashire, England who died in nearby County Cavan after 1666. Isaac was an early Quaker in Ireland, as was his father. He moved to Ballitore, County Kildare, where he married and raised a large family, mostly all of whom emigrated with their parents to Chester County, Pennsylvania, USA in 1725. Oldcastle suffered quite badly during the Great Famine and subsequent emigration. Owing to the continuation of a Gaelic way of life in the north of the county, Oldcastle suffered far more than the richer more arable land in the southern part of County Meath. The poorest class lived where Irish culture was strongest and were obliterated by starvation and emigration. Nonetheless, land patterns visible today still reveal a strong attachment to the pastoral farming of Gaelic culture. Politically and culturally the area has a strong tradition of support for radical republicanism, the Gaelic Athletic Association and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann; a local paper published in the town in the early 1900s gave its name to one of the Irish political parties, Sinn Féin. Oldcastle Workhouse was located on St. Oliver Plunkett Street (formerly Lennox Street), part of the R195 (the main road to Castlepollard), on the southern edge of the town. Designed by George Wilkinson in a neo-Tudor style, and probably built in the late 1830s or early 1840s, it was demolished before the 1950s. Mellow's Park was built by Meath County Council on the site around 1950. Many Germans, Austrians and Hungarians were interned in the old workhouse by the British Government during the First World War. Fennor Upper and Lower in Oldcastle is said to be named after Queen Medb's daughter, Findabair (Fennor). In Irish Mythology, she was sent as an offering to Cú Chulainn in his fight against Medb and her army from Connacht. She was killed by Cú Chulainn and the area was named after the place where she was murdered and buried. In 1923, Micheal Grealy, a member of the anti-treaty IRA, robbed two banks – The Hibernian Bank and the Northern Bank – for which he was executed in Mullingar Barracks. A monument was erected in 1961 in Oldcastle Square by Meath Brigades Executive, Old IRA Federation, 1916–1921 to the memory of Commandant Seamus Coogan and Commandant Patrick McDonnell who were killed by British Crown Forces during the War of Independence. The monument in the form of a cross was unveiled by Seán Dowling, Chairman of the National Federation of the Old IRA. In November 1997 Michael McKevitt and other IRA dissidents held a meeting in a farmhouse in Oldcastle, County Meath, and a new organisation styling itself Óglaigh na hÉireann was formed.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 38–39. The organisation attracted disaffected Provisional IRA members from the republican stronghold of South Armagh, as well as other areas including Dublin, Belfast, Limerick, Tipperary, County Louth, County Tyrone and County Monaghan. = Oldcastle Detention camp (1916-1918) = Ireland was part of the United Kingdom in 1914 when the first world war broke out. The Alien Restriction Act 1914 was passed on 5 August 1914. The Act introduced strict controls on freedom of movement of foreign nationals and introduced a system of registration with the police. The Act also contained powers to deport foreign nationals and to intern all Austrian and German males between the ages of 17 and 42 i.e. men of military age. ‘The Oldcastle detention camp was the only permanent civilian POW camp in Ireland, detaining so called “enemy aliens”.The Oldcastle Prisoner of War Camp 1914–1918, John Smith, Riocht Na Midhe – Records of Meath Archaeological and History Society 2010, Vol XX1This was due to a fear that these men would betray Britain by returning home and joining the German Army or becoming spies in Britain. Not all German and Austrian nationals residing Ireland were detained immediately. These individuals tended to be citizens who had influential contacts and whose good conduct was guaranteed by them. However even these men were detained eventually. After this Act was passed the British War Office started looking for suitable buildings to convert into detention centres. As stated by John Smith, \\"disused workhouses were ideal. They had much of the infrastructure to hold hundreds of people: dormitories, kitchens, dining halls, water, washing facilities, an infirmary, store rooms, recreation yards etc\\". These also had the bonus of being easy to defend with their high walls and being on the outskirts of towns. Oldcastle Workhouse met these requirements perfectly. In 1838 The Poor Law Act was passed which aimed to relieve the poor/destitute by providing basic food and accommodation. Oldcastle Workhouse was built and opened in 1842 to accommodate 600 people. By 1914 there were only 50 inmates living in the building. After the military approved the conversion of the workhouse into a detention centre, these remaining residents were moved to other workhouses in the area. In November 1914 the building was converted. The eight foot perimeter walls were reinforced, ‘There are nine sentry boxes around the workhouse grounds, while several galvanized houses have been erected... The grounds are surrounded by barbed wire entanglements about 5 feet high and 14 feet wide.’ Quoted from The Anglo Celt, a newspaper in the area at the time of the camp.http://www.anglocelt.ie/news/roundup/articles/2014/12/13/4034489-last- word-their-only-crime-was-their-nationality/ On 12 December 1914 ‘The long expected German prisoners arrived this week in Oldcastle and took up quarters in the disused workhouse.’ This was a headline from the time, The Meath Chronicle on the day the arrival. The Meath Chronicle reported that via a specially commissioned train 68 German inmates were transported into the town. From there they were marched through the town under armed guards to their new residence. Two days later another 26 civilians were moved into the camp. This continued steadily from late 1914 to 1915. 304 inmates were in the camp by February 1915 this number increased to 579 by June 1916. By this time every space in the workhouse was being utilised by the camp commandant Major Robert Johnson including the workhouses church sacristy. ‘Written accounts show that the highest recorded number of prisoners being held at the Oldcastle Detention Camp was 583 – the building appeared to be operating at full capacity.’ As taken from John Smith’s article on the subject. Up to thirty men were housed in a room on regulation camp beds - that is, plank beds with sacks stuffed with straw serving as mattresses Ruth Fleischmann, 'Aloys Fleischmann: Bavarian Musician and Civilian Prisoner of War 1916-1919' in: Oldcastle Camp 1914-1918: An Illustrated History, Ed. Tom French, Meath County Council 2018, 140-1.\\\\- one pillow and three blankets per man. Aloys Fleischmann, cathedral organist and choirmaster in Cork, was interned in the camp. The detainees were civilians from vastly different backgrounds. This ranged from clergymen, jewellery makers and musicians to cooks, butlers and butchers. Though the prison was not entirely pleasant the inmates had some privileges especially those who came from a better background. It was possible for the more affluent inmates to buy their own rooms and hire their own servants from among the less affluent detainees. The British wanted to divide the classes as they believed it was not acceptable to put a docker with a doctor. As part of camp life they were allowed to write and send two letters a week containing twenty-four lines. Parcels could be received and visitors were allowed for 15 minutes twice a month. One inmate, Aloys Fleischmann, a Bavarian church musician and composer, wrote to his wife and requested “three blankets and a pillow, a warm knitted Jacket, waterproof boots, a wash bowl, a kettle and mug, cutlery, tobacco and books.” This quote was taken from John Smith's research article. We can gather from this that conditions in camp were cold, damp and basic. Although it is also reported that if they could gather 100 prisoners they would go on a four-mile march for exercise ending up in a pub in Dromone. They were even allowed to go in and buy a drink. Aloys Fleischmann kept a diary while in the camp. A journalist visited the camp in June 1915, ‘he stated that he was “met by a large body of men” and described them as “fine strapping men”’. Account taken from John Smith’s article on the camp. These men caused no trouble for the guards but seemed bored and had nothing to do. The reported goes on to lament that they should be put to better use. Certainly, in the early days the inmates had nothing to occupy their time so this could have been the reason for four of the detainees to be sent to the mental asylum in Mullingar. By July 1916 it was reported that the detainees had formed committees to run the camp. They took charge of their own washing, drinking water and cooking. There were 3 bakers and 12 cooks among the inmates who provided all the meals for the camp. They were provided with regulation provisions which included \\"bread, biscuits, fresh or frozen meat, tea, coffee, salt, sugar, condensed milk, fresh vegetables, cheese, butter, peas, beans, lentils and rice\\". Account taken from John Smith’s article on the detention centre. The rest of the men practiced their trades by making toys, jewellery, boots and wood-carving. Many men spent their days painting and sketching. The camp also had two orchestras’ which gave concerts and played for dramatic performances. Apart from the boredom one of the other issues for the inmates was the relationships with their families. This led to many divorces and estrangement from their children. There were numerous escape attempts reported in newspapers. One of the most notorious attempts was by Carl Morlang and Aphonsus Grein who managed to escape for a few days. On the night of 14 August at 9.30 pm the prisoners were noticed missing at roll-call. Morlang and Grein left the prison and made their way northwards to Ballyjamesduff, Co Cavan disguised as two clergymen. ‘At the village of Denn a few miles from Cavan, Grein entered the public house and treated all hands in lavish style.’ An account taken from The Anglo Celt. They were captured the following day by the local constabulary and returned to camp. When they were searched they were found to be carrying maps, supplies and money which they should not have been able to obtain. Also among their belongings it was said there was a letter addressed to Charles Fox thanking him for helping them escape. He was a decorated ex-officer in the British Army and a successful businessman. He was very republican in his views so he was arrested and tried for treason, which was a hanging offence. However, the charges were dropped. He returned to Oldcastle and treated like a hero by the locals. Two inmates were killed at Oldcastle during the years 1914–1918. One on 17 September 1917 during an escape with another inmate. August Bockmeyer was shot when he refused to stop. Although he survived the shooting he later succumbed to his injuries. There was an enquiry and it was declared that ‘Private Tiernan’s actions to be “quite justified” in the “discharge” of his duty.’ As stated by the article by John Smith. The second, Franz Xaver Seemeier, died in January 1917. According to the information given to the press by the camp authorities, the detainee was playing football when he collided with another player and was taken to the infirmary; the following day he died from serious internal injuries. According to an account written by an internee, Seemeier was bayoneted by a guard after he had been seen approaching the barbed wire fence.Ruth Fleischmann, 'Aloys Fleischmann: Bavarian Musician and Civilian Prisoner of War 1916-1919' in: Oldcastle Camp 1914-1918: An Illustrated History, Ed. Tom French, Meath County Council 2018, 141-2. After the 1916 Rising the political landscape had changed in Ireland. There was an anti-conscription meeting in Oldcastle held on 13 April 1918. The guest speaker was Arthur Griffith a key figure in Sinn Fein. The rally was attended by thousands of people and was only 300 meters away from the camp. The speeches taking place were very Nationalist and anti- British. Prisoners watched from the roof of the camp ‘from which the meeting was visible’. Account taken from The Anglo Celt. Once the speeches had ended the crowd moved towards the prison but nothing became of this. Following this incident and the political concerns at the time the British decided to move the prisoners from Oldcastle. On 25 May 1918 a specially commissioned train left Oldcastle to go to North Wall, Dublin. The prisoners were then taken by ship to Knockaloe Camp on the Isle of Man. Oldcastle was returned to its previous owners the Oldcastle Board of Guardians and fell into disuse. During the War of Independence in May 1920 Oldcastle Workhouse was set ablaze by the local IRA to stop the British using it as a military base. The main buildings no longer stand the only thing still standing is the perimeter wall.  Entertainment The Oldcastle Agricultural Show is held on the third Sunday in July in the Gilson National Park.

However, it was later discovered that the explosion was set up by the government who learned of Mikhail's powers and wanted to exploit them without him being encumbered by ties to the past.Uncanny X-Men #286 Mikhail was sent by his superiors into an inter-dimensional void,Uncanny X-Men #285 counting on his powers to keep him and his comrades safe, to see what was on the other side. He found a world, although he was the only survivor of his crew. He married Tra-mai-a-Zath, daughter of the world's ruler, the Worldly Avatar,Uncanny X-Men (1st series) #286 and soon became a messiah-like figure and found himself embroiled in a civil war. The X-Men happened to end up on the same planet, and told Mikhail that he had to close the void before it destroyed both this world and their home. However, having had one failed attempt that killed many (including his wife), Mikhail was apprehensive to try it again. With the help of Sunfire, Iceman, and Jean Grey he succeeded, and was transported home where next he appeared with the Morlocks. Tragically, after Mikhail set himself up as leader of the Morlocks, the tunnel-dwelling mutants beneath New York City, he massacred nearly all of them by flooding the tunnels.Uncanny X-Men #293 He did, however, survive,Storm vol. 2 #1 along with Callisto the former leader of the band of outcasts and a group of Morlocks who later descended to form Gene Nation. In a world where time moves faster than normal, Mikhail had established a citadel for himself on the top of a massive hill. The philosophy of \\"survival of the fittest\\" was the only thing which governed the society. If someone could reach the summit of the hill they were considered \\"fit\\" and worthy of being part of Gene Nation. Mikhail was forced to transport Storm and the Gene Nationals back to Earth, but he escaped once more (presumably back to the Hill) ranting about his benefactor being displeased with him. Storm then transported all of the Gene Nationals to a dying village in Africa where they would eke out a new life for themselves. It was discovered that Mikhail was working for the Dark Beast to try to propagate a group of elite warriors.Storm vol. 1, #4 =Legacy Virus= Distraught by the death of his little sister Illyana by the Legacy Virus, Mikhail decided to do something. Mikhail goes back and exposes his sister to the virus when she is in her aged form, thinking that with her magical abilities it would shield her from harm and help her to build an immunity.New Mutants: Truth or Death It was later revealed that Mikhail himself was suffering from the disease and was also trying to rid his body of the fatal virus. However, his plan backfired, and Illyana contracted the disease, her brother having been the one to administer it to her.New Mutants: Truth or Death #3 =The Twelve= When Professor X temporarily disbanded the X-Men, Colossus took Marrow with him to Boston to see an art expo. While there, they were transported to the Hill by Mikhail Rasputin, and Colossus came face-to-face with his brother for the first time since his supposed suicide. The pair of X-Men ended up freeing Mikhail from the corrupting influence of a sentient energy native to that dimension and brought him back to the X-Mansion to recuperate when the entire team became embroiled in the gathering of the Twelve. Mikhail was one of the Twelve, and one of the Horsemen breached the mansion's security to kidnap him. Colossus joined a strike force of X-Men who traveled to Egypt in order to confront Apocalypse, and his Skrull allies. In the resulting battles, Mikhail sacrificed himself to carry the Horsemen away from the conflict in a dimensional gateway. Although some Horsemen have reappeared since then, Mikhail did not reappear until X-Men: Colossus- Bloodline. =Colossus: Bloodline= Mikhail has made his reappearance and this time had allied himself with Sinister.Colossus: Bloodline The two were attempting to assassinate all of the members of the Rasputin family but one, so that the spirit of their forefather Grigory Rasputin may be concentrated and reincarnated in the last remaining member of the lineage. Mikhail teleported himself and his brother to another dimension that was a series of rocky caves. Not wanting to physically kill his brother, he decided to leave him in the rock dimension where he would die in a matter of weeks. However, away from Sinister for a period of time, he was able to overcome his mental manipulations and came to his senses, rescuing his brother. His final decision was to teleport to a world named The Dark Zone, a dimension from which it was impossible to return and also once entered, impossible to die in. This protected the rest of the Rasputin line from the depredations of Sinister as at some point Mikhail would have been the sole surviving Rasputin, which would then trap his ancestor in the dark zone. Colossus tried to persuade him to save himself, but Mikhail determined that it would be best for the possible problem and for his own insanity.X-Men: Colossus- Bloodline #5 After the events of M-Day, Mikhail has retained his mutant powers. Powers and abilities Mikhail's powers have always been rather ambiguous and have never fully been explained, but have been described as 'energy warping'.X-Men (1st series) #99Marvel official character profile for Colossus, URL= https://www.marvel.com/characters/colossus-piotr-rasputin Date accessed= 21 October 2018 His role as a cosmonaut was to use his powers to protect the crew and vessel from the energies of the void they were investigating on Sakhalin Island. Whilst in the world he had entered through the void, he attempted to close it to protect both Earth and the other world; 'a source of energy that parallelled the void' was required, and Mikhail served 'in lieu of that powerful source', which indicates he could wield considerable energy.Uncanny X-Men (1st series) #286 When the portal between the two worlds was later opened, and the X-Men came to Mikhail's world, he served as the focal point of the atomic power of Sunfire, the control of low temperature of Iceman, and the telekinetic fields of Jean Grey, wielding 'the untold energies of a thousand thousand stars' (sic).Uncanny X-Men (1st series) #286 On his return to Earth, the traumatised Mikhail was shown to possess warping powers that could affect more than just energy, lashing out at a man delivering pizza and turning him into a tree, apparently killing him.Uncanny X-Men (1st series) #290# Still wielding the inter-dimensional energies to which he was exposed traversing the void, Mikhail retained the ability to move between dimensions.Uncanny X-Men (1st series) #325 He was able to extract from within his own body the Legacy Virus and transfer it to his sister, Illyana (reasoning that her older form, magically empowered, would be able to protect her and prevent her death).New Mutants: Truth or Death #1-3 His apparent atomic or molecular control manifested in the ability to imbue inanimate objects with a degree of life; in his psychosis believing himself to be a god, Mikhail sought to animate a portrait of his deceased sister, but was dissuaded by his brother Colossus.Uncanny X-Men (1st series) #373-374 The Age of Apocalypse version is said to, \\"command energy and force fields.\\" In various appearances he is shown to be able to manipulate the substance of matter on a subatomic level and warp energy wavelengths, allowing him to fire destructive blasts and teleport through space and dimensions although the full extent and limit of his powers are unknown. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse, Mikhail was one of the Russian mutants that opposed Apocalypse's invasion. He caught Apocalypse's attention after he was able to kill War, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Being impressed by Mikhail's victory, Apocalypse captured and brainwashed Mikhail. Mikhail became a Prelate and one of Apocalypse's Horsemen and was placed in charge of the central United States. He later led a group of Infinite Soldiers back to Moscow where he discovered his brother Colossus was the new leader of the Soviet Super Soldiers. This group fought valiantly but were no match for their former leader and all but Colossus were killed. Despite the months of brainwashing, Mikhail could not bring himself to kill his brother. Colossus almost broke through Apocalypse's brainwashing when the X-Men arrived, driving him away.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men Age of Apocalypse 2005 The months of experimental procedures and brainwashing he endured eventually made him lose his sanity, Mikhail went into seclusion and turned his powers into himself, significantly altering his physiology and appearance. He changed his flesh into a flesh-metal hybrid and opened up gateways in his own mind that gave him powers that even Apocalypse had never dreamed of. After years of mutating himself, Mikhail did not fear even Apocalypse himself. When Mikhail returned, Apocalypse gave him the added responsibility of being in charge of his Eurasian lands. Mikhail employed the Stryfe Force as his personal army, human servants that survived his Upscale Program, a program which turned ordinary humans into cyborgs under his control. At his side was his majordomo Keeper Murdock (the AoA version of Daredevil), who served Rasputin out of personal gratitude, as he believed his powers were the product of Rasputin's Upscale Program. Another of Mikhail's human allies was Bruce Banner, a scientist seeking to mutate himself, who obtained a supply of mutant test subjects in exchange for his aid.X-Universe #1 Rasputin abandoned North America and approached the Human High Council with an offering of peace, which he didn't intend to fulfill. The Forgotten Horseman, as he was nicknamed, captured the Council Agents aboard his ships and planned on murdering the Human High Council leaders. His plan was to assume control of all Europe using the amplified powers of the captured Empath to manipulate the emotions of all humans. However, the Council agents took control of Rasputin's fleet. Mikhail was stopped from murdering the Council leaders by Donald Blake, who apparently killed the Horseman by stabbing him through the heart with his cane and pushing him out of the Big Ben, at the cost of his own life.X-Universe #2 In other media =Video games= * Mikhail Rasputin appears in X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse voiced by Scott MacDonald. Mikhail is the second of the Horsemen of Apocalypse encountered when the X-Men fight him in the Savage Land. His appearance is more reminiscent of his character in the Age of Apocalypse storyline from Marvel Comics than his traditional look, which is understandable given the setting of the game. There were a lot references about him being Colossus' older brother, but he has no special dialogue with Colossus. In this version, his powers include energy blasts, self-duplication, super-speed, and the ability to transform inanimate objects into minions.

The population of the town in 2016 was 1,318. It is located about 26 km northwest of Galway on the N59 road. Oughterard is on the border of the Connemara region, and is the chief angling centre on Lough Corrib. Places of interest Three kilometres outside the town stand the ruins of Aughnanure Castle, a well-preserved example of a medieval tower house. Much of the surrounding area was occupied by the O'Flaherty clan, but was taken over by Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster, in 1256. Ross Castle is also located a number of kilometres outside Oughterard. The mansion, which is visible today, was built by the Martin family in the 17th century but there is some evidence still present of the original castle structure, built in the 15th century by the O'Flaherty family, in its foundation. The 'Quiet Man Bridge' is located 8 kilometres past Oughterard, down the Leam Road, which was the setting for the 1950s film The Quiet Man starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. Also close to Oughterard, the Glengowla Mines (abandoned in 1865) is a \\"show mine\\" with exhibits on the lead and silver mining history of the area. Oughterard and the Owenriff River c.1890-1910 Transport Oughterard railway station opened on 1 January 1895 and closed on 29 April 1935. There are daily buses going from and to Galway and Clifden along the N59. City Link and Bus Éireann are the two bus services that travel to and from Galway. Amenities Oughterard has a primary school, 'Scoil Chuimín agus Caitríona', and a co-educational voluntary secondary school, St Paul's. As of early 2019, Oughterard's public library, based in the town's old courthouse, was closed for renovations. A former hotel on the outskirts of the town, the Connemara Gateway Hotel, attracted some controversy in 2019, when locals protested plans to convert the disused site into a direct provision centre. Some locals protested against \\"inhumane direct provision centres\\", with some members of the \\"Oughterard Says No to Direct Provision\\" group suggesting that \\"negative outside influences\\" had attempted to influence the protests, amid some accusations of racism. After prolonged protests, the tender for the centre was withdrawn. Sport Sports clubs in the area include Oughterard GAA club (Corribdale), Oughterard Association Football Club (New Village), Oughterard Rugby Club (Cliden Road), and Corrib Basketball (Main Street). Oughterard Golf Club, located outside the town, was incorporated in 1969 and developed in the early 1970s.

It was formed by Frank Giustra on July 10, 1997, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and is currently headquartered in Santa Monica, California, United States. In addition to its flagship Lionsgate Films division, which generated the seventh-highest gross revenue in North America in 2015, the company contains other divisions such as Lionsgate Television and Lionsgate Interactive. It owns a variety of subsidiaries such as Summit Entertainment, Debmar-Mercury, and Starz Inc. History =Early history= Lionsgate was formed in 1997 by Frank Giustra with a $16 million investment including another $40 million from other investors which included Keyur Patel and Yorkton Securities' executives such as G. Scott Paterson. Giustra had recently retired as CEO from Yorkton, an investment bank, and Paterson was then president. Giustra then merged Lionsgate with Toronto Stock Exchange listed Beringer Gold Corp. (founded in 1986) to take the company public. Beringer's mining assets were soon sold off.\\"Lionsgate\\" Lionsgate Investors http://investors.lionsgate.com \\"Retrieved on May 23, 2012\\" =Acquisitions= Lionsgate then began a series of acquisitions to get into the film industry. The company bought a number of small production facilities and distributors, starting with Montreal-based Cinépix Film Properties (renamed as Lions Gate Films) and North Shore Studios (renamed Lions Gate Studios) in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mandalay Television was acquired by Lionsgate from Peter Guber for a 4% Lionsgate stake. In 1998, Lionsgate helped Guber form Mandalay Pictures with a 45% investment in Mandalay. Lionsgate followed that up with a June purchase of International Movie Group, Inc. (IMG), a bankrupt film distributor previously invested in by Guber and Yorktown Securities, for its film library. IMG's CEO Peter Strauss became President of Lions Gate Entertainment, Inc. (LGE), the American parent company for Lionsgate's U.S. interests. The Lions Gate Media subsidiary was also formed to produce for television. Completing its first year of operation, Lionsgate had a revenue of $42.2 million with a loss of $397,000. The company share price dropped to a low of $1.40. This limited the corporation's ability to make acquisitions via stock swaps. Lionsgate instead made its next acquisition of Termite Art Productions, a reality-based television production company, for $2.75 million by issuing three convertible promissory notes. Giustra had the shareholders vote to move the company's public listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to the American Stock Exchange, along with a two-for-one stock consolidation to qualify, for greater exposure that might boost share value. In January 1999, Roman Doroniuk was named president and chief operating officers of Lionsgate, which led to the corporation's financial operations being moved in April to Doroniuk's offices in Toronto, Ontario while corporate headquarters remained in Vancouver, British Columbia. Lionsgate created US based Avalanche Films and acquired half of Sterling Home Entertainment, both in video sales. Again, Lionsgate registered losses in its second year of $9.3 million on revenues of $78.3 million with most of the losses were from its stake in Mandalay Pictures. Thus in the summer, Lionsgate placed its studios up for sale with no buyers. TV operations were changed to non-network hourlong series over riskier network shows and ended its relationship with Mandalay Television. The corporation sought out more capital and cash with a filing of a preliminary prospectus for the sale of preferred stock and common stock warrants and a $13.4 million line of credit. =Lionsgate increases and new CEO= Additional acquisition funding arrived in January 2000 as a $33.1 million investment from an investor group that included Paul Allen, former Sony Pictures executive Jon Feltheimer, German broadcasting company Tele-Munchen, and SBS Broadcasting SA. This led to Feltheimer taking over as CEO from Giustra thus the passed over Doroniuk left the company. Feltheimer increased film making including several $1 million films at Avalanche. However, Federgreen still remains one of the major owners of the company and is extremely involved in the making of all their major movies. In June, Lionsgate acquired Trimark Holdings, Inc. for approximately $50 million in stock and cash including taking on $36 million in debt. Lionsgate continued making acquisitions during the decade to boost distribution and its film library. On December 15, 2003, Lionsgate acquired Artisan Entertainment for $220 million. In 2004, Erik Nelson reacquired Termite Art and renamed it to Creative Differences. Lionsgate partnered with Panamax Films in 2005 to make movies for the Latino market which only produced two films.

On July 26, 2007, Lionsgate bought a partial stake in independent film distribution company Roadside Attractions. Lionsgate started up Lionsgate Music by June 2007. On September 10, 2007, Lionsgate bought Mandate Pictures for $56.3 million, $44.3 million in cash and $12 million in stock, and taking on $6.6 million of Mandate's debt.

By July 2008, Lionsgate has not made any progress on building its new film studio in Rio Rancho or on setting up the corporation to run the studio per its agreement with New Mexico. In November, Lionsgate Music established a joint venture with music publishing company Wind-up Records. In January 2009, Lionsgate purchased TV Guide Network and TVGuide.com from Rovi for $255 million cash. In May 2009, Lionsgate sold a 49% stake in TV Guide Network and website to One Equity Partners under pressure from shareholder Carl Icahn. Lionsgate cut back its slate of films per year by four in February 2009. In April, Relativity Media signed with Lionsgate for a 5 picture per year multi-year film distribution.

AD 76) was a Roman historian. In his later years he lived in Rome, and there he died, after having been blind for twelve years, at the age of eighty-five. During the reigns of Claudius and Nero he compiled for his sons, from various sources—e.g. the Gazette (Aetablica)–shorthand reports or skeletons (commentarii) of Cicero's unpublished speeches, Tiro's life of Cicero, speeches and letters of Cicero's contemporaries, various historical writers, e.g. Varro, Atticus, Antias, Tuditanus and Fenestella (a contemporary of Livy whom he often criticizes) -- historical commentaries on Cicero's speeches, of which only five, viz, in Pisonem, pro Scauro, pro Milone, pro Cornelio and In Toga Candida, in a very mutilated edition, are preserved, under the modern title Q. Asconii Pediani Orationvm Ciceronis qvinqve enarratio. In a note upon the speech pro Scauro, he speaks of Longus Caecina (died AD 57) as still living, while his words imply that Claudius (died AD 54) was not alive. This statement, therefore, must have been written between AD 54 and 57. These valuable notes, written in good Latin, relate chiefly to historical and antiquarian matters. A commentary, of superior Latinity and mainly of a grammatical character, on Cicero's Verrine orations, was transmitted alongside the commentaries of Asconius but is regarded as a 4th or 5th century work. Both works were found by Poggio in a manuscript at St Gallen in 1416. This manuscript is lost, but three transcripts were made by Poggio, Zomini (Sozomenus) of Pistoia and Bartolommeo da Montepulciano. That of Poggio is now at Madrid (Matritensis X. 81), and that of Zomini is in the Forteguerri library at Pistoia (No. 37). A copy of Bartolommeo's transcript exists in Florence (Laur. 5). The later manuscripts are derived from Poggio's copy. Other works attributed to Asconius were: *a life of Sallust *a defence of Virgil against his detractors *a treatise (perhaps a symposium in imitation of Plato) on health and long life.

The MPU-401, where MPU stands for MIDI Processing Unit, is an important but now obsolete interface for connecting MIDI-equipped electronic music hardware to personal computers. It was designed by Roland Corporation, which also co-authored the MIDI standard. Logo replica of the MPU-401  Design  Released around 1984, the original MPU-401 was an external breakout box providing MIDI IN/MIDI OUT/MIDI THRU/TAPE IN/TAPE OUT/MIDI SYNC connectors, for use with a separately-sold interface card/cartridge (\\"MPU-401 interface kit\\") inserted into a computer system. For this setup, the following \\"interface kits\\" were made: * MIF-APL: For the Apple II. * MIF-C64: For the Commodore 64. * MIF-FM7: For the Fujitsu FM7. * MIF- IPC: For the IBM PC/IBM XT. It turned out not to work reliably with 286 and faster processors. Early versions of the actual PCB had IF-MIDI/IBM as a silk screen. * MIF-IPC-A: For the IBM AT, works with PC and XT as well. * Xanadu MUSICOM IFM-PC: For the IBM PC / IBM XT / IBM AT. This was a third party MIDI card, incorporating the MIF-IPC(-A) and additional functionality that was coupled with the OEM Roland MPU-401 BOB. It also had a mini audio jack on the PCB. * MIF-MSX: For the MSX. * MIF-PC8: For the NEC PC-88. * MIF-PC98: For the NEC PC-98. * MIF-X1: For the Sharp X1. * MIF-V64: For the Commodore 64. In 2014 hobbyists built clones of the MIF-IPC-A card for PCs.  Variants  Later, Roland would put most of the electronics originally found in the breakout box onto the interface card itself, thus reducing the size of the breakout box. Products released in this manner: *MPU-401N: an external interface, specifically designed for use with the NEC PC-98 series notebook computers. This breakout-box unit features a special COMPUTER IN port for direct connection to the computer's 110-pin expansion bus. METRONOME OUT connector was added. Released in Japan only. * MPU-IPC: for the IBM PC/IBM XT/IBM AT and compatibles (8 bit ISA). It had a 25-pin female connector for the breakout box, even though only nine pins were used, and only seven were functionally different: both 5V and ground use two pins each. * MPU-IPC-T: for the IBM PC/IBM XT/IBM AT and compatibles (8 bit ISA). The MIDI SYNC connector was removed from this Taiwanese-manufactured model, and the previously hardcoded I/O address and IRQ could be set to different values with jumpers. The break-out box has three DIN connectors for MIDI (1xIN and 2xOUT) plus three 3.5mm mini jack connectors (TAPE IN, TAPE OUT and METRONOME OUT). * MPU- IMC: for the IBM PS/2's Micro Channel Architecture bus. In earlier models both I/O address and IRQ were hardcoded to IRQ 2 (causing serious problems with the hard disk as it also uses that IRQ); in later models the IRQ could be set with a jumper. It had a 9-pin female connector for the breakout box. The IRQ selection on the MPU-IMC. Due to the incompatibility of IRQ 2/9 (and potentially I/O addresses) between the MPU-IMC and IBM PS/2 MCA models certain games will not work with MPU-401. * S-MPU/AT (Super MPU): for the IBM AT and compatibles (16 bit ISA). It had a Mini-DIN female connector for the breakout box. The MIDI SYNC, TAPE IN, TAPE OUT, METRONOME OUT connectors was removed, but a second MIDI IN connector was added. An application to assign resources (plug and play) must be run to use the card in DOS. This application is not a TSR, i.e. it does not take up conventional memory. * S-MPU-IIAT (Super MPU II): for the IBM or compatible Plug and Play PC's (16 bit ISA). It had a Mini- DIN female connector for the breakout box with two MIDI In connectors and two MIDI Out connectors. An application to assign resources (plug and play) must be run to use the card in DOS. This application is not a TSR, i.e. it does not take up precious conventional memory. * LAPC-I: for the IBM PC and compatibles. Includes the Roland CM-32L sound source. A breakout box for this card, the MCB-1, was sold separately. * LAPC-N: for the NEC PC-98. Includes the Roland CM-32LN sound source. A breakout box for this card, the MCB-2, was sold separately. * RAP-10: for the IBM AT and compatibles (16 bit ISA). General midi sound source only. MPU-401 UART mode only. A breakout box for this card, the MCB-10, was sold separately. * SCP-55: for the IBM and compatible laptops (PCMCIA). Includes the Roland SC-55 sound source. A breakout box for this card, the MCB-3, was sold separately. MPU-401 UART mode only. Still later, Roland would get rid of the breakout box completely and put all connectors on the back of the interface card itself. Products released in this manner: Roland MPU-IMC, the rare 'Micro Channel' version of the card. Roland MPU-401AT Roland MPU-PC98II Roland MPU-IPC-T card * MPU-APL: for the Apple II series. Single-card combination of the MIF-APL interface and MPU-401, featuring MIDI IN, OUT, and SYNC connectors. * MPU-401AT: for IBM AT and \\"100% compatibles\\". Includes a connector for Wavetable daughterboards. * MPU-PC98: for the NEC PC-98. * MPU-PC98II: for the NEC PC-98. * S-MPU/PC (Super MPU PC-98): for the NEC PC-98. * S-MPU/2N (Super MPU II N): for the NEC PC-98. * SCC-1: for the IBM PC and compatibles. Includes the Roland SC-55 sound source. * GPPC-N & GPPC-NA: for the NEC PC-98. Includes the Roland SC-55 sound source.  Clones  By the late 1980s other manufacturers of PCBs developed intelligent MPU-401 clones. Some of these, like Voyetra, were equipped with Roland chips whereas others had retro-engineered ROMs (Midiman / Music Quest). Examples: * Midiman MM-401 (8BIT, non Roland chip set, also sold as part of the Midiman PC Desktop Music Kit) * Computer Music Supply CMS-401 (8BIT, non Roland chip set) * Music Quest PC MIDI Card / MQX-16s / MQX-32m (8 & 16BIT, non Roland chip set) * Voyetra V-400x / OP-400x (V-4000, V4001, 8BIT, Roland chip set) * MIDI LAND DX-401 (non Roland chipset) & MD-401 (non Roland chipset) * Data Soft DS-401 (non Roland chipset) In 2015 hobbyists developed a Music Quest PC MIDI Card 8BIT clone. In 2017/2018 hobbyists developed a revision of the Music Quest PC MIDI Card 8BIT clone that includes a wavetable header in analogy of the Roland MPU-401AT.  Modes  The MPU-401 can work in two modes, normal mode and UART mode. \\"Normal mode\\" would provide the host system with an 8-track sequencer, MIDI clock output, SYNC 24 signal output, Tape Sync and a metronome; as a result of these features, it is often called \\"intelligent mode\\". Compare this to UART mode, which reduces the MPU-401 to simply relaying in-/outcoming MIDI data bytes. As computers became more powerful, the features offered in \\"intelligent mode\\" became obsolete, as implementing them in the host system's software became more efficient (than paying for dedicated hardware that will do them). As a result, the UART mode became the dominant mode of operation, with many clones not supporting the \\"intelligent mode\\" at all, being advertised as MPU-401 compatible.  SoftMPU  In the mid 2010s a hobbyist platform software interface, SoftMPU, was written that upgrades UART (non intelligent) MPU-401 interfaces to an intelligent MPU-401 interface, however this only works for the DOS operating system. HardMPU In 2015 a PCB (HardMPU) was developed that incorporates SoftMPU as logic on hardware (so that the PC's CPU does not have to process intelligent MIDI). Currently HardMPU only supports playback and not recording.  Contemporary interfaces  Physical MIDI connections are increasingly replaced with the USB interface, and a USB to MIDI converter in order to drive musical peripherals which do not yet have their own USB ports. Often, peripherals are able to accept MIDI input through USB and route it to the traditional DIN connectors. While MPU-401 support is no longer included in Windows Vista, a driver is available on Windows Update. As of 2011 the interface was still supported by Linux and Mac OS X.

In the work, Abelard juxtaposes apparently contradictory quotations from the Church Fathers on many of the traditional topics of Christian theology. In the Prologue, Abélard outlines rules for reconciling these contradictions, the most important of which is noting the multiple significations of a single word. However, Abélard does not himself apply these rules in the body of the Sic et Non, which has led scholars to conclude that the work was meant as an exercise book for students in applying dialectic (logic) to theology. In Sic et Non, Abelard presents 158 questions that present a theological assertion and allows its negation. The first five questions are: # Must human faith be completed by reason, or not? # Does faith deal only with unseen things, or not? # Is there any knowledge of things unseen, or not? # May one believe only in God alone, or not? # Is God a single unitary being, or not? The prologue frames the text as a professor's guide, \\"Aristotle, the most clear-sighted of all the philosophers, was desirous above all things else to arouse this questioning spirit ...\\".  Recensions and dating of the Sic et non  There are eleven surviving full and partial manuscripts of the Sic et non. These are: *Zürich, Zentralbibliothek, Car.

Numa Pompilius consulted her frequently, but on the early Aventine. The life of Numa was of extensive interest to Antias. In Fragment 6 (Plutarch, Numa, 15 and elsewhere) following the nymph's advice he summons Jupiter from heaven and forces him to accept a remedy of onion and fish heads to counter the effects of a lightning strike, instead of the human heads proposed by the god. Livy ignores the story.Howard (1906), p. 163. Valerius Antias ( century BC) was an ancient Roman annalist whom Livy mentions as a source. No complete works of his survive but from the sixty-five fragments said to be his in the works of other authors it has been deduced that he wrote a chronicle of ancient Rome in at least seventy-five books.Howard (1906), p. 161. The latest dateable event in the fragments is mention of the heirs of the orator, Lucius Licinius Crassus, who died in 91 BC. Of the seventy references to Antias in classical (Greek and Latin) literature sixty-one mention him as an authority on Roman legendary history. Numa Pompilius consulting Egeria. Life Not much is known about the life of Valerius Antias. His family were the Valerii Antiates, a branch of the Valeria gens residing at least from early republican times in the vicinity of Antium (modern towns of Anzio and Nettuno). He may have been descended from Lucius Valerius Antias.Smith (1870), Antias. He was probably a younger contemporary of Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius and lived in the times of Sulla, although some scholars believe that he was a contemporary of Julius Caesar and wrote his work after 50 BC, because he seems to have been unknown to Cicero, who does not mention him in his enumeration of famous historians.De Legibus, 1.2.3-7. He was the most important of the so-called “younger annalists”. Work The nearly completely lost work of Antias – cited as annales or as historiae – began its account of the Roman history with the foundation of Rome and extended at least to the year 91 BC. The second book told about the legendary Roman king Numa Pompilius, the twenty-second book about the capitulation of Gaius Hostilius Mancinus in 136 BC (this event Livy only reports in book 55 of his history). Therefore, the earlier times were reported much shorter than the contemporary history of the author. The work of Antias was not very reliable. Livy criticizes his exaggerated numbers of killed and captured enemies in the Roman wars. Sometimes he seems to have even invented battles. But sometimes he also delivered correct values, which fact can be concluded from a comparison with some values given by Polybius. Antias’ account of each year included the allocation of troops and provinces, important omen, battles, foundation of new colonies etc. At the end of the description of each year he reported about plays, temple inaugurations, and other news, in particular about events in the city of Rome. Under the influence of Hellenistic historiography Antias related his stories very long- winded and filled with sensationalism to entertain his readers. He embroidered the mostly short accounts of older historians with dramatic details and also recounted legends and miracles. He falsified the report about the trials of the Scipio brothers (compare Livy 38.50-60) and seems to have invented high offices and deeds of members of his house, the gens Valeria, who lived in the early Roman republic because there were no reliable sources about these early times, which could have disproved his assertions. Antias gave a rationalistic account about the discovery of the coffins with the books of king Numa, because he had the coffins uncovered by rain and not by excavation like in the older tradition. The style of Antias was simple, but not archaic, and Marcus Cornelius Fronto (epistel ad Verus 1, 1, p. 134, 2 ed. Van den Hout) judged his language and style to be unattractive (invenuste). Therefore, he was rarely cited literally by later grammarians.Hans Volkmann, Valerius 98. In: Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft (RE), vol. 7A, 2 (1948), col. 2313-2340 Legacy In one long-standing view of Antias' influence on Livy, the latter relied mainly on the former in Books 1-10 of Ab Urbe Condita Libri, the legendary history of Rome. To elucidate this possible influence, A.A. Howard compared each of Antias' fragments with the equivalent story in Livy. He deduced that there is no evidence of such influence in the first ten books. Of twenty fragments falling within the period Livy does not use any, either omitting the information, or explicitly disagreeing with it. Howard says:Howard (1906), p. 167. > \\"The argument that Livy made free use of Antias and mentioned him only in > case of disagreement is absolutely without foundation, for we have seen > fourteen specific instances in which, although Livy does not mention him, he > nevertheless disagrees with his statements as known to us from other > sources, or absolutely disregards them....\\" For example, in Fragment 1 Acca Larentia willed her property to Romulus. Livy does not mention it. Fragment 3 mentions that exactly 527 Sabine Women were kidnapped. Livy says the number is greater than 30, and so on. For the entire period covered by Livy, 33 fragments of Antias come from Livy.Howard (1906), p. 181. He disagrees with six of these, criticizes eleven more, quotes Antias in disagreement on ten, and agrees with, but later disproves, two. Howard concludes disparagingly that > \\"It is on such evidence as this that we are asked to believe that Antias was > the source of considerable portions of Livy's history and that Livy followed > blindly, at least in the earlier part of his work. \\"  See also  * Livy's History of Rome References =Citations= =Bibliography= *  External links  * Old Latin-language writers Latin historians 1st-century BC historians 1st-century BC Romans Valerii Year of birth unknown Year of death unknown Antiates ","title":"Valerius Antias"},{"id":"996685","text":"A historiated initial from John Capgrave's Commentary on Exodus (c. 1440) showing Capgrave presenting his book to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. It is one of three remaining volumes of Gloucester's original bequest to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University John Capgrave (21 April 1393 – 12 August 1464) was an English historian, hagiographer and scholastic theologian. He is remembered chiefly for Nova Legenda Angliae (New Reading from England), the first comprehensive collection of the lives of English saints. Schooling Capgrave was born in Bishop's Lynn, now King's Lynn, Norfolk: \\"My cuntre is Northfolke, of the town of Lynne\\" (Life of St Katharine, p. 16). His parents are unknown but he may have been the nephew of a namesake who obtained a doctorate of theology at Oxford in 1390 and was also an Augustinian friar. Capgrave the younger joined the order at Lynn in about 1410 and was ordained in 1416 or 1417. He then studied theology at the order's school in London. By 1421, he was a lector, qualified to teach at all but one of the order's levels of schooling. He was then sent by the prior-general for further studies in Cambridge, where he delivered his examinatory sermon in Latin in 1422. He later wrote an English version of this as his treatise on the twelve orders that follow the rule of St Augustine.ODNB entry: Retrieved 29 June 2011. Subscription required. His progress from ordination to the degree of master of theology is said to have been the fastest recorded.F. X. Roth: The English Austin Friars, 1249–1538 (New York: Augustinian Historical Institute, 1961–6) I, 174. Cited in ODNB entry. Works Capgrave's earliest work was a Life of St Norbert in English from some time before 1422. There followed a succession of exegeses, many of them now lost. His lost commentaries entitled In regum are known to have been dedicated to Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester and to John Low, prior-provincial of the Augustinians in 1427–1433 and later a bishop. Capgrave was present when the foundation stone of King's College, Cambridge was laid on 2 April 1441 by Henry VI. Several hagiographies and royal biographies followed, including one in English of St Katharine. By 1446 he was Prior of the Augustinian friary at Bishop's Lynn. Capgrave paid a visit to Rome in 1449–1450 for the holy year of Jubilee and left an account that provides a glimpse into the histories, legends, traditions and public attitudes in the church at that time.C. A. Mills, ed.: Ye Solace of Pilgrimes. A Description of Rome, circa AD 1450, by John Capgrave, an Austin Friar of King's Lynn (London etc.: Oxford University Press, 1911). Retrieved 29 June 2011. Some later works were dedicated to William Grey, King's Proctor in Rome in 1450 and later Bishop of Ely. Only twelve of Capgrave's 45 known works survive, including the seven in English. Perhaps the most important for posterity was his Abbreviacion of Cronicles, which provides a frame for world history within an Augustinian framework, drawing on the St Albans chronicles by Thomas Walsingham and others. According to the Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature, the book \\"brings together what Capgrave felt were the most important events in world and later English history. He often moralized on historical incidents and consistently revealed a bias for Christians and later Englishmen in his depiction of events.\\"Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature, ed.

He is best known for his county history, Survey of Cornwall (1602). Life Carew belonged to a prominent gentry family, and was the eldest son of Thomas Carew: he was born on 17 July 1555 at East Antony, Cornwall. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a contemporary of Sir Philip Sidney and William Camden, and then at the Middle Temple. He made a translation of the first five cantos of Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered (1594), which was more correct than that of Edward Fairfax. He also translated Juan de la Huarte's Examen de Ingenios, basing his translation on Camillo Camilli's Italian version. (This book is the first systematic attempt to relate physiology with psychology, though based on the medicine of Galen. ) Carew was a member of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries, and is particularly known for his Survey of Cornwall (1602), the second English county history to appear in print. Later editions were published in 1723, 1769 and 1811, and Davies Gilbert published an index in his Cornwall, vol. 4, pp. 381–92. He also published an Epistle concerning the Excellencies of the English Tongue (1605). Carew served as High Sheriff of Cornwall (1583 and 1586), and as MP for Saltash in 1584. He was married to Juliana Arundell, the eldest daughter of Sir John Arundell of Trerice; their son Richard Carew was created a baronet in 1641 (see Carew baronets). Carew died on 6 November 1620 and was buried in Antony church on 7 November.

Initially, Palatines were representatives of the monarchs, later (from 1723) the vice- regent (viceroy). In the early centuries of the kingdom, they were appointed by the king, and later (from 1608) were elected by the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary. Palatine's jurisdiction included only Hungary proper, in the Kingdom of Croatia until 1918 the ban held similar function as the highest office in the Kingdom (after the king himself), monarch's representative, commander of the royal army and viceroy (after the union of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia with Hungary in 1102).  Title  The earliest recorded Medieval Latin form of the title was comes palatii (\\"count of the palace\\"); it was preserved in the deed of foundation of the Tihany Abbey, issued in 1055. A new variant (comes palatinus) came into use in the second half of the ; it was first recorded around 1067. The shortened palatinus form became the official version in the 1230s. A new official titlepalatinus regni Hungarie (\\"Palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary\\")was adopted in the 1340s, which shows that the palatines who were still royal officials were also regarded as representatives of the Estates of the realm from that time on. The original Hungarian version of the title was nádorispán; it was first recorded around 1405. The etymology of the word is uncertain. Most scholars agree that its root is the Slavic word for court (dvorjь), but no documents evidence that the assumed *nadъ-dvorjь-županъ (\\"head of the royal court\\") form actually existed. In Czech and Serbo-Croatian languages, similar expressions (náderšpan and nadršpan) existed, but only as loanwords from Hungarian, in reference to the palatines of Hungary. Ludovicus Tubero and some other 16th-century scholars referred to the palatine as nándorispán. Historian András Róna-Tas says that the title may be connected to the Bulgars' old Hungarian exonym (nándor). If his theory is valid, the palatine was originally the head of the Bulgars in Hungary. Other scholars have not accepted Róna-Tas's theory, because the nándorispán version seems to have developed from the original nádorispán version. The modern Hungarian version of the title (nádor), which is the shortened version of the original title, was first recorded in 1784.  History  = Origins ( 1000– 1100) = High-ranking officials who bore the title comes palatinus or comes palatii were present in several royal courts of medieval Europe. In the Carolingian Empire, the comes palatii was the monarch's deputy and one of the highest judges in the , according to the contemporaneous Hincmar. In Croatia, the zuppanus palatii was the head of the royal court in 892. In 11th-century Bohemia and in Poland, the \\"count of the palace\\" was the monarch's deputy in military affairs. According to a scholarly theory, the comes palatii was originally responsible for the administration of the royal household, but primary sources do not contain direct reference to the palatines' economic functions. Aba, the first known Palatine, later King of Hungary (r. 1041–1044) Hungarian historians agree that the imperial court of the Holy Roman Empire set the pattern for the organization of the royal household in Hungary. Historians also concur that the first king of Hungary, Stephen I, who died in 1038, appointed the first palatine, although no primary source mentioned this office during his reign. György Györffy says that one Comes Ceba, who was responsible for the transfer of ten villages to the Pannonhalma Archabbey on the king's behalf around 1005, must have been a palatine, because the villages were situated in many counties, suggesting that he was not the head of one county. The Long Life of Saint Gerard say that King Stephen I made Csanád \\"the master of the household of the king and Ajtony\\" after Csanád defeated Ajtony. Some historians (including Györffy and Gábor Thoroczkay) say that the text suggests that Csanád held the office of palatine for some time during Stephen's reign; other historians (for example, Tibor Szőcs and Tibor Almási) write that the author of the legend borrowed the expression from Psalm 105 which mentioned the \\"master\\" of the king's household. Nevertheless, Gerard of Csanád's same legend preserved the earliest historical event in connection with a palatinethe dethronement of Stephen I's successor, Peter Orseolo by \\"Count Palatine Aba\\" in 1041. According to modern scholars' consensus, Aba, who was Stephen I's brother-in-law or nephew, must have been made palatine by Stephen I. A decree of King Coloman the Learned stated that messengers sent by the ispáns from the borderlands to the monarch were entitled to \\"claim the cost of travel and an equal amount for the return journey\\"The Laws of the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary, 1000-1301 (Coloman:36), p. 27. from the palatine. No other primary sources contain direct evidence of the first palatines' economic duties, but other royal officials who were mentioned in 11th-century royal charters (including the ispáns and the stablemen) do not seem to have been responsible for the management of the royal household. Consequently, most historians say that most probably the palatines were the administrators of the royal domains and revenues up until the 1120s. The palatines' jurisdiction over the udvornici, or royal serving people, which is documented from the end of the , also validate this theory. The late 13th-century chronicler, Simon of Kéza, stated that it was King Coloman who had \\"made over his own udvornici for the use of the palatine of the realm\\",Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 2.96), p. 181. but Kéza's testimony is suspect. In his Admonitions, King Stephen I declared that the kings should not judge legal cases in person, suggesting that a high-ranking official administered justice on the kings' behalf already in the first half of the . Modern historians agree that the palatine was that high official. A law-book, issued during or shortly before the reign of King Ladislaus I of Hungary, preserved the first reference to the palatines' judiciary function, ordering that a palatine who administer justice to people who fell outside his jurisdiction should pay a fine of \\"fifty-five pensae\\" (the equivalent to 2,000 pence).The Laws of the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary, 1000-1301 (Ladislaus III:3), p. 18. The same decree also ruled that the \\"count of the duke\\" was to pay the same amount if \\"he judges others besides his own people\\", which suggests that the head of the \\"duchy\\" was also entitled to appoint his own palatine. = Middle Ages ( 1100–1485) = A new great officer, the curialis comes, appeared in the royal court in the first half of the . He was responsible for the management of the royal household. Authentic royal charters do not prove that the curialis comes administered justice on the king's behalf in the royal court in the , but according to a scholarly theory, he heard disputes in the royal court already during the reign of King Coloman's son, Stephen II of Hungary, which gave rise to the development of the palatines' own court of justice. The curialis comes was mentioned as iudex curie, or royal judge, after around 1219. Changes in the administration of the royal court and the palatines' office occurred around the same period. Hereafter the highest-ranking royal officials, including the palatine and the royal judge, were styled as \\"barons\\". The first documents issued in a palatine's name is dated to about 1219. Up to that time, the palatines' decisions had not been recorded by their own officials, but by other authorities, especially by cathedral chapters. The earliest references to the palatines' deputies, who were later known as vicepalatines or the palatines' vicejudges, were also recorded in 1219. From the 1230s, the monarchs occasionally entrusted the palatines, along with other barons of the realm, with specific tasks. For instance, Andrew II sent Denis, son of Ampud on diplomatic missions; Stephen Gutkeled destroyed mills built without permission on the river Rába on Béla IV's orders. The palatines acted as itinerant judges, wandering in the whole realm in the 1230s and early 1240s. Roland Rátót, who became palatine in 1248, abandoned this practice and mostly heard cases in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia). After Béla IV of Hungary and his son, Stephen divided the country along the river Danube in 1262, Stephen, who adopted the title of \\"junior king\\", set up his own royal court and made Denis Péc his palatine. Andrew III, who was crowned king in 1290, often made two influential noblemen palatines. During the interregnum that followed Andrew III's death, many oligarchs were styled palatines, including Amadeus Aba, Matthew Csák and Stephen Ákos. He was also the judge of the Jászok (Alans), of the Cumanians and of the Jews. Title of Palatine is abolished in 1848. From 1200, he was also the comes of several counties, thus being entitled to one third of the county taxes. From the 13th century, his deputy (vicepalatinus) was based in Pest (around 1300 temporarily in Old Buda), where he was simultaneously the county leader of the Pest county and judge of the middle nobility. The Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary of 1455 and 1456 issued the decree \\"de officio Palatinus\\", which guaranteed the palatine's position as the representative of the king. From around 1400 he was the viceregent of the king, a function which however only became important after 1526. He was allowed to command the royal army and to preside over the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary instead of the king. When the king was not of age or if there was an interregnum, he also could convene the Diet. From around 1450 he had the right to grant royal property — like the king himself but with certain restrictions. An act of 1485 explicitly stipulated that the palatine shall be the viceregent in the king's absence. = Early Modern Times (1485-1608) = After 1526, when the Habsburgs became rulers of the kingdom and the Turks seized large parts of the kingdom, the palatine, as the vice-regent (viceroy), had his seat outside Royal Hungary in Prague and later in Vienna. In 1526, the palatine became a life function. In 1527, the palatine István Báthory created the Hungarian Vice-regency Council (a kind of government, seat in Pozsony (German: Pressburg, now Bratislava) since 1531) comprising also other noble representatives, which became a permanent institution headed by the palatine in 1549. In 1608, the functions of vice-regent and palatine were separated. The Vice-regency council was abolished in 1673, but renewed in 1723, when the palatine became the official president of the council. After 1848, the palatine was only a symbolic function, but it was only in 1918 — with the end of Habsburgs in the Kingdom of Hungary (the kingdom continued formally until 1945) — that the function ceased officially.  Functions  = Deputy of the monarch = The Golden Bull of 1222 authorized the palatine to represent the monarch at the great assembly which was customarily held at Székesfehérvár on the feast of King St Stephen in each year. The presence of the palatine at the yearly law-day enabled him to act as a mediator between the sovereign and the noblemen. = Judicial functions = Initially, the palatines administered justice on the kings' behalf, primarily in the royal court. A decree, attributed to King Ladislaus I, explicitly forbade the palatine from \\"send[ing] the seal\\" to anyone \\"except only to those who are called [udvornici] and to those who come to him voluntarily\\" while he was absent from the royal court. On the other hand, the decree also shows that in the second half of the , the palatine's jurisdiction over the udvornici was independent of his role as the sovereign's deputy. Around 1100, King Coloman authorized the palatine to hear appeals against decisions of judges from the counties \\"if a popular outcry arises against them\\".The Laws of the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary, 1000-1301 (Coloman:37), p. 27. Four royal charters show that the palatines, along with other high-ranking royal officials, occasionally heard disputes between ecclesiastic institutions and royal people as judges, specifically assigned with the task by the monarchs in the . The palatines' own court of justice is documented from the early 13th century. In 1201, King Emeric exempted the \\"guest settlers\\" in Sárospatak from the jurisdiction of all judges but the king and the palatine, which proves that the palatines had already heard cases on their own right, not only as the monarchs' representatives. The Golden Bull of 1222 declared that a palatine had jurisdiction over all inhabitants of Hungary, although he was only authorized to condemn a nobleman to death or confiscate a nobleman's property if the monarch had consented to it. The same decree was completed with a sentence which confirmed the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts (including the clergymen's immunity) in accordance with customary law when King Andrew II of Hungary confirmed the Golden Bull on the prelates' demand in 1231.  Deputies  The earliest charters referring to the palatines' deputies mentioned them under several names, including vicarius palatini (in 1220 and 1221), and vicecomes palatini comitis and viceiudex palaini comitis (in 1221). The same documents, all preserved in the Regestrum Varadinense, suggest that the palatine and his deputies administered justice during the same period but in faraway territories: while Palatine Nicholas Szák heard cases in the lands east of the river Tisza, his deputies worked in Transdanubia in 1220. This practise was obviously unpopular, because the Golden Bull of 1222 explicitly stated that the palatine \\"shall have no deputy judge except for the one at his own court\\". Important palatines Important families that provided several palatines were: in the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th century were the Aba (family), Lackfi, in the 15th century the Garay, afterwards the Báthory and the Zápolya, Esterházy, Pálffy, and ultimately the Joseph branch of the Habsburg. Prominent palatines have been: in the early 17th century, István Illésházy of Trencsén, then up to 1616, György Thurzó and János Zakmárdi. Thurzó is the palatine who arrested Elizabeth Báthory, the countess accused for killing numerous girls and young women. The position was occupied in the remaining 17th century by members of the families Esterházy, Pálffy, Francis Wesselényi, Rhedey and others. The last palatines at the end of the 18th and the first half of the 19th century were the Habsburgs Archdukes Alexander Leopold, Joseph and his son Stephen, who resigned in 1848. Following Stephen's death in 1867 without issue, his half-brother Archduke Joseph August of Austria inherited the title, though the post by that time was symbolic only.

Considered part of the Irving Group of Companies, it was founded by entrepreneur Kenneth \\"K.C.\\" Irving and is privately owned by his son, Arthur, and his family. Irving Oil operates Canada's largest refinery, the Irving Oil Refinery, in Saint John, New Brunswick, and Ireland's only refinery, in Whitegate, County Cork, as well as a network of gasoline stations, fleet of oil tankers, real estate and other related assets. History  =Origins= Original refinery on the east side of Saint John, New Brunswick Entrepreneur Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving established Irving Oil Limited in 1924, when he was 25 years old. The first retailing location was in Bouctouche, New Brunswick, selling gasoline imported by rail. Irving moved to Saint John to open a Ford dealership and lubricants plant in 1924. The company expanded across the Maritimes through the 1930s, to Quebec in 1940, Newfoundland in 1949, and to Maine in 1972. =Environmental initiatives= In 1977, Irving Oil became the first Canadian oil company to offer unleaded gasoline at its retail outlets. In the late 1990s it became the first oil company in Canada and one of the first in North America to offer gasoline with very low sulphur content, a fact which was recognized by many automobile manufacturers. Due to its investment in reducing emissions, Irving Oil was one of the few energy companies in Canada to publicly support the Kyoto Accord. Operations =Refining= Irving Canaport sign Old style Irving Oil station, in Musquodoboit Harbour, Nova Scotia In 1960 the company partnered with Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL) to build the Irving Oil Refinery in the east end of Saint John. Irving bought out SOCAL's share of the refinery in the late 1980s and expanded the facility to become Canada's largest refinery, processing over . In the late 1990s, the refinery was upgraded to create some of North America's lowest-emission petroleum. Since 1970 the refinery has been served by the Canaport crude oil receiving terminal southeast of Saint John. In 2009 this facility was expanded to host the Canaport LNG terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG). Irving Oil announced in fall 2006 that it had purchased more land near Canaport and was examining the feasibility of constructing another refinery in the area to complement the original modernized 1960s-era refinery in the east end of Saint John; the new refinery was to be named the \\"Eider Rock Refinery\\" and was to be built under a partnership between Irving Oil and BP plc. On July 24, 2009 both companies announced that they were indefinitely postponing plans to build the second refinery. =Distribution= Marine Irving Oil's core retail area is in northeast North America and is well served by a network of regional ports and harbours in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and New England - an area that is under-served by pipelines. Consequently, the company economically transports much of its petroleum products to regional distribution terminals at ports throughout the region using its own fleet of coastal tankers. The Irving Whale, an oil barge owned by Irving Oil's sister firm J.D. Irving Ltd., was carrying a cargo of 4300 tons of No. 6 fuel oil for Irving Oil when it sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on September 7, 1970, causing a large initial oil spill and subsequent leaks for the next 26 years until it was salvaged by the federal government on July 30, 1996. In the 1990s, Irving Oil also took delivery of several Ultra Large Crude Carriers to deliver crude oil to the Saint John refinery from production locations in Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea. Road Irving Oil operates a large fleet of company- branded tanker trucks to deliver petroleum to retail locations from its Saint John refinery as well as the marine distribution terminals. Since the 1970s these semi-trailer tanker trucks were painted a distinctive golden yellow but the fleet underwent a paint scheme change in the 2000s to use white for both cab and trailer. Irving Oil's home heating fuel delivery truck fleet was similarly coloured and is undergoing a paint scheme change. Sister company J.D. Irving Limited owns and operates RST Industries which provides road tanker transport services for Irving Oil's wholesale deliveries, as well as for jet fuel, marine fuel, liquid asphalt, and other products. Rail Irving Oil once made extensive use of rail service to deliver petroleum from the Saint John refinery to rail-side distribution terminals throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. The decline in rural branch rail lines operated by Canadian National Railway and CP Rail in the 1980s and 1990s, combined with the increase of 4-lane highway construction, has seen Irving Oil eliminate practically all retail petroleum delivery by rail and the closure of many of its rail-side distribution terminals in favour of newer highway-served terminals or direct deliveries. Irving Oil continues to make extensive use of rail service for wholesale petroleum deliveries from its Saint John refinery. Products such as propane, liquid asphalt and diesel are delivered daily to locations in Quebec and New England via New Brunswick Southern Railway, owned by sister company J.D. Irving Limited as well as by CN. =Retail network= Irving Mainway, Westville, Nova Scotia Irving Oil operates bulk furnace oil and propane outlets in most major centres across Atlantic Canada, New England and Quebec as well as select locations in eastern Ontario, almost all of which are supplied from its Saint John refinery. Irving Oil also operates over 900 gas stations in these jurisdictions. In recent decades, smaller stations have been closed and consolidated as newer, larger facilities are constructed - Irving owns many choice real estate locations in communities across northeastern North America, some of which are no longer used for gas retailing, and others being held in speculation of some future need. Older stations are typically franchise operations and still have automobile service and repair shops, which in recent years are branded by Meineke. Convenience stores Most of Irving Oil's corporate owned-and-operated stations also contain convenience stores. These locations operated as simply \\"Irving\\" stations until the late 1990s, when the \\"Mainway\\" banner (\\"Marché Mainway\\" in Quebec) was introduced; \\"Mainway\\" being a brand appropriated from one of Irving's U.S. acquisitions. By the early 2000s, 56 of the company's Quebec locations had been leased to the Couche-Tard chain and rebranded accordingly, conversely 60 of Couche-Tard's fueling stations were supplied by Irving fuels and re-branded accordingly. By the mid 2000s, Irving began to renovate and rebrand its old \\"Mainway\\" stations under the name \\"Bluecanoe\\" as part of the company's modernization plan. The Bluecanoe brand was first introduced in New England and was introduced to some stations in eastern Ontario and the Atlantic provinces; however, many others were not upgraded and retained the older name \\"Mainway\\". On May 8, 2008, Irving announced that they would lease 252 of its gas stations in Atlantic Canada and New England to Couche-Tard for 20 years. Their gas remain supplied by Irving, but their convenience stores were converted to Circle K. In 2018, following Couche- Tard's acquisition of CST Brands (which saw most of its Canadian assets sold to Parkland Fuel), 36 Ultramar stations in Atlantic Canada were put into teams - most of them were sold off to Parkland Fuel, and the other 13 were sold to Irving outright (and rebranded to Irving/Circle K) under a similar agreement to the other locations. Big Stops Irving \\"Big Stop\\" truck stop sign near Fredericton, New Brunswick Irving Oil also operates several \\"Big Stops\\", which are truck stops featuring family restaurants, facilities for truck drivers, and convenience stores. These large stations are located at strategic locations throughout New England, the Maritimes, Quebec and Newfoundland. They occupy several hectares near important highway interchanges and junctions and have been developed since the 1970s; some of the oldest Big Stops are still in operation with the interiors being evocative of that era. These locations, aside from their convenience store operations, continue to be operated by Irving Oil. In the past decade, Irving Oil has opened several new Big Stops in New Brunswick to reflect the modernized and realigned arterial highway network in that province, and these facilities contain restaurants that have their own name and identity which are often reflective of the local area. The first modern Big Stop is in Salisbury, NB, and its restaurant is called \\"The Silver Fox\\"; the second one to open was in Lincoln, NB and has a restaurant called \\"The Blue Canoe\\"; the third was in Grand Falls, NB with a restaurant called \\"The Back Forty\\"; the most recent is in Enfield, NS with a restaurant called \\"Crossing\\" - the original name for the community. Irving corporate offices in Saint John Criticisms Examples of vertical integration within the \\"Irving Group of Companies\\" (as the Irving family refers to their holdings) include the acquisition or formation of businesses along the entire chain of production, from the Irving refinery (an Irving Oil subsidiary) and its retail outlets, to the transportation subsidiaries of J.D. Irving (RST, Midland, NB Southern, Sunbury), to various construction and engineering companies that assist in building, maintaining and expanding the conglomerate's facilities. Further examples of vertical integration within the conglomerate include Industrial Security Ltd. (ISL), the wholly owned security company that guards facilities, as well as industrial suppliers such as Thornes, Universal Sales and Commercial Equipment Ltd. which provide specialty goods and services to its companies. J.D. Irving, the sister firm to Irving Oil, is a dominant forestry company in northeastern North America, growing trees, harvesting trees and producing lumber, pulp and paper, and various enhanced value products such as magazine grade paper, tissue, and personal care products. James Irving also owns Brunswick News which controls most English-language newspapers in New Brunswick. The City of Saint John, where Irving Oil is located, is closely tied to the Irving Group of Companies, which are mostly headquartered there. In 2005, Irving Oil received a controversial tax break from the municipality to develop the Canaport LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal; it was apparently negotiated one-on-one with the city's then-mayor Norm McFarlane. The tax concessions have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million. The tax break was cancelled in December, 2016 at the request of Saint John city council, with unanimous support in the Legislative Assembly. The July 2013 Lac-Mégantic, Quebec rail tanker explosion increased awareness in Saint John of potential rail safety issues involving Irving Oil crude shipments, since the train that exploded was on its way to the Irving Oil refinery there. Irving Oil's siting of a crude oil rail terminal in an east neighbourhood of the city drew heavy criticism from environmentalists and residents. Irving Oil was allowed to establish the terminal without environmental assessments. The facility has since faced complaints regarding air quality and noise. There was also conflict in Saint John over the proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline that was to cross through a major municipal park. However, it is unknown if there would be any health risks to the community. The Dominion newspaper, an independent Canadian newspaper, has criticized Irving's ownership of Brunswick News, as well as the newspapers' journalistic integrity, particularly when reporting on companies controlled by the Irving family such as Irving Oil. Even the Canadian Senate has examined the issue; a report from the Senate in 2006 on media control in Canada singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies' ownership of all English- language daily newspapers in the province, including the Telegraph-Journal. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the Senate report, stated, \\"We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick.\\" The report went further, stating, \\"the Irvings' corporate interests form an industrial-media complex that dominates the province\\" to a degree \\"unique in developed countries.\\" At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses. In 2015 the Telegraph-Journal published editorials arguing against reconsideration of the tax concessions granted to Irving Oil, without acknowledging the conflict of interest. In 2016, coverage of Saint John Common Council advocacy for higher taxation of Irving Oil's refinery was notably absent from the newspaper, despite extensive coverage in CBC and other news outlets. There have also been accusations of Irving family political patronage, notably involving Allan Rock and Claudette Bradshaw of the Liberal Party of Canada. See also * Kenneth Colin Irving * J.D.

He is remembered as an anti-Walpolean satirist and also as a patriot. Several of his melodies continue to be sung today, and he was widely praised in the generation after his death. Because he worked in anonymity, selling his own compositions to others to pass off as their own, contemporary scholarship can only be certain of some of his poetry, and a great deal of the music he composed was written for theatrical incidental music. However, under his own name and hand, he was a prolific songwriter and balladeer, and he wrote the lyrics for almost all of these songs. Further, he wrote numerous operas and plays. His life is illustrative of the professional author in the early 18th century. Without inheritance or title or governmental position, he wrote for all of the remunerative venues, and yet he also kept his own political point of view and was able to score significant points against the ministry of the day. Further, he was one of the leading lights of the new \\"Patriotic\\" movement in drama. Early life Henry Carey was born in London and was the illegitimate son of George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax. Carey did not make the claim himself, but he did use \\"Savile\\" as the name of three of his male children, and these corresponded to the births of Halifax's own three sons. Furthermore, he dedicated all of his major works to Halifax (Gillespie 127). His biography in The Gentleman's Magazine also stated that Carey received a \\"generous annuity\\" from the Savile family, but that seems less likely and remains unconfirmed. The fact that, even when his most popular plays were on the boards, Carey would write for pay argues against such an annuity. Aside from rumor, it is impossible to be sure of Carey's parents. It is possible that a Henry and a Mary Carey, both school teachers, were his parents. Indeed, his first profession, according to Richard Hawkins, was as a music teacher in a boarding school for the middle gentry, a position he held while also working as an author, so these two Careys are the most likely candidates for at least his surrogate, if not his biological, parents. Early musical and literary work Scholars have trouble identifying Carey's first works, because he was probably writing anonymously. According to Laetitia Pilkington, friend of Jonathan Swift's and other Tory wits, Carey worked as a \\"subaltern\\" to James Worsdale later in his life, in 1734, when he was best paid and most famous. Since he was writing for pay when he had theatrical successes, it seems reasonable that he had been hiring his pen for quite some time. In the 18th century, he appears to have done hack work for the periodicals of the day. His first accredited work was a weekly publication of a set of serialized romance fictions entitled Records of Love in January through March 1710. This work was aimed at a female readership and was written with a clear expectation of an intelligent, educated, and populous set of readers. He also appears as a singer of Italian and English entre-acte songs at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane around 1710 (Gillespie 127). His first poetry publication came in 1713, the year of the height of the Tory ministry under Queen Anne with Poems on Several Occasions. In 1714, Carey had a job as a psalmist at Lincoln's Inn church and also at Drury Lane. He performed there with his music students. Critically, the Tory ministry fell with the death of Anne, and Robert Walpole's Whigs were on the rise. The leaders of the former government, Robert Harley and Henry St. John, were accused of treason over the coming months, and, while St. John fled, Harley was imprisoned in the Tower of London. In 1715, Carey wrote his first play, an afterpiece entitled The Contrivances. On 13 July 1717, Carey lost both of his jobs, at Drury Lane and at Lincoln's Inn, for a singular political statement. Harley had just been freed from the Tower and had attended Lincoln's Inn Church, and Carey set Psalm 124 to a jaunty, celebratory tune and sang it. The Psalm concerns the Exodus of the Israelites, announcing that :\\"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us: :Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: :Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul.\\" It concludes with \\"Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.\\" William Hogarth's satire of pantomime and puppet theatricals, 1724. Even though Carey lost those two jobs, he was soon back at Drury Lane, and he married Elizabeth Pearks in September. He produced his second play, Hanging and Marriage, in 1722. The theatrical seasons of 1723 and 1724 were dominated by pantomime and spectacle plays in London (inducing a young William Hogarth to satirize the abandonment of drama for puppets), and Carey worked providing the music to some of these productions. In 1723, he wrote the music for Harlequin Dr. Faustus (text, such as it was, by Barton Booth) at Drury Lane. From 1723 to 1733, Carey was the \\"unofficial composer in residence\\" for Drury Lane, and he wrote and performed much of the music between acts, preludes, and epilogue music, as well as the music called for by dances and other entertainments in the plays (Gillespie 127). Henry Carey never ceased to be a composer nor to work as a singer and musician. Even as he began to have greater success as a poet and playwright, he continued to work in music. Furthermore, Carey worked in a theatre that was associated with the Whig party. Colley Cibber, Robert Wilks, and Barton Booth were patronized first by Joseph Addison and his circle and then by Robert Walpole and his circle, and yet Carey appears to have been an unambiguous supporter of the Tory ministry of Henry St. John and Harley and the literary circle of Alexander Pope. When, therefore, Pope satirized the theatrical vacuity of the pantomime stage in The Dunciad, he was aiming not at the musicians and composers, but rather at the replacement of drama with spectacle. Namby Pamby and anti-Walpolean satire His poem, Namby Pamby (1725), satirized Ambrose Philips who was a frequent and famous target of Alexander Pope's wrath. Philips had written a series of odes to \\"all persons\\", from Robert Walpole to the mother in the nursery, and the latter provided the occasion for Carey to exaggerate. Philips had employed a 2.5' iambic line, and Carey devastatingly claimed that the half-line matched Philips's halfwitted conception. The poem was so successful that Carey himself began to be known as \\"Namby Pamby Carey\\" (while Philips became known as \\"Namby Pamby\\"), and the poem even came to be used as children's literature. Furthermore, the term \\"namby pamby\\" came into widespread usage to describe any nonsensical frippery. \\"Sally in Our Alley\\", one of Carey's songs, was also exceptionally successful, and it has been performed by many singers through to the modern era. Carey was, after Namby Pamby, a well-known figure among those opposed to Robert Walpole, and the poem had been praised by Alexander Pope (as \\"Sally in our Alley\\" had been by Joseph Addison). Carey was an admirer and subscriber to the operas of Handel, but he, like John Gay and Alexander Pope, thought that the operatic stars were absurd. Therefore, he began to satirize opera in 1726 and in that year he produced Faustina, or, the Roman Songstress, a satire of Faustina Bordoni. Faustina was at that time in a hissing fight with Francesca Cuzzoni and actually came to blows the next year during a performance of Handel. In the next year, he wrote Mocking is Catching to satirize Senesino, the Italian castrati opera star. In 1730, he added music and introduced ballads for his previous play, Hanging and Marriage, and put the play on as The Clown's Stratagem. He used the basic text of the play again, with new music, for Betty, or, The Country Bumpkins in 1732. These two characteristics—a love of opera and frustration at its abuses and a love of patriotism and frustration at Walpole's policies—would show up in all of Carey's professional works. In the same year, Carey may have been the first to sing \\"God Save the King\\" at a Patriot Whig meeting, and there is some reason to attribute the song to him. The Bath Chronicle of 13 August 1795 recounted: The earliest published version of God Save the King (for two voices) seems to date from the early 1740s. Carey as dramatic satirist An 1818 playbill for Chrononhotonthologos. As a playwright, Carey was a significant figure in the re-emergence of satirical drama in the 1730s. After the success of Namby Pamby, Carey was favored by the older generation of Tory wits and the Scriblerus Club. After John Gay's invention of the ballad opera with The Beggar's Opera, Carey turned to writing musical burlesques. He wrote a great deal of music and some librettos for other playwrights during this period. In 1732, J. F. Lampe, Thomas Arne, J. C. Smith and Henry Carey formed the English Opera project. Their goal was to revive serious opera in English. Together, they formed the English Opera Company, and Carey wrote two librettos, for Amelia (set by Lampe and acted at the Little Theatre at The Haymarket (an opposition playhouse favored by Henry Fielding)) and Teraminta (set by Smith and performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields). Amelia was a great popular success, but the opera company failed, and the project came to nought (Gillespie 128). Having satirized the foreignness of opera, in 1734 Carey turned his attention to the poorly written, mass-produced tragedy. Chrononhotonthologos was a parody of bombastic tragedy and, particularly, the very hack-written spectacle plays he had collaborated on at Drury Lane. The play was daring, for it was a satire of Caroline of Ansbach and George II of the United Kingdom. The Queen was attacked for her alliance with Robert Walpole and her general caprice. It also had a generous amount of music by Carey. If contemporary allies understood the criticisms inherent in the play, it was also possible to see it as a burlesque with nonsense verse. He followed that up with the ballad farce of The Honest Yorkshire-Man. Although Carey's attempt to revive serious, patriotic English opera did not work, his attempts at parody and satire in opera did. He had previously satirized the exoticism and emptiness of the English public's love of prima donna singers and castrati, but in 1737, he adapted The Dragon of Wantley from a Lincolnshire folk ballad into a full mock-opera. This literary adaptation was a step beyond adapting literary plays into ballads (as John Gay had done), for it began with a folk ballad and transformed it into opera. The play, with music by John Frederick Lampe, punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at Robert Walpole and his taxation policies. The play was a huge success. Its initial run was sixty-nine performances in the first season, which exceeded even The Beggar's Opera. The play debuted at the Haymarket, where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. Part of its satire of opera was that it had all of the words sung, including the recitatives and da capo arias (Gillespie 128). The play itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. The Musical Entertainer from 1739 contains engravings showing how the staging was performed (Gillespie 128). From 1737 to 1740, he wrote The Musical Century in one Hundred English Ballads in two volumes. Although Carey complained that his enemies were calling him \\"Ballad- maker,\\" the work was praised later by Charles Burney, and in the 19th century opinion of Carey's clear, simple, and memorable ballad tunes went even higher. Also in 1738, he helped found the Fund for Decayed Musicians, and he produced Margery, or, a Worse Plague than the Dragon, a sequel to The Dragon of Wantley. He had another popular success in 1739 with Nancy, or, The Parting Lovers, a patriotic play about a sailor leaving his beloved to fight against the Spanish. As with other works, Carey's point was primarily patriotic. Patriotic plays at the time were often demurrals of official policy and England's foreign entanglements. Nancy was set as well as written by Carey, and its main characters are a sailor, Nancy, and a Press Gang officer. The play broke new ground in explicitly treating a contemporary matter of social concern in song (Gillespie 128). Death Carey's son, Charles, died in 1743, and Carey hanged himself at his home in London later that year.Grimaldi (Boz edition), p. 94 While the anonymous account in The Gentleman's Magazine says that Carey had an annuity, he left a pregnant second wife (Sarah, whom he married between 1729 and 1733) and three dependent children, and both Hawkins and The London Stage say that he was despondent over financial difficulties. Grief over the death of his son is another possible explanation of his suicide, and Suzanne Aspden speculates that Carey suffered from paranoia, while others have suspected that he had depression or other maladies. His daughter Anne would become an actress and bear an illegitimate son, Edmund Carey, who would later be known as Edmund Kean. Literary significance Henry Carey's work has been tarred with allegations of triviality since his own day. He had an extraordinary gift with melody and wordplay, and later authors, such as Edward Lear, would cite Carey as a predecessor for his tongue twisters and nonsense verse in Namby Pamby and Chrononhotonthologos. At the same time, Carey's productions were noted in his own day for their political acuity and bravery (if not foolhardiness). He was willing to offend and suffer the consequences of his convictions, but he made his political statements in a diverting and apparently frivolous manner, thereby allowing his friends to respond to his politics and his enemies to dismiss his levity. In the Macaulay-dominated view of literary history of the early 20th-century, Carey was represented as a balladeer whose fundamental moroseness was proven by his shameful suicide, and his plays, now devoid of topicality, were set as broad entertainments. Musicologists have recognized, however, the subtle gifts necessary for Carey's music, and theater historians are beginning to recognize the context of his plays. He was the most prolific English song composer of 1715–1740, and he wrote his own lyrics to all but twelve of his two hundred and fifty songs (Gillespie 128). He was responsible for linking the vocal style of Henry Purcell to the later style of Arne by combining popular English folks song and tavern song with Italian flourishes.

It is closely related with ecological economics, but has a more politically applied focus. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report argues \\"that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognizing global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a Just Transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive.\\"UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of natural capital and ecological services as having economic value (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity and Bank of Natural Capital) and a full cost accounting regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.Runnals, D. (2011) “Environment and economy: joined at the hip or just strange bedfellows?”. S.A.P.I.EN.S. 4 (1) Green Sticker and ecolabel practices have emerged as consumer facing indicators of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a way to promote their greening practices in a globalizing economy.  Green economists and economics  Green economics is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after Lynn Margulis). A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist. Proponents of feminism, postmodernism, the environmental movement, peace movement, Green politics, green anarchism and anti-globalization movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to mainstream economics. The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of Green parties which are formally organized and claim the capitalised Green term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of \\"'green economists\\"' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, biomimicry and a fuller accounting for biodiversity. (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and Bank of Natural Capital for a layperson's presentation of these.) Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools. For instance, it is regarded as classical economics where the traditional land is generalized to natural capital and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as canals). Or, it is viewed as Marxist economics with nature represented as a form of Lumpenproletariat, an exploited base of non-human workers providing surplus value to the human economy, or as a branch of neoclassical economics in which the price of life for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low. An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of natural capital and full cost accounting under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of \\"green economics\\". As of 2010 the Bretton Woods institutions (notably the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (via its \\"Green Fund\\" initiative) responsible for global monetary policy have stated a clear intention to move towards biodiversity valuation and a more official and universal biodiversity finance. Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives. The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that \\"based on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation.\\" Definition Karl Burkart defines a green economy as based on six main sectors: * Renewable energy * Green buildings * Sustainable transport * Water management * Waste management * Land management Image:Sustainable development.svg|right|The three pillars of sustainability.|300px|thumb poly 138 194 148 219 164 240 182 257 219 277 263 291 261 311 264 331 272 351 283 366 300 383 316 394 287 408 261 417 224 424 182 426 154 423 119 415 87 403 58 385 40 368 24 347 17 328 13 309 16 286 26 263 43 240 64 224 84 212 107 202 Environment poly 324 219 334 226 343 234 351 242 359 251 366 263 371 276 375 287 400 279 417 272 438 263 453 252 466 241 477 229 488 214 497 193 482 189 463 188 423 188 398 191 376 196 352 204 Equitable poly 319 221 330 229 337 235 347 244 357 258 365 270 371 287 358 289 344 291 321 292 303 292 284 290 268 288 272 275 278 261 287 249 297 239 Sustainable poly 142 192 167 188 185 187 211 187 235 190 263 196 286 203 304 212 316 219 305 227 295 236 285 246 276 259 269 272 264 287 249 284 229 277 208 268 190 256 172 242 158 226 149 212 Bearable (Social ecology) poly 267 291 265 304 267 320 275 345 284 360 293 371 304 381 319 392 332 384 343 374 354 362 364 347 371 332 373 317 374 305 372 292 362 293 344 295 323 296 301 296 286 294 Viable (Environmental economics) poly 501 193 519 197 541 205 561 215 582 228 604 248 616 267 623 286 626 305 623 326 617 343 607 359 596 373 580 386 563 397 538 409 517 417 494 422 468 425 432 426 413 424 396 421 375 416 353 409 335 401 323 394 335 386 349 372 360 359 374 331 377 313 377 299 376 290 388 288 410 280 458 256 481 233 Economic poly 141 188 139 173 143 147 152 126 169 107 191 88 216 75 242 65 280 55 310 53 352 54 379 60 415 71 447 88 461 99 475 112 488 128 496 147 500 162 500 176 500 189 471 185 452 183 410 185 369 194 337 206 319 216 305 208 279 197 257 191 230 185 199 183 199 182 199 183 Social The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) representing global business defines green economy as “an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development”.UNDESA, (2012).

Ecological footprint measurements are a way to gauge anthropogenic impact and are another standard used by municipal governments.http://www.fcm.ca/Documents/reports/Ecological_Footprints_of_Canadian_Municipalities_and_Regions_EN.pdf  Green energy issues  Green economies require a transition to green energy generation based on renewable energy to replace fossil fuels as well as energy conservation and efficient energy use. The market failure to respond to environmental protection and climate protection needs can be attributed to high external costs and high initial costs for research, development, and marketing of green energy sources and green products.(Reinhardt, 1999; King and Lenox, 2002; Wagner, 203; Wagner, et al., 2005) The green economy may need government subsidies as market incentives to motivate firms to invest and produce green products and services. The German Renewable Energy Act, legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, all provide such market incentives. However, other expertsAmory Lovins, Hunter Lovins, and Paul Hawken, authors of Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, and Jay Conrad Levinson and Shel Horowitz, authors of Guerrilla Marketing Goes Green argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.  Criticism  A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature, arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy \\"will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years.\\" Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, Towards a Green Economy, while well-intentioned \\"ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations.\\" Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for UNCTAD also says that the focus on Green Economy and \\"green growth\\" in particular, \\"based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate change \\" and \\"may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can bring about a U-turn of global greenhouse gas emissions.U.Hoffmann (2011), \\"Some reflections on climate change, green growth illusions and development space\\" Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses,Spash, C.L. 2007.

May, 2-4 and argued that the Green Economy, as advocated by the UN, is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis. He has also criticised the UN's project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity (TEEB), and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms.Spash, C.L. 2008.

Armadillidium are also commonly known as pill woodlice, leg pebbles, pill bugs, roly-poly, or potato bugs, and are often confused with pill millipedes such as Glomeris marginata. They are characterised by their ability to roll into a ball (\\"volvation\\") when disturbed. Distribution and habitat They typically feed on moss, algae, bark and other decaying organic matter. They are usually found in moist areas such as decomposing leaf matter and soil. Armadillidium vulgare is the most abundant species in Europe and has been introduced worldwide. However, the vast majority of species are endemic to small regions close to the Mediterranean Sea, in much lower numbers than common species such as A. vulgare, and hence are understudied. Description Unlike other terrestrial arthropods such as insects and spiders, pill bugs do not have a waxy cuticle that would reduce evaporation from their bodies. Pill bugs also use modified lungs, called pseudotrachea, for respiration, and the lungs must remain moist to function. Individual pill bugs typically live for two or three years, and females brood eggs once or twice each summer. Several hundred eggs are brooded at a time in the marsupium, a pocket on the ventral side of the female pill bug. The marsupium must also be kept filled with water until the young hatch and crawl away. The colouration especially of young A. klugii resembles the red hourglass marking of the Mediterranean black widow Latrodectus tredecimguttatus. This is probably a kind of mimicry, to ward off predators that mistake the harmless animal for a venomous spider.Revision of the Armadillidium klugii-group (Isopoda: Oniscidea) Species File:The

As one of the Bluestocking Circle that surrounded Elizabeth Montagu,Encyclopaedia Britannica Retrieved 13 July 2016. she earned respect for the first English translation of the Discourses of Epictetus, by the 2nd-century Stoic philosopher. She also published poems and translated from French and Italian. Most of her other literary output took the form of correspondence to family and friends. Carter had many eminent friends and was close to Elizabeth Montagu, Hannah More, Hester Chapone, and other Bluestocking members. Anne Hunter, a minor poet and socialite, and Mary Delany were also noted as close friends. She befriended Samuel Johnson, editing some editions of his periodical The Rambler. Early life and education Born in Deal, Kent, 16 December 1717, Elizabeth Carter was the oldest child of Rev. Nicolas Carter, perpetual curate of Deal, and his first wife, Margaret (died c. 1728), who was the only daughter and heir of Richard Swayne of Bere Regis, Dorset. She died when Elizabeth was ten.18th C – People & Places Retrieved 13 July 2016. Her redbrick family home can still be seen at the junction of South Street and Middle Street, close to the seafront. Nicolas Carter himself undertook the labour of educating his numerous children in the Latin and Greek languages. His eldest daughter was so slow to understand her lessons that he almost despaired of ever making her a scholar, and would have given up the attempt but for her resolute perseverance as a child, in which she struggled incessantly against all obstacles. From an early age her ambition was to be good and learned, and she steadfastly pursued that goal through life. She could never acquire grammar as a rudimentary theory, but having attained great proficiency in the Greek and Latin languages – being especially proficient in Greek – she deduced the principles from the literature. Her father also taught her Hebrew. In order to assist her in acquiring French, her father sent her to board for a year in the family of M. Le Seur, a refugee minister at Canterbury, where she learned both to understand and to speak it with fluency. She subsequently applied herself to Italian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese, and very late in life, she learned enough Arabic to read it without a dictionary. Being naturally heavy, and resolved to stay awake as long as possible in pursuit of her studies, she had recourse to use snuff, and was never able to break herself of the habit. Over-application to her studies and lack of sleep brought on intense headaches, to which she remained subject through life. Her taste for literature was formed upon the finest models available, while her refined manner and habits were formed by an early introduction to high society. She carefully studied astronomy, and the geography of ancient history. She learned to play the spinnet and the German flute, and was fond of dancing in her youth. She drew tolerably well, was acquainted with household economy, loved gardening and growing flowers, and occupied her leisure or social hours with needlework. In the hope of counteracting the bad effects of too much study, she habitually took long walks and attending social parties. Career Writers; twenty portraits. Engraving by J.W. Cook, 1825. (Carter is in the first row, second from the left.) Her earliest attempts at literary composition were in verse. Her father was friendly with Edward Cave, the publisher, in whose fourth volume of The Gentleman's Magazine, she published several pieces, under the pseudonym of “Eliza,” when she was only sixteen years old. Visiting London occasionally with her father, she was introduced by Cave to many literary persons, and among the rest to Dr Johnson, soon after his first settling there in the year 1737. In 1738, she published an anonymous collection of her poems, including those which had been previously printed in The Gentleman’s Magazine. In the same year, her father had had conversations with Carter about marriage, and again a few years later, but she never married, wishing instead to remain independent. She adopted the matronly designation \\"Mrs\\" after the manner of an earlier generation. Carter rendered into English De Crousaz's Examen de l'essai de Monsieur Pope sur l'homme (Examination of Mr Pope's \\"An Essay on Man\\", two volumes, 1739); Algarotti's Newtonianismo per le dame (Newtonianism for women). Elizabeth Robinson, born in 1720, was the eldest daughter of Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby, who had married the heiress of the Drakes of Horton, near Hythe. Elizabeth spent a great part of her childhood there, and was early attracted by sympathy of feeling and similarity of pursuits towards her young contemporary and neighbour, Elizabeth Carter. A close friendship was formed between them, which lasted to the end of their long lives. In the year 1742, Elizabeth married Edward Montagu, a grandson of the second Earl Of Sandwich; and subsequently to that event, Carter often visited Mrs Montagu, at her country seat at Sandleford and at her house in London. In 1741 she began her acquaintance with Catherine Talbot, which became a close friendship for they appreciated each other's faculties, virtues, and piety. Through Talbot and her mother, she came into contact with Thomas Secker, with whom they resided. He was then Bishop of Oxford, and became the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1758. Title page of the Works of Epictetus, translated by Carter. First edition, 1758 Early in the year 1749, she commenced her translation of All the Works of Epictetus, Which are Now Extant, which she submitted sheet by sheet to Secker's revisal. She finished the Discourses in December 1752, but at his suggestion added the Enchiridion and Fragments, with an introduction and notes. A subscription having been got up by him and her other wealthy and influential friends, the work was published in 1758, Carter's position in the pantheon of 18th-century women writers was ensured by her translation of Epictetus, the first English translation of the known works by the Greek Stoic philosopher, and it brought her in a clear profit of £1,000. This translation passed through three editions and retained a high reputation in standard literature.Susan Staves, A Literary History of Women's Writing in Britain, 1660–1780 (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2006) pp. 309–15. While she was occupied in preparing the first edition for the press, Carter was also preparing her youngest brother for the University of Cambridge. Carter befriended Samuel Johnson, editing some editions of his periodical The Rambler in the 1750s. He wrote, \\"My old friend Mrs. Carter could make a pudding as well as translate Epictetus from the Greek...\\" =Deal, Kent= Her father having lost his second wife, and his other children being all settled in homes of their own, Carter bought a house at Deal in 1762. Her father rented part of it, while she managed the household. They had their separate libraries, and spent their studious hours apart, meeting at meals, and spending their evenings together during periods of six months. The other half of the year she usually passed in London, or in visiting her friends at their country houses. At the suggestion of William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath, who took great delight in her conversation and writings, Carter published another volume of poems in 1762, to which George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton contributed a poetical introduction. In 1763, she accompanied the Earl of Bath and Edward and Elizabeth Montagu on a continental tour. They crossed the Channel to Calais, visited the Spa, passed down the Rhine, and, travelling through Brussels, Ghent, Bruges, and Dunkirk to Calais, re-crossed to Dover, after an absence of nearly four months. In the summer of 1764, Lord Bath died; and as he made no mention of Elizabeth Carter in his will, the ultimate heir to his property, Sir William Johnson Pulteney, spontaneously settled upon her an annuity of £100, which he soon afterwards increased to £150. In August 1768, her friend Archbishop Secker died; in November 1769, her friend Miss Sutton died; and in 1770, her best friend Catherine Talbot died. In the same year, Carter edited and published a volume of Talbot's papers, under the title of Reflections on the Seven Days of the Week; and subsequently, two volumes of Essays and Poems. After her father's death in 1774, a small inheritance fell to her. In 1775, Edward Montagu died and his wife Elizabeth inherited a large property. Among her first acts was to bequeath an annuity of £100 to Carter. Mrs Underwood, a family connection of the Carters, afterwards bequeathed to Carter an annuity of £40; and Mrs Talbot dying in 1783, left her the sum of £200 as a legacy. Thus not only did Carter attain literary fame, she acquired, by means which she could never have anticipated, a secure income for her wants and needs. =Nine Living Muses= Elizabeth Carter (far left), in the company of other \\"Bluestockings\\" in Richard Samuel's The Nine Living Muses of Great Britain, 1779.

Later years and death Elizabeth Carter, Poems on several occasions. The fourth edition. (1777) Carter's difficulties were all confined to her books of private study; she met with no discouragements from the outer world. Her translations were approved, her verses were applauded by Burke, Dr. Johnson, Savage, and Baratier; and she found herself courted by many members of learned society. In 1782, at the desire of her friend, Sir W. J. Pulteney, she accompanied his daughter to Paris, but she returned home in sixteen days, and limited her subsequent journeys to British soil. She was repeatedly honoured at Deal with visits from various members of the royal family. The Queen, who had long been accustomed to ask her opinion upon books via ladies of the court, at last, in 1791, commanded her attendance at Cremorne House, where the translator of Epictetus was formally presented and received with the highest favour. In 1796, Carter had a dangerous illness, from which she never thoroughly recovered. She continued, however, to exert herself in visiting the poor, as well as in the establishment and maintenance of charitable institutions. In the year 1800, her faithful friend, Mrs Montagu, died at the age of eighty. Their correspondence, from 1755 to 1799, was published after Mrs Carter's death by her nephew, Mr Pennington. As with her bluestocking contemporaries, Carter lived a long life. Deafness increasing with age reduced her conversational abilities. On 19 February 1806, after a long period of gradually increasing weakness, Carter died at her lodgings in Clarges Street, London. Style and themes Her sound and comprehensive mind, highly cultured as it was, could produce nothing bad, but it lacked the essential qualifications of the true poet: active originality, the power of conceiving, and of shaping new conceptions. Her poems demonstrated regularity of numbers, and the well graduated succession of thoughts. Carter's biographer published an extensive selection from her thirty years’ correspondence with Talbot, and her correspondence with Mrs Agmondesham Vesey between the years 1763 and 1787, in two quarto volumes. Carter's letters were noted for correct, perspicuous, and appropriate language; for soundness of judgment, moderation of spirit, deep sincerity, and pervading piety. Her cheerful disposition was evidenced not only in her sentiments and opinions, but in her occasional expressions of buoyant gaiety where there was always something awkward, forced, and exaggerated. Carter kept an interest in religious matters. She was influenced by Hester Chapone, and she wrote apologetic treatises of the Christian faith, asserting the authority of the Bible over human matters. One of these works, known as Objections against the New Testament with Mrs Carter's Answers to them and was published in the compilation of writings Memoirs of the Life of Mrs Elizabeth Carter by Montagu Pennington, which included her Notes on the Bible and the Answers to Objections concerning the Christian Religion. Her deep belief in God also appears in her poems \\"In Diem Natalem\\" and \\"Thoughts at Midnight\\" (also known as \\"A Night Piece\\"). Influence and legacy The novelist Samuel Richardson included Carter's poem \\"Ode to Wisdom\\" in the text of his novel Clarissa (1747–48) without ascribing it to her. It was later published in a corrected form the Gentleman's Magazine and Carter received an apology from Richardson. Elizabeth Gaskell, the 19th- century novelist, refers to Carter as an epistolatory model, bracketing her in Cranford with Hester Chapone, a self-taught Bluestocking.Cranford, Chapter V-- Old Letters Virginia Woolf saw her as a feminist precursor – urging \\"homage to the robust shade of Eliza Carter – the valiant old woman who tied a bell to her bedstead in order that she might wake early and learn Greek.\\"V.

He was the author of a work entitled Annales, probably from the earliest times down to his own days. The fragments indicate the great variety of subjects discussed: the origin of the appeal to the people (provocatio); the use of elephants in the circus games; the wearing of gold rings; the introduction of the olive tree; the material for making the toga; the cultivation of the soil; certain details as to the lives of Cicero and Terence. The work was referred to (mention is made of an abridged edition) by Pliny the Elder, Asconius Pedianus (the commentator on Cicero), Nonius and the philologists. Fragments of his work can be found in Hermann Peter's Historicorum Romanorum fragmenta (1883). A work published under the name of L.

He was the author of several nautical novels that remained popular through the 19th century. Life Chamier was the son of an Anglo-Indian official, John Ezechial Chamier and his wife Georgiana, daughter of Vice-Admiral Sir William Burnaby. The family home was in Grosvenor Place, London. He entered the Royal Navy in June 1809, joining the frigate as a midshipman in time for the Walcheren Campaign. After the campaign the Salsette was ordered to the Mediterranean and while at Smyrna on 11 April 1810 met with Lord Byron who on hearing the ship was making for Constantinople asked Captain Bathurst for a lift. Byron took a friendly interest in the young Chamier and when the ship stopped en-route at Tenedos within sight of the plains of Troy prevailed on the captain to allow the boy ashore to carry his fowling piece. There Byron sat down on the tomb of Patroclus, and pulled out his copy of Homer and read for his companions. Chamier would become a lifelong devotee, and sprinkle his own books in the future with many Byronic quotations. Later in May 1810, Chamier watched Byron on his famous swim across the Hellespont from Europe to Asia at the second attempt. He described the episode in his autobiography. Once in Constantinople the young midshipman accompanied his captain to various receptions and audiences for Sir Robert Adair with the sultan Mahmud II. Bathurst was promoted in November 1810 to command the 74-gun and took Chamier with him. Later by April 1811 Chamier went on to serve in the mediterranean on the fighting the slave trade. This was followed from October 1811 to 1814 on board the under Sir Peter Parker. He was onshore with Parker when the latter was killed at Bellair on 30 August 1814. On 6 July 1815 he was promoted lieutenant, and continued service in the Mediterranean, the home station, and the West Indies. From 20 September 1824 to 3 August 1825 he was first lieutenant on the . He was on the West Indies station until 9 August 1826, when he was put briefly in command of the 10-gun brig for bringing her home to England in 1827, but thereafter was very soon paid off. Chamier took no further employment and in 1833 was placed on the retired list of the navy, on which he was formally promoted captain on 1 April 1856. Effectively retired in 1827, he settled down to the life of an Essex county squire, further dividing his time between his house in Halkin Street, Belgravia, and Paris. His autobiography, The Life of a Sailor, was serialised in The Metropolitan Magazine in 1831–1832). In 1831 he was engaged in editing the translated transcript of Mikhail Zagoskin's novel Dmitrich Miloslawsky to be issued in England as The Young Muscovite; or, The Poles in Russia, which apparently dated from 1824. The translation had been provided from Moscow by a Russian lady of rank and her two daughters. The book's publication was ceaselessly reported as imminent throughout 1831 and in early 1834. It was intended to publish in three parts, but it was not to appear on London bookshelves until March 1834, and when it did, it was found to have been extensively adapted to acclaim by Charmier. At the tail end of 1831 Chamier lost a considerable sum in a failed venture the premature establishment of The Metropolitan Magazine, his friend Frederick Marryat would make something of it, later that year. Licking his wounds in Paris he met his future wife Bessie Soane in January 1831. The couple wished to marry but Bessie's guardian Sir John Soane refused permission, despite Chamier, on the face of it, being a man of means; his father had left him a legacy of £10,000 and his writing at that stage was earning him £300 a year. The couple clandestinely eloped to Gretna Green. The couple remarried in Esher that April in an unsuccessful bid to placate the family, to no result, and went off to live in Paris From October 1832 till August 1834. Their only child Elizabeth was born there in the January. He also wrote nautical novels somewhat in the style of Marryat, including The Unfortunate Man (1835), Ben Brace, the Last of Nelson's Agamemnons (1836), The Arethusa (1837), Jack Adams, the Mutineer (1838), The Spitfire (1840), Tom Bowling (1841), a trilogy Count Konigsmark (1845) and Jack Malcolm's Log (1846). In addition, he continued William James's Naval History and wrote some books of travel. Chamier invested heavily in the railways. In 1845 alone was a director of several companies, notably the Fampoux and Hazebrouck, the Paris and Lyon, the Cambridge and Lincoln Extension, the ruinous Northampton and Cambridge, and the Rugby and Worcester. He had been in Paris during the revolution of February 1848, and published an account of that period under the title A Review of the French Revolution of 1848, in which he depicted the main personages taking part in the events. Chamier held for some time an official post abroad, but retired to Warrior Square, St Leonards-on-Sea, where he died on 29 October 1870 after a lingering illness, survived by his wife. The couple are buried in Hastings Cemetery. He had married in 1832 Elizabeth, daughter of the late John Soane, of Chelsea, and granddaughter of the celebrated Sir John Soane.. His wife, Elizabeth died in 1879. The couple's only child, Eliza Maria Chamier, first married Captain Frederick Crewe, and on his death married Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, 7th Baron Calthorpe. Frederick Chamier laid claim to being descended from the 17th-century French Huguenot politician Daniel Chamier. Reception Chamier's most popular books were: *Life of a Sailor, reprinted six times between 1832 and 1873A new edition appeared in 2011: The life of a sailor: Frederick Chamier, edited and introduced by Vincent McInerney (Barnsley: Seaforth). *Ben Brace, reprinted eleven times between 1836 and 1905 *Tom Bowling, reprinted five times between 1858 and 1905 *The Spitfire, reprinted three times between 1840 and 1861 In 1870 The Times described Chamier as \\"a veteran novelist, one, indeed, whose sea novels some quarter of a century ago were almost as universally popular as those of Captain Marryat.\\" Captain Chamier's works were popular on the Continent; some appeared in two or three translations.

Conduct books Title page from the first edition of Hester Chapone's Letters on the Improvement of the Mind (1773), one of the most popular conduct books at the time Mary Wollstonecraft was writing her first work The former was first written for her 15-year-old niece, in 1773, but by 1800 it had been through at least 16 editions. A further 12 editions had appeared by 1829, at least one of them a French translation. They focused on encouraging rational understanding through the reading of the Bible, history and literature. The girl addressed was also supposed to study book- keeping, household management and botany, geology, astronomy. Only sentimental novels were to be avoided. Mary Wollstonecraft singled it out as one of few examples of the self-improvement genre that deserved praise. The tide of advice or conduct books in Britain reached its height between 1760 and 1820; one scholar calls the period as \\"the age of courtesy books for women\\".Quoted in Armstrong, p. 61. As Nancy Armstrong writes in her seminal Desire and Domestic Fiction (1987): \\"So popular did these books become that by the second half of the eighteenth century virtually everyone knew the ideal of womanhood they proposed.\\"Armstrong, p. 61. Chapone's is a typical example.Sutherland, pp. 28 and 35. Conduct books integrated the styles and rhetoric of earlier genres, such as devotional writings, marriage manuals, recipe books, and works on household economy. They offered their readers a description most often of the ideal woman, while at the same time handing out practical advice. Not only did they dictate morality, but they guided readers' choice of dress and outlined what was seen in that period as proper etiquette.Sutherland, p. 26. Chapone's work in particular appealed to Wollstonecraft and influenced her composition of Thoughts. She admired it for its \\"sustained programme of study for women\\" and basis on the idea that Christianity should be \\"the chief instructor of our rational faculties\\".Sutherland, p. 29, and on its emphasis that women should be considered rational beings and not left to wallow in \\"sensualism\\".Sutherland, p. 41. Wollstonecraft drew on both Chapone and Macaulay's works when she wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792.Sutherland, pp. 42–43. Another admirer, and also a personal friend, was the novelist and diarist Frances Burney. Their surviving correspondence includes a letter of condolence of 4 April 1799 from Burney to Chapone, on the death in childbirth of Jane Jeffreyes, née Mulso, the niece to whom the Letters on the Improvement of the Mind had been addressed.The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Madame D'Arblay).

Life He was born in Limerick on 11 January 1762. His father, John Cherry, a printer and bookseller in Limerick, is said to hare intended him for the church. At eleven years of age, however, Cherry left the Limerick from school and entered the employment of James Potts, a printer and bookseller in Dublin. From an early period, he displayed a taste for the stage, and at the age of fourteen he played as an amateur, in a room at the Black-a-Moor's Head, Towers Street, Dublin, Lucia in Addison's Cato. Three years later be first appeared at Naas, county Kildare, as a member of a strolling company under the management of a Mr. Martin, playing Feignwell in A Bold Stroke for s Wife. As a strolling player in Ireland, he purchased, at the cost of constant exposure and imminent risk of starvation, a fair knowledge of his art. According to the accounts of his career published during his lifetime, he was on one occasion three days without food. Yielding to discouragement he returned to his former occupation and remained in Dublin for three years. After one or two attempts to resume his profession of an actor he joined the company of Richard William Knipe, a well-known and popular manager, whose daughter, after the death of her father, he married in Belfast. Cherry then joined the 'principal provincial company of Ireland' under the management of Atkins, and played with an increasing reputation in the north of Ireland a round of leading characters. Mr. Ryder having in 1787 been engaged for Covent Garden, Mr. Cherry was called up to supply his place at the Theatre Royal, Smock Alley, Dublin. As Ryder's first appearance took place on 25 October 1766, this data is seen to be not wholly trustworthy. For five or six years Cherry, familiarly known as 'Little Cherry,' enjoyed a high reputation in Dublin. His first part in the Smock Alley Theatre was Darby in the Poor Soldier of O'Keefe. Early in the season of 1791–2, he appeared with his wife in Hull as a member of the company of Tate Wilkinson, playing comic characters previously assigned to Fawcett, who had just quit the York circuit for Covent Garden. He first appeared as a member of Wilkinson's troupe at Wakefield as Vapid in the Dramatist, and Lamrillo in Jephson's Two Strings to your Bow. In the spring of 1794, Cherry, irritated that Fawcett, then on a starring tour, resumed his old parts, threw up his engagement with Tale Wilkinson and returned to Dublin, where he continued for two seasons, after which, with his wife, he engaged with Ward and Banks at the Theatre Royal, Manchester. Thence, to replace Blisset, he proceeded to Bath, in which city he made his first appearance on 6 October 1798. From Bath, he made his way to Drury Lane, at which house he appeared for the first time on 25 September 1802 as Sir Benjamin Dove in the Brothers of Cumberland, and Lazarillo in Two Strings to your Bow. At this house, at which one or two of his pieces were produced, he stayed until 1807, after which his name disappeared from the bills. A few years subsequently he was managing a theatrical company in Wales. By his wife, Cherry had a large family. He died at Monmouth in February 1812. Assessment Genest was unfavourably impressed with Cherry as an actor.

The height of the kinetic energy decreases asymptotically toward zero as the speed decreases and distance increases according to Kepler's laws. In astrodynamics or celestial mechanics a parabolic trajectory is a Kepler orbit with the eccentricity equal to 1 and is an unbound orbit that is exactly on the border between elliptical and hyperbolic. When moving away from the source it is called an escape orbit, otherwise a capture orbit. It is also sometimes referred to as a C3 = 0 orbit (see Characteristic energy). Under standard assumptions a body traveling along an escape orbit will coast along a parabolic trajectory to infinity, with velocity relative to the central body tending to zero, and therefore will never return. Parabolic trajectories are minimum-energy escape trajectories, separating positive-energy hyperbolic trajectories from negative-energy elliptic orbits. Velocity The orbital velocity (v\\\\,) of a body travelling along parabolic trajectory can be computed as: :v = \\\\sqrt{2\\\\mu \\\\over r} where: *r\\\\, is the radial distance of orbiting body from central body, *\\\\mu\\\\, is the standard gravitational parameter. At any position the orbiting body has the escape velocity for that position. If a body has an escape velocity with respect to the Earth, this is not enough to escape the Solar System, so near the Earth the orbit resembles a parabola, but further away it bends into an elliptical orbit around the Sun. This velocity (v\\\\,) is closely related to the orbital velocity of a body in a circular orbit of the radius equal to the radial position of orbiting body on the parabolic trajectory: :v = \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\, v_o where: *v_o\\\\, is orbital velocity of a body in circular orbit. Equation of motion For a body moving along this kind of trajectory an orbital equation becomes: :r = {h^2 \\\\over \\\\mu}{1 \\\\over {1 + \\\\cos u}} where: *r\\\\, is radial distance of orbiting body from central body, *h\\\\, is specific angular momentum of the orbiting body, * u\\\\, is a true anomaly of the orbiting body, *\\\\mu\\\\, is the standard gravitational parameter. Energy Under standard assumptions, the specific orbital energy (\\\\epsilon\\\\,) of a parabolic trajectory is zero, so the orbital energy conservation equation for this trajectory takes the form: :\\\\epsilon = {v^2 \\\\over 2} - {\\\\mu \\\\over r} = 0 where: *v\\\\, is orbital velocity of orbiting body, *r\\\\, is radial distance of orbiting body from central body, *\\\\mu\\\\, is the standard gravitational parameter.

He was best known for political satire. Early life The son of the Rev. Thomas Cleveland, vicar of Hinckley (1620–52), Cleveland was born in Loughborough, and educated at Hinckley Grammar School. Admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, he graduated BA in 1632 and became a fellow of St John's College in 1634, where he became a college tutor and lecturer on rhetoric. Posts A staunch Royalist, Cleveland opposed the election of Oliver Cromwell as member for Cambridge in the Long Parliament, and lost his college post as a result in 1645. He then joined Charles I, by whom he was welcomed, and was appointed to the office of Judge Advocate at Newark. In 1646, however, he lost this office, and wandered about the country dependent on the bounty of other Royalists. In 1655 he was imprisoned at Great Yarmouth, but released by Cromwell, to whom he appealed, and went to London, where he lived till his death. For his letter to Cromwell, see May it please yr Highnesse (1657) or Cleaveland's petition to His Highnesse the Lord Protector [sic]. Poems and other works Cleveland's poems first appeared in The Character of a London Diurnal (1647) and thereafter in some 20 other collections. His real achievement lay in his political, satirical poems, written mainly in heroic couplets. He has been called \\"both a detached, intellectual, 'metaphysical' poet\\" and \\"a committed satirist\\". Cleveland also wrote Royalist news books such as Mercurius Pragmaticus for King Charles II, which appeared after the execution of Charles I. He was particularly interested in the 14th-century Wat Tyler rebellion against Richard II; cf. The idol of the clownes, or, Insurrection of Wat The Tyler (1654) and The Rebellion of the Rude Multitude under Wat Tyler and his priests Baal and Straw (1660). His volume of Poems was published in 1656.

She was the author of a number of books and essays, including The Intuitive Theory of Morals (1855), On the Pursuits of Women (1863), Cities of the Past (1864), Criminals, Idiots, Women and Minors (1869), Darwinism in Morals (1871) and Scientific Spirit of the Age (1888). Life Hajjin was Frances Power Cobbe's canine companion and traveled with her and her partner, Mary Lloyd, to Wales after Cobbe retired Frances Power Cobbe was a member of the prominent Cobbe family, descended from Archbishop Charles Cobbe, Primate of Ireland. She was born in Newbridge House in the family estate in what is now Donabate, Co. Dublin. Cobbe worked at the Red Lodge Reformatory and lived with the owner, Mary Carpenter, from 1858 to 1859, but a turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school and moved out.Saywell, R J, Mary Carpenter of Bristol, The University of Bristol, 1964 (2001 reprint) Cobbe formed a lesbian relationship with the Welsh sculptor Mary Lloyd (1819-c. 1896), whom she met in Rome in 1861 and lived with from 1864 until Lloyd's death. That death, in 1896, affected Cobbe badly. Her friend, the writer Blanche Atkinson, writing, “The sorrow of Miss Lloyd’s death changed the whole aspect of existence for Miss Cobbe.

She met him again during 1869 in Wales, and apparently interrupted him when he was quite ill, and tried to persuade him to read John Stuart Mill—and indeed Darwin had read Cobbe's review of Mill's book, The Subjection of Women. She then lost his trust when without permission she edited and published a letter he'd written to her. Her critique of Darwin's Descent of Man, Darwinism in Morals was published in The Theological Review in April 1871.

Selective removal of parts of a plant such as branches, buds, or roots is typically known as pruning. In forestry, thinning is the selective removal of trees, primarily undertaken to improve the growth rate or health of the remaining trees. Overcrowded trees are under competitive stress from their neighbors. Thinning may be done to increase the resistance of the stand to environmental stress such as drought, insect infestation, extreme temperature, or wildfire.  In forestry  Thinning in the Umatilla National Forest This may be done to make the stand more profitable in an upcoming final felling or to achieve ecological goals such as increasing biodiversity or accelerating the development of desired structural attributes such as large diameter trees with long tree crowns. Early thinning, say after 20 years rather than late thinning, say after 50 years has different effects on the trees thinned. An early thinning would encourage trees to get wider crowns, increase diameter and be more stable against threats like snow breakage or windthrow. Too much too early would lead to a site overgrowing with shrubs and prevent an understory regenerating effectively. Doing it too late would mean that trees would grow tall and slender and though some increment would come to the trees, they may be less marketable as thinness reduces value. Too early and epicormic shooting is a risk, and this can lead to tree branchiness and knots in the resultant timber harvest, again reducing value. Traditionally thinning has been done to create a desired balance between individual tree attributes (such as tree diameter) and per area attributes such as volume.Smith et al. 1997 It has been, and often still is, applied with the desire to create uniform stands. Thinning treatments are often described in terms of number of trees per area to remain or average spacing between trees. The intent is to create and manage uniform stands. It is also more needed when too many trees were initially planted or survived from the seedling phase. Planting less and thinning less saves money in commercial forestry, so a good balance is required and is dependent on site qualities as well as planting régimes. There is no sure result from thinning and no standard timing or other aspect. Individual site conditions and species responses or species mixes on sites may vary considerably and thus responses to thinnings likewise. Norway spruce on a suitable site have responded well in terms of growth increment, to late thinnings (after 50 years)Responses from thinning a 50 year old Norway spruce plantation in central New York, SUNY Coll. Enviro. Sci. & Forestry Sch. Tech. Publication No. 1 (ESF 85-002) Drew, AP 1985 whereas other species have not for example slash pine.Thinning practices in short-rotation stands. In A.B. Crow (Ed.), Advancement in management of Southern pines pg 50-60 10th Ann Forerst Symposium Baton Rouge LA. State UniPress 1961 Due to such variability it is better to talk about a thinning régime rather than one particular method of thinning taking place in a stand. =Thinning methods= * thinning from below – this low thinning can be split into 4 Grades: A Grade is a very light thinning, that removes all overtopped trees Kraft crown class 4 and 5. B Grade is a very light thinning that removes overtopped trees and intermediates which are Kraft Crown class 4,5 and some 3s, C Grade and D Grade are a moderate and heavy thinning respectively removing anything that will not lead to high quality tree crown growth. * thinning from above – this crown thinning removes all of the trees that impact crown wise on other trees. Smaller trees, Kraft crown class 5 for example would just be ignored and left in the stand and not cut. It is also called the French method.Baker, Frederick. Theory and Practice of Silviculture. First Edition. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1934. Print. * diameter-limit thinning this selection thinning is related to the Borggreve silvicultural system. Large trees over a certain diameter are removed for smaller trees in good condition to grow. These in turn after some growth are thinned. Eventually the stand is exhausted after several cycles and the remnant is clear cut and replanted. It is used with shade tolerant species like Western hemlock. * geometrical thinning – mechanical thinning like this is used in plantations where one row is taken out and the next left no matter the tree condition. A different grid might be used for natural stands sometimes called strip thinning. * free thinning – this is done as crop tree release and it means thinning around a wanted tree, over a stand this may mean in some areas no thinning and in others a lot of thinning. this heterogeneity represents where the most valuable trees are.Silviculture Concepts and Applications, Ralph D. Nyland 2002 Chapter 18 Methods of Thinning =Ecological thinning= A thinning in which the trees removed have little or no economic value is called a pre-commercial thinning. Ecological thinning is a variant of this being studied for use in forest conservation. The primary aim of forest thinning is to increase growth of selected trees, but ecological thinning is done to favor development of wildlife habitat (such as hollows) rather than focusing on increased timber yields. Thinning may also reduce the risk of wildfire by increasing availability of groundwater as well as reducing fuel for wildfires. Chemical thinning is a form of non-commercial thinning in which the trees are killed while they stand by injecting a chemical such as glyphosate (Round Up) into a cut made in the stem. This reduces the number of live stems remaining, providing a benefit to those that remain and may be undertaken where the cost of a traditional thin is high. It can also be done on very exposed sites where breaking the canopy through a traditional thinning operation would expose the stand to a high risk of windthrow. Another type of thinning is called variable density thinning. In this type of thinning, the intent is to manage various portions of the stand in different ways to create structural and spatial heterogeneity. The intent is often to increase biodiversity or wildlife habitat. In variable density thinning, some portions of the stand may not be entered. These unentered areas, sometimes called reserves, leave islands, or skips (as they are skipped over) help retain a large range of tree diameters, serve as a future source of competition-related mortality, and may preserve snags, down wood, and understory plants. Other portions of a stand could be heavily thinned or gaps or openings could be created. These areas accelerate the growth rates of trees in the open areas or on their perimeter and help retain or develop long crowns with live branches. Another portion of the stand, sometimes referred to as the matrix, is thinned to result in residual trees densities which area in between the other extremes. Over the whole area, a wide variety of trees with different diameters and species are retained. = Virtual thinning in marteloscopes = Timber marking - selecting the trees to be cut in a forest stand by marking them - is a crucial task for a forest manager. Because of the irreversible character of cutting trees, tools were developed to virtually practice tree selection. A marteloscope is a forest site (typically a one hectare rectangular site) where all trees are numbered, mapped and recorded. This information can then be visualised through an application on a hand-held device such as a tablet.  In agriculture  Sugar beets thinning What are the objectives of thinning versus non thinning in carrot productionIngriculture and gardening, thinning is the selective removal of flowers, fruits, shoots, and seedlings or young plants to allow adequate space for the remaining organs/plants to grow efficiently. In large-scale farming, techniques like precision seeding and transplanting can eliminate the need for thinning by starting plants at their optimum spacing. On a smaller scale, such as a home vegetable garden, thinning can be used as a way to make maximum use of space for certain crops. For example, beets, carrots, green onions and others can be planted densely, and then thinned to make room for continued growth of the plants left in the soil, and also as a harvest of baby vegetables (beet greens, baby carrots, baby onions). Also thinning is used in post harvesting.

H. Butler. She is known mostly for her war poem A War Film, about World War I.Maurice Wollman, Modern Poetry 1922–1934. Wollman adds some further biographical information that is hard to check. Biography She was born in Risley, Derbyshire, and (accordingly to a letter from her sold at auction recently) she lived at Goldenbrook Farm in Risley at some point during her life. Teresa Mary Hooley's early life was spent at Risley Lodge, the home of her father Terah Hooley (died 1927), a successful lace manufacturer who built Springfield Mill at Sandiacre, and her mother Mary (died 1928), his second wife. She made her name before the Great War, writing poems in the Daily Mirror alongside Edith Sitwell – not an admirer of her work. During the war, she presumably had an interest in Spiritualism, since her poem \\"Christ of the Night\\" appeared in the Occult Review in December 1915, on p. 342\\\\. Her work was published in a number of collections in the 1920s and 1930s but has largely fallen out of fashion. One of her poems, \\"The Owl\\" (Sova) was published in a 1939 Czech language compilation of animal poetry. She had two full brothers who survived childhood. Of these the younger, Basil Terah Hooley, born in 1893, was decorated in the Great War but died in the 1918 flu pandemic. Her much older half-brother was the financier Ernest Terah Hooley of Risley Hall with whom she maintained a civil if frosty relationship. Hooley married Frank H. Butler in May 1920 at Risley Church. They had a son but the marriage did not survive. In later life some found her a formidable presence. A War Film Hooley's poem A War Film describes the experience of seeing documentary footage of World War I, and refers to the Retreat from Mons, after one of the great battles of the Great War. Although this is Hooley's most well known poem little is known about it, and its date has been debated in online fora. It has been assumed the poem was inspired by watching documentary footage about World War I. The earliest documentary was The Battle of the Somme (1916), but it is unlikely that a contemporary writer would confuse the Battle of the Somme and the Retreat from Mons. It is therefore reasonable to conjecture that the 1926 film, Mons, was the most probable source. The fact that the poem can be found in Songs of all Seasons (published 1927) could be seen to bear this hypothesis out. Works *Gloom and Gleam (1913, A.C.

Memorial plaque to Henry Cockton on the wall of the Charnel House in the Great Churchyard in Bury St. Edmunds. Henry Cockton (7 December 1807 – 26 June 1853) was an English novelist, remembered primarily for The Life and Adventures of Valentine Vox, the Ventriloquist (1839–40).Robert Halliday, 'Henry Cockton, a Victorian novelist of the age of Dickens', Suffolk Review, new series 69 (Autumn 2017) 2–17, is the most detailed study of this author's life and works. There are few other studies of Henry Cockton, apart from Robert Halliday, 'New light on Henry Cockton', Notes And Queries 239 (September 1994) 349–351 and Donald MacAndrew, 'the author of Valentine Vox', East Anglian Magazine, June 1979, 440–442. Henry Cockton was born in George Yard, Shoreditch, London, the third of eight children of William and Mary Cockton. His father may have been a weaver. Nothing is known about his childhood or education; all that can be ascertained about his early life is that he spent some years employed in a house of business in Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk.Bury and Norwich Post 25 June 1856, 2. Here, on 9 May 1837, he married Ann Howes in St. James's Church (now the Cathedral). Ann was the daughter of Eleanor Howes, a widow who owned The Seven Stars Inn in Long Brackland, a street in that town.Halliday (2017) 3–4. Henry and Ann had a daughter, Eleanor Anne, and a son, Edward Stanley, born in Bury St. Edmunds on 20 December 1839 and 11 December 1841.Halliday (2017) 8. In 1839 Henry Cockton commenced writing The Life and Adventures of Valentine Vox the Ventriloquist. Published by Robert Tyas of London, in the monthly serial format, popularised by Charles Dickens, it was an immediate success, enjoying great popularity and acclaim. Illustrations by Thomas Onwhyn were a prominent feature of this, and most of Henry Cockton's later novels. The first three chapters are set 'in one of the most ancient and populous boroughs in the county of Suffolk', a thinly disguised Bury St. Edmunds. Valentine Vox teaches himself ventriloquism after seeing a performer in a local tavern, then uses his skills to create mayhem and mischief. Fearing this will lead him into trouble, his family send him to stay with his uncle Grimwood Goodman in London. This provides unlimited opportunities to perform pranks, such as disrupting political meetings, theatrical performances, educational lectures and social events. Valentine develops a close friendship with Grimwood. Fearing that Grimwood will re-write his will in Valentine's favour, unscrupulous relatives have Grimwood confined in a private lunatic asylum, where he undergoes many horrific experiences. Eventually Valentine finds Grimwood, and liberates him, not by using ventriloquism, but by paying for his release. At the novel's conclusion, Valentine marries the love interest, Louise Raven, and abandons ventriloquism. Valentine's activities as a ventriloquist are quite incredible, showing an impossible, almost super-human level of ability: by the end of the book he has duped literally hundreds of people from all walks of life in all situations, not one of whom ever suspects him. Yet the novel contains no technical information about ventriloquism, and it is doubtful if the author had any practical knowledge of the subject. The completed work contained a preface by Henry Cockton, outlining the scandal of private lunatic asylums. As with Charles Dickens in Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby, he clearly intended to draw attention to a social issue about which he felt strongly.John Sutherland, The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction (1988) 648; Steven Connor, Dumbstruck, a Cultural History of Ventriloquism (2000) 316-23; Halliday (2017) 4–7. Valentine Vox was lauded as one of most amusing and entertaining works of the year, rivalling the popularity of Dickens's novels. Between 1853 and 1902 over 400,000 copies were published in the UK. It even spawned an imitation: Thomas Peckett Prest wrote a plagiarism, The Adventures of Valentine Vaux, or, the Tricks of a Ventriloquist (1840), using the pseudonym Timothy Portwine. Valentine Vox was last printed in 1920. While modern readers will probably gain little from the humour, which consists of one joke, told with repetition, it contains some vividly observed scenes of contemporary London life, which can be read as sources of social history.For an academic study of the novel see Christopher Pitard, V for Ventriloquism: Powers of Vocal Mimicry in Henry Cockton’s The Life and Adventures of Valentine Vox, the Ventriloquist https://19.bbk.ac.uk/articles/10.16995/ntn.778/ The success of Valentine Vox prompted Richard Bentley to commission Henry Cockton to write Stanley Thorn (1841) for Bentley's Miscellany. This was not an original composition, but a work initiated by Richard Barham in which several authors had been asked to collaborate in a work on the theme of The Rake's Progress, about the downfall of a wealthy young man of property. Henry Cockton was given the manuscripts to adapt and complete, which he did, adding an unconvincing happy ending in place of the tragic end that was originally envisioned.R. H. D. Barham, The Life and Times of the Rev. Richard Harris Barham ... by his son (1870) 2: 65–7; Sutherland, op. cit., 600-1. Henry Cockton does not seem to have made much money from novel-writing, as the 1841 census showed him and his family as resident in 165 Blackfriars Road, Southwark, where they were lodgers of Maria Dowie, a widowed dressmaker.The National Archives, United Kingdom Census 1841, HO 107/1084/1, folio 45, page 31; MacAndrew, op. cit., 441. Henry Cockton's third novel, George St. George Julian The Prince was intended to expose financial corruption, fraud and forgery. In the course of his misadventures the eponymous hero encounters several rogues and cheats, including the historical Gregor MacGregor, the self-styled Cazique of Poyais.Sutherland, op. cit., 242. The publisher collapsed before Henry Cockton had received any payment for George St. George Julian, and he was effectively bankrupted, being imprisoned for debt, but being released after declaring himself an insovent debtor.The Times 28 Sept 1842, 7; Halliday (2017) 9. Three further novels followed. The Sisters of England and France (1843), originally serialised in the Illustrated London News, set in Regency England, tells the stories of Caroline and Lucrece, whose lives diverge as a result of their marriages.Sutherland, op. cit., 583. Sylvester Sound the Somnambulist (1844), was a comic tale about a persistent sleepwalker, who unknowingly performs many exploits in this state. A comic novel, it enjoyed some success, selling over 40,000 copies, and remaining in print until 1921.Halliday (2017) 9. The Love Match (1845), about a general's daughter who marries a stable hand, is of some interest for descriptions of the contemporary Newmarket horse-racing community: this featured a terse message announcing it would probably be the author's last book. His failure to make a financial profit from writing was probably the primary reason for his change of career, and he returned to Bury St. Edmunds to run The Seven Stars for his mother-in-law. Here he unwisely stood surety for the sum of £200 for his brother, Edward, only to lose the money when Edward fled to Australia. He then embarked on a malting speculation, buying large quantities of the product, possibly for re-sale or to start a business, but he was largely ignorant of the malt trade, and his scheme collapsed, leaving him financially ruined.Dictionary of National Biography (1885–1900) 11: 202; MacAndrew (1979) 441-2; Halliday (1994) 350-1; Halliday (2017) 11. He abandoned innkeeping, and, with his family, moved into his mother-in-law's house, where he wrote three further novels, none of which enjoyed great success.The National Archives, United Kingdom Census 1851 HO 107/1792, folio 317, page 25, folio 318, page 26. The Steward: a Romance of Real Life (1850), describes the downfall of George Croly, a Suffolk country gentleman, who is uncategorically lambasted as an evil, duplicitous person. An angry vitriolic work, The Steward possibly reflects the author's own feelings at the time. Lady Felicia (1852), a Cinderella inspired story about a shop assistant who marries a titled lady, is of some interest for its setting in Sudbury in Suffolk, against a background of local political corruption, a theme which had featured in the Pickwick Papers. Percy Effingham, or the germ of the world's esteem (1853), the story of an amiable and intelligent, but naive young man, who loses 'the world's esteem' (in this case, money and financial success), may have reflected the author's feelings about his own life, being finished only a few days before his death, on 26 June 1853.Bury And Norwich Post, 29 June 1853, 4; Sutherland, op. cit., 136. Four days later he was buried in an unmarked grave in the town churchyard of Bury St. Edmunds. There were no obituary notices.MacAndrew (1979) 441.

Biography He was born at Plymouth, where his father, Francis Collins, was a solicitor. He was educated at a private school, and after some years spent as mathematical master at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, he relocated to London. In London, Collins devoted himself to journalism in the Conservative Party interest, writing largely for periodicals. He also wrote occasional and humorous verse, and several novels. Soon after his second marriage, to Frances Collins in 1868, he settled at Knowl Hill, Berkshire and from this time he rarely left his home for a day and published several novels. In 1855, he published his Idyls and Rhymes; and in 1865 his first story, Who is the Heir? was published. A second volume of lyrics, The Inn of Strange Meetings, was issued in 1871; and in 1872 he produced his longest and best sustained poem, The British Birds, a communication from the Ghost of Aristophanes. He also wrote several novels, including Sweet Anne Page (1868), Two Plunges for a Pearl (1872), \\"Miranda\\" (1873), Mr. Carrington (1873) (under the name of \\"R. T.

He founded the Edinburgh Phrenological Society in 1820 and wrote the influential study The Constitution of Man (1828). Combe was trained in Scots law and had an Edinburgh solicitor's practice. After his marriage in 1833, Combe devoted himself in later years to promoting phrenology internationally. Early life George Combe was born in Edinburgh, the son of George Combe, a prosperous brewer in the city, and the elder brother of Andrew Combe. After attending the High School of Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh, Combe entered a lawyer's office in 1804; and, in 1812, he began his own practice. The Combe family lived together in a large home at 25 Northumberland Street in the New Town until at least 1833. The Phrenological Society Sculpted portrait of Combe on the Museum of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society building in Edinburgh In 1815, the Edinburgh Review contained an article on the system of \\"craniology\\" devised by Franz Joseph Gall and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim, which was denounced as \\"a piece of thorough quackery from beginning to end.\\" When Spurzheim came to Edinburgh in 1816, Combe was invited to a friend's house, where he watched Spurzheim dissect a human brain. Impressed by this demonstration, he attended the second series of Spurzheim's lectures. Investigating the subject for himself, he became satisfied that the fundamental principles of phrenology were true — namely, \\"that the brain is the organ of mind; that the brain is an aggregate of several parts, each subserving a distinct mental faculty; and that the size of the cerebral organ is, caeteris paribus, an index of power or energy of function.\\" Combe as sculpted by Lawrence Macdonald around 1825 45 Melville Street, Edinburgh In 1820, Combe helped to found the Phrenological Society of Edinburgh, which in 1823 began to publish a Phrenological Journal. Through his lectures and writings, Combe drew public attention to phrenology in Continental Europe and the United States, and in his native United Kingdom. Debate with Hamilton Combe began to lecture at Edinburgh in 1822, and published a Manual called Elements of Phrenology in June 1824. He took private tuition in elocution; contemporaries described him as clever and opinionated. Combe's discussions had an air of confidentiality and rather theatrical urgency. Converts came in, new societies sprang up, and controversies began. A second edition of the Elements, 1825, was attacked by Francis Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review for September 1825. Combe replied in a pamphlet and in the journal. Sir William Hamilton delivered addresses to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1826 and 1827 attacking the phrenologists. A sharp controversy followed, including challenges to public disputes and mutual charges of misrepresentation, in which Spurzheim took part. The correspondence was published in the fourth and fifth volumes of the Phrenological Journal. Social interests: schools, prisons and asylums George Combe, a daguerrotype In 1836, Combe stood for the chair of Logic at Edinburgh, against two other candidates, Sir William Hamilton and Isaac Taylor; Hamilton won with 18 votes, against 14 for Taylor. In 1838 Combe visited the United States and studied the treatment of criminals there. He initiated a programme of public education on chemistry, physiology, history and moral philosophy. Combe sought to improve the provision of public education, advocating a national system of non-sectarian education. He helped to set up a school in Edinburgh run on the principles of William Ellis, and did some teaching there himself on phrenology and physiology. It was prompted by the London Birkbeck School, which had opened on 17 July 1848. Combe was a significant figure in taking the view that the state should be involved with the educational system. His ideas were supported by William Jolly, an inspector of schools, and noted by Frank Pierrepont Graves. Combe was seriously concerned about prison reform. With the assistance of William A. F. Browne, he opened a debate about the introduction of humane treatment of psychiatric patients in publicly funded asylums. Later life John Ramsay L'Amy WS FRSE (son of James L'Amy) trained under Combe at his offices at 25 Northumberland Street in Edinburgh's New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1832-33 In 1842, Combe delivered a course of 22 lectures on phrenology in the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg, and he travelled much in Europe, inquiring into the management of schools, prisons and asylums. On retirement, Combe lived in a substantial, elegant terraced townhouse, 45 Melville Street, in Edinburgh's West End.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1857-8 He was revising the 9th edition of the Constitution of Man when he died at Moor Park, Farnham in August 1858. He is buried in the Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh against the north wall of the original section.Find a Grave. Retrieved 5 July 2020. Works In 1817 his first essay on phrenology appeared in The Scots Magazine, soon followed by a series of papers on the same subject in the Literary and Statistical Magazine. These were collected and published in 1819 in book form as Essays on Phrenology, which in later editions became A System of Phrenology. craniometer from Elements of phrenology (1835), by George Combe Combe's most popular work, The Constitution of Man, appeared in 1828, but was widely denounced as a materialist and atheist. He argued in the book: \\"Mental qualities are determined by the size, form and constitution of the brain; and these are transmitted by hereditary descent\\". Combe was part of an active Edinburgh scene composed of people thinking about the nature of heredity and its possible malleability, such as Lamarck proposed. Combe himself was no Lamarckian, but in the decades before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, the Constitution was probably the single most important vehicle for the dissemination of naturalistic progressivism in the English-speaking world. His Answers to the Objections Urged Against Phrenology published in 1838 was followed in 1840 by Moral Philosophy and in 1841 by Notes on the United States of North America. Combe's Phrenology Applied to Painting and Sculpture came in 1855. The culmination of Combe's autobiographical philosophy appears in \\"On the Relation between Science and Religion\\", first publicly issued in 1857. Combe moved into the economic arena with a pamphlet on The Currency Question (1858). A fuller phrenological approach to political economy was set out later by William Ballantyne Hodgson. Family In 1833, Combe married Cecilia Siddons, a daughter of the actress Sarah Siddons and sister of Henry Siddons, author of Practical Illustrations of Rhetorical Gesture and Action (1807). She brought him a fortune and a happy – though childless – marriage, preceded by a phrenological check for compatibility. A few years later, he retired from work as a lawyer in comfortable circumstances. The large, simple headstone on Combe's grave in Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh lies against the north wall of the original cemetery, backing onto the first northern extension. Cecilia Siddons is buried with him. Bibliography *George Combe (1828), The Constitution of Man Considered in Relation to External Objects. J. Anderson jun.

Colton was educated at Eton and King's College, graduating with a B.A. in 1801 and an M.A. in 1804. In 1801, he was presented by the college with the perpetual curacy of Tiverton's Prior's Quarter in Devon, where he lived for many years. He was appointed to the vicarage of Kew and Petersham in 1812. His performance of church-related functions at both locations was erratic: at times conscientious and brilliant while at other times cursory and indulgent. He left formal church service, and England, in 1828. Contemporaries believed that he had fled from his creditors, who took out a legal \\"docket\\" against him, identifying him as a wine-merchant. For two years Colton traveled throughout the United States. He later established a modest residence in Paris. There he invested in an art gallery and had a large private collection of valuable paintings. Other pastimes included wine collecting and partridge-shooting. He also frequented the gaming salons of the \\"Palais Royal\\" and was so successful that in a year or two he acquired the equivalent of 25,000 English pounds. He continued gambling, however, and lost his French fortune. At the time of his death, Colton was living on funds received from his immediate family. An illness required surgery, but Colton dreaded the operation. He eventually killed himself rather than undergo the procedure. Literary work Colton's books, including collections of epigrammatic aphorisms and short essays on conduct, though now almost forgotten, had a phenomenal popularity in their day. Toward the end of 1820, Colton published Lacon, or Many Things in Few Words, addressed to those who think., in a small cheap edition. It attracted attention and praise, however, and five additional printings were issued in 1821. Lacon, Vol. II appeared in 1822. In 1822, Colton re-published a previous work on Napoleon, with extensive additions, under the title of The Conflagration of Moscow. In Paris he printed An Ode on the Death of Lord Byron for private circulation and continued to write. At his death he left an unpublished poem of 600 lines called Modern Antiquity. In the twentieth century and to the present day Colton has been read most frequently perhaps in quotation books, including Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, where many of his aphorisms have been preserved.

Combe wrote verses to accompany Thomas Rowlandson's comic caricatures. Dr Syntax in Danger, print after a drawing by Thomas Rowlandson. William Combe (25 March 174219 June 1823) was a British miscellaneous writer. His early life was that of an adventurer, his later was passed chiefly within the \\"rules\\" of the King's Bench Prison. He is chiefly remembered as the author of The Three Tours of Doctor Syntax, a comic poem, illustrated by artist Thomas Rowlandson's color plates, that satirised William Gilpin. Combe also wrote a series of imaginary letters, supposed to have been written by the second, or \\"wicked\\" Lord Lyttelton. Of a similar kind were his letters between Swift and \\"Stella\\". He also wrote the letterpress for various illustrated books, and was a general hack.  Early life  Combe's father, Robert Combes, was a rich Bristol ironmonger who died in 1756; his mother, Susannah Hill (died 1748), was from a Quaker background. He was educated at Eton College, but was withdrawn from the school by William Alexander, his guardian, on his father's death; Alexander died in 1762. He inherited from both his father and guardian, aspired to the status of gentleman, and changed his name to Combe. He spent his fortune, travelled and was nicknamed \\"Count Combe\\"; and in the period 1769–1773 was low in funds, existing in France, Wales and the West Midlands. In 1773 Robert Berkeley employed Combe to edit Thomas Falkner's Description of Patagonia. Combe then settled to work as a writer and book editor. Works Derby Museum In 1776 Combe made his first success in London with The Diaboliad, a satire full of bitter personal attacks. Four years later, in 1780, debts brought him into the King's Bench Prison, and much of his subsequent life was spent in prison. Combe's spurious Letters of the Late Lord Lyttelton (1780) took in many of his contemporaries: as late as 1851, a writer in the Quarterly Review regarded these letters as authentic, basing on them a claim to have solved the riddle of identity of Junius, in Thomas Lyttelton, 2nd Baron Lyttelton. An early acquaintance with Laurence Sterne resulted in Combe's anonymous Letters supposed to have been written by Yorick and Eliza (1779), the named characters being from Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. Periodical literature of all sorts—pamphlets, satires, burlesques, \\"two thousand columns for the papers,\\" \\"two hundred biographies\\"Hotten (1895), p. XLVIII—filled up the next years, and about 1789 Combe was receiving £200 yearly from the Pitt government as a pamphleteer. In 1790 and 91, the six volumes of a Devil on Two Sticks in England won for Combe the title of \\"the English le Sage\\". In 1794 he ghost-wrote the Aeneas Anderson memoir of the Lord Macartney embassy to Peking, \\"A Narrative of the British Embassy to China, in the Years 1792, 1793, and 1794\\". In 1794–1796 he wrote the text for Boydell's History of the River Thames, and in 1803 he began to write for The Times. From 1809 to 1811 he wrote for Ackermann's The Poetical Magazine the serialized comic poem The Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of the Picturesque, descriptive and moralizing verse illustrated by artist Thomas Rowlandson's color plates.Don Markstein's Toonopedia: The Tours of Dr. Syntax The Tours of Dr. Syntax\\" at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on May 5, 2016. It satirised William Gilpin, who toured Britain to describe his theory of the Picturesque. It was collected in book form in 1812, and was followed by two similar Tours, \\"...in search of Consolation\\" (1819) and \\"...in search of a Wife,\\" the first Mrs Syntax having died at the end of the first Tour. The second Tour was collected as an 1820 book, and the third tour as an 1821 book. Some reprint editions over the next several decades rendered Rowlandson's color plates in black and white. Then came Six Poems in illustration of drawings by Princess Elizabeth (1813), The English Dance of Death (1815–1816), The Dance of Life (1816–1817), The Adventures of Johnny Quae Genus (1822)—all written for Rowlandson's caricatures; together with histories of Oxford and Cambridge, and of Westminster Abbey for Ackermann; Picturesque Tours along the Rhine and other rivers, Histories of Madeira, Antiquities of York, texts for Turner's Southern Coast Views, and contributions innumerable to the Literary Repository.

In 1591 he converted to Catholicism, and lived in exile on the continent for some years. He returned to England at the accession of King James, but was soon a prisoner in the Tower and in the Fleet. He died an exile at Liège in 1613. Family Henry Constable, born in Newark-on-Trent in 1562, was the only child of Sir Robert Constable (d. 12 November 1591) and Christiana Dabridgecourt, widow of Anthony Forster, and daughter of John Dabridgecourt of Langdon Hall, Warwickshire. His paternal grandparents were Sir Robert Constable (before 1495 – 29 October 1558) and Katherine Manners, the daughter of George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros, and sister of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland.. According to Sullivan, the connections Robert Constable acquired through his marriage 'opened up a career of military service and public office'. Constable served under Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, in the campaign after the Northern Rebellion of 1569, and was knighted by Sussex at Berwick.. He was Marshal of Berwick from 1576 to 1578, and was appointed Lieutenant-General of the OrdnanceSullivan states that he was Master of the Ordinance, although Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, was Master of the Ordinance from 1558 to 1590; . at some time before 4 August 1588.. In the same year he had a son who was also named Henry, who became a Royalist army officer and the 1st Viscount Dunbar.Jack Binns, 'Constable, Henry, first Viscount Dunbar (1588–1645)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Other children included daughter, Dorothy Lawson, who became a priest harbourer.Claire Walker, 'Lawson , Dorothy (1580–1632)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 11 June 2017 Career Henry Constable matriculated as a fellow commoner at St John's College, Cambridge at Easter 1578, and took his BA on 29 January 1580. His contemporary at Cambridge was Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.. He was enrolled at Lincoln's Inn on 21 February 1583, but there is no further record of his legal studies.. On 12 September of that year Constable was in Scotland. He was then posted to Paris on the recommendation of his father's friend, Sir Francis Walsingham,. serving under the English ambassador there, Sir Edward Stafford, between 14 December 1583 and April 1585. In May 1585 he was at Heidelberg, and he may have travelled to Poland. During this period, according to Sullivan, Constable acted as a spokesperson for Protestant causes.. Constable was probably at the English court during 1588–9, as he is recorded as having attended the funeral of his kinsman, John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland, in March 1588, and as having been in contact with Arabella Stuart in 1589. During this period he was reported to have been one of Queen Elizabeth's favourites.. He was sent to Edinburgh in 1589 on the occasion of King James VI's marriage, and by this time was a member of the circle of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. His religious convictions were still to outward appearances Protestant. About this time he is credited with having written the anonymous tract Examen pacifique de la doctrine des Huguenots, published in September 1589, in which, according to Sullivan, he wrote as a Roman Catholic urging his countrymen to support Henri IV, who had just been crowned King.; . Constable seems to have left Scotland with the French diplomat Jean Hotman in October 1589, but returned in 1590, and wrote a sonnet, \\"To the King of Scotland upon the occasion of his longe stay in Denmarke by reason of the coldnesse of the winter and the freezing of the sea.\\"Roderick J. Lyall, Alexander Montgomerie: Poetry, Politics, and Cultural Change in Jacobean Scotland (Arizona, 2005), p. 179. In 1591 Constable went to Normandy with the English forces under Essex who laid siege to Rouen. At some time between his arrival in France and the death of his father on 12 November 1591 Constable openly embraced Roman Catholicism.; . Henri IV granted him a small pension.. For the next decade he was principally based in Paris, but travelled to Rome in 1595. On 3 October 1596 he was in Rouen, from which Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, wrote to Sir Robert Cecil that 'Here is Mr. H. Constable; who, lest he should have intruded himself into my company, I desired Mr Edmunds to let him know my desire he should forbear either coming, writing, or sending unto me, which he hath hitherto performed'.. During this period he was also in Antwerp and Brussels. Until 1597 he kept up his connections with the Essex circle, writing to Essex himself and to Anthony Bacon.; . He continued to claim loyalty to Queen Elizabeth, and supported King James' claim to the English throne in preference to the claim of the Spanish Infanta, daughter of Philip II of Spain. On 1 March 1599 Constable arrived at Leith in Scotland, and eventually obtained access to King James, remaining until September, 'hunting and conversing on poetry and divinity' with the King. In 1600 he again travelled to Rome to seek Pope Clement VIII's approval of another visit to King James.. On James's accession Constable hoped to return to England, and wrote first to friends in Scotland for support, and on 11 June 1603, to his kinsman, Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, and to Sir Robert Cecil. By December of that year he was back at court, and was granted a warrant on 8 February 1604 by which he obtained possession of his inherited lands.. However his continued pursuit of plans to influence King James towards toleration of Catholics resulted in his imprisonment in the Tower, where he remained from 14 April to 9 July 1604.; . He was subsequently placed under house arrest, and deprived of his inheritance. He was in the Fleet prison on 11 February 1608, when John Chamberlain wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton that no sooner was Sir Tobie Matthew released, and 'no sooner gan nor his nest scant cold, when Harry Constable was committed in his roome and nestles in the same lodging'.. Constable was imprisoned on at least one other occasion. On 31 July 1610 he was granted licence to leave England. He returned to Paris, and on 27 November 1611 rumours of his death were passed on by John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton: 'Sir William Bowes is lately dead, and we hear that Harry Constable hath taken the same way in Fraunce'.. Little more is known of his activities apart from the record of his presence at a theological disputation on 4 September 1612. In 1613 his friend, Cardinal Perron, sent him to Liège on a mission to convert an English Protestant divine, Benjamin Carier.. Constable died at Liège on 9 October 1613.. Literary accomplishments An 1897 edition of The Poems of Henry Constable in Art Deco binding In 1592 Diana, a sequence of twenty-three sonnets by Constable, was published in London by Richard Smith, one of the first sonnets sequences in English.; . A second edition, containing five new sonnets by Constable with additions by Sir Philip Sidney and other poets followed in 1594. Sullivan considers that the 1594 publication was undertaken on Richard Smith's initiative. There were two further editions in 1597 and 1604.; ; . Four poems by Constable were included in England's Helicon in 1600,; . among them Damelus Song to his Diaphenia and Venus and Adonis. According to W. Carew Hazlitt, 'A more beautiful specimen of early English lyric poetry than The Sheepheard's Song of Venus and Adonis could hardly be found in the whole circle of Elizabethan poetry'.. The Todd manuscript contains additional love sonnets by Constable, and Harleian MS 7553 contains seventeen 'Spirituall sonnettes, to the honour of God: and hys saintes’.. Constable's verse is characterised by fervour and richness of colour. Of the numerous sonnets he wrote, the twenty-eight of the sonnet sequence Diana, and the four prefixed to Sir Philip Sidney's An Apology for Poetry, contain his best work. In My lady's presence makes the roses red, he is able to capture Spenser's charm. His rhyme scheme is mixed Italian and English, like Sidney's, the octave being Italian and the sestet English. Constable was highly reputed as a poet in his own day.. In the censure of contemporary poets in Act I, Scene ii, of the anonymous Elizabethan play, The Return From Parnassus, Iudicio passes judgment favourably on Constable, saying that:; . > Sweete Constable doth take the wondring eare > And layes it up in willing prisonment. Ben Jonson also pays tribute to Constable's verse in Underwood:. > Hath our great Sydney Stella set, > Where never star shone brighter yet? > Or Constable's ambrosiac muse > Made Diana not his notes refuse Constable is known to have written two theological tracts in 1596 and 1597 which are no longer extant. He also responded to A Conference about the Next Succession, generally attributed to Robert Persons. Constable's Discoverye of a Counterfecte Conference … for Thadvancement of a Counterfecte Tytle, which supported King James' claim to the English crown, was printed in Paris in 1600, although the title page falsely claimed that it had been printed in Cologne..

He was the brother of poet Philip Pendleton Cooke. During the American Civil War, Cooke served as a staff officer for Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart in the Confederate States Army cavalry and after Stuart's death, for Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton. Stuart's wife, Flora, was a first cousin of Cooke. Early life Born in Winchester, Virginia on November 3, 1830, Cooke was one of 13 children (five of whom survived childhood) of Bermuda-born planter and lawyer John R. Cooke and Maria Pendleton Cooke.Trout, Robert J. They Followed the Plume: The Story of J.E.B. Stuart and His Staff. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1993. . pp. 89–90. He was born on the family's plantation, \\"Ambler's Hill,\\" near Winchester, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley. In 1838, \\"Glengary\\", the family estate to which the Cookes had moved, burned down. The family moved to Charles Town, Virginia and in 1840 to Richmond, Virginia. At his father's urging, Cooke studied and practiced law briefly in Richmond but abandoned that in 1849 when continuing financial problems prevented him from enrolling at the University of Virginia.Trout, 1993, p. 90. He formed a law partnership with his father in 1851 but his writing often interfered with his work. Cooke had several manuscripts published between 1848 and 1853. In 1854, he began to write and publish books. In 1858 after his father's death, he gave up the practice of law altogether. After he started writing, he almost immediately became a successful novelist and prolific short story writer, eventually authoring 31 books and almost 200 published articles and poems. He became noted for his writing about Virginia, much of it in historical novels. Cooke illustrated Virginia life and history in the novels, The Virginia Comedians (1854), and later The Wearing of the Gray, a tale of the American Civil War, and more formally in a respected Virginia history. His style was somewhat high-flown. He was the author of The Youth of Jefferson. Cooke joined the Richmond Howitzers, a militia artillery unit, in the 1850s, earning the rank of sergeant.Trout, 1993, p. 91. He accompanied the unit to Harpers Ferry in response to John Brown's raid. Civil War Cooke fought with the Richmond Howitzers at the First Battle of Bull Run. After the battle, Cooke began to write to newspapers in the South, as \\"Our Virginia Correspondent,\\" in order to praise Stuart and campaign for then Col. Stuart's promotion, which also was sought by Stuart's commanding officer, General Joseph E. Johnston.Thomas, Emory M. Bold Dragoon: The Life of J.E.B. Stuart. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1986. . p. 87. Stuart was promoted to brigadier general on September 24, 1861.Thomas, 1986, pp. 87–88. In March and April 1862, Cooke served as an unpaid volunteer aide for Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart. Cooke was a first cousin of General Stuart's wife, Flora Cooke Stuart. On May 19, 1862, he was formally commissioned as a lieutenant and officially joined Stuart's staff. Cooke participated in the Peninsula Campaign and Stuart's subsequent ride around the Union army of George B. McClellan, later writing a detailed description of the action.Thomas, 1986, pp. 118, 120–121. Cooke served as an ordnance officer until October 1863.Trout, 1993, pp. 4, 18, 93. Despite Stuart's secret dislike for Cooke personally,Wert, Jeffry D. Cavalryman of the Lost Cause: A Biography of J.E.B. Stuart. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2008. . p. 200. Stuart praised Cooke's service during the Peninsula Campaign and Seven Days' Battles and sought a promotion for him. Stuart was promoted to major general on July 25, 1862.Thomas, 1986, p. 139. On June 9, 1863, Cooke and other staff members were drawn into combat at the Battle of Brandy Station. Cooke also participated in the Gettysburg Campaign with Stuart. Soon after the start of the Stuart's ride around the Union Army of the Potomac, Cooke was nearly shot or captured during the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863). He was eating breakfast with two other staff officers and a courier at the home of a blacksmith while the blacksmith shoed their horses. The Confederate officers were about a half mile from the main body of Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton III's cavalry division when advance riders from the 11th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry rode by in pursuit of the advance guard of Hampton's division. The other three Confederates quickly fled toward their main body but Cooke was intent on finishing his breakfast and having his horse shoed. He barely escaped when a second group of Union riders became suspicious of the nature of activity at the farm and rode up to check.Wittenberg, Eric J., and J. David Petruzzi. Plenty of Blame to Go Around: Jeb Stuart's Controversial Ride to Gettysburg. New York: Savas Beatie, 2006. . p. 11. During the war, Cooke served Stuart as an aide, ordnance officer, and assistant adjutant general, earning the rank of captain. On October 27, 1863, Stuart made Cooke an adjutant in order to put his writing talent to work in catching up on his paperwork.Trout, 1993, p. 92. Although Cooke wrote favorably about Stuart during and after the war, Stuart confidentially told Flora (but not Cooke himself) that he did not like Cooke and found him boring.Thomas, 1986, p. 94.Thomas, 1986, p. 141 stated: \\"Stuart was not a contemplative man; he simply acted.\\"Like Thomas, Trout, 1993, p. 92 states that Cooke never knew that Stuart disliked him.Cooke was not unable to recognize a few faults in Stuart. He called him \\"a thoroughly good hater\\" and said he never forgave those who opposed him personally or professionally. Wert, 2008, p. 83. Following Stuart's death at Yellow Tavern in May 1864, Cooke served as an adjutant on the staff of Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, eventually rising to the rank of major by the end of the war. Postbellum career In 1867, Cooke married Mary Frances Page and settled down at the former home of Daniel Morgan, Saratoga, near Boyce, Virginia, to become a marginally prosperous farmer and gardener as well as an author. The Cookes had three children.Trout, 1993, p. 93. To Cooke's great grief, Mary Frances died on January 15, 1878. Historian Emory M. Thomas wrote: \\"John Esten Cooke used and embellished his in-law's fame in a series of stories and novels that made Cooke famous. He never knew that Stuart thought him an enormous bore.\\"Thomas, 1986, p. 297. Even before the end of the war, in 1863, Cooke wrote the first of several popular biographies, that of Stonewall Jackson: A Military Biography, published in 1876, for which he received some contemporary criticism for the errors in the book. He also later published a novel on Jackson, Surry of Eagle's Nest (1866). His later efforts at biography, such as a biography of Robert E. Lee and officers that he had personally known, were considered more accurate that his early Jackson biography.

Design and development The Yak-12 was designed by Yakovlev's team to meet a requirement of the Soviet Air Force of 1944 for a new liaison and utility plane, to replace the obsolete Po-2 biplane. It was also meant to be used in civil aviation as a successor to Yakovlev's AIR-6 of 1934, built in a relatively small series. Yakovlev's first proposal was a four-place high-wing aircraft, the Yak-10 (first named Yak-14), built in January 1945. It won the competition with a low-wing Yak-13, based on the same fuselage, and a series of 40 Yak-10s were produced,Gunston 1995, pp. 468–469. powered with a 108 kW (145 hp) Shvetsov M-11M radial. In 1947, Yakovlev developed a new aircraft to replace the Yak-10. This was fitted with a more powerful 119 kW (160 hp) M-11FR, a new wing and undercarriage, and a fuselage with a revised shape (lower tail). The new type was designated Yak-12, first flying in 1947.Gunston 1995, p. 470. 788 of the basic variant were produced, including military observation planes, some Yak-12S air ambulances, Yak-12SKh agricultural aircraft and Yak-12GR floatplanes. A distinguishing feature of the basic Yak-12, just like Yak-10, were engine cylinders with individual cowlings. It was a plane of a mixed construction and could take 1 or 2 passengers, apart from a pilot. The next generation Yak-12 entered production in 1952, starting with the Yak-12R. It was fitted with a new 194 kW (260 hp) Ivchenko AI-14R radial and all-metal construction. The wing area increased (from 21.6 m² to 23.8 m²). This variant had the least wing loading of all Yak-12s, and therefore best STOL performance (take-off run 52 m/171 ft, landing 81 m/266 ft). After being lengthened to improve weight distribution, with further strengthening of the structure and other minor changes, from 1955 the Yak-12M (\\"modernized\\") was produced. A visible difference was a lengthened, curved tailfin. This variant became more universal, offering a bigger payload. It took a pilot and 3 passengers and could be fitted with dual controls for training, a stretcher for an ambulance role or an agricultural spraying device. It became the most numerous variant. The last generation, produced from 1957, was the Yak-12A. It was an aerodynamically refined variant, with a slimmer fuselage and a new wing.Gunston 1995, p. 471. The cowling was smaller diameter. The rectangular wings were fitted with trapezoidal ends and automatic slats, also single struts replaced twin struts. Navigation equipment and controls were improved, and performance also increased. In the USSR, 3,801 of Yak-12s were built in all models (including 3,013 Yak-12R, M and A). An experimental Yak-12B biplane was also developed, but did not enter production. The Yak-12M was licence- built from 1956 in Poland as the WSK-4 Okecie, or Jak-12M (Polish spelling of Russian name). From 1959, the Yak-12A was built in Poland (1,054 Jak-12Ms, 137 Jak-12As), most for export to the USSR. In 1958, further development of the Yak-12M was carried out in Poland, becoming the PZL-101 Gawron. The Yak-12 was also produced in China as Shenyang type 5. Operational history Yak-12s first entered service in the Soviet Air Force as a liaison and artillery observation plane. Then, they were used also in the Soviet civilian aviation – mostly in the DOSAAF aero club for transport, pilot training, parachute training, and glider towing. They were also used as air ambulances and agricultural aircraft. Apart from the Soviet Union, Yak-12s were used in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia (civil and military), and Hungary (civil). Licence-built Shenyangs were used in China and other countries. In some countries, including Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the Russian name was transcribed as Jak-12. In the Polish Air Force, about 90 Yak-12s were used from 1951, as liaison, patrol, and general utility planes. Most were withdrawn in the 1970s, the last in the 1980s. Most were next handed over to civil aviation. In Poland, the first civilian model was acquired in 1952, and larger numbers were used from the 1960s (at least 79). They were used mostly in regional aeroclubs for pilot training, parachute training, transport, and glider towing. 21 were used as air ambulances. Some civil Yak-12s (mostly Yak-12A) remain in use in 2006. On July 12, 2012, a Yak-12 owned by Canada's Kinross Gold Corporation, crashed shortly after takeoff from an airport in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Description Metal construction (Yak-12R, M, A) or mixed construction (Yak-12) braced high-wing monoplane, conventional in layout, metal and canvas covered. Wings fitted with flaps and slats (automatic slats in Yak-12R, or fixed in other variants). Four-seat cabin (in early variants of Yak-12 – 2 or 3 seats). Conventional fixed landing gear with tail wheel. Single radial engine: 5-cylinder M-11FR (nominal power 104 kW/140 hp, take-off power 118 kW/160 hp) – Yak-12 basic variant; 9-cylinder AI-14R (nominal power 161 kW/220 hp, take-off power 191 kW/260 hp) – Yak-12R, M and A.

It aims to promote the study of Muslim cultures and societies, both historical and contemporary, in order to foster a greater understanding of their relationships with other societies and faiths. It also functions as a gathering point for the Ismaili community as it endeavors to understand its own history and thought, including the often neglected fields of esoteric Islam and Shi‘ism. The Institute draws upon the worldwide knowledge and experience of various institutions and scholars to create awareness through initiatives, publications, and partnerships in the field of Islamic Studies. Its library, which houses the largest-known accessible collection of Ismaili codices in the world, is a major resource in the field. In addition to its research, the IIS offers two graduate programmes: the Graduate Programme in Islamic Studies and Humanities (GPISH) and the Secondary Teacher Education Programme (STEP). Established in 1977 by the Aga Khan, it functions under his guidance and works closely with the Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilizations at the Aga Khan University. History and conceptualization =Modern Ismaili Studies= Modern Ismaili studies first began in the 1930s in South Asia, where collections of Ismaili manuscripts had been preserved within Ismaili communities and brought to the fore through the pioneering efforts of Wladimir Ivanow, Asaf Fyzee, Husayn al-Hamdani, and Zahid Ali. Much of this early work helped to dispel the writings of the nineteenth century orientalists, which were often defamatory albeit unintentionally, having drawn only on the sources of the Ismailis’ adversaries, while over-sensationalizing occidental accounts. Ivanow, in particular, played an important role in the creation of the Ismaili Society of Bombay, which was, in a sense, a precursor to the Institute. The former Ismaili Society of Bombay was established under the patronage of Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III in February 1946. The Ismaili Society stood for “the promotion of independent and critical study of all matters connected with Ismailism” and frequently published monographs, critical editions of original texts and collections of short papers. Like the Institute, the Society’s work was involved in studying the field of particular intellectual movements in Islam, with a specific interest in Shi‘ism and Sufism. With these underlying premises, the Aga Khan chaired the Ismailia Association Conference in April 1975: a four-day meeting in Paris during which groundwork was laid for what was eventually to become the Institute of Ismaili Studies. In November 1977, the Aga Khan made a public announcement that formally proclaimed the inauguration of the Institute. In his remarks the Aga Khan expressed his wish that the Institute become a major institution for his community, while reflecting upon the Fatimid centres of learning established by his ancestors a millennium before. =Tradition of learning= The late Aga Khan III was instrumental in the transformation of Aligarh University, for which he campaigned starting as early as 1896. He also articulated the Muslims’ need for a “Central University” – a place where religion and learning are never divorced and individuality is safeguarded from imitating other cultures – so that early in their lives, students would gain a sense “for truthfulness, and for independence of character”. In subsequent years, Aga Khan III founded many schools in East Africa and South Asia. Most of these schools continue to exist today. He and his forefathers trace their ancestry back to the Fatimid Caliph-Imams who were among the first Muslims to establish institutes of higher learning in the history of Islamic civilization. Therefore, despite its recent foundation, the Institute draws upon a long historical tradition that is firmly rooted in education and learning and equally cognizant thereof. =Governance= The Institute operates under a Board of Governors of which the Aga Khan is chairman. Afzal Ahmed, Dr. Aziz Esmail, Mohammed Keshavjee, Naguib Kheraj, Zauhar Meghji and Dr. Shafik Sachedina are also sitting members. The current Co-Director and Head of the Department of Academic Research and Publications is Dr. Farhad Daftary. Library and publications The Institute of Ismaili Studies Library was established in 1979 and is a major resource at the Institute, which houses the largest-known accessible collection of Ismaili codices in the world. Its role is to preserve, develop and make available a central archive of Ismaili manuscripts, printed texts and audiovisual materials, and to support the activities and programmes of the Institute by providing necessary resources. The Library’s collection comprises some thirty thousand items, including rare manuscripts in Arabic, Persian and Gujarati. Many of these manuscripts are described in published catalogues. The Library also actively seeks to expand its holdings through new acquisitions, donations and by obtaining photocopies and microfilms of manuscripts that are held in various private and institutional collections. The Library’s collection has benefited from a number of private collections that have been donated such as the Dr. Zahid Ali collection of two hundred twenty rare manuscripts, and the Sherali Alidina collection. Much of the early collection, however, predates the foundation of the Institute and represents the holdings of the Ismaili Society of Mumbai. =Publications= The Institute’s publications are manifold and range from curriculum materials to translations and academic publications. They reflect its mandate of promoting modern scholarship in the area of Islamic studies. Most of the works are published through Islamic Publications Ltd. (IPL) in association with I.B. Tauris & Co. Ltd.. The collection of curriculum materials produced by the Institute’s Department of Education for the religious and cultural education of the Ismaili community is known as the Ta‘lim Programme. This curriculum is currently available at primary levels for ages four to twelve in eight different languages. The curriculum is also expected to further expand for students at a secondary school level in the near future. Seven types of academic publications are produced by the Institute, as listed below: #Occasional papers or essays addressing broad themes on the relationship between religion and society, with special reference to Islam; #Monographs that explore specific aspects of the Islamic religions tradition; #Significant editions or translations of primary or secondary texts pertinent to the understanding of Islam; #Translations of poetic and literary texts, which illustrate the rich heritage of spiritual, devotional and symbolic expressions in Muslim history; #Works pertaining to Ismailism; #Proceedings of conferences and seminars sponsored by the Institute; #Bibliographical works or catalogues. Programmes The Institute of Ismaili Studies offers a variety of different programmes from the graduate level to preparatory programmes for Ismaili students who have not previously studied English, such as the Khorog English Programme and the Syrian Preparatory Program. =Graduate Programme in Islamic Studies and Humanities= The Graduate Programme in Islamic Studies and Humanities (GPISH) has a three-year duration. It aims to \\"engender a sympathetic yet critical examination of issues facing contemporary Muslims, from the debate amongst Muslim intellectuals regarding the re-examination of aspects of the Islamic heritage to the challenges posed by modernisation and development.\\" The goal of the program is to prepare students for a research degree and a wide variety of career opportunities. It focuses on Islam in general, and in particular on Shi‘ism and the Ismaili community, its history, and its teachings as understood within the Islamic religious tradition. The programme integrates a variety of disciplines into the study of Muslim societies, including history, anthropology, political science, philosophical analysis, literature, aesthetics, art, and the study of religion. After two years of theory based learning, students embark on a field project during the summer of their second academic year. The final year of the programme is spent at a degree-granting university in the UK, where students study for a master's degree in a discipline that is resonant with the aims of the graduate programme. All admitted students are provided with a full scholarship that covers tuition and housing, as well as a stipend covering living expenses. The institute also provides doctoral scholarships to suitable candidates, and preference is given those who have completed GPISH. =Secondary Teacher Education Programme= Founded in 2002, The Secondary Teacher Education Programme (STEP) is a two- year post-graduate programme that seeks to train and sustain teachers who will be instrumental in teaching the Institute’s Secondary Curriculum to Ismaili students worldwide. It culminates in an MTeach and an MA in Education (Muslim Societies and Civilizations), both awarded by the University of London, and is the product of a partnership between Institute of Ismaili Studies and the University of London's Institute of Education. Following the completion of the academic portion of the STEP program, students return to their home countries and participate in an in-service phase at their national Ismaili Tariqah and Religious Education Board/Committee (ITREB/C). Students are provided with a full scholarship and stipend that covers the entire program (including the home-based practicum), and related travel expenses. The programme is currently open to applicants from thirteen countries: Canada, France, India, Kenya, Pakistan, Portugal, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, UAE, Uganda, UK and the USA.

In 2013, the District reported that 286 pupils or 14.7% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 48.3% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2011, the Central Columbia School District reported that 295 pupils or 14.4% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 48.8% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2009, the District administration reported that 278 pupils or 13% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 48.6% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Central Columbia School District has provided full day kindergarten since 2011-12. The District has seen no decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. In fact, every school year since 2010, the Board has sought an exception to raise taxes above the Act 1 index due to its escalating special education costs. (See Act I index section below). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. If screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the Central Columbia School District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Central Columbia School District received a $1,112,337 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education Funding 2011-2012 Fiscal Year, 2011Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. In 2017-18, the District received $1,184,273 in Special education funding from the state.PDE, PA Special Education funding by LEA, 2017 =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 69 or 3.47% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 public school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy Central Columbia School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 called Policy 246.Central Columbia School Board Policy Manual The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age-appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108–265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006\\". The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low-nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education — Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Central Columbia School District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The US Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Central Columbia School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Beginning with the 2017-18 school year, high school students are mandated to receive a dose of MCV meningococcal conjugate vaccine for 12th grade entry. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2015-16, the District employed 151 teachers with an average teacher salary of $61,858 and the highest salary was $146,338. Central Columbia School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, Pennsylvania public school teachers and administrators can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers’ total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2014-15, the state mandated District contribution to the teacher pension fund rose to 21.40% of employee salaries and in 2015-16 it rose again to 25.84% of total District salaries. In 2017-18, the mandated contribution rate for state and local taxpayers is 32.57% of each teachers salary. In 2012-13, the average teacher salary in Central Columbia School District was $57,014.68 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $15,494 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $72,509.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in Pennsylvania Students, 2012 The District employed 150 teachers with an average salary of $58,107 and a top salary of $120,408. In 2009, Central Columbia School District reported employing 160 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $56,049 and a top salary of $110,000.Asbury Park Press, PA. Public School Salaries, 2009 The teacher's work day is 7.5 hours with 180 student days (185 total days) in the contract year. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance (teachers pay 13% of the costs of their health insurance), vision insurance, dental insurance, professional development reimbursement, 2 paid personal days, at least 10 paid sick days, paid death leave, a paid emergency day and other benefits. Department heads and grade group leaders receive additional compensation. In 2007, Central Columbia School District employed 138 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $51,143 for 180 days worked. The district's average teacher salary was the second highest of all the Columbia County school districts in 2007.Fenton, Jacob, Average classroom teacher salary in Columbia County, 2006-07 .

Reserves In 2008, the Central Columbia School District reported an unreserved designated fund balance of $703,500.00 and an unreserved undesignated fund balance of $5,215,089.00.General Reserved Fund Balance by School District 1996-2008, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report 2008. In 2010, Central Columbia School District Administration reported $3,602,538 in the unreserved- undesignated fund balance. The District also reported $5,138,500 in its unreserved-designated fund in 2010. IN 2012, Central Columbia School District reported $10,915,161 in reserves.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in Pennsylvania Students - Central Columbia Report 2013, November 2013 Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion. In 2014-15, Central Columbia School District reported having $10,690,707 in reserves. The District’s reserves were 39% of its budget exceeding state regulation limits of 8%. Audit In January 2012, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the District. The findings were reported to the School Board and the District's administration. In 2016, the State Auditor GEneral reported the Board had more than doubled the District's Total Debt from $20.3 million (2013) to $47.7 million in 2015. Tuition Students who live in the District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Central Columbia School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $7,756.21, High School - $8,718.57. In 2015, the District's tuition rates were: elementary - $8,813.09 and the high school was $10,791. In 2016, 28 pupils chose to attend cyber charter schools. The Central Columbia School District is funded by a combination of: a local income tax 1.05%, a property tax, per capita taxes, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a small amount, generally 10% of its budget from the federal government. In Pennsylvania, pension income and social security income are exempt from both state income tax and local earned income taxes regardless of income level. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the District. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeded $60,000 a year, plus they receive federal Social Security benefits. Both retirement benefits are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. Effective 2016, active duty military are also exempted from paying the local earned income tax in Pennsylvania. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Central Columbia School District receives 30.7% of its annual revenue from the state. In December 2014, the Pennsylvania Education Funding Reform Commission conducted a hearing regarding school funding by the Commonwealth. The commission developed a new basic education funding formula which sets a new way to distribute state basic education dollars. It abolished the practice of \\"hold harmless\\" funding, which gave districts at least the same as they got the previous school year regardless of declining enrollment. The plan became law in June 2016 (House Bill 1552).Basic Education Funding Commission, Commission minutes, 2016York Dispatch, Governor Wolf Signs Fair Funding Formula, June 2016 For the 2017-18 school year, Central Columbia School District received a 1.4% increase to $6,461,649 in Basic Education Funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The greatest increase in funding, in Columbia County, was awarded to Bloomsburg Area School District a 2.6% increase.PDE, 2017-18 Education Distributions: Basic, Special, RTL by LEA, August 2017 Pennsylvania again increased its public education spending to a record high of $5.995 billion. It was a $100 million increase, 1.7% increase over the 2016-17 state education appropriation.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Education Budget 2017-18, July 2017 Additionally, the state continued to fund its Ready to Learn grants at $250 million and Special Education funding received a $25 million increase to $1.121 billion.PDE, Special Education Funding fiscal year 2017-18, July 2017 The state also paid $529,5 million to the school employee social security fund and another $2.304 billion to the teacher’s pension fund, an increase of 7.6% over the state’s 2016-17 payment. The state maintained its $100 million reimbursement to school districts for transportation costs. Governor Wolf had proposed cutting the funding by 50% shifting the costs to local taxpayers. For the 2016-17 school year, Central Columbia School District received $6,375,268 in Basic Education Funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This is a 2.2% increase over 2015-16 funding to the District. The highest percentage of BEF increase in Columbia County was 3% awarded to both Bloomsburg Area School District and Benton Area School District, under the state's Basic Education Funding formula. For the 2016-17 school year, Pennsylvania increased its public education spending to a record high of $5,895 billion. It was a $200 million increase, 3.51% increase over the 2015-16 appropriation.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Education Budget 2016-17, July 2016 The state also funded Ready to Learn grants at $250 million and Special Education funding received a $20 million increase.PDE, Special Education Funding fiscal year 2016-17, July 2017 The state also paid $492 million to the school employee social security fund and another $2.064 billion to the teacher's pension fund.PA Office of Budget, Commonwealth 2016-17 Enacted Budget Line-Item Appropriations, July 2016 Central Columbia received an increase in special education funding and Ready to Learn funding to $255,774. For the 2015-16 school year, Governor Tom Wolf released a partial Basic Education Funding of $2,998,431 to Central Columbia School District, in January 2016. This was part of $10.3 billion in school funding withheld from the public schools, by the Governor since the summer of 2015.

The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions, and government property. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Additionally, service related, disabled U.S. military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. There are a plethora of gas pipelines in the District due to marcellus shale gas development. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, there by limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Located in the marcellus shale region, Sayre Area School District is adversely impacted this way.The Nature Conservancy – Pennsylvania Chapter, Natural Gas Pipelines Pennsylvania Energy Impacts Assessment, December 16, 2011The Nature Conservancy, Marcellus Shale Gas Development in Bradford County, December 16, 2011 The Atlantic Sunrise Gas Pipeline passes through Mount Pleasant Township in the western region of the district.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010–2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.

His prison rhyme the Purgatory of Suicides (1845) runs to 944 stanzas. He also wrote novels and in later life religious texts. He was an autodidact, who worked otherwise as a shoemaker, preacher, schoolmaster and journalist, before taking up Chartism in 1840. He was a passionate, determined and fiery man. Early years Cooper was born in Leicester, and apprenticed to a shoemaker. In spite of hardships and difficulties, he managed to educate himself, and at the age of 23, having been a shoemaker in Gainsborough, managed to open a school there in 1827.The Dictionary of National Biography: the concise dictionary ... to 1930; p. 276. He married in 1834, but his wife died in 1880. Chartist leader and lecturer After journalistic work in Lincoln and London, Cooper joined the staff of the Leicestershire Mercury in 1840.The Dictionary of National Biography: the concise dictionary... to 1930, p. 276. Leicester under his leadership became a Chartist stronghold, with its own journals, such as the Commonwealthman, and a school for adults. He became a leader and lecturer among them and in 1842 was imprisoned in Stafford for two years after riots in the Staffordshire Potteries, where he wrote his Purgatory of Suicides, a political epic. However, Cooper abandoned full-time radicalism on his release. Writing and lecturing In addition to various papers with which he was connected, Cooper in 1850 ran Cooper's Journal, but only a few issues appeared. {sfn |MacDonald |1901}} At the same time he adopted sceptical views, which he continued to hold until 1855, when he became a Christian, joined the Baptists, and was a preacher among them. Though still calling himself a Chartist, he sought to earn a living and a reputation as a writer. In addition to his poems, he wrote several novels, although those like Alderman Ralph (1853) failed on both counts. Having abandoned his religious beliefs at the time of his imprisonment, Cooper was dramatically re-converted to Christianity in 1855. His next thirty years were spent as a lecturer in defence of Christianity, attacking the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin and Ernst Haeckel. He authored Evolution, The Stone Book, and The Mosaic Record of Creation (1878), which argued for creationism and rejected evolution.David Knight, Public Understanding of Science: A History of Communicating Scientific Ideas. Routledge, 2006, p. 191. \\"Evolution, the Stone Book, and the Mosaic Record of Creation\\". The Spectator. Somewhat impulsive, he was an honest and sincere man. His autobiography (1872) is regarded as a minor Victorian classic. In his later years he settled into being an old- fashioned Radical. His friends in 1867 raised an annuity for him, and in the last year of his life he received a government pension. He died in Lincoln on 15 July 1892 and was buried there.

He also left behind a reputation as a humorist and as a poet, although his work was not published until after his death and in unreliable editions. Life The son of a prominent nurseryman in Twickenham,Twickenham, The Environs of London: volume 3: County of Middlesex (1795), pp.558–604 Richard Corbet was educated at Westminster School, Broadgates Hall, Oxford and Christ Church, Oxford, taking his Oxford Master of Arts (MA Oxon) in 1605. Having taken holy orders (he was, irregularly, ordained both deacon and priest on the same day, 26 March 1613, by John Bridges, Bishop of Oxford), he became a Doctor of Divinity (DD) in 1617. In consideration of his preaching, which included an oration on the death of the heir to the throne (Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales), James VI and I made him one of the royal chaplains. He also held a number of other positions, including Dean of Christ Church (1620–28), later becoming Bishop of Oxford (1628) and then Bishop of Norwich (1632).The Concise Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University 1992, p.646 He was nominated to the See of Oxford on 30 July 1628 and translated to Norwich on 7 May 1632. He was generally an easy-going man and, although he was anti-Puritan and wrote against them, did little to repress Puritan activities around Norwich when William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, began his campaign against them. Corbet was also renowned for his humour and many anecdotes were told of him throughout his career. One of those recorded by John Aubrey recalls how \\"On a market-day he and some of his comrades were at the taverne by the Crosse… The ballad-singer complayned he had no custome, he could not put off his ballads. The jolly Doctor puts off his gowne, and puts on the ballad-singer's leathern jacket, and being a handsome man, and a rare full voice, he presently vended a great many, and had a great audience.Poems 1807, pp.liii-liv Later he appropriated the form of the sung ballad so as to break down the distinction between different kinds of audience and make its intermediary possibilities available for wider dispersal of his particular views. One included \\"The Distracted Puritan\\",Percy's Reliques Mad Song the Second with its satirical characterisation of ostentatious religiosity. Though written in the form of a personal justification, its setting to the tune Tom O' Bedlam, a frequent accompaniment to ballads about madness, signals how the words are really to be taken. Another line of attack occurs in his \\"A proper new ballad entitled Fairies’ Farewell\\",University of Wisconsin a lament for folk tradition undermined by Puritan prohibitions. Frequent later reprintings have treated it as a piece of charming lore, but the choice of a tune originally associated with lament makes its message clear. The true subject is social friction and the breakdown of trust that has brought.Joshua B. Fisher, \\"He is turned a ballad-maker\\": Broadside Appropriations in Early Modern England, Early Modern Literary Studies 9.2, 2003 Poetry Corbet spent much of his life in Oxford, where it is possible that he knew the younger men Henry King and Jasper Mayne, both educated like him at Westminster School and Christ Church, and fellow contributors of poetical tributes to Donne's collected poems. Certainly he knew Ben Jonson, whom he was partly instrumental in inviting to Oxford in 1616.Poems 1807, pp.xv-xvii Jonson also wrote a companion piece to Corbet's own poetical tribute to his father Vincent after his death in 1619.Works of the British Poets IV, p.566 In his own day, Corbet's reputation was high and his poems were circulated widely in manuscript. Most, according to Anthony Wood, were \\"made in his younger years, and never intended to be published\\".Athenae Oxonienses (London, 1691-2), I, 512 Their first book publication was in Certain Elegant Poems (London, 1647), edited by John Donne the Younger. This was little more than a patchwork of twenty-two poor and sometimes spurious texts. Poëtica Stromata, a second and entirely separate foreign edition appeared in the following year, consisting of twenty-five poems (only fourteen of which had appeared in the 1647 edition). After another London edition in 1672, there were no more until the augmented fourth edition of Octavius Gilchrist (London 1807). In the 20th century there was a scholarly edition by J A W Bennett and Hugh Trevor-Roper (Oxford 1955). Humour often characterised his written work. In a prose appeal for the refurbishment of St Paul's Cathedral, he described how the building had suffered a double martyrdom by fire and continues: “Saint Paul complained of stoning twice; his church of firing: stoning she wants indeed, and a good stoning would repair her.”(Poems 1807, p.xliv) His elegy for John Donne, the dean of St Paul's, makes the same point as many others accompanying the posthumous collection of Donne's poems. To write on this subject, one must first be like the author, he argues, but then concludes that since Donne is now dead he would rather not proceed so far.Poems by J.D. with elegies on the author's death, London 1633, p.378 Some of Corbet's poems have the same uneven rhythms of Donne and other contemporary writers, and are touched by the same Baroque spirit of exaggeration. A fair example occurs in \\"An elegy upon the Lady Haddington, who died of the small-pox\\", where the disease is addressed thus: ::Thou, that of faces honeycombs dost make, ::And of two breasts two cullenders, forsake ::Thy deadly trade: thou now art rich; give o’er, ::And let our curses call thee forth no more; ::Or if thou needs wilt magnify thy power, ::Go where thou art invoked every hour – ::Amongst the gamesters, where they name thee thick.Poems 1807, p.128 He wrote several more elegies besides and joined with fellow wits in making fun of Thomas Coryat’s Crudities (Poems 1807, pp.11–12). Verse letters indicate the Court circle of royal favourites and their dependents among whom he moved, being addressed to John Mordaunt, 1st Earl of Peterborough, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and Thomas Aylesbury. His more original subjects are accounts of journeys: the burlesque \\"Journey to France\\" (Poems 1807, p.94 ff), and the satirical account of a tour from Oxford to Newark, \\"Iter Boreale\\" (p.171ff).

He was dismissed from his post at Eton for encouraging a culture of intimacy, possibly innocent, between teachers and pupils. He is widely known for his English version of the elegy Heraclitus by Callimachus. Life He was born at Great Torrington in Devon, and educated at Eton, where he was afterwards a renowned master, nicknamed \\"Tute\\" (short for \\"tutor\\") by his pupils. After Eton, where he won the Newcastle Scholarship,W.C. Lubenow, The Cambridge Apostles 1820-1914: Liberalism, Imagination, and Friendship (Cambridge University Press, 1998), at page 258 he studied at King's College, Cambridge, where he won the Chancellor's Medal for an English poem on Plato in 1843, and the Craven Scholarship in 1844. He was a writer of Latin verse as well as English verse. Although best known for the much-anthologised \\"Heraclitus\\", an adaptation of an elegy by Callimachus, (\\"They told me Heraclitus, they told me you were dead\\"\\"Heraclitus\\" poem), his chief poetical work is the collection Ionica.Ionica (Smith, Elder & Co., 1858. iv, 116 pages) contained 48 poems, two dated 1851 and 1855. Ionica II (C.U.P., 1877. 48 pages) had 25 poems, several bearing dates in the period 1859-1877. Ionica (George Allen, 1891. vi, 210 pages) contained 85 poems, omitting six of the 1858 volume and two of the 1877 book, but adding 20 new poems, three dated 1877, 1885 and 1889. The collected edition Ionica edited by A. C. Benson (George Allen, 1905. xxxii, 220 pages) restored five poems dropped in 1891 - three from the 1858 volume and two from the 1877 book - and added one from a letter of 1862 (first published in the Letters and Journals of 1897). Still omitted were \\"A Chobham Song\\", \\"Rhymes at the Wrong End\\" and \\"The Bridesmaid\\". Cory became an assistant master at Eton in 1845 just after graduating from King's. He insisted on the centrality of personal ties between teacher and student. The historian G. W. Prothero described him as \\"the most brilliant Eton tutor of his day\\". Arthur Coleridge described him as \\"the wisest master who has ever been at Eton\\". Among his former pupils are numbered several statesmen of the period, including Lord Rosebery, Captain Algernon Drummond, Henry Scott Holland, Howard Overing Sturgis, Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax and Arthur Balfour. = Resignation = Johnson was forced to resign from Eton at Easter 1872 after an \\"indiscreet letter\\" that he had written to a pupil was intercepted by the boy's parents and brought to the notice of the headmaster.See Henry Salt: Memories of Bygone Eton (1928), pp. 112-119. Salt was also a master at Eton and had written in 1910 in Eton under Hornby (pp. 61-2) that \\"The real reason ... will probably never be told.\\" Although it has been suggested that Johnson was a devoted paederast who numbered among his paramours Reginald Brett, the future Lord Esher,Ward, Yvonne M.. Censoring Queen Victoria: How Two Gentlemen Edited a Queen and Created an Icon. London: Oneworld Books, 2014, pp.21-3. the Dictionary of National Biography maintains that this cannot be proved and that \\"No one can be quite sure of the exact circumstances of his resignation,\\" adding: \\"There is no question, however, that he was dangerously fond of a number of boys. Although he probably did not allow his affections to take any physical form, he permitted intimacies between the boys. This conduct was brought to the notice of the headmaster, James Hornby, who demanded Johnson's resignation.\\"Card,Tim. ‘Cory, William Johnson (1823–1892)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 4 May 2014 as archived article (no longer current version) In dismissing Johnson, Hornby commented that it was not for committing acts of “immorality in the ordinary sense of the word”,Lubenow, William C.. ‘Paidea and power: William Johnson (Cory), Oscar Browning and their sackings from Eton’, Paper presented to the North American Conference on British Studies meeting in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on 17 October 1998 accessed 4 May 2014 meaning sodomy in the euphemism of the era, and an alternative view of Johnson's dismissal is given by William C. Lubenow, who posits that Hornby \\"turfed out William Johnson and Oscar Browning because they were liberal reformers in a highly authoritarian institution ...

Johnson retired to Halsdon and changed his name on 17 October 1872 to Cory (the maiden name of his paternal grandmother) before emigrating for health reasons to Madeira in February 1878, where he married and had a son. He returned to England in September 1882, settling in Hampstead, where he died on 11 June 1892. He was buried at Hampstead on 16 June. = Posthumous influence = Cory is well noted for a letter in which he articulates the purpose of education. His words are taken by many as a justification for studying Latin. The full quotation goes: > At school you are engaged not so much in acquiring knowledge as in making > mental efforts under criticism. A certain amount of knowledge you can indeed > with average faculties acquire so as to retain; nor need you regret the > hours you spent on much that is forgotten, for the shadow of lost knowledge > at least protects you from many illusions. But you go to a great school not > so much for knowledge as for arts and habits; for the habit of attention, > for the art of expression, for the art of assuming at a moment's notice a > new intellectual position, for the art of entering quickly into another > person's thoughts, for the habit of submitting to censure and refutation, > for the art of indicating assent or dissent in graduated terms, for the > habit of regarding minute points of accuracy, for the art of working out > what is possible in a given time, for taste, for discrimination, for mental > courage, and for mental soberness.Eton College In 1924 an entire book devoted to Cory was printed, entitled Ionicus. The author was Reginald Baliol Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, with whom Johnson is alleged to have enjoyed a relationship when Brett was a schoolboy, and who was by then an adviser to the government and one of the most eminent and powerful men of his time. Brett had begun a correspondence with Cory while he was at Eton, and continued it until the time of Cory's death. The dedication mentions three Prime Ministers, two of which (Rosebery and Balfour) learnt at Eton \\"the elements of high politics from IONICUS\\" (Rosebery and Balfour), whereas the third (Asquith) \\"showed him kindness in his old age\\".

She was a student of John Muir Wood and later became a popular writer of hymns, most especially \\"The Sands Of Time Are Sinking\\", while travelling with her minister husband from 1854 to 1878. Many of her hymns were widely used throughout Great Britain during the mid-to late 19th century. One of her sons, John William Cousin, was a prominent writer and editor of A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature. Biography Anne Ross Cousin was born in Hull, England on 27 April 1824. She was the only child of Dr. David Ross Cundell, a former assistant surgeon with the 33rd regiment at the Battle of Waterloo, and moved with her family to Leith soon after her birth. She received a private education and became a skilled pianist under John Muir Wood. In 1847, she married William Cousin, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, then serving at a local Presbyterian church in Chelsea, and with whom she would have six children. Shortly after their marriage, William was called to minister to the Free Church in Irvine, North Ayrshire, and then in Melrose in 1859. During this time, Anne began writing church hymns for her husband's services and many of these became very popular in Britain during the mid-to late 19th century. Her most popular song, \\"The Sands Of Time Are Sinking\\", was written in 1854 while William was still in Irvine. Cousin later claimed she had been inspired by the writing of Samuel Rutherford. The original version was 19 stanzas and first appeared in \\"The Christian Treasury\\" as \\"The Last Words of Samuel Rutherford\\" in 1857. It did not become widely known, however, until the Rev. Dr. J. Hood Wilson introduced a shorted 5-verse version into a hymn book, \\"The Service of Praise\\", for his congregation at the Barclay Church in Edinburgh. Other popular ones included \\"O Christ what burdens bowed Thy head\\" and \\"King Eternal King Immortal\\", the latter often set to music and sung at choral festivals. A collection of her poems, Immanuel's Land and Other Pieces, was published in 1876 under her initials A.R.C., by which she was most widely known. They retired in Edinburgh after nearly 20 years of religious service. William Cousin died in 1883, and Anne remained in the city until her own death on 6 December 1906. Her daughter, Anne P. Cousin, contributed to her biography when she was profiled for the Dictionary of National Biography by Sir Sidney Lee in 1912. The Sands of Time are Sinking Cousin's best known hymn, \\"The Sands of Time are Sinking\\", is known and sung over the English-speaking world. It is also known as \\"Immanuel's Land\\", the phrase that is repeated at the end of each stanza. This poem was inspired by Samuel Rutherford's last words. It was first published in the 1860s, with extracts from Rutherford's works, under the title: Last words of Reverend Samuel Rutherford: with some of his sweet sayings. The first verse of Immanuel's Land says: :The sands of time are sinking, the dawn of Heaven breaks; :The summer morn I’ve sighed for — the fair, sweet morn awakes: :Dark, dark hath been the midnight, but dayspring is at hand, :And glory, glory dwelleth in Immanuel’s land. In this context, Immanuel is used as a name of Christ. The original poem has nineteen verses, but only a few of them appear in most hymnals. Many of the omitted verses are about Anwoth, where Rutherford lived.

Broadly construed, the term refers to a series of wars between 1563 and 1721. More narrowly, it refers to particular wars between 1600 and 1629. These are the wars included under the broader use of the term: *the 16th century conflict sometimes referred to as the Livonian War (1558–1583) *the War against Sigismund, in 1598 *the war of 1600–1629 (sometimes considered a part of the larger trans-European Thirty Years' War) which was twice interrupted by periods of truce and can be divided into: **the war of 1600–1611 **the war of 1617–18 **the war of 1621–1625 **the war of 1626–1629 *the conflicts in the second half of the 17th century known as The Deluge (part of Northern Wars 1655–1661) *the Great Northern War (1700–1721). *the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806–07), in which Poland, by then partitioned, was represented by the Polish Legions in Napoleonic service *the last Polish–Swedish War was the War of the Sixth Coalition, because the Duchy of Warsaw was a Napoleonic ally, whereas the Kingdom of Sweden was a member of the anti-Napoleonic coalition.  Livonian War   War against Sigismund  The conflict between Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden can trace its roots to the War against Sigismund, where Sigismund III Vasa, at one time king of both the Commonwealth and Sweden, lost the throne of Sweden during the civil war (1597–1599). Few Commonwealth troops participated in this conflict, and it is mostly regarded as a Swedish civil war, not part of the Polish–Swedish wars. After early stalemate, Sigismund was defeated in the Battle of Stångebro in 1598 and by 1599, Sigismund was dethroned by his uncle, Duke Charles and forced to retreat to the Commonwealth. This also spelled the end of the short-lived personal union between Poland and Sweden.  Polish–Swedish War of 1600–1611  However, even after being dethroned, Sigismund did not give up on regaining the Swedish throne, and from then on, most of his policies would revolve around his attempts to conquer Sweden, even though Commonwealth nobility had little will for such a long and bloody conflict. Sigismund started his plan in 1599, when he confirmed the pacta conventa, documents with promises he signed when elected as a King of Poland, which stated that the then-Swedish territory of Estonia would now become part of the Commonwealth. Polish nobility, the szlachta, supported this particular conflict, assuming it would be limited to Estonia only, and expecting many gains in form of new lands and increases of grain export through access to Estonian ports on the Baltic Sea. In addition, szlachta did not think highly of the Swedes, and did not expect this war to drag long or be difficult. They grossly underestimated their opponent, thinking that Poland, having been nearly undefeated in battle for over a hundred years, would be easily able to parry any attacks of the Scandinavians. The Commonwealth had nearly 10 million inhabitants, almost 10 times that of 1 million in Sweden. On the other hand, szlachta forgot that the Commonwealth had one of the smallest military to population ratios in Europe, and did not know that the Swedish army was highly trained and motivated. Battle of Kirchholm in 1605 Sweden was able to draft a large army much more quickly than the Commonwealth, due to its centralised government and obligatory draft of free peasants. The Commonwealth was forced to fight on two fronts, as its armies were also needed south to deal with the Moldavian Magnate Wars, and Swedish forces quickly gained 3:1 numerical superiority. In the beginning of the war, in 1600, although a Commonwealth army under command of Great Lithuanian Hetman Krzysztof Mikołaj \\"the Thunderbolt\\" Radziwiłł striking first was able to deal the Swedish forces several defeats in the open fields, Swedes took control not only of Estonia, but of most of Livonia, the Commonwealth territory south of Estonia (the entire region was known in Poland-Lithuania as Inflanty (). The Polish- Lithuanian parliament, the Sejm, reacted by increasing funds for the army and recalling forces and commanders from the southern front (deemed less important as most of that war took part outside Commonwealth territory) to the threatened north. In 1601 Lithuanian hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and Polish chancellor Jan Zamoyski, recalled from Moldavia, arrived in Lithuania to fight the Swedish incursion, which now threatened not only the Estonia promised by Sigismund, but older Polish territories south of it. Chodkiewicz and Radziwiłł defeated the Swedes in the first major open battle of this war at Kokenhusen (Koknese) in early 1601. Soon afterwards, Jan Zamoyski, fresh from his victory against the Moldavians, came in to help against the Swedes, with 12,000 men, and 50 artillery pieces, 15 of which were classified as heavy. Charles was unable to deal effectively with such an army and was forced to retreat. However, during the retreat he left sizable numbers of defenders at various captured fortresses in Livonia. Zamoyski now took to siege warfare instead of chasing the retreating King, soon capturing Wolmar (Valmiera) and Fellin (Viljandi, Felin). By 1602, the Swedes were only left with control of Reval (Tallinn, Talin, Rewl), Pernau (Pärnu, Parnau, Parnawa), Hapsal (Haapsalu, Hapsalu) and Dorpat (Tartu). However, Zamoyski, now 60 years old, had fallen ill and Chodkiewicz took command and laid siege to Dorpat. At Wesenberg (Rakvere), he defeated a Swedish reinforcement force sent in to help Dorpat, which was soon forced to surrender. Chodkiewicz was appointed acting commander in chief of Lithuania forces after Zamoyski's return south in 1602 (Zamoyski would never return to lead the armies, his health deteriorated and he would die in 1605). Chodkiewicz, despite inadequate supplies and little support from the Commonwealth Sejm (parliament) and King Sigismund III Vasa, brilliantly distinguished himself, capturing fortress after fortress and repulsing the duke of Södermanland, afterwards Charles IX, from Riga (Ryga), however Reval, Pernau, and Narwa (Narva, Narew) remained under Swedish control. In 1604 he captured Dorpat, twice defeated the Swedish generals at Biały Kamień and near Weissenstein (Paide) (often winning against superior odds, like at Weissenstein where he had only 2,300 men and defeated a 6,000 man Swedish force; Chodkiewicz wrote in his memoirs this was a decisive battle and one of his greatest victories, with Polish-Lithuanian losses 81 dead, 100 wounded and Swedish losses approaching half of their army). For his valour Chodkiewicz was rewarded by the king with the grand hetman buława of Lithuania. However, the war was neglected by the Commonwealth's parliament, which turned a deaf ear to all his requests for reinforcements and for supplies and money to pay his soldiers. The Commonwealth's decentralised financial system (all taxes had to be agreed upon by all the nobility at Sejm and regional Sejmiks) meant that the Commonwealth treasury was almost always empty. This flaw plagued the Commonwealth for centuries. Chodkiewicz nevertheless more than held his own against the Swedes. He instituted a new form of warfare based upon his use of the elite hussar cavalry and consequently the Swedes were repeatedly defeated in the open field. First the Commonwealth forces attacked Swedish cavalry, after which they usually attacked demoralised Swedish infantry which was unable to retreat at all, and usually annihilated whole formations of this infantry. In 1605 the Swedes spent large sums of money to conscript a massive new army. Riksdag spent much cash on conscripting new formations, and as the Russian tsar Boris Godunov gave the Swedes much financial help, likely attempting to keep both Sweden and the Commonwealth busy during the Time of Troubles. The Swedes were able to hire large numbers of mercenaries, as well as hiring many siege engineers from all over Europe. In 1605, a few miles from Reval, a 5,000-strong army led by Anders Lennartson landed in Estonia. Several days later another Swedish expedition, numbering around 4,000 and led by Count Frederick Joachim Mansfeld, landed near and besieged the fortress of Dünamünde (Daugavgriva, Dynemunt) near Riga, although without any success. After this setback they now began laying siege to Riga. Their main mission was to capture this important city, one of the largest Baltic ports. Chodkiewicz moved in to relieve the garrison at Riga, but found that the Swedes were also sending in reinforcements under Lennartsson. Chodkiewicz moved in on Lennartsson, however he decided not to engage in open battle and retreated into a fortress. On finding out that Charles himself was now marching in with yet more reinforcements (around 5,000), Lennartsson decided to link up with the king and assault Riga together. Chodkiewicz, who failed to prevent the Swedish forces from joining, moved from Cēsis (Kiesia) to near Kircholm (Salacpils, Salaspils) and Iskiel (Ikskile), where he built a small fortified camp. Charles, who arrived at Riga on 23 September, learned of the Chodkiewicz force nearby and decided to destroy it with an attack with the majority of Swedish forces within the area. On 27 September the Swedish force under King Charles moved towards Kircholm. The Battle of Kircholm (Salaspils) on September 27, 1605, near Düna (Daugava, Dvina, Dźwina) River would be Chodkiewicz's crowning achievement. Chodkiewicz, having smaller forces (approximately at 1:3 disadvantage), used a 'feint' to force the Swedes off their high position. The Swedes under Charles thought that the Lithuanians with small support of Poles were retreating and, therefore, they advanced, spreading out their formations to give chase. This is what Chodkiewicz was waiting for. The Commonwealth's army now gave fire with their infantry causing the Swedes some losses, at which point the Hussars moved into a re-formation and charged at the Swedish infantry formations. The Swedish formations broke completely, the King himself fleeing, barely escaping back to his flotilla off the coast. Thus Chodkiewicz, with barely 3,600 troops, defeated an 11,000-man Swedish army, inflicting 5,500–9,000 casualties, for which feat he received letters of congratulation from the Pope, all the Catholic potentates of Europe, and even from the sultan of Turkey and the shah of Persia. Yet this great victory was absolutely fruitless, owing to the domestic dissensions which prevailed in the Commonwealth during the following five years. Chodkiewicz's army, unpaid for years, abandoned him at last en masse in order to plunder the estates of their political opponents, leaving the hetman to carry on the war as best he could with a handful of mercenaries paid out of the pockets of himself and his friends. With tiny, inadequate forces, Chodkiewicz nonetheless prevented Swedes from overrunning the entire Inflanty region, helped by the relative inaction of Swedish commanders until 1608. Chodkiewicz, who was one of the magnates who remained loyal to the king, had to divide his attention between the rebellion against Sigismund in the Commonwealth (the Zebrzydowski rebellion, 1606–1609) and a fresh invasion of Livonia by the Swedes led by Mansfeld in 1608. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz painted by Juliusz Kossak Mansfeld captured Dünamünde, Fellin, and Kokenhusen, but when Chodkiewicz returned, the tide turned. In 1609 Chodkiwicz once more he relieved Riga besides capturing Pernau. Chodkiewicz also defeated the Swedish flotilla at Salis and finally defeated Mansfeld's army once again near the river Gauja. Eventually, a truce was signed in 1611 after the death of Charles IX. It would last until 1617 (or November 1620, conflicting sources). During the next decade, the Commonwealth was occupied with its aggression against Russia. Southern borders were also endangered by the constant troubles with Ottoman Empire during the Moldavian Magnate Wars.  Polish–Swedish War of 1621–1625  Having signed the Treaty of Stolbovo ending their Ingrian War with Russia in 1617, the Swedes, led by King Gustav II Adolf (Gustavus Adolphus), who was hailed as saviour of Protestant Europe, turned their attention to the Commonwealth again. They have expanded their gains in the disputed Livonia region, taking Dünamünde and Pernau in 1617. When the truce expired in November 1620, Gustav Adolf succeeded in taking the city of Riga after a few weeks of siege. The Commonwealth, occupied by a serious war with the Ottomans (battles of Cecora and Chocim) was unable to send significant forces to stop Gustav Adolf, and was forced to sign a truce favorable to Gustav Adolf. The Commonwealth was forced to cede Livonia north of Dvina (Düna) river, and retained only a nominal control over Riga. A new truce in Mittau (Jelgava, Mittawa) was signed and lasted from November 1622 to March 1625.  Polish–Swedish War of 1626–1629  In 1625, the Swedes quickly occupied all of Livonia and Courland by the year's end. In the beginning of 1626, a Swedish army under Gustavus II Adolphus numbering 3,000 men, faced a Polish force twice as big at Wallhof under Jan Stanisław Sapieha Swedish casualties were reported as none whilst Polish casualties exceeded 2,000 men. In May 1626 Gustav Adolf began the surprising invasion of Prussia. Gustav's landing in Ducal Prussia near Pillau with over 8,000 soldiers came as a surprise to the Commonwealth and despite his relatively small forces, Gustav Adolf acting with the support of the Elector of Brandenburg quickly captured all of the coastal towns, with the exception of the largest prize: the city of Gdańsk (Danzig). The Commonwealth received no support from its vassal, Ducal Prussia. Near the village of Gniew in a battle (22–30 September 1626) Gustav defeated a Polish army led by King Sigismund. Sigismund retreated and called from reinforcements from other parts of the country. Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski's forces (4,200 light cavalry, 1,000 dragoons, 1,000 infantry) moved to Prussia with amazing speed. Strengthened by other units, he had 10,000 men against over 20,000-strong Swedish force. Using the tactic of maneuver warfare, with small mobile units striking at the enemy's communication lines and smaller units, he managed to stop the Swedish attack and force the units under Axel Oxenstierna, who also attempted to avoid battles with an overwhelming concentrated forces of Koniecpolski, into a defense. For a short time the war became a stalemate. In the meantime, the Sejm (Commonwealth Parliament) agreed to raise money for the war, but the situation of the Polish forces was difficult. Lithuanian forces were dealt a serious defeat in December 1626 near Kokenhusen in Livonia and retreated behind the Dvina river. The Swedes planned to strike Koniecpolski from two directions - Oxenstierna from direction of the Vistula and Johann Streiff von Lawentstein and Maxymilian Teuffl from Swedish held Pomerania. The flooding of the Vistula disrupted their plans and allowed Koniecpolski to intercept the enemy units coming from Pomerania. Portrait of hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski Koniecpolski recaptured the town of Puck on 2 April. During the crossing of the Vistula near Kieżmark, in the vicinity of Danzig (Gdańsk), Gustav met the Polish forces and in the ensuing battle was wounded in the hip and forced to retreat. In July he led forces to lift the siege of Braniew, and lay siege to Orneta. Koniecpolski responded with the sudden attack and capture of Gniew. Gustav Adolf was reported to be impressed by the speed of Koniecpolski's reaction. With about 7,800 men (including 2,500 cavalry and hussars), Koniecpolski tried to stop the Swedish army from reaching Danzig near Dirschau (Gdańsk, near Tczew). On 7–8 August (or 18 September, sources vary), battle with the Swedish forces (10,000 men including 5,000 infantry) took place near the swamps of Mołtawa. The Swedes wanted to provoke the Poles into an attack and then destroy them with infantry fire and artillery, but Koniecpolski decided not to attack. The Swedes then took the initiative and attacked with cavalry, but did not manage to draw the Poles within the range of their fire. The consequent Swedish attacks managed to deal severe damage to Polish cavalry units, but did not manage to cripple the army (whose morale was kept high, thanks to Koniecpolski). The battle ended when Gustav Adolf was once again wounded and the Swedes retreated. After the battle, Koniecpolski saw the need to reform the army and strengthen the firepower of infantry and artillery to match the Swedish units. The Swedes, on the other hand, learned arts of cavalry attacks, charges and melee combat from the Poles. In March/April (dates vary) of 1627 near Czarne (Hamersztyn) Koniecpolski forced the Swedish forces to retreat inside the city, and three days later to surrender, leaving behind their banners and insignia. Some Swedish soldiers and mercenaries changed sides at that time. This victory also convinced the Elector of Brandenburg to declare his support for the Commonwealth, and the Lithuanian forces resumed the offensive in Inflanty. Koniecpolski's insistence of taking the war to the seas resulted in the tiny and untested Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy of 9 ships to the defeat of a Swedish flotilla on 28 November 1627 (or 17 November, dates vary), at the Battle of Oliwa. In 1628 the Polish forces, lacking funding, were forced to stop their offensive and switch to defense. Gustav Adolf captured Nowy and Brodnica. Koniecpolski counterattacked by using his small forces most efficiently - fast cavalry melee attacks combined with the supporting fire of infantry and artillery, and using fortifications and terrain advantage. By that time the war had become a war of maneuver with neither side willing to face the other without advantages of terrain or fortifications. The Sejm decided to increase the funds for the war after the battle of Górzno, where Stanisław Potocki was defeated. The Catholic Austrian sent help to the Commonwealth in the form of units under field marshal Jan Jerzy Arnheim. A corps under Albrecht von Wallenstein also cooperated in Pomerania with Koniecpolski in 1629. Nonetheless, Koniecpolski was forced to withdraw Commonwealth forces from many strategic Polish strongholds in Prussia. In time, hetman Koniecpolski managed to recapture Puck. The final battle took place on 27 June 1629 near Trzciana (or Trzcianka). The Swedes attacked in the direction of Graudenz (Grudziądz), were stopped, and retreated to Stuhm (Sztum) and Marienburg (Malbork). Koniecpolski attacked the rear guard led by Jan, Count of Ren, and destroyed it. He also repelled a counterattack by Swedish raitars, who were pushed in the direction of Pułkowice, where another counterattack was led by Gustav Adolf with 2,000 cavalrymen. This counterattack was also stopped, and the Swedish forces were saved by the last reserve units led by field marshal Herman Wrangel, who finally managed to stop the Polish attack. Swedish losses were heavy, especially in the cavalry regiments. Gustav Adolf said after the battle \\"I have never been in such a bath\\". 600 Swedes were killed, including the count of Ren and the son of Wrangel, Jan Wilhelm Reingraff, and 200 were captured. Polish losses were under 200 killed and injured. The Swedish army bombarding the fortress of Dunamunde near Riga. However this victory was not followed up politically and militarily. Despite's all of Koniecpolski's brilliant efforts, a ceasefire in Stary Targ (Truce of Altmark) on 26 October 1629 was in favour of the Swedes, to whom Poland ceded the larger part of Livonia with the important port of Riga. Swedes also got the right to tax Polish trade moved through the Baltic (3.5% on the value of goods), kept control of many cities in Royal Prussia (including Baltiysk (Pillau, Piława), Memel and Elbląg (Elbing)) and for the time were generally recognized as the dominant power on the southern Baltic Sea coast. Duchy of Prussia was compensated by its losses (occupation of some cities by Swedes) by Commonwealth, with the temporary (until 1634) transfer of Malbork, Sztum and Żuławy Wiślane. Remaining ships of the Commonwealth fleet were transferred to Sweden. The Swedes only failure was their inability to capture the important port of Gdańsk. Gustav Adolf's biographer, Harte, noted that the king was furious \\"that a pacific commercial rabble should beat a set of illustrious fellows, who made fighting their profession\\". Nonetheless, Swedes now controlled almost all Baltic ports, with the exception of Danzig, Puck, Königsberg (Królewiec) and Liepāja (Libau, Libawa). This would be the closest Sweden ever got to realising its goal of making the Baltic Sea 'Sweden's inner lake'. After the treaty, Sweden used their prizes and money as a starting point in their entry into the Thirty Years' War and begun the invasion of northern Germany. Treaty of Altmark would be revised in Commonwealth favour in 1635 (Treaty of Sztumska Wieś or Treaty of Stuhmsdorf), when Sweden, weakened by their losses in the Thirty Years' War, would retreat from some Baltic ports and stop taking the 3.5% tax.

Medical uses Commonly accepted medical reasons for induction include: * Postterm pregnancy, i.e. if the pregnancy has gone past the end of the 42nd week. *Intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR). * There are health risks to the woman in continuing the pregnancy (e.g. she has pre-eclampsia). *Premature rupture of the membranes (PROM); this is when the membranes have ruptured, but labor does not start within a specific amount of time.Allahyar, J. & Galan, H. \\"Premature Rupture of the Membranes.\\"; also American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists. * Premature termination of the pregnancy (abortion). * Fetal death in utero and previous history of stillbirth. * Twin pregnancy continuing beyond 38 weeks. * Previous health conditions that puts risk on the woman and/or her child such as diabetes, high blood pressure *High BMI Induction of labor in those who are either at or after term improves outcomes for the baby and decreases the number of C-sections performed.

The use of intrauterine catheters are also indicated. These work by compressing the cervix mechanically to generate release on prostaglandins in local tissues. There is no direct effect on the uterus. Pharmacological methods include dinoprostone (prostaglandin E2), misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analogue), and intravenous oxytocin. =Medication= * Intravaginal, endocervical or extra-amniotic administration of prostaglandin, such as dinoprostone or misoprostol. Prostaglandin E2 is the most studied compound and with most evidence behind it. A range of different dosage forms are available with a variety of routes possible. The use of misoprostol has been extensively studied but normally in small, poorly defined studies. Only a very few countries have approved misoprostol for use in induction of labor. *Intravenous (IV) administration of synthetic oxytocin preparations is used to artificially induce labor if it is deemed medically necessary. A high dose of oxytocin does not seem to have greater benefits than a standard dose. There are risks associated with IV oxytocin induced labor. Risks include the women having induced contractions that are too vigorous, too close together (frequent), or that last too long, which may lead to added stress on the baby (changes in baby's heart rate) and may require the mother to have an emergency caesarean section. There is no high quality evidence to indicate if IV oxytocin should be stopped once a woman reaches active labor in order to reduce the incidence of women requiring caesarean sections. * Use of mifepristone has been described but is rarely used in practice.  Relaxin has been investigated, but is not currently commonly used. * mnemonic; ARNOP: Antiprogesterone, relaxin, nitric oxide donors, oxytocin, prostaglandins =Non-pharmaceutical= *Membrane sweep, also known as membrane stripping, Hamilton maneuver, or \\"stretch and sweep\\". The procedure is carried out by a midwife or doctor as part of an internal vaginal examination. The midwife or doctor puts a couple of lubricated, gloved fingers into the women's vagina and inserts their index finger into the opening of the cervix or neck of the womb. They then use a circular movement to try to separate the membranes of the amniotic sac, containing the baby, from the cervix. This action, which releases hormones called prostaglandins, may prepare the cervix for birth and may initiate labour. *Artificial rupture of the membranes (AROM or ARM) (\\"breaking the waters\\") * Extra-amniotic saline infusion (EASI), in which a Foley catheter is inserted into the cervix and the distal portion expanded to dilate it and to release prostaglandins. * Cook Medical Double Balloon known as the Cervical Ripening Balloon with Stylet for assisted placement is FDA approved. The Double balloon provides one balloon to be inflated with saline on one side of the Uterine side of the cervix and the second balloon to be inflated with saline on the vaginal side of the cervix.  When to induce  The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended against elective induction before 41 weeks if there is no medical indication and the cervix is unfavorable., which cites  One recent study indicates that labor induction at term (41 weeks) or post-term reduces the rate of caesarean section by 12 per cent, and also reduces fetal death.Ekaterina Mishanina et al., \\"Use of labour induction and risk of cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis\\", April 2014, Canadian Medical Association Journal, Some observational/retrospective studies have shown that non- indicated, elective inductions before the 41st week of gestation are associated with an increased risk of requiring a caesarean section. Randomized clinical trials have not addressed this question. However, researchers have found that multiparous women who undergo labor induction without medical indicators are not predisposed to caesarean sections.Heinberg EM, Wood RA, Chambers RB. Elective induction of labor in multiparous women. Does it increase the risk of cesarean section? 2002. J Reprod Med. 47(5):399–403. Doctors and pregnant women should have a discussion of risks and benefits when considering an induction of labor in the absence of an accepted medical indication. There is insufficient evidence to determine if inducing a women's labor at home is a safe and effective approach for both the women and the baby. Studies have shown a slight increase in risk of infant mortality for births in the 41st and particularly 42nd week of gestation, as well as a higher risk of injury to the mother and child.Tim A. Bruckner et al, Increased neonatal mortality among normal-weight births beyond 41 weeks of gestation in California, October 2008, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Due to the increasing risks of advanced gestation, induction appears to reduce the risk for caesarean delivery after 41 weeks' gestation and possibly earlier. Inducing labour after 41 weeks of completed gestion is likely to reduce the risk of perinatal death and stillbirth compared with waiting for labour to start spontaneously. Inducing labor before 39 weeks in the absence of a medical indication (such as hypertension, IUGR, or pre-eclampsia) increases the risk of complications of prematurity including difficulties with respiration, infection, feeding, jaundice, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and perinatal death. Inducing labour after 34 weeks and before 37 weeks in women with hypertensive disorders (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension) may lead to better outcomes for the woman but does not improve or worsen outcomes for the baby. More research is needed to produce more certain results. If waters break (membranes rupture) between 24 and 37 weeks' gestation, waiting for the labour to start naturally with careful monitoring of the woman and baby is more likely to lead to healthier outcomes. For women over 37 weeks pregnant whose babies are suspected of not coping well in the womb, it is not yet clear from research whether it is best to have an induction or caesarean immediately, or to wait until labour happens by itself. Similarly, there is not yet enough research to show whether it is best to deliver babies prematurely if they are not coping in the womb or whether to wait so that they are less premature when they are born. Clinicians assess the odds of having a vaginal delivery after labor induction by a \\"Bishop score\\". However, recent research has questioned the relationship between the Bishop score and a successful induction, finding that a poor Bishop score actually may improve the chance for a vaginal delivery after induction. A Bishop Score is done to assess the progression of the cervix prior to an induction. In order to do this, the cervix must be checked to see how much it has effaced, thinned out, and how far dilated it is. The score goes by a points system depending on five factors. Each factor is scored on a scale of either 0–2 or 0–3, any total score less than 5 holds a higher risk of delivering by caesarean section. Doheny, K. (2010, June 22). Labor Induction May Boost C-Section Risk. HealthDay Consumer News Service. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. Sometimes when a woman's waters break after 37 weeks she is induced instead of waiting for labour to start naturally. This may decrease the risks of infection for the woman and baby but more research is needed to find out whether inducing is good for women and babies longer term. Women who have had a caesarean section for a previous pregnancy are at risk of having a uterine rupture, when their caesarean scar re-opens. Uterine rupture is very serious for the woman and the baby, and induction of labour increases this risk further. There is not yet enough research to determine which method of induction is safest for a woman who has had a caesarean section before. There is also no research to say whether it is better for these women and their babies to have an elective caesarean section instead of being induced.  Criticisms of induction  Induced labor may be more painful for the woman as one of the side effects of intravenous oxytocin is increased contraction pains, mainly due to the rigid onset.National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, \\"CG70 Induction of labour: NICE guideline\\", July 2008, retrieved 2012-04-10 This may lead to the increased use of analgesics and other pain-relieving pharmaceuticals.Vernon, David, Having a Great Birth in Australia, Australian College of Midwives, 2005, These interventions may also lead to an increased likelihood of caesarean section delivery for the baby. However, studies into this matter show differing results. One study indicated that while overall caesarean section rates from 1990–1997 remained at or below 20 per cent, elective induction was associated with a doubling of the rate of Caesarean section. Another study showed that elective induction in women who were not post-term increased a woman's chance of a C-section by two to three times. A more recent study indicated that induction may increase the risk of caesarean section if performed before the 40th week of gestation, but it has no effect or actually lowers the risk if performed after the 40th week.A Gülmezoglu et al, Induction of labor for improving birth outcomes for women at or beyond term, 2009, The Cochrane Library, A 2014 systematic review and meta analysis on the subject of induction and its effect on cesarean section indicate that after 41 weeks of gestation there is a reduction of cesarean deliveries when the labour is induced. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices labeled pitocin a \\"high-alert medication\\" because of the high likelihood of \\"significant patient harm when it is used in error.\\"The Institute for Safe Medication Practices Results Of ISMP Survey On High-Alert Medications: Differences Between Nursing, Pharmacy, And Risk/Quality/Safety Perspectives ISMP.org.

The region has an area of and centers on the city of Hertsa. Population: History Hertza region was part of the Principality of Moldavia since its founding in the 14th century and after the union of Moldavia with Wallachia in 1859 it became part of Romania, which gained its formal independence in 1877. The region was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, and was added to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was recaptured by Romania in 1941 in the course of Axis attack on the Soviet Union in the Second World War, but was recaptured again by the Soviet Army in 1944. The annexation was confirmed by the Paris Peace Treaties in 1947 between the USSR and the Communist Romania. The fact that neither the secret protocol (appendix) of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which specified the expansionist claims of both sides, nor the June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum demanding from Romania the adjacent territory of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia included Hertsa makes the capture by the Soviets especially controversial.Din istoria Ţinutului HerţaCum ne-a luat Molotov Bucovina şi Ţinutul Herţei Furthermore, unlike Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the region had not been a part of Imperial Russia or Austria-Hungary before World War I, but had been a part of Romania and one of its predecessor states, Moldavia, before that. In 1962, the region was merged into the Hlybotskyi Raion, and in 1991, was reinstated again. Demographics In 1930, the region had a population of 30,082, of which 27,919 (92.8%) Romanians, 1,931 (6.4%) Jews and 232 (0.8%) people of other ethnicities. In 2001, the population of Hertsaivskyi Raion was 32,316, of which 91.4% Romanians, 5.0% Ukrainians, 2.3% Moldovans, 0.9% Russians and 0.3% of other ethnicities (see: Ukrainian Census, 2001).

It has a population of 2,851 (1 January 2009), and is located in the very eastern tip of the Betuwe, 2 km to the south of Huissen, between the cities of Arnhem and Nijmegen. Angeren is first mentioned as Angrina in a document dated 814 or 815. By 1160 Angeren was an independent parish. During the Middle Ages, Angeren grew to a village with a village square, a fortification ('Het Roode Wald') and a flour mill. The symbol of Angeren is Het Keuje ('The Pig') and there is a small statue of it in the center of the town. The symbol refers to the historic dependency of Angeren on agriculture (mainly pig farms). The local football club is S.V. Angeren. Their first squad plays in the 3rd division (Sunday amateurs – Eastern Region KNVB). The local tennis club is called TV Angeren. Angeren is located at the Linge, a small river that springs up in the nearby town of Doornenburg, and the Pannerdens Kanaal, a canal linking the Waal and the Nederrijn. The freight train route Betuwelijn (opened in 2007) passes Angeren and crosses the Pannerdens Kanaal via a tunnel. Construction of the train route caused considerable protest in the village: on 4 April 2000 for example, a house that needed to be demolished was occupied by protesters who sat on the roof before being forced off by police. This event caused substantial media coverage.

He briefly served as acting president of California Institute of Technology (Caltech). A graduate of the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the 1930s where he studied physics, he followed George Volkoff, who was a year ahead of him, to the University of California, Berkeley, where he was accepted as a graduate student by Robert Oppenheimer, the leading theoretical physicist in the United States at that time. Christy received his doctorate in 1941 and joined the physics department of Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1942 he joined the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where he was recruited by Enrico Fermi to join the effort to build the first nuclear reactor, having been recommended as a theory resource by Oppenheimer. When Oppenheimer formed the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, Christy was one of the early recruits to join the Theory Group. Christy is generally credited with the insight that a solid sub-critical mass of plutonium could be explosively compressed into supercriticality, a great simplification of earlier concepts of implosion requiring hollow shells. For this insight the solid-core plutonium model is often referred to as the \\"Christy pit\\". After the war, Christy briefly joined the University of Chicago Physics department before being recruited to join the Caltech faculty in 1946 when Oppenheimer decided it was not practical for him to resume his academic activities. He stayed at Caltech for his academic career, serving as Department Chair, Provost and Acting President. In 1960 Christy turned his attention to astrophysics, creating some of the first practical computation models of stellar operation. For this work Christy was awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1967. In the 1980s and 1990s Christy participated in the National Research Council's Committee on Dosimetry, an extended effort to better understand the actual radiation exposure due to the bombs dropped on Japan, and on the basis of that learning, better understand the medical risks of radiation exposure. Early life Robert Frederick Cohen was born on May 14, 1916 in Vancouver, British Columbia, the son of Moise Jacques Cohen, an electrical engineer, and his wife Hattie Alberta née Mackay, a school teacher. He was named Robert after his maternal great uncle Robert Wood, and Frederick after Frederick Alexander Christy, the second husband of his maternal grandmother. He had an older brother, John, who was born in 1913. Moise changed the family surname to Christy by deed poll on August 31, 1918. On November 4, Moise was accidentally electrocuted at work. Hattie died after goitre surgery in 1926. Christy and his brother were then cared for by Robert Wood, their grandmother Alberta Mackay, and their great aunt Maud Mackay. Christy was educated at Magee High School, and graduated in 1932 with the highest examination score in the province of British Columbia. He was awarded the Governor General's Academic Medal, and, importantly in view of his family's limited ability to pay, free tuition to attend the University of British Columbia (UBC). At the award dinner he met the second-place winner, Dagmar Elizabeth von Lieven, whom he dated while at UBC. He received his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in mathematics and physics with first class honors in 1935, and his Master of Arts (MA) degree in 1937, writing a thesis on \\"Electron attachment and negative ion formation in oxygen\\". George Volkoff, a friend of Christy who was a year ahead of him at UBC, was accepted as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, by Robert Oppenheimer, who led the most active school of theoretical physics in the United States at that time. This inspired Christy to apply to the University of California as well. He was accepted, and was awarded a fellowship for his first year. At Berkeley he shared an apartment with Volkoff, Robert Cornog, Ken McKenzie and McKenzie's wife Lynn McKenzie. For his thesis, Oppenheimer had him look at mesotrons, subatomic particles called muons today that then recently been found in cosmic rays. They were so-called because they were larger than electrons but smaller than protons. With the help of Shuichi Kusaka he performed detailed calculations of the particle's spin. He published two papers on mesotrons with Kusaka in the Physical Review, which formed the basis of his 1941 Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis Manhattan Project Robert Christy's wartime Los Alamos security badge Christy could have graduated in 1940, but could not then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This brought him to the attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942. A model of a Christy pit Enrico Fermi and his team from Columbia University arrived at the University of Chicago in January 1942 as part of an effort to concentrate the Manhattan Project's reactor work at the new Metallurgical Laboratory. Fermi arranged with Wigner for Christy to join his group, which was building a nuclear reactor, which Fermi called a \\"pile\\", in the squash court under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. Construction began on November 6, 1942, and Christy was present when Chicago Pile-1 went critical on December 2. In early 1943, Christy joined Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he became an American citizen in 1943 or 1944. Hans Bethe, the head of T (Theoretical) Division, detailed his physicists to assist with the projects at the laboratory. With his knowledge of reactors, Christy's assignment was to help Donald W. Kerst's Water Boiler group. The Water Boiler was an aqueous homogeneous reactor intended as a laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and the effect of various tamper materials. It was the first reactor to use enriched uranium as a fuel, and the first to use liquid fuel in the form of soluble uranium sulfate dissolved in water. Christy estimated that it would require of pure uranium-235, a figure he subsequently revised to . When the reactor went critical on May 9, 1944 with , the accuracy of Christy's figures raised the laboratory's confidence in T Division's calculations. The discovery by Emilio Segrè's group in April and May 1944 of high levels of plutonium-240 in reactor-produced plutonium meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, but studies indicated that this would be extremely difficult to achieve. By August 1944, the calculations had been made of how an ideal spherical implosion would work; the problem was how to make it work in the real world where jets and spalling were a problem. Christy worked in Rudolf Peierls's T-1 Group, which studied the theory of implosion. He suggested the possibility of using a solid plutonium core that would form a critical mass when compressed. This was an ultra-conservative design that solved the problem of jets by brute force. It became known as the \\"Christy pit\\" or \\"Christy gadget\\", \\"gadget\\" being the laboratory euphemism for a bomb. However the solid pit was intrinsically less efficient than a hollow pit, and it required a modulated neutron initiator to start the chain reaction. Christy worked with Klaus Fuchs, Paul Stein and Hans Bethe to develop a suitable initiator design, which became known as an \\"urchin\\". The Gadget used in the Trinity nuclear test and the Fat Man used in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki used Christy pits. Later in life, Christy agreed to give a number of both oral history and video interviews in which he discussed his role in the Manhattan Project and latter interests. Later life An artist's conception of the Project Orion spacecraft After the war ended, Christy accepted an assistant professorship at the University of Chicago, at a salary of $5,000 per annum, twice what he had been making before the war. He moved back to Chicago in February 1946, but suitable housing was hard to find in the immediate post-war period, and Christy and his family shared a mansion with Edward Teller and his family. Before the war, Oppenheimer had spent part of each year teaching at California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Christy was one of Oppenheimer's Berkeley students who made the trip down to Pasadena, California, each year to continue studying with Oppenheimer. After the war, Oppenheimer decided that with his additional responsibilities he could no longer continue this arrangement. The head of the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at Caltech, Charles Lauritsen therefore asked Oppenheimer for the name of a theoretical physicist that he would recommend as a replacement. Oppenheimer recommended Christy. Willy Fowler then approached Christy with an offer of a full-time position at Caltech at $5,400 per annum, and Christy accepted. He remained at Caltech for the rest of his academic career. The drawback to working at Caltech was that neither Lauritsen nor Fowler was a theoretical physicist, so a heavy workload fell on Christy. This was recognised by a pay raise to $10,000 per annum in 1954. Christy joined Oppenheimer, Lauritsen and Robert Bacher, who joined the faculty at Caltech in 1949, in Project Vista, a detailed 1951 study on how Western Europe could be defended against the Soviet Union. Christy was distraught at the outcome of the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing. When he encountered Teller, who had testified against Oppenheimer, at Los Alamos in 1954, Christy publicly refused to shake Teller's hand. \\"I viewed Oppenheimer as a god\\", he later recalled, \\"and I was sure that he was not a treasonable person.\\" Asked about his relationship with Teller in 2006, Christy said: In 1956, Christy was one of a number of scientists from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with Freeman Dyson on Project Orion, the design of a spacecraft propelled by atomic bombs. RS Puppis, a Cepheid variable star. Christy explained why they pulsate. During a sabbatical year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an investigation of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars. At the time it was a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967. Christy was appointed vice president and Provost of Caltech in 1970. Under Christy and President Harold Brown Caltech expanded its humanities and added economics to allow (or perhaps to compel—undergrads were required to take 25% of their units in \\"humanities\\") students to broaden their education. He had David Morrisroe appointed as vice president for Financial Affairs, and they steered Caltech through the financially stringent 1970s. The first women were admitted as undergraduates in Fall 1970. When Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired in 1969 but refused tenure in 1974, filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Christy pressed for the case to be settled and La Belle to be given tenure. The EEOC ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle received tenure in 1979. In 1970 he became romantically involved with Inge- Juliana Sackman, a fellow physicist 26 years his junior. He divorced Dagmar in early 1971, and married Juliana on August 4, 1973. They had two daughters, Illia Juliana Lilly Christy, born in 1974, and Alexandra Roberta (Alexa) Christy, born in 1976. Christy briefly became acting President of Caltech in 1977 when Brown left to become Secretary of Defense. Christy returned to teaching after Marvin L. Goldberger became president in 1978. He became Institute Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1983, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986. Christy died on October 3, 2012. He was survived by his wife Juliana, their two daughters, Illia and Alexa, and his two sons, Peter and Ted. He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, California.

Illustration by Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale Thomas Ford (ca. 1580buried 17 November 1648) was an English composer, lutenist, viol player and poet. Life Ford was attached to the court of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of James I, who died in 1612. He was musician to the household of Prince Henry from 1610 to 1612, musician to the household of Prince Charles 1617 to 1625, and musician to Charles I from 1626 to 1642, the outbreak of the English Civil War. His will was made on 12 November 1648 and he was buried in St. Margaret's, Westminster on 17 November, but it is not known exactly when he died.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed (1954), Vol. III, p. 427 Ford wrote anthems, for three to six voices; four sacred canons; 35 partsongs; six fantasias for five parts; and a few other pieces for viols. His most important collection was probably the Musicke of Sundrie Kindes (London, 1607), which was in two parts. The first book included lute ayres, described as \\"Aries for 4 voices to the Lute, Orphorion, or Basse-viol, with a Dialogue for two Voices...\\"; the second part contained dances such as \\"Pavens, Galiards, Almaines, Toies, Jigges, Thumpes, and such like...\\" scored for combinations of viols. Many of the ayres are given in two versions: one for voice or voices and lute, and another for four equal voices. An unusual feature of his music for viol is the occasional use of a sound effect: a heavy pizzicato \\"thump...with the first and second finger of the left hand according to the direction of the pricks.\\" One of the songs from this collection, \\"Since first I saw your face\\", was set by Roger Quilter in 1942 for the Arnold Book of Old Songs. Some of his sacred music, found in two collections from 1614 and 1620, is unusual in including a basso continuo, a plainly Baroque feature which, though common on the continent by then, only made a belated appearance in England. Together with John Dowland, Ford is a chief representative of the school which preceded Henry Lawes.

Their lands were later organized as the Catholic dioceses of Chartres, Orléans and Blois, that is, the greater part of the modern departments of Eure-et-Loir, Loiret and Loir-et-Cher. The territory of the Carnutes had the reputation among Roman observers of being the political and religious center of the Gaulish nations. The chief fortified towns were Cenabum (mistakenly labeled \\"Genabum\\"), the modern Orléans, where a bridge crossed the Loire, and Autricum (or Carnutes, thus Chartres). The great annual druidic assembly mentioned by Caesar took place in one or the other of these towns. Livy's history records the legendary tradition that the Carnutes had been one of the tribes that accompanied Bellovesus in his invasion of Italy during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus.  Name  They are mentioned as Carnutes by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Livy (late-1st c. BC),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 2:35Livy. Ab Urbe Condita Libri, V:34:5 as Carnūti by Tibullus (late-1st c. BC),Tibullus. I.7.12 as Karnoútōn (Καρνούτων) and Karnoúntōn (Καρνούντων) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD),Strabo. Geōgraphiká, 4:2:3; 4:3:4 as Karnoũtai (Καρνοῦται) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD),Ptolemy. Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis, 2:8:10 and as Carnunta in the Notitia Dignitatum (5th c. AD).Notitia Dignitatum. oc 42:33 The name Carnutes probably stems from Gaulish carnon ('horn'), thus meaning 'the horned ones', ultimately from Proto-Celtic *karno ('horn, hoof'; compare with Middle Welsh carn 'hoof'). The root carn ('stone piles') has also been proposed. Carnutes is linguistically related to the Brittonic *Kornouii and the Welsh Kernyw, designating the Cornwall region. The city of Chartres, attested as Carnotum ca. 400 (Carnotis ca. 650, Cartis in 930), is named after the Gallic tribe.  History  A map of Gaul in the 1st century BC, showing the relative positions of the Celtic tribes. In the 1st century BC, the Carnutes minted coins, usually struck with dies, but sometimes cast in an alloy of high tin content called potin. Their coinage turns up in hoards well outside their home territories, in some cases so widely distributed in the finds that the place of coinage is not secure. The iconography of their numismatics includes the motifs of heads with traditional Celtic torcs; a wolf with a star; a galloping horse; and the triskelion. Many coins show an eagle with the lunar crescent, with a serpent, or with a wheel with six or four spokes, or a pentagrammatic star, or beneath a hand holding a branch with berries, holly perhaps. The wheel with four spokes forms a cross within a circle, an almost universal image since Neolithic times. Sometimes the circle is a ring of granules. Among the Celts, the ring and spokes may represent the cycle of the year divided in its four seasons, rather than the sun, which is a common meaning among cultures.\\"Monnaies\\", Vol. 15, CGB, in French See Cross. In the time of Caesar, the Carnutes were dependents of the Remi, who on one occasion interceded for them. In the winter of 58-57 BC, Caesar imposed a protectorate over the Carnutes and set up Tasgetius as his choice of king, picked from the ruling clan. Within three years, the Carnutes assassinated the puppet king. On 13 February 53 BC, the Carnutes of Cenabum massacred all the Roman merchants stationed in the town as well as one of Caesar's commissariat officers. The uprising became a general one throughout Gaul, under the leadership of Vercingetorix. Caesar burned Cenabum, where he had the men killed and women and children sold as slaves. The booty was distributed among his soldiers, an effective way of financing the conquest of Gaul. During the war that followed, the Carnutes sent 12,000 fighting men to relieve Alesia, but shared in the defeat of the Gallic army. Having attacked the Bituriges, who appealed to Caesar for assistance, they were forced to submit. Cenabum was left for years as a mass of ruins for example, with two Roman legions garrisoned there. After they had been pacified, though not Romanized, under Augustus, the Carnutes, as one of the peoples of Gallia Lugdunensis, were raised to the rank of civitas socia or foederati. They retained their self-governing institutions, and minted coins; their only obligation was for the men to render military service to the emperor. Up to the 3rd century, Autricum (later Carnutes, whence Chartres) was the capital. In 275 Aurelian refounded Cenabum, ordaining it no longer a vicus but a civitas; he named it Aurelianum or Aurelianensis urbs (which eventually became Orléans).

It is a massive HII region containing a very compact open cluster (probably a super star cluster) HD 97950. Observations NGC 3603 (left) and NGC 3576 are star formation regions in the southern Milky Way. NGC 3603 was observed by John Herschel on the 14th of March 1834 during his visit to South Africa, who remarked that it was \\"a very remarkable object...perhaps a globular cluster\\". Herschel catalogued it as nebula 3334 in his Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope, published in 1847. In 1864 the Royal Society published his General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters, where he listed it as number 2354. It was subsequently incorporated into the New General Catalogue as by J. L. E. Dreyer as NGC 3603. The central cluster was catalogued as the star HD 97950, but has long been recognised as nebulous or multiple. It was also noted for having an unusual emission spectrum and the spectral type was given as Oe in the Henry Draper Catalogue. This was later refined to WN5 + O as the emission was recognised as characteristic of a Wolf-Rayet star. Eventually, the cluster would be resolved and found to contain three of the most massive and most luminous stars known, as well as a number of luminous O class stars and many fainter stars. Features ISAAC instrument at the ANTU telescope NGC 3603 is the most massive visible cloud of glowing gas and plasma, known as a H II region, in the Milky Way. The central star cluster is the densest concentration of very massive stars known in the galaxy. Strong ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds have cleared the gas and dust, giving an unobscured view of the cluster. Three prominent Wolf-Rayet stars have been detected within the cluster, all originally unresolved and known as the single star HD 97950. The brightest of the three, HD 97950A1 (or NGC 3603-A1) is actually a pair of Wolf-Rayet stars that orbit around each other once every 3.77 days. The primary is an estimated mass , while its companion is . The star designated HD 97950B is a single star more massive and more luminous than either of the individual members of HD 97950A1. It is 2,880,000 times as luminous as the sun and 132 times as massive. NGC 3603 is visible in the telescope as a small rather insignificant nebulosity with a yellowish tinge due to the effects of interstellar absorption. In the mid-1960s, optical studies combined with radio astronomical observations showed it to be an extremely strong thermal radio source. Later observations of other galaxies introduced the concept of starburst regions, in some cases whole galaxies, of extremely rapid star formation. NGC 3603 is now considered to be such a region, and it has been compared by some authors to the larger cluster 30 Doradus, in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Sher 25, the B class supergiant on the outskirts of NGC 3603, is surrounded by ejected material in an hourglass shape similar to that found for the supernova 1987A, and this has aroused intense interest in the future evolution of stars such as Sher 25. Two of the most luminous young stars known are found within NGC 3603, but outside the central cluster. WR 42e and NGC 3603 MTT 58 both have a spectral type of O2If*/WN6 indicating an extremely massive young star. WR 42e is a possible runaway from a three-body encounter, while MTT 58 appears to still be embedded within its parental cocoon and is in a possible binary with an O3If star.

Aarfy is the plump navigator in Yossarian's B-25, noted for being oblivious to incoming flak, getting lost on missions, and his omnipresent pipe. His nickname \\"Aarfy\\" is an abbreviation of his surname, Aardvark. Character sketch =Motivation= Aarfy is a social climber looking to work his way up into high society. =Goal(s)= Aarfy befriends Nately because Nately's father is rich, and he hopes to work for him after the war. Aarfy sees himself as moral and protects well-connected women from the sexual advances of other officers, looking for any possibility of self-advance within society. \\"Old Aarfy has never paid for it\\" he often says in reference to prostitutes. He often and openly commits rape, and says he can tell which girl is \\"nice and clean\\" and which isn't. =Relationships and conflict(s)= Yossarian is constantly infuriated by Aarfy during missions, who appears to have no fear of flak and always gets in Yossarian's way when he is trying to get back to the escape hatch, away from the bombardier position in the nose. Aarfy tries to be friends with Nately, in the hope that his father will give Aarfy an important job after the war for this service. Nately realizes that Aarfy is a \\"climber,\\" though, and sees the other officers more as his friends. Aarfy helps to protect women with social connections from the sexual advances of the other officers, much to their dismay, hoping that these connections will later be of use. Unlike the other officers, Aarfy is not willing to pay for sex with a prostitute, but perversely he has no regrets when he rapes and murders the innocent maid Michaela; when asked by Yossarian why he didn't simply hire a prostitute, he repeats his common admonition that \\"Old Aarfy has never paid for it\\", and shows no remorse. =Epiphany= When Yossarian starts to convince Aarfy that he will have to pay for the rape and murder of Michaela, for the first time in the novel he loses his composure and shows fear. His fear is not realized though, as when the police arrive, they instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL and not Aarfy. His reprehensible actions are therefore vindicated and he can be satisfied that the system is there to protect him. Biographical summary =Actions in \\"Catch-22\\"= On Mission During dangerous missions Yossarian always shouts at Aarfy to get out of the way so he can get to the escape hatch. Aarfy always replies that he can not hear him, infuriating Yossarian even more, and no matter how loud Yossarian shouts, Aarfy never can hear him (except when he says \\"never mind\\"). On one mission Yossarian gets so upset he punches Aarfy, but to no effect as his body fat absorbs all the blows. Yossarian's frustration with Aarfy is never vented and he always gives up, leaving Aarfy to carry on regardless. He nearly gets himself and his comrades killed several times while getting lost on mission: *Over Ferrara, when Yossarian went round a second time to bomb the bridge and Kraft and his plane's crew were killed. *On a milk run to Parma, where Aarfy led the planes over the city of Livorno and Yossarian got hit in the leg by flak. *With Colonel Cathcart, where the plane almost got shot down. Aarfy is so heedless of his own personal safety and the well-being of others that it always astounds him when they become angry at him. Social Climbing Aarfy throughout the novel tries to befriend Nately, as a means of getting in favor with his wealthy father: :\\"he had already fallen truly in love with Nately's father and the prospect of working for him after the war in some executive capacity as a reward for befriending Nately.\\" The irony is that Nately actually sees his friends as Yossarian, Orr, Hungry Joe, and Dunbar whom his parents would not be impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as a “climber”. The girls upstairs and the cameo woman – protects them from the sexual advances of the officers, not for his own pleasure, but because he sees them as women connected to important men who could help him out after the war. Fraternity Life Aarfy views women as purely a means to an end, whether it is for sex or for social connections. He advises Nately that if he wants to keep his prostitute in the apartment in Rome one night, then pay for them to stay till after curfew and then they will be obliged to stay and do what ever they want. He gives an example when he has done this before in his fraternity days: :“I remember one day we tricked two dumb high-school girls from town into the fraternity house and made them put out for all the fellows there who wanted them by threatening to call up their parents and say they were putting out for us. We kept them trapped in bed for more than ten hours. We even smacked their faces a little when they started to complain. Then we took away their nickels and dimes and chewing gum and threw them out.” Michaela Toward the end of the novel, Aarfy rapes and murders a maid, Michaela, while on leave in Rome. This inadvertently forms the emotional center of the novel. When an aghast Yossarian tells him that he will be arrested and possibly executed, Aarfy laughs dismissively that no one would do that to \\"good old Aarfy\\": > :\\"But I only raped her once!\\" he explained. :Yossarian was aghast. \\"But you > killed her, Aarfy! You killed her!\\" :\\"Oh, I had to do that after I had raped > her,\\" Aarfy replied in his most condescending manner. \\"I couldn't very well > let her go around saying bad things about us, could I?\\" :\\"But why did you > have to touch her at all, you dumb bastard?\\" Yossarian shouted. \\"Why > couldn't you get yourself a girl off the street if you wanted one? The city > is full of prostitutes.\\" :\\"Oh, no, not me,\\" Aarfy bragged. \\"I never paid for > it in my life.\\" His insouciant view is vindicated when the police arriving on the scene show no interest in Aarfy and instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL. Major themes =Catch-22= Yossarian's frustration with Aarfy during missions is analogous to his frustration with \\"Catch-22,\\" whereby no matter how loud he shouts or hard he fights he can not affect Aarfy, who carries on regardless. Similarly one can not fight \\"Catch-22.\\" Aarfy's character exemplifies the perversity of a society and culture governed by Catch-22s that ultimately serve to protect the powerful. Other, more considerate members of the squadron suffer ignominious or horrible fates while he—merely oblivious and inconsiderate for most of the novel—faces no negative consequences even when his self-absorption drives him to murder. In his reactions to flak, and to rape and murder, Aarfy demonstrates complete insanity. Hence he survives and prospers in a completely insane world. =Attitude towards women= Unlike the other officers, most notably Yossarian and Hungry Joe, Aarfy does not outwardly show any signs of lust in the novel. He generally sees women as objects of distaste (as in the prostitutes the officers pay for) or as a means for social climbing. Although he believes that he is showing them due courtesy, he is not actually respecting these women for who they are, but just using them as a means to an end.  Portrayals  In Mike Nichols' 1970 film adaptation of the novel, Aarfy is played by Charles Grodin. In the 2019 Hulu miniseries, he is played by Rafi Gavron.

He served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Manitoba legislature from 1988 to 2003. Although the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party was in power for most of this period, Helwer was never appointed to a cabinet position (though he did serve as Party Whip at one point). Helwer was born in Selkirk, Manitoba. He worked as an Esso agent from 1963 to 1974, and was a Macleod Authorized Dealer from 1974 to 1983. From 1976 to 1996, he was also the owner of a small business called Rockwood Farm Supplies. Helwer served as a municipal councillor in Teulon from 1969 to 1973 and 1977 to 1980, and was the town's Mayor from 1980 to 1988. He was also chair of the Hunter Hospital Board from 1977 to 1987. Helwer first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, losing to New Democratic Party incumbent John Bucklaschuk by about 950 votes in the riding of Gimli. In the 1988 election (called after the NDP government lost a budget vote and held during a period of unpopularity for the party), Helwer defeated Bucklaschuk by about 1400 votes to win the riding. Helwer was re-elected easily in the 1990 election, and was able to defeat NDP challenger Fran Frederickson by about 1800 votes in 1995.

Instead, the style is defined in an external style sheet file using a style sheet language such as CSS or XSLT. This design approach is identified as a \\"separation\\" because it largely supersedes the antecedent methodology in which a page's markup defined both style and structure. The philosophy underlying this methodology is a specific case of separation of concerns. Benefits Separation of style and content has advantages,Why use CSS? - Web developer guide MDNWhy Use CSS in Website Design but has only become practical after improvements in popular web browsers' CSS implementations. =Speed= Overall, users experience of a site utilising style sheets will generally be quicker than sites that don’t use the technology. ‘Overall’ as the first page will probably load more slowly – because the style sheet AND the content will need to be transferred. Subsequent pages will load faster because no style information will need to be downloaded – the CSS file will already be in the browser’s cache. =Maintainability= Holding all the presentation styles in one file can reduce the maintenance time and reduces the chance of error, thereby improving presentation consistency. For example, the font color associated with a type of text element may be specified — and therefore easily modified — throughout an entire website simply by changing one short string of characters in a single file. The alternate approach, using styles embedded in each individual page, would require a cumbersome, time consuming, and error-prone edit of every file. =Accessibility= Sites that use CSS with either XHTML or HTML are easier to tweak so that they appear similar in different browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc.). Sites using CSS \\"degrade gracefully\\" in browsers unable to display graphical content, such as Lynx, or those so very old that they cannot use CSS. Browsers ignore CSS that they do not understand, such as CSS 3 statements. This enables a wide variety of user agents to be able to access the content of a site even if they cannot render the style sheet or are not designed with graphical capability in mind. For example, a browser using a refreshable braille display for output could disregard layout information entirely, and the user would still have access to all page content. =Customization= If a page's layout information is stored externally, a user can decide to disable the layout information entirely, leaving the site's bare content still in a readable form. Site authors may also offer multiple style sheets, which can be used to completely change the appearance of the site without altering any of its content. Most modern web browsers also allow the user to define their own style sheet, which can include rules that override the author's layout rules. This allows users, for example, to bold every hyperlink on every page they visit. =Consistency= Because the semantic file contains only the meanings an author intends to convey, the styling of the various elements of the document's content is very consistent. For example, headings, emphasized text, lists and mathematical expressions all receive consistently applied style properties from the external style sheet. Authors need not concern themselves with the style properties at the time of composition. These presentational details can be deferred until the moment of presentation. =Portability= The deferment of presentational details until the time of presentation means that a document can be easily re-purposed for an entirely different presentation medium with merely the application of a new style sheet already prepared for the new medium and consistent with elemental or structural vocabulary of the semantic document. A carefully authored document for a web page can easily be printed to a hard-bound volume complete with headers and footers, page numbers and a generated table of contents simply by applying a new style sheet. Practical disadvantages today Currently specifications (for example, XHTML, XSL, CSS) and software tools implementing these specification are only reaching the early stages of maturity. So there are some practical issues facing authors who seek to embrace this method of separating content and style. =Narrow adoption without the parsing and generation tools= While the style specifications are quite mature and still maturing, the software tools have been slow to adapt. Most of the major web development tools still embrace a mixed presentation- content model. So authors and designers looking for GUI based tools for their work find it difficult to follow the semantic web method. In addition to GUI tools, shared repositories for generalized style sheets would probably aid adoption of these methods.

It is around north of St Helens. At the 2001 Census the population of the civil parish was 8,344, reducing to 7,779 at the 2011 Census. Historically a part of Lancashire, it is unknown when Rainford was founded, but the earliest record of the village is dated 1189.http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/coffey_time/10076636.Looking_at_the_long_history_of_this_proud_Lancashire_village/ Rainford formerly constituted an urban district. History Rainford is well known for its industrial past when it was a major manufacturer of clay smoking pipes. The nearby coal mines became worked out and closed prior to the Second World War. Until the mid-1960s, it was also a location for sand excavation, for use in the glass factories of St Helens. One of the noteworthy buildings in Rainford is the Rookery, a large 17th-century manor house situated off the 'Pottery Padds'; the house was formerly a school and workhouse and has since become home to a tenant. Geography Traditional ploughing at Fir Tree Farm Rainford lies on a fertile agricultural plain and is effectively an urban island surrounded by large scale farming, mainly arable, but with some livestock herds. The village consists of two main sections – the main body of the village, centred on the parish church; and Rainford Junction, a smaller settlement which has grown up around Rainford railway station. The two parts of the village are separated by a band of farmland, although they come close to meeting at the village's north-western end. There are three smaller villages which are near to Rainford – King's Moss to the east, Crawford to the north-east and Crank to the south-east. Industry Agriculture has been a constant since time immemorial around Rainford. From the mid-17th century Rainford was a centre of clay pipe manufacture. C.J. Berry speculates that this may have been due to the prevalence of Catholics in the industry, and Rainford's history of Nonconformism and religious tolerance, in contrast to the persecution Catholics received in much of the country in the era. The type of clay used was only generally found in Devon and Cornwall, and was thus imported. The industry in the area peaked during the period c. 1800–40, in which there was little else in the village besides the clay pipe industry. Whilst other towns in the area made pipes, the industry in Rainford started earlier and continued longer. The last two pipe manufacturers retired in 1956. The clay industry continued in the area thereafter, though, with the Rainford Potteries (established 1890) making earthenware drainpipes from local clay.The Manufacture of Clay Tobacco Pipes in Rainford – Survey of a Defunct Industry, C.J. Berry, 1963 Transport Rainford Junction is so called because it contained the junction between the Liverpool & Bury Railway's Skelmersdale Branch and St Helens Railway, and is now home to the village's only railway station. The railway station is on the Kirkby – Manchester Victoria via Wigan line. Passengers wishing to travel to Liverpool must change at Kirkby onto the Merseyrail electrified line. Rainford Village railway station, located on Cross Pit Lane, served the centre of the village from 1858 until closure in 1951. It was located on the line to St Helens Shaw Street railway station. Rainford sits alongside the A570 (Rainford Bypass), a dual carriageway constructed in the late 1930s to supplant the original route running through the village centre. The A570 connects at one end to the East Lancashire Road (A580) and, at the other end, the M58 motorway. This results in excellent road links, and the village therefore has many inhabitants who commute to the nearby cities of Liverpool and Manchester and to St Helens. There are bus services in Rainford; as at November 2015 Arriva North West operate service 38 which connects the village and Rainford Junction to St Helens every 30 minutes. Evening and Sunday journeys on this service are numbered 356 and go via Crank approximately hourly. HTL Buses operate the 152 from St Helens to Rainford with a few services extended to Ormskirk. The 157 goes to Ashton and is currently operated by Cumfybus. Culture and recreation Rainford has many noted public houses, including the Bottle and Glass, the Junction Hotel, the Star Inn, the Derby Arms, the Golden Lion, and the Eagle and Child. It is also home to the George Wright Brewery. Annually the village has a festival called picnic in the park. The festival is for the Benefit of local clubs such as Rainford Rangers, the local football team, the 2018 headline was not status quo and on 1st of June 2019 the headline is due to be Carole Decker, formerly of T’Pau. Rainford Silver Band is highly regarded, and has won many contests A 'walking day' takes place every year in June and a fairground is set up behind the Golden Lion public house, in which the silver band participate. A well- supported Rainford Show is held each year in early September in the old Rainford Urban District Council offices, with competitive classes for handicrafts, flowers, vegetables, floral art, photography etc.http://www.sthelensreporter.co.uk/news/local/rainford-show-a- success-1-730542http://www.osadvertiser.co.uk/videos-photos/west-lancashire- photos/2008/09/04/hundreds-turn-out-for-rainford- show-80904-21704913/http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/9839724.It___s_showtime_for_the_village/ Religion Rainford currently has three functioning churches, with the Catholic, Church of England and United Reform denominations having one each. There is also a nondenominational chapel in nearby Crank. The area has a history of Nonconformism, and was a stronghold of Recusancy from the Reformation until the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1832.A History of Rainford Parish Church 1541–2003 Education Rainford is also noted for its schools. It currently has three primary schools and a secondary school with a large sixth form. The primary schools are Rainford Brook Lodge County Primary School, Rainford C of E Primary School and Rainford Corpus Christi Catholic Primary School. The high school and sixth form operate jointly as Rainford High Technology College, and serve to educate pupils not just from Rainford, but from throughout St. Helens and beyond. Many pupils continue to university each year. The high school has recently been partnered with Guangdong University, in southern China. Sports There is currently a golf course called the Northwest National Golf Club alongside the A570 dual carriageway. This new course contains 18 holes, a golf academy, restaurant and conference centre and was opened in the summer of 2009. Rainford also has various sports clubs; A.F.C.

It was built for the doge Francesco Foscari in 1453, and designed by the architect Bartolomeo Bon. It is now the main seat of Ca' Foscari University of Venice. The palace is located on the widest bend of the Grand Canal. Here, during the annual Regata Storica (Historical Regatta), held on the first Sunday in September, a floating wooden structure known as La Machina is placed (from this structure the Venetian authorities watch the race); this is also the site of the finishing line, and the venue for prize- giving. History Previously a Byzantine palace, known as the \\"House with the Two Towers\\", stood on the site. This was bought by the Republic of Venice in 1429 from Bernardo Giustinian, to be the residence of the vice-captain of the Republic, Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. The palace consisted of two towers flanking a lower, central block and was used for entertaining illustrious guests of the Republic, including kings and diplomats. In 1439, the palace was given to another captain, Francesco Sforza. However, In 1447, Francesco Sforza betrayed the Republic and was deprived of the residence. In 1453 the Republic of Venice regained possession of the palace and sold it by auction to the Doge of the time, Francesco Foscari; he had the palace demolished and rebuilt in late Venetian gothic style; the building was chosen by the doge for its position on the Grand Canal. Foscari immediately set about rebuilding the palace in a manner befitting his status: he moved the site of the new palace forward on to the bank of the Grand Canal. Buying and rebuilding the palace for himself meant for the doge affirming his political and military role: he actually represented the continuity of the military successes of that period, lasted 30 years, and was the promoter of the Venetian expansion in the mainland (terraferma). The huge new palace could hardly have been finished when Foscari was disgraced in 1457 and retired to his new home until his death. In 1574 king Henry III of France was housed in the second floor of the building. The most recent restoration of Ca' Foscari and the adjacent Palazzo Giustinian was commissioned in 2004, aiming to fulfill the new requirements of safety and practicality. Work lasted from January 2004 until the summer of 2006. Presently the palace is the headquarters of the Ca' Foscari University, which has made accessible to the public some of the most beautiful halls, such as the \\"Aula Baratto\\" and the \\"Aula Berengo\\". In 2013, thanks to a series of important technical measures for energy efficiency and thanks to the adoption of stringent environmental management practices put in place by the Ca' Foscari University, the building obtained the LEED certificate for sustainability, thus becoming the oldest building in the world to acquire this prestigious certification. Description Ca' Foscari, view from across the canal, Venice, Italy. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection Ca' Foscari is a typical example of the residence of the Venetian nobles and merchants. The structure is one of the most imposing buildings of the city and its external courtyard is the biggest courtyard of a private house after that of the Doge's Palace. In common with other palaces, Ca' Foscari's principal and most decorated facade and entrance faced the Grand Canal - the city's main thoroughfare. This façade is characterized by a rhythmic sequence of arches and windows; this style, known as Floral Gothic, is emulated throughout the city and can be identified through the use of pointed arches and carved window heads. At Ca' Foscari, the tops of each column are decorated with carved quatrefoil patterns; the Gothic capitals are adorned with foliage, animals and masks. Above the Gothic window is a marble frieze with a helmet surmounted by a lion couchant representing the role of the doge as the captain of the republic; at each side of the central helmet we can find two putti holding a shield symbolising the Foscari's coat of arms with the winged lion of Saint Mark, symbol of Venice. The practical function of Venetian palaces differed from those in other Italian cities. The nobility did not derive their income from landed estates as elsewhere, but from seafaring and trade. As a result, their \\"fondaco\\" houses had to serve not only as residences but also as the headquarters for their trading ventures. The main features of these early palaces were two-storey arcades or loggias along the waterfront; on the ground floor was a portal for loading and unloading merchandise. The portal often led into an entrance hall or \\"portico\\" used for business negotiations, with storerooms and offices on either side and a kitchen at the back. The living quarters were upstairs, with the rooms leading off great T-shaped central room; a well and an open staircase were placed in the courtyard. There were low towers at each end of the façade. The House of the two Towers too used to have this structure, before Francesco Foscari decided to destroy it and rebuild it in Gothic style. The ground floor was used as storerooms; the first and second floors (\\"piani nobili\\") were used for formal entertaining and private residential use respectively. The central loggia of these two principal floors are designed in a similar Venetian floral Gothic style to the better known arcade of the Doge's Palace. The loggias, tied one above the other, are now glazed and light the large halls behind. The loggias are flanked by wings each of two bays containing smaller rooms. View on the Grand Canal from the second floor of Ca' Foscari Uses of the building After the death of Francesco Foscari in 1457, the palace was used for various and different purposes, according to the epoch. Some dates for events and particular uses of the building: *1513 The wedding party of Federico Foscari and the daughter of Giovanni Venier took place in the palace *1516 the palace was divided between the heirs of the Foscari family and used to give hospitality to European kings calling at Venice. *1661 the heirs of the Foscari family resumed possession of the palace and went to live there again, while renting part of the building to the Duke of Brunswick *1698 Peter I of Russia, received hospitality in secrecy *1790 Francesco Foscari (son of Sebastiano Foscari, not to be mistaken with the doge who gave the name to the palace) died: he was the last member of the family to live in the palace *1811 amateur actors used the building as a theatre *1835 the building was used by indigent citizens, painters (for the beautiful view on the Grand Canal) and shopkeepers (as storeroom for their stuff) *1848 The palace was used as a barracks by the army of Daniele Manin *1849 During the bombing of Venice by the Austrians the palace gave hospitality to poor families and afterwards used as a barracks by the Austrian army *1868 the palace became the seat of the University Ca' Foscari of Venice =The portal= The portal of Ca' Foscari is today the main entrance of the building and was restored in 2008. It is made of Istrian marble, is of rectangular shape, it is surmounted by a lunette; on its perimeter it is decorated with chequered patterns. The coat of arms inside the lunette is composed of a central blazon and three putti (one on each side and one on the top); inside the blazon is depicted the winged lion of St. Mark holding an open book. In 1797, following the forced surrender of Venice and overthrow of the Republic by General Bonaparte, family blazons were abolished; consequently, they were hidden, taken down or, as at Ca' Foscari, covered with whitewash. =Entrance hall= The entrance hall was restored in 1936 by the great Italian architect Carlo Scarpa. On that occasion Scarpa designed: *the glass wall entrance, which reminds the window of the great hall on the second floor *the benches (with the typical T-shape pattern present in other works by Carlo Scarpa) *the handrail of the nineteenth-century stairway *the lamps 19th-century lantern in the palace =Mario Baratto Hall= Ca' Foscari-Aula Baratto The great hall dedicated to Mario Baratto (a professor of Italian literature and antifascist, who died in 1984) is situated on the second floor (the piano nobile) of the palace. The room is used today for conferences, conventions, formal ceremonies, advanced training courses and important events of Ca’ Foscari University. Scarpa designed the Great Hall in order to replace the Museum of Commerce. A massive portal with the Latin inscription ″STUDIA DECUS ORNAMENTUMQUE VITAE″ introduces the hall. The most relevant features of the rooms are represented by: *the interventions made by Carlo Scarpa (the window, the boiserie and the footboard); *the two frescos painted by Mario Sironi e Mario De Luigi, which date back to 1936-1937; *the view on the largest bend of the Grand Canal. In 1979 a fire destroyed part of the room and consequently the architect Valeriano Pastor restored the room and the boiserie. After the fire the boiserie of Scarpa was in a very deteriorated state. Valeriano Pastor, student of Scarpa, restored it together with the same craftsman that worked with Scarpa in 1956. Between 1935 and 1937 Mario Sironi was asked by the rector Agostino Lanzillo to decorate the Great Hall of Ca’ Foscari. He was chosen because he was considered an artist able to convey the faith and the fervor of the Italian Fascist youth of that period. The Italy, Venice and Studies fresco includes a student athlete holding a book and a musquet, the allegory of Technique, the allegory of Medicine, the city of Venice sitting on a throne, the lion of St. Mark and the domes of the basilica. It also shows a figure in chains called Motherland, which represents the victory of Italy in Ethiopia. There is an inscription over the Motherland figure: “Italy will do by itself”; it refers to the autarky pursued by Italy and to its ambition to become an imperial power. The second painting represents the school of philosophers. In the middle there is the thinker surrounded by his students. The painting presents traces of cubism, but there is also the three-dimensional element. The painting recalls Pablo Picasso's and Juan Gris's artistic style and Georges Braque's emphasis on colors. In 2004 the room was restored once more, this time as part of the general restoration of the entire building. The craftsmen who had worked with Carlo Scarpa were called upon for the restoration of the boiserie and it was on this occasion that the chairs now present in the room were made. =Interventions by Carlo Scarpa= In 1936 Carlo Scarpa restored and remodeled various parts of the university, including the great hall. In 1956 Scarpa was asked to return to Ca' Foscari to transform the great hall into a lecture hall, and on this occasion he created the boiserie elements. Before the intervention of the architect, the space now occupied by the great hall was used to house a museum of the Faculty of Economics. Scarpa's project for the great hall included: The Great hall Mario Baratto: a detail * the window frame (made of glass and wood) in front of the 15th-century gothic window (polifora) * the wooden platform with the slab of marble with a Latin inscription and the two pedestals * the wooden tribune * the marble portal with a Latin inscription Ca' Foscari: boiserie designed by Carlo Scarpa Scarpa removed the student tribune and designed the boiserie panelling, using part of the same wood employed for the student gallery. The boiserie is both a connection and a separation between the room and the corridor. Its sliding cloth-covered frames are used to conceal the room, and when they're closed they remind the ogive of the gothic window. The image of the gothic window is mirrored on the glass of the boiserie, with notable light effects. =Frescoes= Venezia, l'Italia e gli Studi, by Mario Sironi Mario Sironi was commissioned to decorate the great hall Mario Baratto in 1936. The painting portrays a series of allegorical figures: *the student athlete (emblem of the Fascist University Groups) holding a book and a musket; *the winged lion emblem of the Republic of Venice; *the domes of the St Mark's Basilica; *the allegory of Technique (the woman leaning against a wheel); *the allegory of Medicine (the woman with the caduceus); *Venice (the woman on the throne holding a plate depicting Ca' Foscari); *the Homeland (which represents the victory of Italy against Ethiopia). La scuola, by Mario De Luigi Mario De Luigi was a close friend of Carlo Scarpa; they both attended the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice and they worked together in the field of design and town planning; he was assistant of Arturo Martini at the Academy, then he started teaching scenography at University IUAV of Venice. De Luigi was asked to decorate a room on the first floor of Ca' Foscari palace; afterwards the painting was moved to the second floor, in the great hall Mario Baratto. The painting portrays a philosopher among his students. 16th-century decorated ceiling in the palace See also * University Ca' Foscari of Venice * Francesco Foscari * Carlo Scarpa * Villa Foscari References Sources * Marcello Brusegan.

The original flavours include: strawberry, lemon, orange, and cherry (changed from the initial lime). The tropical flavours include: strawberry banana, pineapple, mango melon, cherry and kiwi. History The brand was introduced by Mars in the UK in 1960, named Opal Fruits by Peter Phillips (known as Peter Pfeffer at the time), the winner of a competition that won him £5. The four original flavours were strawberry, lemon, orange, and lime. Opal Fruits were introduced in the United States in 1967 as M&M;'s Fruit Chewies and later, in the late 1960s, Starburst. Originally, Starburst came in the same flavours as Opal Fruits. Subsequently, its first variant, \\"Sunshine Flavors\\", was released and was later renamed \\"Tropical Opal Fruits\\". In Europe, lemon and lime were combined to become \\"Lemon and lime\\" to make room for a blackcurrant flavour. The brand name Opal Fruits was phased out in the UK, followed by Ireland in 1998 in order to standardise the product in a globalised marketplace. In 2008, however, the supermarket chain Asda revived the original Opal Fruits in the UK for a period of 12 weeks starting 10 May 2008. On 6 October 2008, Mars acquired Wrigley and it transferred Mars' non- chocolate candy brands, including Starburst, to the Wrigley subsidiary. The original flavours are now branded \\"Original Fruits\\", and Starburst now comes in several assortments: FaveREDs, Limited Edition Retro Fruits, Tropical, Baja California, Sour, Strawberry Mix, Berries and Creme, Very Berry and Fruity Slushies. Among the additional flavours are Strawberry Lemonade, Strawberry- Banana, Blue Raspberry, Blue Raspberry Rush, Cherry Splash, Citrus Slush, Kiwi, Banana, Plum, Passion Fruit, Mango, Blueberry, Blackberry, Raspberry, Melon, Watermelon, Tropical Punch, Green Apple, Orange Cream, Mixed Berries and Cream, Peaches and Cream, and Strawberry and Cream. Europe and the United States also has the \\"Sour\\" assortment, which includes Apple, Cherry, Pineapple and Raspberry, as well as Strawberry Mix. Starburst in the UK is vegan, its packaging and website clearly stating \\"Suitable for Vegetarians\\", and also does not contain any artificial colours or flavours. In the US, Starburst contains non-vegetarian gelatin in its ingredients. The UK 'Opal Fruits' limited edition branding Lime Starburst made a comeback in 2007 as a limited- edition \\"retro\\" flavour in packages of the \\"Baja\\" version, while the range in the UK was further extended with a version named Starburst Choozers. These lozenge shaped chews have a liquid fruit juice centre, and come packaged with the tag line \\"The chews that ooze.\\" Each packet contains three flavours; Orange & Mango, Raspberry & Orange, and Pineapple & Orange. As of August 2016, the advertising slogan for Starburst is \\"Unexplainably Juicy\\". During March 2020, the Opal Fruits name was revived again for a limited period in the UK with a 152g bag available in Poundland and Dealz stores initially.https://www.heart.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/opal-fruits- comeback-22-years-starburst/ Marketing In the 1970s, Opal Fruits were well known in the UK for their advertising tag line \\"Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!\\" (slogan coined by Murray Walker). The full advertising jingle was \\"Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water/Fresh with the tang of citrus/four refreshing fruit flavours/orange, lemon, strawberry, lime/Opal Fruits—made to make your mouth water!\\" Starburst has been marketed in several ways, including a marketing tie-in for the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest where they replaced Kiwi Banana and Tropical Punch with Royal Berry Punch. In 2007, a commercial for Starburst's Berries and Creme flavour went viral. The commercial, referred to as \\"Berries and Creme\\" or as \\"The Little Lad Dance\\", stars Jack Ferver as a man dressed in Victorian/Georgian clothing expressing his excitement for the candy's flavour by performing an impromptu song and dance routine. The commercial received praise for its style from Advertising Age. In an interview with Adweek Ferver commented that the commercial took over 12 hours to film and that he had to wear the full costume in 80 degree weather. Other varieties Starburst also exists in the form of candy corn, popsicles, gum, candy canes, jelly beans, lip gloss (in a partnership with Lip Smackers), and yogurt (by Yoplait in 2019 as a flavour).

A starburst is an astrophysical process that involves star formation occurring at a rate that is large compared to the rate that is typically observed. This starburst activity will consume the available interstellar gas supply over a timespan that is much shorter than the lifetime of the galaxy. For example, the nebula NGC 6334 has a star formation rate estimated to be 3600 Solar Masses per million years compared the star formation rate of the entire Milky Way of about seven million solar masses per million years. Due to the high amount of star formation a starburst is usually accompanied by much higher gas pressure and a larger ratio of hydrogen cyanide to carbon monoxide emission-lines than are usually observed. Tarantula Nebula, the largest starburst region in the local group. Starburst can occur in entire galaxies or just regions of space. A starburst region is a region of space that is undergoing a large amount of star formation. For example, the Tarantula Nebula is a nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud which has one of the highest star formation rates in the Local Group. By contrast, a starburst galaxy is an entire galaxy that is experiencing a very high star formation rate. One notable example being Messier 82 in which the gas pressure is 100 times greater than in the local neighborhood and it is forming stars at about the same rate as the Milky Way in a region about 600 parsecs across. At this rate M82 will consume its 200 million solar masses of atomic and molecular hydrogen in 100 mega years (its free-fall time). Starburst regions can occur in different shapes, for example in Messier 94 the inner ring is a star burst region. Messier 82 has a starburst core of about 600 parsec in diameter. Starbursts are common during galaxy mergers such as the Antennae Galaxies. In the case of mergers, the starburst can either be local or galaxy wide depending on the galaxies and how they are merging.

The units are length2 time−2, i.e. velocity squared, or energy per mass. Every object in a 2-body ballistic trajectory has a constant specific orbital energy \\\\epsilon equal to the sum of its specific kinetic and specific potential energy: :\\\\epsilon = \\\\frac{1}{2} v^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r} = \\\\text{constant} = \\\\frac{1}{2} C_3, where \\\\mu = GM is the standard gravitational parameter of the massive body with mass M, and r is the radial distance from its center. As an object in an escape trajectory moves outward, its kinetic energy decreases as its potential energy (which is always negative) increases, maintaining a constant sum. Note that C3 is twice the specific orbital energy \\\\epsilon of the escaping object. Non-escape trajectory A spacecraft with insufficient energy to escape will remain in a closed orbit (unless it intersects the central body), with :C_3 = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{a} < 0 where :\\\\mu = GM is the standard gravitational parameter, :a is the semi-major axis of the orbit's ellipse. If the orbit is circular, of radius r, then :C_3 = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r} Parabolic trajectory A spacecraft leaving the central body on a parabolic trajectory has exactly the energy needed to escape and no more: :C_3 = 0 Hyperbolic trajectory A spacecraft that is leaving the central body on a hyperbolic trajectory has more than enough energy to escape: :C_3 = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{|a|} > 0 where :\\\\mu = GM is the standard gravitational parameter, :a is the semi-major axis of the orbit's hyperbola (which may be negative in some convention). Also, :C_3 = v_\\\\infty^2 where v_\\\\infty is the asymptotic velocity at infinite distance. Spacecraft's velocity approaches v_\\\\infty as it is further away from the central object's gravity. Examples MAVEN, a Mars-bound spacecraft, was launched into a trajectory with a characteristic energy of 12.2 km2/s2 with respect to the Earth.Atlas V set to launch MAVEN on Mars mission, nasaspaceflight.com, 17 November 2013. When simplified to a two-body problem, this would mean the MAVEN escaped Earth on a hyperbolic trajectory slowly decreasing its speed towards \\\\sqrt{12.2}\\\\text{ km/s} = 3.5\\\\text{ km/s}. However, since the Sun's gravitational field is much stronger than Earth's, the two-body solution is insufficient. The characteristic energy with respect to Sun was negative, and MAVEN – instead of heading to infinity – entered an elliptical orbit around the Sun. But the maximal velocity on the new orbit could be approximated to 33.5 km/s by assuming that it reached practical \\"infinity\\" at 3.5 km/s and that such Earth-bound \\"infinity\\" also moves with Earth's orbital velocity of about 30 km/s.

Pacifiers normally have three parts, an elongated teat, a mouth shield, and a handle. The mouth shield is large enough to prevent the child from attempting to take the pacifier into its mouth, and so forecloses the danger that the child will swallow then choke on it. Pacifiers have many different informal names: binky (American English), dummy (British English and Australian English), soother (Canadian English), and Dodie. History Baby Comforter design – 1900 Pacifiers were mentioned for the first time in medical literature in 1473, being described by German physician Bartholomäus Metlinger in his book Kinderbüchlein, in later editions retitled Regiment der jungen Kinder (\\"Caring For Young Children\\").

The AAP suggests avoiding pacifiers for the first month. Introducing a pacifier can lead to the infant ineffectively sucking at the breast and causing \\"nipple confusion\\". Babies will take their suck out on the pacifier instead of nursing or comfort nursing at the breast which is good for the infant's brain development and the mother's supply. Evidence in premature infants or infants that are not healthy is lacking but shows that it can have benefits. It may have clinical benefits for preterm babies, such as helping them progress from tube to bottle feeding. Infants who use pacifiers may have more ear infections (otitis media). The effectiveness of avoiding the use of a pacifier to prevent ear infections is not known. Although it is commonly believed that using a pacifier will lead to dental problems, if the pacifier is used for less than around three years, it does not appear to lead to long-term damage. However, prolonged use of a pacifier or other non-nutritive sucking habit (such as finger or blanket sucking) has been found to lead to malocclusion of the teeth, that is teeth sticking out or not meeting properly when they bite together. This is a common problem and the dental (orthodontic) treatment to correct it can take a long time and can be expensive. A Cochrane Review of the evidence found that orthodontic braces or psychological intervention (such as positive or negative reinforcement) were effective in helping children stop sucking habits where that was necessary. An orthodontic brace that used a palatal crib design seems to have been more effective than a palatal arch design. There appears to be no strong evidence that using a pacifier delays speech development by preventing babies from practicing their speaking skills. Benefits Researchers have found that use of a pacifier is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.Report in ''Science Daily''. Sciencedaily.com (2005-12-08). Retrieved on 2013-04-14. They are divided over whether this association is sufficient reason to prefer pacifier use.

Others argue that the association is not strong enough or that the mechanism is unclear. Pacifiers have also been found to reduce infants' crying during painful procedures such as venipuncture. Some parents prefer the use of a pacifier to the child sucking their thumb or fingers. Researchers in Brazil have shown that neither \\"orthodontic\\" nor standard pacifiers prevent dental problems if children continue sucking past the age of three years. It is commonly reported anecdotally that pacifier use among stimulant users helps reduce bruxism and thus prevents tooth damage. It is also known to help infants to get to sleep and also keeps infants calm. Medical policies The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's \\"Policy on Thumb, Finger and Pacifier Habits\\" says: \\"Most children stop sucking on thumbs, pacifiers or other objects on their own between 2 and 4 years of age. However, some children continue these habits over long periods of time. In these children, the upper front teeth may tip toward the lip or not come in properly. Frequent or intense habits over a prolonged period of time can affect the way the child's teeth bite together, as well as the growth of the jaws and bones that support the teeth.\\"Thumb, Finger and Pacifier Habits. American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. aapd.org A study of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) states that \\"It seems appropriate to stop discouraging the use of pacifiers.\\" The authors recommend the use of pacifiers at nap time and bedtime throughout the first year of life. For breastfeeding mothers, the authors suggest waiting until breastfeeding is well established, typically for several weeks, before introducing the pacifier. The British Dental Health Foundation recommends: \\"If you can, avoid using a dummy and discourage thumb sucking. With prolonged use (see Drawbacks above), these can both eventually cause problems with how the teeth grow and develop. And this may need treatment with a brace when the child gets older.\\"Dental care for mother and baby. dentalhealth.org Adult pacifiers A NUK 5 pacifier Three ravers; the woman on the right has a pacifier on a string around her neck (2007) Adult-sized pacifiers, consisting of a standard baby pacifier guard but a larger, wider nipple, are used by some members of the Adult Baby community.

Since the early 2010s, there has been the advent of generic, NUK-style pacifiers on eBay, which have both adult-sized silicone nipples and adult- sized face guards and rings to match. Recent studies have also shown that pacifier use among adults may reduce or completely eliminate snoring, and can also help with anxiety and sleep. They also aid with people who have seizures in their sleep, PTSD, manic episodes and extreme cases of anxiety related excessive chewing. Baby pacifier – the best snoring remedy. Pravda, September 20, 2004 At techno parties and raves, standard children's pacifiers are a common sight, being both used and sold there; a common side effect of entactogen and stimulant drugs, often used by rave attendees, is bruxism (grinding of the teeth), which can result in damage to the teeth, mandible, or tongue. The use of dummies, or, alternatively, chewing gum, are anecdotally claimed to help prevent this. Prevalence of attachments to pacifiers and their psychological functions In the late 1970s researchers dispelled the notion that pacifiers were psychologically unhealthy and aberrant. Richard H. Passman and Jane S. Halonen at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee traced the developmental course of attachments to pacifiers and provided norms. They found that 66% of their sample of babies who were three months old in the United States demonstrated at least some attachment, according to their mothers. At six months of age, this incidence was 40%, and at nine months it was 44%. Thereafter, the rate of attachment to pacifiers dropped precipitously until, at 24 months of age and later, it was quite rare. These researchers also provided experimental support for what were then only anecdotal observations that pacifiers do indeed pacify babies. In an unfamiliar playroom, one-year-old infants accompanied by their pacifier evidenced more play and demonstrated less distress than did babies without them. The investigators concluded that pacifiers should be considered to be attachment objects, similar to other security objects like blankets. Passman and Halonen contended that the widespread occurrence of attachments to pacifiers as well as their importance as security objects should reassure parents that they are a normal part of development for a majority of infants.

The ACLJ was founded in 1990 by law school graduate and evangelical minister Pat Robertson with the stated \\"mandate to protect religious and constitutional freedoms\\". ACLJ generally pursues constitutional issues and conservative Christian ideals in courts of law. The leaders of the ACLJ also occasionally engage in public debates to present their perspective on legal and constitutional issues.

History The ACLJ arose in part as a right-leaning political answer to the American Civil Liberties Union. The name and acronym, ACLJ, was chosen to contrast with the ACLU. It has attracted much media attention for its lawsuits, such as its campaign to oppose changes to the constitution of Kenya that, according to the group, would permit abortion and Islamic law, and its attempts to block the construction of an Islamic cultural center near the former site of the World Trade Center. The ACLJ supported blocking the construction of the center through New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission. In November 2010, the ACLJ asked that the U.S. Justice Department investigate the Congressional Muslim Staffer Association's weekly prayer session on Capitol Hill, alleging that the organization demonstrated \\"a pattern of inviting Islamic extremists with ties to terrorism to participate in these events\\". In 2018, ACLJ attorney Jay Sekulow was serving on President Donald Trump's personal legal team.

Sekulow is half-owner of the for-profit corporation Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group whose governor and executive officer is Stuart Roth, one of his partners in the law firm and real estate business that declared bankruptcy in 1986. From 2011 to 2016, the ACLJ paid the group $23 million, \\"its largest outside expense.\\" Europe In 1997 Jay Sekulow and Thomas Patrick Monaghan, Chief Counsel and Senior Counsel of the ACLJ, respectively, set up the European Center for Law and Justice (ECLJ) in Strasbourg as part of the ACLJ's international strategy. Sekulow serves as Chief Counsel for the ECLJ. The following year the ACLJ set up the Slavic Center for Law and Justice (SCLJ) in Moscow. Both organizations on the European mainland have a full-time staff of religious rights attorneys.European Center for Law and Justice, About ECLJ The ECLJ is active in the United Nations Organization and in the Council of Europe, and represents the interests of some Christians in the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Africa The ACLJ is one of several American Christian groups that are promoting conservative Christian laws in Africa, supporting controversial movements regarding LGBT rights, including support in Uganda for criminalizing homosexuality. Criticism The ACLJ has been criticized by the ACLU for its stance on putting prayer in public school and by Americans United for conflating support of separation of church and state with being anti- religious. The Human Rights Campaign is critical of the ACLJ's finances citing that the organization does not meet \\"10 out of 20 of the Better Business Bureau’s standards for charity accountability\\" and that ACLJ obfuscates how much Sekulow earns from the organization.

The compound is a white crystalline salt and is transparent over a wide range of wavelengths, with commercial uses in optics that are also used in space telescopes.

Production and structure Magnesium fluoride is prepared from magnesium oxide with sources of hydrogen fluoride such as ammonium bifluoride: :MgO + (NH4)HF2 → MgF2 \\\\+ NH3 \\\\+ H2O Related metathesis reactions are also feasible. The compound crystallizes as tetragonal birefringent crystals. The structure of the compound is similar to that in rutile, featuring octahedral Mg2+ centers and 3-coordinate fluoride centres. Uses =Optics= Magnesium fluoride is transparent over an extremely wide range of wavelengths. Windows, lenses, and prisms made of this material can be used over the entire range of wavelengths from 0.120 μm (vacuum ultraviolet) to 8.0 μm (infrared). High quality synthetic VUV grade MgF2 is quite expensive, in the region of $3/kg (2007) but the real cost of optics in this material is due to relatively low volume manufacture. However, with lithium fluoride it is one of the two materials that will transmit in the vacuum ultraviolet range at 121 nm (Lyman alpha) and this is where it finds its application. Lower grade MgF2 is sometimes used in the infrared but here it is inferior to calcium fluoride. MgF2 is tough and works and polishes well, but it is slightly birefringent and should be cut with the optic axis perpendicular to the plane of the window or lens. Due to its having a suitable refractive index of 1.37, thin layers of MgF2 are very commonly used on the surfaces of optical elements as inexpensive anti- reflective coatings. The Verdet constant of (MgF2) at 632.8 nm is 0.00810arcmin/G⋅cm.J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans., 1996, 92, 2753 - 2757.

Braud 1913, pp. 77-78 (footnote 2), quotes the minutes des actes de naissance (minutes of birth certificates) of the Préfecture du département de la Seine, which read: \\"Du 29 janvier de l'an dix-huit cent quatorze, à midi un quart, acte de naissance de Marie-Cornélie, de sexe féminin, née d'hier à midi, rue de Béthizy, nº10, quartier Saint- Honoré, fille de Pierre Falcon, tailleur, et de Edmée-Cornélie Mérot, son épouse.\\" (\\"On 29 January of the year eighteen hundred fourteen, at noon and a quarter, birth certificate of Marie-Cornélie, of female sex, born yesterday at noon, Rue du Béthizy, no. 10, Saint-Honoré Quarter, daughter of Pierre Falcon, tailor, and of Edmée-Cornélie Mérot, his wife.\\"). Thus, her birth occurred at noon on 28 January 1814 and was recorded on 29 January at 12:15 p.m. Braud specifically repudiates the errors of earlier publications by Larousse and Malherbes which give the year 1812. – 25 February 1897) was a French soprano who sang at the Opéra in Paris. Her greatest success was creating the role of Valentine in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots. She possessed \\"a full, resonant voice\\"Warrack and West 1992, p. 230. with a distinctive dark timbreRobinson and Walton 2011. and was an exceptional actress. Based on the roles written for her voice her vocal range spanned from low A-flat to high D, 2.5 octaves. She and the tenor Adolphe Nourrit are credited with being primarily responsible for raising artistic standards at the Opéra, and the roles in which she excelled came to be known as \\"falcon soprano\\" parts.Robinson 1992, p. 110. She had an exceptionally short career, essentially ending about five years after her debut, when at the age of 23 she lost her voice during a performance of Niedermeyer's Stradella. Early life and training She was born Marie-Cornélie Falcon in Le Monastier sur Gazeille (Velay) to Pierre Falcon, a master-tailor and his wife Edmée-Cornélie. Falcon was one of three children; her sister Jenny Falcon was to marry a Russian nobleman and appear on the stage at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in St. Petersburg.Braud 1913, p. 77. Cornélie was enrolled at the Paris Conservatory from 1827 to 1831.Gourret 1987, p. 33. There she first studied with Felice Pellegrini and François-Louis Henry, and later with Marco Bordogni and Adolphe Nourrit. She won a second prize in solfège in 1829, a first prize in vocalization (vocalisation) in 1830, and a first prize in singing (chant) in 1831.Pierre 1900, p. 751. Debut in Robert le diable At the invitation of Nourrit she made her debut at the age of 18 at the Opéra as Alice in the 41st performance of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable (20 July 1832). The cast included Nourrit and Julie Dorus (who had premiered the role in 1830According to Desarbres 1868, p. 60, Julie Dorus alternated in the two roles of Alice and Isabelle, the flexibility of her voice enabling this vocal tour de force.). The director of the Opéra, Louis Véron, had made certain there was plenty of advance publicity, and the auditorium was packed. The audience included the composers Rossini, Berlioz, Cherubini, Halévy, and Auber, the singers Maria Malibran, Caroline Branchu, and Giulia Grisi, and two of France's greatest actresses from the Comédie- Française, Mademoiselle Mars and Mademoiselle Georges. Other audience members included the painters Honoré Daumier and Ary Scheffer, the librettist Eugène Scribe, and the critics and writers Théophile Gautier, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, and Alfred de Musset.The list of celebrities in the audience is compiled from Smart 2003, pp. 113-114, Somerset-Wild 2004, p. 172, and Braud 1913, p. 80, who also lists many others, including Benjamin Constant, Gérard de Nerval, Eugène Sue, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and Adolphe Thiers. Although understandably suffering from stage fright, Falcon managed to sing her first aria without error, and finished her role with \\"ease and competence.\\"Pitou 1990, p. 449. Her tragic demeanor and dark looks were highly appropriate to the part, and she made a vivid impression on the public.Fétis 1862, p. 179. Meyerbeer himself came to Paris to see Falcon as Alice, but after her fifth performance on 24 August she had to withdraw due to illness, and he did not get to hear her until 17 September.Pitou 1990, pp. 449–450. The following day Meyerbeer wrote to his wife: \\"The house was as full as it ever could be, 8700 francs (without subscription) and many people could not find seats. The performance was ... so fresh ... like the first performance of the work, not a trace of being played out. About Falcon I dare not reach any definite conclusion, ... only it is evident that she has a strong and beautiful voice, not without agility, at the same time that she is a vividly expressive (but somewhat overcharged) actress. Unfortunately her intonation is not completely pure, and I fear she will never overcome these weaknesses. In sum, I think that she could be an outstanding star, and I will certainly in any case write a principal role for her in my new opera.\\"Letter dated 18 September 1832 from Giacomo Meyerbeer to his wife. Quoted in Kelly 2004, p. 167, and Zimmermann 1998, p. 151. Meyerbeer's new opera would become Les Huguenots, in which Falcon was to achieve the greatest success of her career. Other early roles at the Opéra Costume design for Falcon as Amélie in Act 2 of Gustave III Her first creation at the Opéra came on 27 February 1833 when she sang Amélie in Auber's Gustave III. Ellen Creathorne Clayton has described the performance as follows: > Unfortunately, the part of the Countess Amélie, with its powder and hoops, > and pretty coquetry, was not suited to the dark and mystic style of > Cornélie. \\"Alas, Mdlle. Falcon!\\" cried Jules Janin; \\"this young creature, of > such great hopes, sang without voice, without expression, without exertion, > without energy, without point.\\" She was stifled amid the mad gayety, the > whirl of the dancers, the glare and splendor of the scenes. The singers in > Gustave indeed were \\"nowhere;\\" the dancers reigned supreme.Clayton 1865, p. > 324. Luigi Cherubini asked Falcon to create Morgiana in his new 4-act tragédie lyrique Ali Baba, ou Les quarante voleurs (Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves). The premiere was on 22 July 1833, and, as Spire Pitou tells us, \\"his invitation was more flattering than substantial, because the part of Morgiana hardly constituted a real challenge to a young and ambitious singer\\".Pitou 1990, p. 450. Falcon's next real opportunity to shine came with a new revival of Don Juan. This was a 5-act adaptation in French by Castil-Blaze, his son Henri Blaze, and Émile Deschamps of Mozart's Don Giovanni. The all-star cast included Falcon as Donna Anna and Nourrit as Don Juan with Nicolas Levasseur as Leporello, Marcellin Lafont as Don Ottavio, Prosper Dérivis as the Commandeur, Henri Dabadie as Masetto, Julie Dorus-Gras as Elvire, and Laure Cinti-Damoreau as Zerline.Chouquet 1873, p. 398. Berlioz, who must have attended a dress rehearsal, had some reservations about Falcon's performance, writing in Rénovateur (6 March 1834): > Mlle Falcon, so energetic in Robert le Diable, was physically speaking, with > her contenance \\"pale as a beautiful autumn evening\\", the ideal Donna Anna. > She had fine moments in the accompanied recitative sung over her father's > body. Why then did she all at once go off the boil in the great aria of the > first act, \\"Tu sais quel inflâme\\"? Oh! Mlle Falcon, with those black eyes of > yours and the incisive voice you possess, there is no need to be afraid. Let > your eyes flash and your voice ring out: you will be yourself, and you will > be the incarnation of the vengeful Spanish noblewoman whose principal > features your timidity veiled from us.Quoted and translated by Cairns 1999, > p. 71. Berlioz was rather more frank in a letter in which he wrote \\"my position [as a critic] has not allowed me to admit that without exception all the singers, and Nourrit most of all, are a thousand miles below their roles.\\"Quoted and translated by Cairns 1999, p. 66. Nevertheless, Falcon was admirably suited to the part, and her reception after the opening on 10 March 1834, was even more favorable than that which she had received for Alice. On 3 May 1834, Falcon sang Julia in a revival of Spontini's La vestale which was a benefit performance for Adolphe Nourrit. The cast, besides Nourrit as Licinius, included Nicolas Levasseur as Cinna, Henri Dabadie as the High Priest, and Zulmé Leroux-Dabadie as the Grand Vestal. The second act was repeated as an excerpt five more times that season.Lajarte 1878, pp. 63–64; Chouquet 1873, p. 382. Falcon's portrayal of Julia was received favorably.Kutsch and Riemens 2003, p. 1388. Concerts with Berlioz Berlioz's admiration for the singer was considerable, however, and with Véron's permission he engaged her for one of his concerts which he organized that winter in the hall of the Paris Conservatory. It was the second in the series and was presented on 23 November 1834 with Narcisse Girard conducting. Falcon sang Berlioz's new orchestrations of the songs La captive and Le Jeune Pâtrie breton, and earned an encore in which she sang an aria by Bellini. The concert also featured the premiere of Berlioz's new symphony Harold en Italie, and the audience included the Duc d'Orléans, Chopin, Liszt, and Victor Hugo. With the new symphony and Falcon as the star singer, the receipts were more than double those of the first concert on 9 November, which had featured the Symphonie fantastique and the overture Le Roi Lear.Holoman 1989, p. 163; Cairns 1999, pp. 41–42. However, La captive, and not Harold, was the hit of the show, with the Gazette Musicale (7 December 1834) calling it \\"a masterpiece of melodic skill and orchestration.\\"Holoman 1989, p. 164. The orchestration of La captive has unfortunately been lost (Holoman 1989, p. 241). Falcon also appeared the following year in a concert on 22 November 1835 which was organized jointly by Girard and Berlioz, in which she again sang Berlioz's Le Jeune Pâtre breton and an aria from Meyerbeer's opera Il crociato in Egitto.Holoman 1989, p. 171; Cairns 1999, p. 99. Further roles at the Opéra Falcon as Rachel in La Juive Falcon (right) as Valentine in Les Huguenots (1836), with Julie Dorus-Gras (left) as Marguerite, and Adolphe Nourrit as RaoulFalcon's other creations at the Opéra included the roles of Rachel in Halévy's La Juive (23 February 1835), Valentine in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots (29 February 1836), the title role in Louise Bertin's La Esmeralda (14 November 1836), and Léonor in Louis Niedermeyer's Stradella (3 March 1837).Parsons 193, p. 467. She also appeared as the Countess in Rossini's Le comte Ory and Pamira in Rossini's Le siège de Corinthe (1836).Lajarte 1878, pp. 123–124. By 1835, Falcon was earning 50,000 francs/year at the Opéra, making her the highest paid artist there, earning nearly twice as much as Nourrit and three times as much as Dorus.Smart 2003, p. 114 Vocal demise and final years However, Falcon's singing career was remarkably short. She lost her voice catastrophically during the second performance of Stradella at the Opéra in March 1837. When Nourrit as Stradella asked her \\"Demain nous partirons – voulez-vous?\\" ('We leave tomorrow, are you willing?'), Falcon was unable to sing her line \\"Je suis prête\\" ('I am ready'), fainted, and was carried offstage by Nourrit.Cairns 1999, p. 151, citing Bouvet, 1927. Braud 1913, p. 94, says it was the fourth performance, and gives a different quotation. Berlioz, who was present, describes \\"raucous sounds like those of a child with croup, guttural, whistling notes that quickly faded like those of a flute filled with water\\".Quoted by Bouvet 1927 and reproduced in Smart 2003, p. 116. Falcon resumed performances, but her vocal difficulties continued, and she gave her last regular performance there in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots on 15 January 1838. She resorted to all sorts of bogus treatments and remediesKuhn 1992, p. 219. and moved to Italy for 18 months in the hope that the climate would have a beneficial effect. Falcon returned for a benefit at the Opéra on 14 March 1840, in which she was to sing selections from Act 2 of La Juive and Act 4 of Les Huguenots with Gilbert Duprez, Jean-Étienne Massol, and Julie Dorus-Gras. Her appearance was described as seemingly relaxed, as she received a standing ovation at her entrance. Her range in notes was critically diminished, and she could not perform in opera. She was said to have wept in response to her own vocal state. However, soon after it was discovered that her vocal abilities were now gone. As Spire Pitou relates: \\"She wept at her own pathetic fate but continued despite her inability to do much else besides make the audience regret the loss of her gifts. When she came to the painfully poignant words in Les Huguenots, 'Nuit fatale, nuit d'alarmes, je n'ai plus d'avenir' ('Fatal night, night of alarms, I have no longer a future'), she could not support the dreadful irony of the line. She had no choice but to retire ...\\"Pitou 1990, p. 451. There followed a few performances in Russia in 1840–1841, but after that, except for a few private performances in Paris at the court of Louis-Philippe and for the Duc de Nemours, she definitively quit the stage.Braud 1913, p. 103. Many explanations have been offered for Falcon's loss of voice, including the enormous demands of the music of Grand Opera, the \\"ill-effects of beginning to sing in a large opera house before her body was fully mature\\", Falcon's attempts to lift her range above its natural mezzo-soprano range, and nervous fatigue brought on by her personal life.Smart 2003, p. 116. Benjamin Walton has analyzed the music written for her and has suggested there was a break in her voice between a' and b'. Gilbert Duprez, who sang with her on several occasions, speculated that her inability to negotiate this transition was a factor in her \\"vocal demise\\".The suggestion of a break in her voice is credited to Walton by Smart 2003, p. 116, and the suggestion by Gilbert Duprez that this contributed to her loss of voice is mentioned in Robinson and Walton 2001. Falcon married a financier, becoming Madame Falcon-Malançon and a grandmother,Braud 1913, pp. 103–106. and continued to live, reclusively, near the Opéra in the Chaussée d'Antin, until her death. At the end of 1891, she agreed to appear on stage at the Opéra on the occasion of a celebration of the centenary of Meyerbeer, \\"with three of her surviving contemporaries\\". She died in 1897 and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery.Braud 1913, pp. 103 (note 2), 106. Reputation Costume design for Falcon as Valentine in Acts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots Having sung many of the important roles of early Grand Opera, Falcon was closely associated with the genre by contemporary audiences. The designation of the voice timbre \\"falcon\\", a dramatic soprano with a strong lower register (and lighter upper register) reflects this. Castil-Blaze described her voice in 1832: > ...A range of two octaves extending from b to d, and resonating at all > points with an equal vigour. A silvery voice, with a brilliant timbre, > incisive enough that even the weight of the chorus cannot overwhelm it; yet > the sound emitted with such force never loses its charm or purity.Bouvet > 1927 p.39, cited in translation in Smart 2003 p.116 Falcon's personal reputation was also relevant to her career. \\"Perhaps the only singer of the time to maintain a reputation for chastity\\", this perception carried over to appreciation of her performances of the ingénue roles for which she was famed.Smart 2003, p. 113 In 1844, Chorley wrote of Falcon as: > ... the ill-starred Mademoiselle Falcon, the loved and the lost one of > L'Académie. > She, indeed, was a person to haunt even a passing stranger. Though the seal > of her race was upon her beauty, and it wore the expression of a Deborah or > a Judith,Chorley implies, and Jordan 1994, p. 69, explicitly states (but > does not cite a source for the information), that Falcon was of Jewish > descent. She is also identified as Jewish in \\"F. Halévy\\", Archives > israélites, vol. 23, no. 4 (1 April 1862), p. 188. None of the other > sources, including Meyerbeer's diaries (Meyerbeer and Letellier 1999), > appear to corroborate this. Kelly 2004, p. 167, labels Chorley's rather > indirect phraseology as \\"anti-semitic doubletalk\\", although nothing in > Chorley's description suggests any such intention. rather than of a > Melpomene, I have never seen any actress, who in look and gesture so well > deserved the style and title of the Muse of Modern Tragedy.

These part-time roofs, sometimes at first just a stretched piece of leather, became more sophisticated comprising frame elements and leather or water-resistant cloth to form the construction, and installations even included spaces provided to store the parts when not in use. By the late 1920s, a more convenient version of the temporary roof was often being used where a solid metal panel would slide into a slot at the top of the passenger compartment, sometimes called a de Ville extension. By the early 1930s, cars were being constructed in the Sedan style comprising a metal one-piece roof without the gap above the driver's cabin. To provide a similar facility to the earlier Coup de Ville configurations, sliding cloth or metal panels recognisable as the modern sunroof were regularly fitted to Bentley and Rolls Royce models built by coach builders such as Barker, Gurney Nutting or Park Ward. In these cars, the continuous roofline, between the windscreen and passenger compartment, was unbroken and so, unlike the Coup de Ville, a coverable opening had to be let into the roof panel itself. While at first the purpose may still have been to expose the chauffeur, Bentley cars in particular were increasingly sold for owners to drive themselves. Indeed, some models were provided with a sliding panel for the front seats even though the vehicle had just two-seats. Early \\"Derby\\" Bentley hard-top models were therefore frequently equipped with sliding sunroof panels, possibly more often than not. The purpose of the sliding panels thus changed from uncovering the chauffeur to allowing the owner to better enjoy their surroundings on fine weather days. 1930s MG coupe including a Sliding Head incorporating glass panels This evolution was eventually not limited to luxury motoring. The entrepreneur Noel Mobbs laid the foundation of the volume sunroof market when he evolved his coach building business into a company dedicated to the manufacture of sliding roofs in the name of Pytchley. The Pytchley mechanism was both patented and first publicly demonstrated in 1925. At first Pytchley used their sliding roof system to build a number of coach-built, custom \\"tourer saloon\\" automobiles sold from their premises at 201 - 203 Great Portland Street London. In 1927 they claimed for a Daimler 20/70 hp that \\"This roof slides at the touch of a finger and opens up 50% of the roof area giving greater visibility and more air without draughts.\\" The sliding roof system evolved from a device that Pytchley installed themselves, to an option which manufacturers offered as a standard body style. It was factory fitted to vehicles from a number of different manufacturers. By 1929 the design had improved so that when closed the moveable panel was flush with the rest of the roof. Morris built several models using Pytchley's technology from 1932, including the Morris Minor, Morris Major and Morris Ten adding what became known as a Sliding Head (using the term head in the same way as Folding Head or Drop Head). This comprised a panel which could be slid back over the roof behind to create an opening above the driver and passenger. The sliding panel also incorporated locks which allowed the panel to be fixed at any position from fully closed to fully open. By 1935 Wolseley were using the Pytchley roof and by 1936 Austin too were also selling models with the sliding head. The Hillman Minx was another low-cost small car which was clearly not designed to be chauffeured, and in 1931 it was offered in a variety of body styles as was usual at that time, among the options was a sliding roof section including, on the 1933 Aero model with glass panels, as photographed on the 1932 show car, making this the first moonroof. In 1941 Pytchley took on the manufacturer Vauxhall for failure to pay royalties. Vauxhall claimed that their variation of the sliding roof, which slid the panel under the rear section rather than over, was sufficiently different to mean that a license need not be paid. Pytchley won the case. Variations in moveable, removable and transparent roof panels continued. The Ford Lincoln X-100 concept car of 1953 revisited the Sedanca style for a non- chauffeured vehicle as it had a retractable transparent targa top which inspired later fixed moonroof panels on 1954 production vehicles. In 1961 Triumph launched the TR4 with a removable hard top roof split into two sections. The rear part, incorporating the rear window, could be left on the car when the centre piece was removed creating a Sedanca layout. This concept was resurrected again in 1966 when Porsche launched a version of its 911 sports car that established the term Targa, trademarked by Porsche. This bore even more of a resemblance to the traditional Sedanca form, as the car had both a permanently fixed roll-over hoop, and rear seats. While in 1969 Lamborghini showed the first full-roof framed transparent-panel roof, heralding the modern panoramic roof, on an Espada. 1934 Hillman Aero Minx showing its sliding-panel sunroof with inset glass panels - the world's first moonroof (before the term was coined) Triumph TR4, the first volume- manufactured Sedanca style body (later commonly called Targa) Sunroofs, by historical definition are opaque. Today, most factory sliding sunroof options feature a glass panel and are sometimes marketed as moonroofs, a term introduced in 1973 by John Atkinson, a marketing manager at Ford for the Continental Mark IV. For the first year, Ford sent out its Mark IVs to American Sunroof Company for offline installation. Variations of both the sunroof and moonroof have become the norm in both factory installed and aftermarket offerings, creating a wide range of features and choices. Sunroof systems may be manual or electric, while most moonroof systems are electric/electronic. Manual sunroofs may be lever actuated, as in venting type pop-ups, manual lever or crank operated for sliding systems. Electric roof systems are usually cable driven by a motor and feature some form of sliding opening. Most moonroof systems today are electric and have either a combination pop-up/inbuilt or a pop-up/spoiler configuration (see sunroof types below). Roof systems may be original equipment, factory options (provided by the car company), or installed aftermarket by a roof installation professional for the car dealer or retail customer. Once the vehicle leaves the assembly line, the factory option can no longer be integrated into the roof, making aftermarket the only option.  Sunroof types  Roof systems are available in many shapes, sizes and styles, and are known by many names. The main types are as follows: * Pop-up sunroofs are simply a manually operated tilting panel. These panels are usually removable, and like T-roofs, must be stored when removed. The tilting action provides a vent in the roof, or a full opening when the panel is removed. Pop-ups can be installed in most vehicles, and are relatively inexpensive. Examples include metal panels in the Porsche 944, the early Mazda RX-7, and many glass panel factory and aftermarket installations. * Spoiler sunroofs (tilt-&-slides) combine the features of a pop-up with those of a sliding roof system. They tilt to vent and slide open above the roof, requiring little headroom or roof length. Spoilers typically do not provide as large an opening as other roof systems, but offer the convenience of a self-storing panel. Most spoiler roofs are electric, with optional features like integrated sun shades and express open/close. Spoilers are ideal for short-roof vehicles where other types of sliders cannot be installed. Examples include the Honda CRX, the Toyota Celica and the Mazda RX-7. * Inbuilt sunroof systems have a panel which slides between the metal roof and interior headliner, requiring some loss of headroom but providing a full opening in the roof. All inbuilts slide inside the roof, while some also include a rear venting feature (see pop-up), and/or express open/close functions. Inbuilts do not fit every vehicle, as the panel must slide and store completely within the vehicle roof. Historically, inbuilts were a metal sunroof panel painted to match the vehicle roof, but now most are glass-panel systems with sliding sunshades (typically referred to as moonroofs). One of the first examples was the 1960 Ford Thunderbird. * Folding sunroofs (often called rag-tops or cabrio coach) are a European tradition. They offer the convenience of a sunroof, with an opening more like a convertible. The panel is made of fabric (often vinyl), which folds back as it slides open. After a long absence in European and North American markets, folding sunroofs have experienced a resurgence with several new factory-installed options. Aftermarket versions were once only manual, but now are also available in powered versions. Examples include the original VW Beetle, Renault Twingo and Jeep Liberty. * Top-mount sliding sunroofs (rail mount topslider) have been a popular factory option in Europe for many years. A large glass panel slides open in tracks on top of the roof, with no loss of headroom. Most feature an integral wind deflector to eliminate wind noise. Examples include Donmar's original Skyroof topslider (aftermarket system), the London Taxi and Renault 5 cars. * Panoramic roof systems are a type of large or multi-panel moonroof which offer openings above both the front and rear seats and may be operable or fixed glass panels. An early example visually very similar to many current versions was paraded around the Monaco Grand Prix circuit in 1969, it comprised a full-length fixed plexiglass panel and was fitted to a Lamborghini Espada. The first example of a panoramic roof however was incorporated into the 1953 Lincoln XL-500 concept car which sported a full-length plexiglass bubble canopy. Large operable openings are often accomplished with top-slider (tracks in the top of the roof) or spoiler type mechanisms. Examples include the Acura ZDX, Lexus ES, BMW Mini, Scion tC, Pontiac G6, Mercedes C Class, Volkswagen Eos, Porsche Cayenne, and the Tesla Model S. * Removable roof panels (t-tops or targa roofs) open a vehicle roof to the side windows, providing a wider opening than other roof systems. The Targa body style is identical in configuration to the Sedanca but is designed for owner-driven rather than chauffeured cars and while a Sedanca style implies a rear passenger area, the Targa does not. T-roofs have two removable panels and leave a T-shaped structural brace in the roof center. Targa roofs include only one (opaque or transparent) panel and leave no cross brace. Aftermarket kits are no longer made, but several companies sell replacement and remanufactured panels, parts and accessories. Examples include Triumph TR4, Porsche 911 Targa, Suzuki Cappuccino, Toyota Supra, Pontiac Firebird, Chevrolet Corvette, Honda NSX, and Porsche 914. * Solar sunroofs are made of glass, with an inlaid photovoltaic solar panel that makes the glass totally opaque. They operate the same as conventional factory-fitted glass moonroofs (tilting and retracting), but when closed the solar panel provides electricity to power the interior ventilation fans, for cooling the car interior on hot days when the car is standing outside in the sunlight. These are available as a factory option on the 2010 Prius, recent Audi cars, Renault Zoé, and also were available on some versions of the Mazda Millenia and Mazda 929. * Electric vs. electronic Motorized power roof systems may be operated by a simple push-and-hold switch, or may include an electronic control module (ECM) to provide single-touch express opening, express closing and/or auto-closing on ignition off. * Moonroof is a transparent, usually glass or plexiglass, sunroof that lets light in while closed. Examples include the Mk1 Ford Fiesta from 1976, the Mk3 Ford Escort from 1980, the Acura ILX, and Pontiac G6. The earliest example, although not called moonroof at the time, was the 1933 Hillman Aero Minx which could be fitted with a sliding roof panel including inset glass. An early use of a large-panel transparent roof section was the 1954 Ford Skyliner and Mercury Sun Valley models which borrowed in-part from the full panoramic roof of the Lincoln XL-500 concept car as well as the X-100. A fixed moonroof exclusively for rear seat passengers was a prominent feature of the Aston Martin Lagonda from series 2, to 4 which was launched in 1976.

Automotive accessories Automotive styling features Car windows Automotive body parts ","title":"Sunroof"},{"id":"996986","text":"Anthony \\"Tony\\" Almeida is a fictional character portrayed by Carlos Bernard on the television series 24. Almeida appeared in a total of 126 episodes (including 24: Legacy), the second highest number of episodes of any character in the series, third being Chloe O'Brian (125) and first being Jack Bauer (192), portrayed by Mary Lynn Rajskub and Kiefer Sutherland, respectively. Characterization Tony Almeida was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1973 to an Italian mother and a Portuguese father. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from San Diego State University and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from Stanford University. He served in the United States Marine Corps and attended Scout Sniper and Surveillance and Target Acquisition training. He was honorably discharged as a First Lieutenant and worked as a systems analyst before being hired by CTU. He was previously on more episodes than any other character, second to Jack Bauer, but was surpassed by Chloe O'Brien. Appearances =24: Season 1= Tony Almeida is a systems analyst and third-in-command at the Counter Terrorist Unit's Los Angeles headquarters, and is romantically involved with fellow agent Nina Myers. Tony consequently has animosity towards the series' protagonist, Jack Bauer, who was formerly in a relationship with Nina. Just after midnight, word arrives of an imminent assassination attempt on Democratic presidential candidate David Palmer. When Jack is forced to cease contact with CTU, Tony and Division become suspicious and place CTU under lockdown while George Mason interrogates key staff members. Tony's suspicions are aroused further when Jack returns and sneaks Nina out of headquarters at gunpoint. Shortly thereafter, Tony and Nina interrogate Jamey Farrell, leading her to confess to her involvement with Ira Gaines, the terrorist behind the kidnapping of Jack's wife and daughter. Jamey dies in an apparent suicide soon after this. After Jack succeeds in rescuing Kim and Teri Bauer, both Alberta Green and Ryan Chappelle encourage Tony to report Jack for unnecessarily endangering Senator Palmer. However, Tony refuses. Kim and Teri flee from a CTU safe house when it is attacked by hitmen working for Gaines' employers, Andre and Alexis Drazen. After a confrontation by Nina, Tony visits Jack's home and saves both Teri and Phil Parslow from being killed by Jovan Myovic. Before the day's end, Palmer is saved and the Drazens are killed. However, Nina is revealed to be a second mole working for the Drazens, having killed Jamey and staged Jamey's suicide when Jamey exposed her (Nina). Jack realizes this by viewing security tapes which show Jamey's murder. Nina is captured, though not before she kills several people while attempting to escape, including Teri. When Jack points the gun at Nina for her betrayal, Tony and George dissuade Jack from pulling the trigger. Tony can only watch in disgust and disbelief as the woman he thought he loved is led away. =24: Season 2= Tony becomes the new chief of staff and Mason's second-in-command at CTU, and is present when Jack returns to the agency to assist in hunting down Second Wave, a Middle Eastern terrorist organization that plots to detonate a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles. When Kate Warner reports Reza Nayieer to CTU, Tony questions Reza and the Warner family. Though financial records link Reza to the leader of Second Wave, Syed Ali, Reza denies any involvement with terrorists. It is later revealed that Reza is indeed innocent and that his fiancée, Marie Warner, was the one collaborating with Ali. Near the beginning of the second season, Mason was exposed to lethal dose of plutonium, leaving him with radiation sickness. Mason eventually passes along the leadership of CTU to Tony, and leaves the agency. One hour later, in a noble effort to remove the nuclear bomb from a populated area, Mason crashes a plane carrying the bomb into the Nevada desert, sacrificing his own life as it detonates. Under Tony's command, CTU receives recordings of a meeting between Ali and representatives from three Middle Eastern countries at Cyprus. Jack learns from Jonathan Wallace that the Cyprus recordings were false. After learning the truth himself, Tony, along with Michelle Dessler, begin covertly assisting Jack, and are eventually forced to physically incapacitate Chappelle. After Chappelle is found by Carrie, he orders their arrest. However, when Mike Novick orders Chappelle to assist Jack, Tony and Michelle, they are given immunity and reinstated. With Tony and Michelle's assistance, Jack and Sherry Palmer, the president's ex- wife, are able to get a recording implicating Peter Kingsley, the true manipulator of the day's events, and prevent a war with the Middle East. Throughout the day, Tony and Michelle begin to realize that they share a mutual attraction. At first, Tony keeps his distance out of hesitancy after what happened with Nina. After receiving parting advice from Mason, however, Michelle expresses an interest. The two become romantically involved and later marry. =24: The Game= While Jack Bauer is often pre-occupied with other tasks such as leads to save his daughter or find more information about the terrorist threats, Tony has been out in the field as extensively as both Jack and Chase Edmunds. Throughout the day, Tony apprehended Joseph Sin-Chung, who was currently posing as a crew member of the apprehended cargo boat named Lee Jin-Yu. He prevented a terrorist threat at a metro station prior to the capture of CTU. During the hour that CTU was held hostage, Tony guides Kim Bauer to encrypt the hard-drive containing the data of the undercover CTU agents, significantly slowing down the terrorists' progress in getting the information. Shortly after Kim's return to CTU, Tony leads one of the tactical teams disarming one of the bombs at a construction site situated along a fault line. Hours after the threat, Tony had to rush to the scene of a crime, which involved a hostage situation with Governor James Radford. After restraining as many confused gunmen as he could, he had to negotiate with the leader, who was merely a desperate man trying to save his sick son. Tony succeeds in calming down the gunman, but the gunman is found dead by the time Tony busts open the locked door. He started becoming suspicious of Radford as he checks the gunman's body. Tony's suspicions came true when an assistant of Governor Radford calls telling him to meet her at Fisher Pier, which was happening approximately at the same time as Chase Edmunds's return to C.T.U. Tony met up with the assistant and was given a keycard to Radford's office, with the assistant suspecting that Radford was involved in terrorist activity. The suspicion came true as a helicopter ambushed the pair, killing the assistant. Tony barely escapes with his life and drives off to the Governor's office building. After dealing with various gunmen under Radford's payroll and rescuing any trapped civilians, Tony found evidence that showed Radford's involvement with the terrorists. It turned out that Radford was seen conversing with Peter Madsen, Joseph Sin-Chung, and an unknown third man. Tony attempts to track Radford and manages to eavesdrop on Radford's conversation with the unknown man. Radford attempted to walk out, but the assassin Mandy already kills Radford before Tony could do anything. Tony's evidence proved invaluable since CTU was later able to identify the third man as Max. While Jack and Chase were busy at Fort Lesker, Tony, Michelle, and Chappelle have information that Kate Warner is still alive, but Chappelle restricted Tony from notifying Jack under the guise of completing the established mission. A few hours later, the trace was complete being located at Max's yacht. After berating Chappelle out of disgust, Tony heads back out to the field one more time to assist Jack and Chase at the L.A. Docks in a CTU helicopter. Tony picks up Chase first, and pilots the chopper to have Chase provide support fire for Jack before picking him up. Tony maneuvers the helicopter around the yacht allowing Chase to mow down gunmen firing at them, while Jack abseils onto the deck of the yacht. As the day ends, Tony stays on the yacht with Kate to clean up the mess while Chase pilots the helicopter with a wounded Jack to a nearby hospital. =24: Season 3= Tony fields promotion offers from several CTU regional divisions. Despite this, he, Jack Bauer and Gael Ortega organize a covert sting operation designed to keep the deadly Cordilla virus out of the hands of the Salazars, a Mexican crime family. During the operation, Tony is shot in the neck in a shopping mall and incapacitated, leaving him comatose. After awakening, Tony returns to his CTU post to resume the operation. Tension mounts between Tony and Michelle over his health and his secrecy towards her. Michelle is later trapped inside a hotel as it becomes infected with the virus, and asks Tony to authorize the use of suicide capsules to the infected patrons. Against Jack's explicit wishes, Tony uses Kim in a field operation as a replacement for Jane Saunders, the daughter of rogue MI6 agent Stephen Saunders, in an attempt to secure collateral against him. Just as the FBI prepares to corner Saunders, he reveals that he has captured Michelle and will kill her unless Tony aids his escape. Tony acquiesces, allowing Saunders to evade the FBI and free Jane from CTU custody. Jack realizes Tony's motives, and convinces him to work with CTU on a sting. At the arranged meeting, CTU intervenes and captures Saunders. However, Tony is arrested for treason. =24: Season 4= Tony enters the story once again by rescuing Jack and Audrey from armed hostiles at a security firm. It is afterwards revealed that Almeida was sent to prison for treason, but was released early when Jack secured a pardon from President Palmer. Michelle had left Tony due to his alcoholism and depression, leading him to move in with a woman named Jen Slater. There, Tony harbors Jack and Audrey Raines. Tony considers the rescue a repayment of the debt he owes Jack for getting him out of prison and initially does not wish to be involved in the case any further. Jack respects Tony's wishes, but when setting out from Tony's house to apprehend a suspect on his own, Tony reasons that it would be stupid to let his friend go back out alone after saving his life and offers to help. This leads him to become further involved in the day's events, eventually returning to CTU on a provisional basis. Tensions rise when the Associate Special Agent in Charge of Division Bill Buchanan and Tony's former wife, Michelle Dessler, take active command of CTU Los Angeles when incumbent Special Agent in Charge Erin Driscoll leaves for personal reasons. Tony and Michelle clash at first, but gradually the two begin to realize they still have feelings for each other. Near the end of the day, they have agreed to leave CTU together and start a new life once the current threat is dealt with. An assassin named Mandy who had made an attempt on President David Palmer's life in Season Two, becomes the next lead and Bill Buchanan calls Tony into the field to help apprehend her. Tony is captured and Mandy uses him to coerce Michelle into providing her with an escape route, just as Saunders did to Tony in Season Three. Michelle is about to comply, but decides to tell Bill instead. Mandy attempts to fake her own and Tony's death in a car bomb in order to escape. While being walked out of the building at gunpoint by her, Tony attempts to overcome Mandy, but eventually is rescued by Jack and Curtis, who have, by this point, seen through the ploy. At the end of Day 4, when Walt Cummings, an overzealous member of the new Logan Administration, decides that Jack Bauer needs to die due to his part in an illegal raid on the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles, Tony plays an integral part in faking Jack's death. After smuggling him out of CTU, Tony allows himself to have an emotional good-bye to his friend, before he and Michelle drive off to begin their new life. =24: Season 5= By Day 5, Tony and Michelle have left CTU and are living life together as civilians. After receiving news that Palmer has been assassinated, Michelle wants to go into CTU and assist in the investigation. Tony tries to dissuade her but she leaves without him and triggers a bomb planted under her car. Tony rushes from the house to see what has happened to his wife, but as he finds her body, the car's fuel tank explodes, critically injuring him. It is later confirmed through CTU conversations that Michelle is dead. Tony is transported to CTU Medical, where he undergoes surgery and is stabilized. Later, an assassin infiltrates CTU, impersonates a doctor and lures Jack down to medical by claiming Tony has awoken. Jack manages to foil the attempt on his life. Upon actually waking a few hours later, Tony is not aware that Michelle has died. Having been advised by the doctor that Tony should be kept calm, Bill Buchanan tells him that Michelle's condition is still unknown. However, Tony suspects otherwise and escapes CTU Medical to access a computer, where he learns of his wife's fate. Bill later informs him that CTU have discovered Christopher Henderson to be involved in the murder. Tony ends up sealed inside CTU Medical along with Henderson when terrorists release Sentox nerve gas into the building, killing many members of the staff. Enraged and feeling he has nothing left to live for, Tony decides to kill Henderson by injecting him a lethal dose of hyoscine-pentothal while he is seemingly in a coma. Jack's attempts to dissuade him eventually cause Tony to hesitate, however, and Henderson is given time to disarm Tony of the syringe and inject him with it before escaping. Before Jack can get him medical help, Tony apparently dies. =24: Season 7= Tony is discovered to be alive and currently working with a terrorist group to disrupt US President Allison Taylor's invasion of Sangala by blackmailing her with terrorist attacks. It is ultimately revealed that Christopher Henderson purposely missed Tony's heart when he stabbed him, and planned on turning him. He had his people take Tony's body, and they were able to revive him within 10 minutes of his apparent death. Jack Bauer and the FBI apprehend Tony. Jack requests to interrogate Tony, but fails to get him to talk. However, during the interrogation, Tony taunts Jack into attacking him and while they fight, Tony is able to discreetly give Jack the code word 'Deep Sky'. Jack recognizes this as an old CTU code for a phone number, which he calls once he is in private. The number leads him to Bill Buchanan and Chloe O'Brian who reveal that Tony was working undercover for them to uncover corrupt US officials working with General Benjamin Juma, the dictator of Sangala and perpetrator of mass genocide. Furthermore, Tony needs to be freed so he can continue his work. Jack breaks Tony out of FBI custody and joins him, Bill and Chloe in resuming their independent operation, which culminates in the elimination of the terrorist group, the unmasking of Juma's allies in the U.S. government, and the deaths of General Juma and his squad of soldiers who storm the White House. Following the end of the White House siege, Jack and Tony scramble to intercept and then recover a shipment of bioweapons engineered by Jonas Hodges, president of mercenary corporation Starkwood, who intends to blackmail the President and enact Executive legislation benefitting himself. Aided by the FBI, Jack and Tony successfully destroy the chemical weapons in the Starkwood compound, although Jack is exposed to the bio-weapon and infected. Following the destruction of the weapons, it is revealed that Tony is actually working with the terrorists. He murders FBI Agent Larry Moss and recovers the one remaining canister of the chemical weapon, which he gives to Cara Bowden, a representative of the conspirators, all of whom had planned the day's events and of whom Hodges was previously a member. Tony and the conspirators initiate their operation and attempt to detonate the canister inside the DC Metro tunnels. They are stopped by Jack and the FBI, who apprehend Tony and recover the canister before it can detonate. As they transport Tony to the FBI, Cara contacts Jack and through threats to his daughter Kim Bauer, forces him to help Tony escape custody. Jack hands Tony over to Cara, and they then take Jack hostage to salvage the remains of the virus from Jack's infected blood, tissue and organs. Finally alone with Tony, Jack tries to reason with the man who was once his closest friend. Tony reveals that his true goal was always to get close enough to Alan Wilson, the head conspirator behind the day's attacks and the man responsible for the murders of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler. Tony's actions have convinced Wilson that he could be allowed further into the conspiracy circle and sets up a rare meeting, at which Tony plans to turn on him. Wilson arrives to speak with Tony, but the group is ambushed by the FBI. Retreating into a warehouse, Tony kills Cara and corners Wilson. As Tony prepares to kill him, he reveals that not only did Wilson kill Michelle, but he also killed their unborn son. Jack and Renee arrive, disabling Tony before he has the chance to carry out his revenge. Tony is led away into FBI custody once again, cursing and raging at Jack. =24: Season 9= In the seven-minute special feature exclusive to the Live Another Day Blu-ray set, 24: Solitary, Tony requests to be moved to general population, approximately 8 years after Day 7, so that he can serve as an undercover “inside source” and provide actionable Intel about other prisoners. He states that his desire for revenge consumed him and that Michelle “never would’ve approved of the man I became” following her death. He accepts the fact that he’s going to die in prison, but hopes to save at least one life so that he can be worthy of Michelle’s love again. When the Prison Administrator denies Tony's case due to U.S. Attorney Vanessa Diaz's (who opposes any reduction in Tony's security) evidence, Tony violently attacks her. After Tony is taken out of the room, it is revealed that the attack was a ruse so that Diaz could pass off her glasses to Tony. Vanessa calls her contact on a secure line and informs him that Tony has the plans. Tony puts the glasses on and presses a hidden button on the side of the frame, which reveals a schematic to the prison with a carefully planned escape route on the lenses. He is confident that everything is going according to plan and that, soon, he will be a free man again. =24: Legacy= Tony Almeida returns in the 24 spin-off, 24: Legacy. When Henry Donovan withholds information about his dealings with terrorists and CTU is unable to break him, Rebecca Ingram hires Almeida to provide enhanced interrogation. Almeida is later paid to kill Ara Naseri by Donald Simms and comes into conflict with Eric Carter. Almeida refuses to stand down and loses most of his team to Carter. Almeida gets a call from John Donovan revealing the identity of Naseri and the fact that Naseri is their best chance to save Rebecca. Almeida stands down and tells Carter to save Rebecca. Other appearances Producer David Fury tweeted that he had a dinner meeting with Carlos Bernard, Howard Gordon, Manny Coto, Patrick Somerville, and composer Sean Callery, which had led to speculation that Tony will return in the limited event series 24: Live Another Day. After it became apparent that Tony wouldn't return in Live Another Day, months later, on July 8, 2014, one day after Fury confirmed that Tony is still in prison, it was announced that Tony would be featured in a Live Another Day DVD/Blu-ray featurette called 24: Solitary. Whether it will be a physical appearance on Bernard's half is unknown; in the DVD/Blu-ray advertisement, however, it was said \\"a character from the past returns\\", implying that Bernard would portray Tony once more. On August 21, 2014, it was definitively confirmed that Bernard would return to portray Tony in the 7 minute, 6 second \\"24: Solitary\\" when a photo of him once again portraying Tony in an orange prison jumpsuit was released.

On January 6, 1997, he was again given responsibility for the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act. In a cabinet shuffle on February 5, 1999, Stefanson was appointed Minister of Health and Deputy Premier, also retaining responsibilities of the Boxing/Wrestling Commission and Fitness/Amateur Sport Acts. He scored another easy victory in the 1999 provincial election (defeating New Democrat Dennis Kshyk by over 3000 votes), but the Progressive Conservative party was defeated by the NDP at the provincial level and Stefanson moved into opposition. Although touted by many as a possible party leader after the resignation of Gary Filmon, he decided not to run for the position. On September 7, 2000, Stefanson resigned from the legislature to provide a seat for the party's incoming leader, Stuart Murray. During his time in government, Stefanson was one of the most powerful ministers in Gary Filmon's cabinet. He presided over a series of balanced budgets, achieved at the cost of considerable cuts in public funding for various programs. In 1998, Stefanson was accused by some of exercising undue ministerial influence in the appointment of his brother, Tom, as CEO of Manitoba Telecom Services; no formal charges of impropriety were made, however. In 2000, he supported Tom Long for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance party. From 2004 to 2009, Stefanson was a regional managing partner for BDO Dunwoody. In January 2007, he was appointed by federal transport minister Lawrence Cannon to the board of directors of Via Rail Canada.Transport Canada - Media Release - No. H 006/07 January 26, 2007 - Appointments to Via Rail Canada Inc.

Baret is recognized as the first woman to have completed a voyage of circumnavigation of the globe. Jeanne Baret joined the expedition disguised as a man, calling herself Jean Baret. She enlisted as valet and assistant to the expedition's naturalist, Philibert Commerçon (anglicized as Commerson), shortly before Bougainville's ships sailed from France. According to Bougainville's account, Baret was herself an expert botanist.  Early life  Jeanne Baret was born on July 27, 1740, in the village of La Comelle in the Burgundy region of France. Her record of baptism survives and identifies her as the legitimate issue of Jean Baret and Jeanne Pochard. Her father is identified as a day laborer and seems likely to have been illiterate, as he did not sign the parish register.Dunmore, p. 12Ridley, p. 13 Little is known of Baret's childhood or young adulthood. She later told Bougainville that she had been orphaned and lost her fortune in a lawsuit before taking to disguising herself as a man. Her mother died 15 months after Jeanne was born and her father when she was 15.Clode, Danielle (2020) In Search of the Woman who Sailed the World, Pan Macmillan, Sydney pp. 21, 27 Historians agree that some details of the story she gave Bougainville were a fabrication to shield Commerson from complicity in her disguise.Dunmore, p. 15Ridley, p. 162 Burgundy was at this time one of the more backward provinces of France in terms of the condition of the peasant classes, and it is likely that Baret's family was quite impoverished.Dunmore, pp. 11–14Ridley, pp. 14–16 One of the mysteries of Baret's life is how she obtained at least the rudiments of an education, as her signature on later legal documents provides evidence that she was not illiterate. One of her biographers, Glynis Ridley, suggests that her mother might have been of Huguenot extraction, a group that had a higher tradition of literacy than was otherwise typical of the peasant classes of the time.Ridley, pp. 36–38 Another biographer, John Dunmore, suggests that she was taught by the parish priest or taken on as a charity case by a member of the local gentry. Danielle Clode, however, notes that Jeanne did not sign the parish register for her father's deathClode p. 36 (or the birth of her godson in 1756). Her first known signature is in 1764, making it more likely she was taught to write by Commerson, perhaps to help him with his work. She always signed her own name 'Barret'.Clode p. 38  Relationship with Commerson  At some point between 1760 and 1764, Baret became employed as housekeeper to Commerson, who had settled in Toulon-sur-Arroux, some to the south of La Comelle, upon his marriage in 1760. Commerson's wife, who was the sister of the parish priest, died shortly after giving birth to a son in April 1762, and it seems most likely that Baret took over management of Commerson's household at that time, if not before.Dunmore, pp. 27–28Ridley, pp. 38–389 It is also evident that Baret and Commerson shared a more personal relationship, as Baret became pregnant in 1764. French law at that time required women who became pregnant out of wedlock to obtain a \\"certificate of pregnancy\\" in which they could name the father of their unborn child. Baret's certificate, from August 1764, survives; it was filed in a town away and witnessed by two men of substance who likewise had travelled a considerable distance from their homes. She refused to name the father of her child, but historians do not doubt that it was Commerson and that it was Commerson who had also made the arrangements with the lawyer and witnesses on her behalf.Dunmore, p. 29Ridley, pp. 40–41 Shortly afterwards, Baret and Commerson moved together to Paris, where she continued in the role of his housekeeper. Baret apparently changed her name to \\"Jeanne de Bonnefoy\\" during this period.Dunmore, pp. 29–30Ridley, p. 68 Her child, born in December 1764, was given the name Jean-Pierre Baret. Baret gave the child up to the Paris Foundlings Hospital. He was quickly placed with a foster mother but died in the summer of 1765.Dunmore, pp. 31–32Ridley, pp. 51–56 (Commerson had left his legitimate son from his marriage in the care of his brother-in-law in Toulon-sur-Arroux and never saw him again in his lifetime.) In 1765, Commerson was invited to join Bougainville's expedition. He hesitated in accepting because he was often in poor health; he required Baret's assistance as a nurse as well as in running his household and managing his collections and papers.Dunmore, pp. 32, 36Ridley, p. 57 His appointment allowed him a servant, paid as a royal expense, but women were completely prohibited on French navy ships at this time.Ridley, p. 59 At some point, the idea of Baret disguising herself as a man in order to accompany Commerson was conceived. To avoid scrutiny, she was to join the expedition immediately before the ship sailed, pretending to be a stranger to Commerson. Before leaving Paris, Commerson drew up a will in which he left to \\"Jeanne Baret, known as de Bonnefoi, my housekeeper\\", a lump sum of 600 livres along with back wages owed and the furnishings of their Paris apartment.Dunmore, p. 43Ridley, pp. 66–67 Thus, while the story Baret concocted for Bougainville's benefit to explain her presence on board ship was carefully designed to shield Commerson from involvement, there is clear documentary evidence of their previous relationship, and it is highly improbable that Commerson was not complicit in the plan himself.  With Bougainville  Baret and Commerson joined the Bougainville expedition at the port of Rochefort in late December 1766. They were assigned to sail on the storeship, the Étoile. Because of the vast quantity of equipment Commerson was bringing on the voyage, the ship's captain, François Chenard de la Giraudais, gave up his own large cabin on the ship to Commerson and his \\"assistant\\".Ridley, p. 71 This gave Baret significantly more privacy than she would have had otherwise on board the crowded ship. In particular, the captain's cabin gave Baret access to private toilet facilities so that she did not have to use the shared head with other members of the crew. In addition to Bougainville's published account, Baret's story figures in three other surviving memoirs of the expedition: a journal kept jointly by Commerson and Pierre Duclos-Guyot; a journal by the Prince of Nassau-Siegen, a paying passenger on the Boudeuse; and a memoir by François Vivès, a surgeon on the Étoile.Ridley, p. 4 Vivès has the most to say about Baret, but his memoir is problematical because he and Commerson were on bad terms throughout the voyage, and his account – largely written or revised after the fact – is full of innuendo and spiteful comments directed at both Commerson and Baret.Dunmore, pp. 53, 56Ridley, p. 5 Commerson suffered badly from both seasickness and a recurring ulcer on his leg in the early part of the voyage, and Baret probably spent most of her time attending to him. Aside from the ceremony of \\"crossing the line\\", which Commerson described in some detail in his memoir, there was little for the botanists to do until the Étoile reached Montevideo.Dunmore, pp. 55–67 There they set out on expeditions to the surrounding plains and mountains. Commerson's leg was still troubling him, and Baret seems to have done much of the actual labor, carrying supplies and specimens.Dunmore, p. 72 In Rio de Janeiro – a much more dangerous place, where the Étoiles chaplain was murdered ashore soon after their arrival – Commerson was officially confined to the ship while his leg healed, but he and Baret nonetheless collected specimens of a flowering vine, which he named Bougainvillea.Dunmore, pp. 72–78 After a second visit to Montevideo, their next opportunity to collect plants was in Patagonia while the ships of the expedition were waiting for favourable winds to carry them through the Strait of Magellan. Here Baret accompanied Commerson on the most troublesome excursions over rugged terrain and gained a reputation for courage and strength.Dunmore, pp. 84–87 Commerson, still hampered by his leg injury, referred to Baret as his \\"beast of burden\\" on these expeditions. In addition to the manual labor she performed in collecting plants, stones, and shells, Baret also helped Commerson organize and catalog their specimens and notes in the weeks that followed, as the ships entered the Pacific. Surviving accounts of the expedition differ on when Baret's gender was first discovered. According to Bougainville, rumors that Baret was a woman had circulated for some time, but her gender was not finally confirmed until the expedition reached Tahiti in April 1768. As soon as she and Commerson landed on shore, Baret was immediately surrounded by Tahitians who cried out that she was a woman. It was necessary to return her to the ship to protect her from the excited Tahitians. Bougainville recorded this incident in his journal some weeks after it happened, when he had an opportunity to visit the Étoile to interview Baret personally.Dunmore, pp. 100–101 In his account, Vivès reports much speculation about Baret's gender early in the voyage and asserts that Baret claimed to be a eunuch when confronted directly by La Giraudais (whose own official log has not survived).Dunmore, p. 59Ridley, pp. 82–84 Bougainville's account of Baret's unmasking on Tahiti is not corroborated by the other journal accounts of the expedition, although Vivès describes a similar incident in which Baret was immediately pointed out as a woman by the Tahitian Ahu-toru on board the ship. Vivès also describes a different incident on New Ireland in mid-July in which Baret was caught off-guard, stripped, and \\"examined\\" by a group of other servants on the expedition. Duclos-Guyot and Nassau-Siegen also recorded that Baret had been discovered to be a woman on New Ireland, but without mentioning details.Dunmore, pp. 136–138 Ahu-toru traveled back to France with the expedition and was subsequently questioned at some length about Baret. Modern scholars now believe that Ahu-toru actually thought that Baret was a transvestite, or mahu.Dunmore, pp. 96–100Ridley, pp. 165–169 However, other Tahitian natives reported the presence of a woman in Bougainville's expedition to later visitors to the island, including James Cook in 1769 and Domingo de Bonechea in 1772,Anne Salmond, Aphrodite's Island, pp. 164, 255–256 which indicates that her gender was known to the Tahitians if not to her shipmates at the time she visited the island. After crossing the Pacific, the expedition was desperately short of food. After a brief stop for supplies in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), the ships made a longer stop at the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. This island, known as Isle de France, was then an important French trading station. Commerson was delighted to find that his old friend and fellow botanist Pierre Poivre was serving as governor on the island, and Commerson and Baret remained behind as Poivre's guests. Probably Bougainville also actively encouraged this arrangement, as it allowed him to rid himself of the problem of a woman illegally on board his expedition.Dunmore, pp. 102, 158–164Ridley, pp. 205–210 On Mauritius, Baret continued in her role as Commerson's assistant and housekeeper. It is likely that she accompanied him in plant-collecting on Madagascar and Bourbon Island in 1770–1772. Commerson continued to have serious health problems, and he died in Mauritius in February 1773. His financial resources on the island had dwindled, his patron Poivre had been recalled to Paris. Baret, meanwhile, seems to have established herself independently, being granted property in Port Louis in 1770.Clode, p. 257 Later life After Commerson's death, Baret ran a tavern in Port Louis. She was fined 50 livres for serving alcohol on Sundays in 1773Clode p. 274 Then, on May 17, 1774, she married Jean Dubernat, a non-commissioned officer in the French Army who was most likely on the island on his way home to France.Dunmore, pp. 180–182Ridley, pp. 231–232 Jeanne brought a small fortune to her marriage, presumably from the tavern and perhaps other business ventures she ran on the island.Clode, p. 289 There is no record of exactly when Baret and her husband arrived in France, thus completing her voyage of circumnavigation. Most likely it was sometime in 1775. In April 1776, she received the money that was due to her under Commerson's will after applying directly to the Attorney General.Dunmore, pp. 182–185Ridley, pp. 235–236 With this money, she settled with Dubernat in his native village of Saint-Aulaye where they bought property with Jeanne's wealth and lived with both Dubernat and Jeanne's nieces and nephews.Clode p. 376 In 1785, Baret was granted a pension of 200 livres a year by the Ministry of Marine. The document granting her this pension makes clear the high regard with which she was held by this point: > Jeanne Barré, by means of a disguise, circumnavigated the globe on one of > the vessels commanded by Mr de Bougainville. She devoted herself in > particular to assisting Mr de Commerson, doctor and botanist, and shared > with great courage the labours and dangers of this savant. Her behaviour was > exemplary and Mr de Bougainville refers to it with all due credit.... His > Lordship has been gracious enough to grant to this extraordinary woman a > pension of two hundred livres a year to be drawn from the fund for invalid > servicemen and this pension shall be payable from 1 January 1785.Dunmore, > pp. 185–186 She died in Saint-Aulaye on August 5, 1807, at the age of 67.Dunmore, p. 188Ridley, p. 241  Legacy and controversy  Solanum baretiae Commerson named many of the plants he collected after friends and acquaintances. One of them, a tall shrub with dark green leaves and white flowers that he found on Madagascar, he named Baretia bonafidia. But Commerson's name for this genus did not survive, as it had already been named by the time his reports reached Paris; it is currently known as Turraea.Dunmore, p. 168Ridley, pp. 219–220 While over seventy species are named in honor of Commerson, only one, Solanum baretiae, honors Baret. The New York Botanical Garden includes a plant specimen, attributed to Comerson but believed to be collected by Baret with him, in their herbarium. For many years, Bougainville's published journal – a popular bestseller in its day, in the original French as well as in English translations – was the only widely available source of information about Baret. More recent scholarship has uncovered additional facts and documentation about her life, but much of the new information remained little- known and inaccessible to the general public, particularly outside France. The first English-language biography of Baret, by John Dunmore, was not published until 2002, and then only in New Zealand. Other articles appeared only in scholarly journals. The 2010 biography of Baret by Glynis Ridley, The Discovery of Jeanne Baret, brought Baret to the attention of a wider audience and helped to overturn some of the old misconceptions about her life.\\"A Female Explorer Discovered On The High Seas\\", NPR, December 26, 2010 However, Ridley's biography has also been highly criticized by some reviewers for its reliance on improbable chains of speculation that are not corroborated by any other primary or secondary sources.Sandra Knapp, The plantswoman who dressed as a boy, Nature 470, 36–37 (3 February 2011).\\"Incredible Voyage\\", The Wall Street Journal, January 24, 2011 New researchMaguet, Nicolle, and Sophie Miquel. 2019. \\"De l'océan Indien aux rives de la Dordogne: le retour de Jeanne Barret après son tour du monde.

Creech translated Lucretius into verse in 1682, for which he received a Fellowship at Oxford. He also produced English versions of Manilius, Horace, Theocritus, and other classics. Life He was born at Blandford Forum, Dorset. His father, also called Thomas Creech, died in 1720, and his mother, Jane Creech, died in 1693; they had two children, Thomas the translator and one daughter Bridget, who married Thomas Bastard, an architect of Blandford, and had issue six sons and four daughters. Creech's parents were not rich. His classical training was due to Thomas Curgenven, rector of Folke in Dorset, but best known as master of Sherborne school, to whom Creech afterwards dedicated his translation of the seventh idyll of Theocritus, and to whom he acknowledged his debt in the preface to his translation of Horace. His education was supported from Colonel Strangways, a member of a well-known county family. In Lent term 1675 Creech was admitted as a commoner at Wadham College, Oxford, and placed under the tuition of Robert Pitt. Creech's translation of one of the idylls of Theocritus is inscribed to his \\"chum Mr. Hody of Wadham College\\", and another is dedicated to Robert Balch, who at a later date was his \\"friend and tutor\\". Two of his letters are printed in Evelyn's Diary. He was elected a scholar of his college 28 September 1676, and took degrees: B.A. 27 October 1680, M.A. 13 June 1683, and B.D. 18 March 1696. He was a reputed scholar, and one of the first to benefit by William Sancroft's reforms in the elections for fellowships at All Souls' College, where he was elected a fellow in 1683. For two years (1694–6) he was the headmaster of Sherborne School, but he then returned to Oxford, where a strangeness of manner was noticed in 1698. He accepted the college living of Welwyn, to which he was instituted 25 April 1699, but never entered into residence. After he had been missing for five days he was discovered (in July 1700) to have committed suicide in a garret in the house of Mr. Ives, an apothecary, with whom he lodged. He had wished to marry Miss Philadelphia Playdell of St. Giles, Oxford, but her friends would not consent to the marriage. In his will, dated 18 January 1699, and proved 28 June 1700, he divided his means into two parts, one of which he left to his sister Bridget Bastard for the use of his father during his lifetime and afterwards for herself, while he left the other moiety to Miss Playdell and appointed her sole executrix. She later married Ralph Hobson, butler of Christ Church, Oxford, and died in 1706, aged 34. He was also short of money. There were printed after his death two tracts: * A Step to Oxford, or a Mad Essay on the Reverend Mr. Tho. Creech's hanging himself (as 'tis said) for love. With the Character of his Mistress, 1700. * Daphnis, or a Pastoral Elegy upon the unfortunate and much-lamented death of Mr. Thomas Creech, 1700; second edition (corrected) 1701, and it is also found in ‘A Collection of the best English Poetry,’ vol. i. 1717. His portrait, three-quarters oval in a clerical habit, was given by Humphrey Bartholomew to the picture gallery at Oxford. It was engraved by R. White and also by Van der Gucht. Works Creech's 1682 translation of Lucretius vied in popularity with John Dryden's Virgil and Alexander Pope's Homer. A second edition appeared in the following year with extra commendatory verses in Latin and English, some of which bore the names of Nahum Tate, Thomas Otway, Aphra Behn, Richard Duke, and Edmund Waller; and when Dryden published his translations from Theocritus, Lucretius, and Horace, he made flattering comments on Creech's work in the preface. Creech's Lucretius was often reprinted, and was included in the edition of the British poets which was issued by Robert Anderson. An edition appeared in 1714 containing translations of verses previously omitted and numerous notes from another hand designed to set forth a complete system of Epicurean philosophy. The success of his translation of Lucretius induced Creech to undertake an edition of the original work. It appeared in 1695 with the title 'Titi Lucretii Cari de rerum natura libri sex, quibus interpretationem et notas addidit Thomas Creech,' and was dedicated to his friend Christopher Codrington. This edition was also often republished, in particular at Glasgow in 1753. Creech's agreement with Abel Swalle for the preparation of this volume is among the Ballard MSS. at the Bodleian Library. H. A. J. Munro in his edition of LucretiusVol. i. 1886 ed. p. 17 of introduction. wrote of Creech as borrowing annotations mainly from Lambinus, attributing the popularity of the work to their clarity and brevity. In 1684 Creech published 'The Odes, Satyrs, and Epistles of Horace. Done into English;' it was reprinted in the same year, and again in 1688, 1715, 1720, and 1737. Other translations by Creech consisted of: * Several elegies from Ovid with the second and third eclogues of Virgil in a collection of 'Miscellany Poems,' 1684. * Laconick Apothegms, or remarkable sayings of the Spartans in 'Plutarch's Morals,' 1684, vol. i. pt. iii. 135–204; a Discourse concerning Socrates his Demon, ib. ii. pt. vi. 1–59; the first two books of the Symposiacks, ib. ii. pt. vi. 61–144, iii. pt. viii. 139–418. * Lives of Solon, Pelopidas, and Cleomenes in Plutarch's Lives, 1683–6, 5 vols., an edition often reprinted in the first half of the eighteenth century. * Idylliums of Theocritus, with Rapin's discourse of Pastorals, done into English, 1684, and reprinted in 1721, which was dedicated to Arthur Charlett. * The thirteenth Satire of Juvenal, with notes, in the translation 'by Mr. Dryden and other eminent hands,' 1693. * Verses of Santolius Victorinus, prefixed to 'The compleat Gard'ner of de la Quintinye, made English by John Evelyn,' 1693. * The five books of M.

Figure 1: Block diagram for asymptotic gain model Figure 1 shows a block diagram that leads to the asymptotic gain expression. The asymptotic gain relation also can be expressed as a signal flow graph. See Figure 2. The asymptotic gain model is a special case of the extra element theorem. Figure 2: Possible equivalent signal-flow graph for the asymptotic gain model Definition of terms As follows directly from limiting cases of the gain expression, the asymptotic gain G∞ is simply the gain of the system when the return ratio approaches infinity: :G_{\\\\infty} = G\\\\ \\\\Big |_{T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\ , while the direct transmission term G0 is the gain of the system when the return ratio is zero: :G_{0} = G\\\\ \\\\Big |_{T \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\ . Advantages * This model is useful because it completely characterizes feedback amplifiers, including loading effects and the bilateral properties of amplifiers and feedback networks. * Often feedback amplifiers are designed such that the return ratio T is much greater than unity. In this case, and assuming the direct transmission term G0 is small (as it often is), the gain G of the system is approximately equal to the asymptotic gain G∞. * The asymptotic gain is (usually) only a function of passive elements in a circuit, and can often be found by inspection. * The feedback topology (series-series, series-shunt, etc.) need not be identified beforehand as the analysis is the same in all cases. Implementation Direct application of the model involves these steps: # Select a dependent source in the circuit. # Find the return ratio for that source. # Find the gain G∞ directly from the circuit by replacing the circuit with one corresponding to T = ∞. # Find the gain G0 directly from the circuit by replacing the circuit with one corresponding to T = 0. # Substitute the values for T, G∞ and G0 into the asymptotic gain formula. These steps can be implemented directly in SPICE using the small- signal circuit of hand analysis. In this approach the dependent sources of the devices are readily accessed. In contrast, for experimental measurements using real devices or SPICE simulations using numerically generated device models with inaccessible dependent sources, evaluating the return ratio requires special methods. Connection with classical feedback theory Classical feedback theory neglects feedforward (G0). If feedforward is dropped, the gain from the asymptotic gain model becomes ::G = G_{\\\\infin} \\\\frac {T} {1+T} =\\\\frac {G_{\\\\infin}T}{1+\\\\frac{1} {G_{\\\\infin}} G_{\\\\infin} T} \\\\ , while in classical feedback theory, in terms of the open loop gain A, the gain with feedback (closed loop gain) is: ::A_\\\\mathrm{FB} = \\\\frac {A} {1 + {\\\\beta}_\\\\mathrm{FB} A} \\\\ . Comparison of the two expressions indicates the feedback factor βFB is: :: \\\\beta_\\\\mathrm{FB} = \\\\frac {1} {G_{\\\\infin}} \\\\ , while the open-loop gain is: :: A = G_{\\\\infin} \\\\ T \\\\ . If the accuracy is adequate (usually it is), these formulas suggest an alternative evaluation of T: evaluate the open-loop gain and G∞ and use these expressions to find T. Often these two evaluations are easier than evaluation of T directly. Examples The steps in deriving the gain using the asymptotic gain formula are outlined below for two negative feedback amplifiers. The single transistor example shows how the method works in principle for a transconductance amplifier, while the second two-transistor example shows the approach to more complex cases using a current amplifier. =Single-stage transistor amplifier= right Consider the simple FET feedback amplifier in Figure 3. The aim is to find the low-frequency, open-circuit, transresistance gain of this circuit G = vout / iin using the asymptotic gain model. Figure 4: Small-signal circuit for transresistance amplifier; the feedback resistor Rf is placed below the amplifier to resemble the standard topology Figure 5: Small-signal circuit with return path broken and test voltage driving amplifier at the break The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4, where the transistor is replaced by its hybrid-pi model. Return ratio It is most straightforward to begin by finding the return ratio T, because G0 and G∞ are defined as limiting forms of the gain as T tends to either zero or infinity. To take these limits, it is necessary to know what parameters T depends upon. There is only one dependent source in this circuit, so as a starting point the return ratio related to this source is determined as outlined in the article on return ratio. The return ratio is found using Figure 5. In Figure 5, the input current source is set to zero, By cutting the dependent source out of the output side of the circuit, and short- circuiting its terminals, the output side of the circuit is isolated from the input and the feedback loop is broken. A test current it replaces the dependent source. Then the return current generated in the dependent source by the test current is found. The return ratio is then T = −ir / it. Using this method, and noticing that RD is in parallel with rO, T is determined as: :T = g_\\\\mathrm{m} \\\\left( R_\\\\mathrm{D}\\\\ ||r_\\\\mathrm{O} \\\\right) \\\\approx g_\\\\mathrm{m} R_\\\\mathrm{D} \\\\ , where the approximation is accurate in the common case where rO >> RD. With this relationship it is clear that the limits T → 0, or ∞ are realized if we let transconductance gm → 0, or ∞.Although changing RD // rO also could force the return ratio limits, these resistor values affect other aspects of the circuit as well. It is the control parameter of the dependent source that must be varied because it affects only the dependent source. Asymptotic gain Finding the asymptotic gain G∞ provides insight, and usually can be done by inspection. To find G∞ we let gm → ∞ and find the resulting gain. The drain current, iD = gm vGS, must be finite. Hence, as gm approaches infinity, vGS also must approach zero. As the source is grounded, vGS = 0 implies vG = 0 as well.Because the input voltage vGS approaches zero as the return ratio gets larger, the amplifier input impedance also tends to zero, which means in turn (because of current division) that the amplifier works best if the input signal is a current. If a Norton source is used, rather than an ideal current source, the formal equations derived for T will be the same as for a Thévenin voltage source. Note that in the case of input current, G∞ is a transresistance gain. With vG = 0 and the fact that all the input current flows through Rf (as the FET has an infinite input impedance), the output voltage is simply −iin Rf. Hence :G_{\\\\infty} = \\\\frac{v_\\\\mathrm{out}}{i_\\\\mathrm{in}} = -R_\\\\mathrm{f}\\\\ . Alternatively G∞ is the gain found by replacing the transistor by an ideal amplifier with infinite gain - a nullor. Direct feedthrough To find the direct feedthrough G_0 we simply let gm → 0 and compute the resulting gain. The currents through Rf and the parallel combination of RD |rO must therefore be the same and equal to iin. The output voltage is therefore iin (RD |rO). Hence :G_0 = \\\\frac{v_{out}}{i_{in}} = R_D\\\\|r_O \\\\approx R_D \\\\ , where the approximation is accurate in the common case where rO >> RD. Overall gain The overall transresistance gain of this amplifier is therefore: :G = \\\\frac{v_{out}}{i_{in}} = -R_f \\\\frac{g_m R_D}{1+g_m R_D} + R_D \\\\frac{1}{1+g_m R_D} = \\\\frac{R_D\\\\left(1-g_m R_f\\\\right)}{1+g_m R_D}\\\\ . Examining this equation, it appears to be advantageous to make RD large in order make the overall gain approach the asymptotic gain, which makes the gain insensitive to amplifier parameters (gm and RD). In addition, a large first term reduces the importance of the direct feedthrough factor, which degrades the amplifier. One way to increase RD is to replace this resistor by an active load, for example, a current mirror. Figure 6: Two-transistor feedback amplifier; any source impedance RS is lumped in with the base resistor RB. =Two-stage transistor amplifier= Figure 7: Schematics for using asymptotic gain model; parameter α = β / ( β+1 ); resistor RC = RC1. Figure 6 shows a two-transistor amplifier with a feedback resistor Rf. This amplifier is often referred to as a shunt- series feedback amplifier, and analyzed on the basis that resistor R2 is in series with the output and samples output current, while Rf is in shunt (parallel) with the input and subtracts from the input current. See the article on negative feedback amplifier and references by Meyer or Sedra. That is, the amplifier uses current feedback. It frequently is ambiguous just what type of feedback is involved in an amplifier, and the asymptotic gain approach has the advantage/disadvantage that it works whether or not you understand the circuit. Figure 6 indicates the output node, but does not indicate the choice of output variable. In what follows, the output variable is selected as the short-circuit current of the amplifier, that is, the collector current of the output transistor. Other choices for output are discussed later. To implement the asymptotic gain model, the dependent source associated with either transistor can be used. Here the first transistor is chosen. Return ratio The circuit to determine the return ratio is shown in the top panel of Figure 7. Labels show the currents in the various branches as found using a combination of Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws. Resistor R1 = RB // rπ1 and R3 = RC2 // RL. KVL from the ground of R1 to the ground of R2 provides: : i_\\\\mathrm{B} = -v_{ \\\\pi} \\\\frac {1+R_2/R_1+R_\\\\mathrm{f}/R_1} {(\\\\beta +1) R_2} \\\\ . KVL provides the collector voltage at the top of RC as :v_\\\\mathrm{C} = v_{ \\\\pi} \\\\left(1+ \\\\frac {R_\\\\mathrm{f}} {R_1} \\\\right ) -i_\\\\mathrm{B} r_{ \\\\pi 2} \\\\ . Finally, KCL at this collector provides : i_\\\\mathrm{T} = i_\\\\mathrm{B} - \\\\frac {v_\\\\mathrm{C}} {R_\\\\mathrm{C}} \\\\ . Substituting the first equation into the second and the second into the third, the return ratio is found as :T = - \\\\frac {i_\\\\mathrm{R}} {i_\\\\mathrm{T}} = -g_\\\\mathrm{m} \\\\frac {v_{ \\\\pi} }{i_\\\\mathrm{T}} ::: = \\\\frac {g_\\\\mathrm{m} R_\\\\mathrm{C}} { \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac {R_\\\\mathrm{f}} {R_1} \\\\right) \\\\left( 1+ \\\\frac {R_\\\\mathrm{C}+r_{ \\\\pi 2}}{( \\\\beta +1)R_2} \\\\right) +\\\\frac {R_\\\\mathrm{C}+r_{ \\\\pi 2}}{(\\\\beta +1)R_1} } \\\\ . Gain G0 with T = 0 The circuit to determine G0 is shown in the center panel of Figure 7. In Figure 7, the output variable is the output current βiB (the short-circuit load current), which leads to the short-circuit current gain of the amplifier, namely βiB / iS: :: G_0 = \\\\frac { \\\\beta i_B} {i_S} \\\\ . Using Ohm's law, the voltage at the top of R1 is found as :: ( i_S - i_R ) R_1 = i_R R_f +v_E \\\\ \\\\ , or, rearranging terms, :: i_S = i_R \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac {R_f}{R_1} \\\\right) +\\\\frac {v_E} {R_1} \\\\ . Using KCL at the top of R2: :: i_R = \\\\frac {v_E} {R_2} + ( \\\\beta +1 ) i_B \\\\ . Emitter voltage vE already is known in terms of iB from the diagram of Figure 7. Substituting the second equation in the first, iB is determined in terms of iS alone, and G0 becomes: ::G_0 = \\\\frac { \\\\beta } { ( \\\\beta +1) \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{R_f}{R_1} \\\\right ) +(r_{ \\\\pi 2} +R_C ) \\\\left[ \\\\frac {1} {R_1} + \\\\frac {1} {R_2} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac {R_f} {R_1} \\\\right ) \\\\right] } Gain G0 represents feedforward through the feedback network, and commonly is negligible. Gain G∞ with T → ∞ The circuit to determine G∞ is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 7. The introduction of the ideal op amp (a nullor) in this circuit is explained as follows. When T → ∞, the gain of the amplifier goes to infinity as well, and in such a case the differential voltage driving the amplifier (the voltage across the input transistor rπ1) is driven to zero and (according to Ohm's law when there is no voltage) it draws no input current. On the other hand, the output current and output voltage are whatever the circuit demands. This behavior is like a nullor, so a nullor can be introduced to represent the infinite gain transistor. The current gain is read directly off the schematic: :: G_{ \\\\infty } = \\\\frac { \\\\beta i_B } {i_S} = \\\\left( \\\\frac {\\\\beta} {\\\\beta +1} \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac {R_f} {R_2} \\\\right) \\\\ . Comparison with classical feedback theory Using the classical model, the feed-forward is neglected and the feedback factor βFB is (assuming transistor β >> 1): :: \\\\beta_{FB} = \\\\frac {1} {G_{\\\\infin}} \\\\approx \\\\frac {1} {(1+ \\\\frac {R_f}{R_2} )} = \\\\frac {R_2} {(R_f + R_2)} \\\\ , and the open-loop gain A is: ::A = G_{\\\\infin}T \\\\approx \\\\frac {\\\\left( 1+\\\\frac {R_f}{R_2} \\\\right) g_m R_C} { \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac {R_f} {R_1} \\\\right) \\\\left( 1+ \\\\frac {R_C+r_{ \\\\pi 2}}{( \\\\beta +1)R_2} \\\\right) +\\\\frac {R_C+r_{ \\\\pi 2}}{(\\\\beta +1)R_1} } \\\\ . Overall gain The above expressions can be substituted into the asymptotic gain model equation to find the overall gain G. The resulting gain is the current gain of the amplifier with a short-circuit load. =Gain using alternative output variables= In the amplifier of Figure 6, RL and RC2 are in parallel. To obtain the transresistance gain, say Aρ, that is, the gain using voltage as output variable, the short-circuit current gain G is multiplied by RC2 // RL in accordance with Ohm's law: :: A_{ \\\\rho} = G \\\\left( R_\\\\mathrm{C2} // R_\\\\mathrm{L} \\\\right) \\\\ . The open-circuit voltage gain is found from Aρ by setting RL → ∞. To obtain the current gain when load current iL in load resistor RL is the output variable, say Ai, the formula for current division is used: iL = iout × RC2 / ( RC2 \\\\+ RL ) and the short-circuit current gain G is multiplied by this loading factor: :: A_i = G \\\\left( \\\\frac {R_{C2}} {R_{C2}+ R_{L}} \\\\right) \\\\ . Of course, the short-circuit current gain is recovered by setting RL = 0 Ω.

During the Roman Republic, dux could refer to anyone who commanded troops, including foreign leaders, but was not a formal military rank. In writing his commentaries on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar uses the term only for Celtic generals, with one exception for a Roman commander who held no official rank.Thomas Wiedemann, “The Fetiales: A Reconsideration,” Classical Quarterly 36 (1986), p. 483. The Roman called dux is Publius Crassus, who was too young to hold a commission; see discussion of his rank. Roman Empire =Original usage= Until the 3rd century, dux was not a formal expression of rank within the Roman military or administrative hierarchy.Fergus Millar, The Roman Near East, 31 B.C.-A.D. 337 (Harvard University Press, 1993), pg. 191 online In the Roman military, a dux would be a general in charge of two or more legions. While the title of dux could refer to a consul or imperator, it usually refers to the Roman governor of the provinces. As the governor, the dux was both the highest civil official as well as the commander-in-chief of the legions garrisoned within the province. = Change in usage = By the mid-3rd century AD, it had acquired a more precise connotation defining the commander of an expeditionary force, usually made up of detachments (i.e. vexillationes) from one or more of the regular military formations. Such appointments were made to deal with specific military situations when the threat to be countered seemed beyond the capabilities of the province-based military command structure that had characterised the Roman army of the High Empire. From the time of Gallienus onwards for more than a century duces were invariably Viri Perfectissimi, i.e. members of the second class of the Equestrian Order.) Thus, they would have out-ranked the commanders of provincial legions, who were usually Viri Egregii - equestrians of the third class. Duces differed from praesides who were the supreme civil as well as military authority within their provinces in that the function of the former was purely military. However, the military authority of a dux was not necessarily confined to a single province and they do not seem to have been subject to the authority of the governor of the province in which they happened to be operating. It was not until the end of the 3rd century that the term dux emerged as a regular military rank held by a senior officer of limitanei - i.e. frontier troops as opposed those attached to an Imperial field-army (comitatenses) - with a defined geographic area of responsibility =The office under the Dominate= During the time of the Dominate, the powers of a dux were split from the role of the governor and were given to a new office called dux. The dux was now the highest military office within the province and commanded the legions, but the governor had to authorize the use of the dux's powers. But once authorized, the dux could act independently from the governor and handled all military matters. An example would be the Dux per Gallia Belgica who was the dux of the province of Gallia Belgica. After Diocletian's Tetrarchy reform, the provinces were organized into dioceses each administered by a vicarius. As with the governors, the vicarius was assisted by a dux. This dux was superior to all other duces within the dioceses and when the vicarius called the legions of the dioceses into action, all of the legions were at the dux's command. An example would be the Dux per Gallia who was the dux of the dioceses of Gaul. The office of dux was, in turn, made subject to the magister militum of his respective praetorian prefecture, and above him to the emperor. Later developments In the Byzantine era of the Roman Empire, the position of dux survived (Byzantine Greek: \\"δούξ\\", doux, plural \\"δούκες\\", doukes) as a rank equivalent to a general (strategos). In the late 10th and early 11th centuries, a doux or katepano was in charge of large circumscriptions consisting of several smaller themata and of the professional regiments (tagmata) of the Byzantine army (as opposed to the largely militia- like forces of most themata). In the Komnenian period, the title of doux replaced altogether the strategos in designating the military official in charge of a thema. In the Byzantine navy, doukes of the fleet appear in the 1070s, and the office of megas doux (\\"grand duke\\") was created in the 1090s as the commander-in-chief of the entire navy. The title also gave rise to a family name, the aristocratic Doukas clan, which in the 9th–11th centuries provided several Byzantine emperors and generals, while later bearers of the name (maternally descended from the original family) founded the Despotate of Epirus in northwestern Greece. Post-Roman uses King Arthur, in one of his earliest literary appearances, is described as dux bellorum (\\"dux of battles\\") among the kings of the Romano-Britons in their wars against the Anglo-Saxons. A chronicle from St Martin's monastery in Cologne states that the monastery had been pillaged by the Saxons in 778, but that it was rebuilt by an \\"Olgerus, dux Daniæ\\" (who may have been the historical person around whom the myth of Ogier the Dane formed), with the help of Charlemagne. Dux is also the root of various high feudal noble titles of peerage rank, such as the English duke, the French duc, the Spanish and Portuguese duque, the Venetian doge, the Italian duca and duce, and the Byzantine Greek dukas or doukas (Gr. δούκας) (see Doukas). Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini used the title of dux (and duce in Italian) to represent his leadership. One fascist motto was \\"DVX MEA LVX\\", Latin for \\"[The] Duce [is] my light\\" or \\"[The] Leader [is] my light\\".DUCE-MUSSOLINI, delcampe.it; accessed 15 May 2016. In pre-revolutionary Russia, the Dux Factory built bicycles, automobiles and aircraft in Moscow. =Education= * In Scotland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand dux is a modern title given to the highest-ranking student in academic, arts or sporting achievement (Dux Litterarum, Dux Artium and Dux Ludorum respectively) in each graduating year.

T. Crofton Croker's autograph Thomas Crofton Croker (15 January 1798 - 8 August 1854) was an Irish antiquary, best known for his Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (1825–1828), and who also showed considerable interest in Irish song and music. Although Fairy Legends purported to be an anthology of tales Croker had collected on his field trips, he had lost his manuscript notes and the work had to be reconstructed with the help of friends. He did not acknowledge his debt satisfactorily in the estimation of Thomas Keightley, who voiced his complaint publicly, and soon published his own rival work. The other collaborators generally allowed Croker to take credit, notably William Maginn, though after his death his kinsmen insisted Maginn had written four or more of the tales. Croker retracted ten tales in his third edition of (1834), and after his death, a fourth edition (1859) appeared which was prefaced with a memoir written by his son. William Butler Yeats, who appropriated a number of tales for his anthology, characterised Croker as belonging to the class of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, and criticised him for comic distortions of the Irish tradition, an assessment echoed by other Irish critics. Bridget G. MacCarthy wrote a biographical paper that scrutinises Croker's habit of publishing writings by others under his own name. Defenders of Croker include Justin McCarthy and Neil C. Hultin. Life and works  Croker. Family-owned portrait. Croker was born in the city of Cork. At age 15, he apprenticed in business. During the years 1812 to 1815 he travelled the south of Ireland and began collecting legends and songs. Croker took one Irish coronach (keening) that he collected in Cork in 1813, and translated it into English prose, which was published in the Morning Post in 1815 and caught the attention of the poet George Crabbe in 1817, through the intermediary of the antiquary . Croker also showed talent as an artist, and his works were exhibited at Cork in 1817 (\\"pen-sketches of pilot-boats\\"), but he abandoned art in favour of a literary pursuit. Around 1818, he sent to the poet Thomas Moore a set of about forty ancient Irish air or songs, and some collected poetry, and Moore used the material in editions of his Irish Melodies. After his father's death on 22 March 1818, the estate was managed by his distant relative (or of no relation), John Wilson Croker who was then Secretary of the Admiralty, and who procured him a position as clerk there, a position he would retain for thirty years until his retirement in 1850. He was a man of short stature, measuring 4 feet 10½ inches tall, and described by Sir Walter Scott as \\"Little as a dwarf, keen eyed as a hawk and of very prepossessing manners—something like Tom Moore\\". Croker eventually devoted himself largely to the collection of ancient Irish poetry and Irish folklore. = Researches in the South of Ireland = Croker's first book, Researches in the South of Ireland (1824), was well- received by fellow-antiquaries. According to Croker in his preface, the book was illustrated with pencil drawings by Miss Nicholson and Alfred Nicholson (1788–1833) (his future wife and brother-in-law) who accompanied him on the field trip gathering material. = Fairy Legends = Researches was followed by Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (1825–1828), which enjoyed immense popular success. This would be Croker's most important work. Walter Scott praised the book in a letter, and commended it in his own works. The first part was published in 1825; and was translated into German by the Brothers Grimm (Irische Elfenmärchen, 1826). Parts two and three followed in 1828. Part three consisted of the long Grimm essay on fairies (prefaced to the Elfenmärchen) Croker translated, coupled with a section on Welsh fairy tales written by an unidentified female correspondent. The first edition of Fairy Legends was illustrated with woodcuts by W. H. Brooke; while the second edition was supplied with original drawings by Cork's Daniel Maclise, though undergoing stylistic modifications by the engraver, Brooke. The third edition, three volumes in one was published in 1834. The work went through a total of six editions during the 19th century. It was instrumental in attracting a wider audience to traditional Irish tales, not just within the English- speaking world, but farther abroad. However, Croker modified the tales according to his own inclinations, and has been criticised for adding too literary a style, and contrived humour to the tales.  Collaboration controversy  Sitting portrait. Because Croker had lost the manuscript after collecting it from the field, he had to reconstruct the anthology through help from other writers, such as William Maginn, David Richard Pigot, his friend Joseph Humphreys, Thomas Keightley, and R. Adolphus Lynch of Killarney. The first 1825 edition of Fairy Legends and Traditions did not even bear Croker's name, owing to this being a collaborative effort. Humphreys, a Quaker, was a companion during Croker's excursions into the south 1812–1815. Samuel Carter Hall named himself as the contributor of two tales, and Charles Dod of Parliamentary Companion as another collaborator.Hall, S. C. (1879) A Memory of Thomas Moore, cited by In Fairy Legends, the credit for the first piece \\"The Legend of Knocksheogowna\\" and three others were claimed by Maginn, including the prominent \\"Daniel O'Rourke\\". But according to Croker, the manuscript of \\"Daniel O'Rourke\\" was in the handwriting of Humphreys, touched up by Maginn, and further altered by Croker before going into print. Though such production that entails modification at multiple stages may be poorly countenanced by the modern folklorist, it is pointed out that such methodology is not so distant from the one practiced by the Grimms at the time., \\"Introduction\\", p. xxv, cited by . Croker eventually took sole credit, and kept all of the proceeds from the book's financial success, but of these collaborators, only Keightley publicly voiced protest, and Keightley went on to publish his own Fairy Mythology in 1828. In the wake of it, Croker published the 1834 third edition that eliminated portions of competing claims, reducing the number of tales from 50 down to 40, and purged of \\"most of the copious notes\\", of which the comparative notes Keightley claimed to have supplied. Literary scholar Bridget G. MacCarthy gave a modern-day view criticism of Croker's dodging his way out of attributing the effort of collaborators., e.g. \\"since the stories were well-known folk-tales, Croker had a loop-hole of escape\\", p. 551; \\"very digressive and confusing description\\", p. 551; \\"No one knew better the slippery tactics of the Leprechaun\\", p. 552; \\" So far from allaying existing doubts this preface renders confusion more confused\\", p. 553; \\"busy shrouding authorship in mystery\\", p. 554.  Daniel O'Rourke on stage  Croker adapted the tale \\"Daniel O'Rourke\\" into a Christmas Pantomime under the title \\"Harlequin and the Eagle\\", and performed in 1826 at the Adelphi Theatre, for the sake of actor Daniel Terry. The actor had obtained ownership of the theatre, with considerable financial backing from Walter Scott, who was the friend of the actor's. Scott lavished praises on the pantomime at a meeting with Croker. Though it has been told anecdotally that it was Scott's idea to turn this into a play, Croker had this notion earlier, as evidenced in his notes to Fairy Legends. The play was published as Daniel O'Rourke, or Rhymes of a Pantomime, with a second edition appearing in 1828. = Noviomagus = In 1828, Croker participated in an excavation of the Roman site Noviomagus in Kent, and together with some members of the Society of Antiquaries, formed a club named \\"Noviomagian Society\\", for which Croker was voted president. = Legends of the Lakes = Croker's third book, Legends of the Lakes; or, Sayings and Doings at Killarney (1829) was both a critical and commercial disappointment. It was written in the form of a guided tour through the landscapes of at Killarney, interspersed with legends told in the dialect of the peasantry. He also featured discussions of the music of his friend the Irish piper James Gandsey, of some interest to bagpipe or uilleann pipe musicology. = Later life = Headstone, Brompton Cemetery, London Croker married in 1830 Marianne Nicholson (1792–1854), daughter of Francis Nicholson. T. F. Dillon Croker FSA, FRGS, was their son and only child. Croker assisted in founding the Camden Society (1838) and Percy Society (1840). He edited The Keen of the South of Ireland (1844) for the Percy Society. The first item in this collection (in the preface) was a keen composed in Irish by the mother of Flory Sullivan, collected in Gougane Barra, Co. Cork in 1813. Croker translation of it into English got published in the Morning Post in 1815, as already noted above, and caught notice of poet George Crabbe in 1817. It was an earlier version which was shown to Crabbe in correspondence, but on Crabbe's advice Croker had revised the translation to a more simplified version, more in keeping with the original Irish. B. G. MacCarthy notes that he did not actually translated the keen himself as pass off the labor of native Irish informants such as Mrs. Harrington as his own, and when left to his own devices, Croker \\"merely revealed ignorance\\" of the Irish language. He and his wife's testimonies about funereal customs, particularly the tradition of keening the deceased are among the earliest and most significant contributions to the understanding of the Irish language lament and the accompanying traditions. Croker died in Old Brompton, London, England on 8 August 1854, and lies buried in Brompton Cemetery. His wife survived him but briefly, passing away on 6 October 1854.  Analysis  = Attitude to folklore = Croker did not present his folklore as he found them, but reinvented them in his own literary style, as pointed out by numerous commentators, even cursory ones. The sort of mixing of folklore and literature was also carried out by contemporaries such as Walter Scott in Scotland. But Croker the antiquarian betrayed a \\"patronizing\\" attitude toward his subject, the Irish common folk steeped in tradition. Croker was an Anglo-Irishman (like Keightley), or as Yeats put it, part of the \\"harum-scarum Irish gentility\\" (like Lover). Yeats was not the only one to charge Croker with viewing the lore of the Irish peasantry in a tinted \\"humorised\\" light; this gratuitous mockery was also noted, for example, by folklorist Seán Ó Súilleabháin. Yeats repeatedly refers to the class that \\"imagined [Ireland] as a humorist's Arcadia\\", and continues \\"Their work [i.e., of the early folklore collectors] had the dash as well as the shallowness of an ascendant and idle class, and in Croker is touched everywhere with beauty – a gentle Arcadian beauty\\". Literary scholar Neil C. Hultin also defended the author. Hultin was well aware that Irish critics bristled at Croker's comic caricatures of the Irish and their brogue, but refrained from himself criticising Croker for insensitivity. Hultin co-wrote with Warren U. Ober the introduction to Croker's reissued Fairy Legends (1993), which also depicted Croker in a sympathetic light, stating that he showed genuine affection for the peasantry, and commiseration for the oppression felt by Ireland. Hultin and Ober have suggested that Croker was trapped between two polar-opposite stereotypes of the Irish: both \\"intelligent, sensitive\\" and \\"headstrong, violent\\". = On ancient manuscript records = Croker was contemptuous of Irish annals such as the Annals of the Four Masters, and manuscripts such as the Book of Ballymote which contained narratives and poetry, calling them \\"the monkish chronicles\\" or \\"relics\\", and stating in a cavalier manner that Irish history would not suffer at all at \\"the total loss of the legendary records of an age of ignorance and superstition\\"., citing Researches in the South of Ireland: chap. xviii, P. 334 He claimed to be capable of reading Irish manuscripts, but it is doubtful whether he had any real proficiency in the Irish language.

He was rector of St Stephen Walbrook in the City of London from 1835 until his death. Early life Croly was born in Dublin. His father was a physician. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin with an MA in 1804. The college was to award him an honorary LLD in 1831. He was ordained in 1804, and served as a curate at a parish in the diocese of Meath until around 1810. Then, accompanied by his widowed mother, his brother Henry and his sisters, he moved to London. Finding himself unable to obtain preferment in the church, he dedicated himself to a literary career.White p.334 Literary career Croly was a leading contributor to the Literary Gazette and Blackwood's Magazine, from the establishment of both in 1817, and was also associated with the Tory magazine Britannia. He worked as a theatre critic for the New Times and later as a foreign correspondent. He wrote poems, plays, satires, novels, history, and theological works, and achieved some measure of success in all. Perhaps his best known works were his novels, Salathiel (1828), based on the legend of the Wandering Jew, and Marston (1846). His main contribution to theological literature was an exposition of the Apocalypse. His hymns included Spirit of God, descend upon my heart written in 1854. Religious appointments In 1832 he was put in charge of the parish of Romford in Essex, while the vicar was unable to carry out his duties due to illness. The editor of the Literary Gazette, William Jerdan, had previously attempted to procure a living for him, but this had proved unsuccessful, the reason (according to Croly's obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine) being a confusion between him and another clergyman, a former Roman Catholic, with a similar name. In 1835, however, through the influence of Lord Brougham, a distant relative of his wife he was appointed rector of St Stephen Walbrook in the City of London, a position he held until his death. He had previously turned down Brougham's offer of a remote living on the edge of Dartmoor. His son Frederick wrote: > This parish being very small, and most of the parishioners non-resident, the > new rector could still devote a large portion of his time to general > literature. A still greater advantage of his new position was, that it > afforded an opportunity of exercising in a metropolitan church those > remarkable powers as a preacher, which had been comparatively thrown away > upon a rural congregation. The church of St Stephen's, previously almost > deserted, soon became filled, under the influence of this powerful > attraction, with a large and attentive congregation, most of whom came from > a considerable distance. In 1847 he was appointed afternoon preacher to the Foundling Hospital, but soon resigned after criticism from its governors, who felt that his style was unsuitable for a congregation consisting mainly of children and servants. In his letter of resignation, Croly wrote \\"Christianity is a manly religion, addressed to manly understandings, and which ought to be preached in a manly language.\\"White p.335 He usually preached extemporare. S.C. Hall described him as having \\"‘a sort of rude and indeed angry eloquence that would have stood him in better stead at the bar than in the pulpit.\\"Dictionary of National Biography, quoting Hall's Book of Memories, pp. 232–3 Family In 1819 Croly married Margaret Helen Begbie, whom he had come to know though his work for the Literary Gazette, to which she was also a contributor. They had five sons and a daughter. His eldest son, George Alfred, a lieutenant in the 26th Bengal Native Infantry, died at the Battle of Ferozeshah in 1845, aged 23. His wife died in 1851, and he lost his nine-year-old daughter a few months later.Croly, F.W.

She also wrote for children. Life Catherinen Ann Stevens was born in Borough Green, Kent, England. She was educated at home, spending most of her childhood in Kent. She married an army officer, Major John Crowe (1783–1860). They had a son, John William (born 1823), but the marriage was an unhappy one, and when she met Sydney Smith and his family at Clifton, Bristol in 1828, she asked them for their help. Little is known about the next few years, but by 1838 she was separated from her husband, living in Edinburgh, and had made the acquaintance of several writers, including the impecunious Thomas de Quincey of Edinburgh, and Harriet Martineau and William Makepeace Thackeray of London. Smith was also an encouragement to her in her writing. Her success waned somewhat in the later 1850s and she sold her copyrights in 1861. After 1852, she lived mainly in London and abroad, but she moved to Folkestone in 1871, where she died the following year.Joanne Wilkes: \\"Crowe, Catherine Ann...\\" In: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: OUP, 2004; online e., May 2008 Retrieved 22 September 2010. Subscription required. Writings Crowe's two plays, the verse tragedy Aristodemus (1838) and the melodrama The Cruel Kindness (1853) both had historical themes paralleling her own family problems. Both were published and the second also had a short run in London in 1853. The book that established Crowe as a novelist was The Adventures of Susan Hopley (1841). It was followed by Men and Women (1844), the well-received The Story of Lily Dawson (1847), The Adventures of a Beauty (1852), and Linny Lockwood (1854). Though set in middle-class life, they had complicated, sensational plots, while also commenting on the predicaments of Victorian women brought up in seclusion to be mistreated by those men who did not subscribe to standards of decent behaviour. This aspect of her writing was emphasised particularly by later women writers in an appreciation in Women Novelists of Queen Victoria's Reign (1897). Susan Hopley was reprinted many times, and to her annoyance, dramatised and turned into a penny serial. Her stories were also in demand from periodicals such as the weekly Chambers' Edinburgh Journal and Dickens's Household Words. The play Susan Hopley; or, The Vicissitudes of a Servant Girl, adapted from Crowe's novel by George Dibdin Pitt, opened at the Royal Victoria Theatre in 1841 and became a long- running success. By 1849, it had been performed 343 times. Crowe turned increasingly to supernatural subjects, inspired by German writers. Her collection The Night-side of Nature (1848) became her most popular work and was reprinted as recently as 2000. It was translated into German and French, and is said to have influenced the views of Charles Baudelaire. Her own involvement in such matters came to a bizarre culmination in February 1854, when she was discovered naked in Edinburgh one night, convinced that spirits had rendered her invisible.

The cemetery is for Roman Catholics and is located at 839-A South King Street, . It is maintained by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and has been the final resting place for many Roman Catholics from Honolulu before 1930. The cemetery is open from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. daily. The cemetery is closed to further burials by the Hawaii Department of Health. Central iron cross above the graves of the Vicars Apostolic The origins of the cemetery were two separate lots. The first lot was given by the Kingdom of Hawaii to the Roman Catholic mission during the 1840s and was identified by the title \\"Claim No. 4\\". The second lot was purchased by several wealthy Catholics and given to the Roman Catholic mission. Originally on the outskirts of the village of Honolulu, with the makai side consisting of estuarine wetlands and man-made ponds for the harvesting of sea salt (or paakai in Hawaiian). The Waikiki side of the cemetery was the old Plantation and rice paddies. In 1889, the cemetery consisted of scattered graves and overrunning paths. Wealthier Catholics ensured that their private plots were enclosed by wooden or iron fences and a tombstone. Msgr. Koeckemann erected the tall iron cross in the center of the cemetery. He was eventually laid to rest under the cross. Several other bishops of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, (Msgri. Gulstan Ropert, Libert H. Boeynaems, and Stephen Alencastre) were also buried next to Msgr. Koeckemann. Remains of some forty of the early members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts also lay buried since 1853 in a common grave on site. Other notable people buried in this cemetery include: the native Hawaiian patriot and former delegate to the United State Congress, Robert William Wilcox; Princess Eugenie Ninito Sumner of Tahiti, wife of High Chief John Kapilikea Sumner, and friend of Queen Liliuokalani. Montgomery family crypt at the entrance to the cemetery In 1889, shortly after his arrival in Honolulu, Father Valentin Franckx, SS.CC., former pastor of Saint Augustine by the Sea Catholic Church in Waikīkī laid out a central road and side paths in the cemetery so that each lot could be reached without walking over neighboring lots. Many trees were removed and in 1892, Father Valentin planted the stately royal palms that line the main lane to the cemetery. Father Valentin reported that a society was organized for the upkeep and improvement of the cemetery. Members paid an annual fee of five dollars. A permanent sexton was appointed and anyone acquiring a lot paid ten dollars for a grave and another ten dollars for the digging. The makai portion of the cemetery was found to be unfit for digging to the six-foot depth required by the Board of Health. Ficus growing on gravesite To alleviate encountering ground water during burials, Father Valentin approved the importation of new soil from the nearby Armory. After the closure of the cemetery by the Board of Health, the vicariate made arrangements for Catholic interments at Diamond Head Memorial Park. As of 2004, the lots closest to King Street are watered and maintained better. Those plots further in (close to the Hawaiian Electric Company yard) appear to be minimally maintained, if at all. Several grave markers are sequestered at the corner of what appears to have been a chapel and tree roots from a Ficus have obscured the original plots.

Nayyar worked extensively with singers Geeta Dutt, Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi, though not with leading Bollywood female singer Lata Mangeshkar. Early life and career Nayyar was born in Lahore, British India (present Pakistan). He then underwent music training. He composed the background score for Kaneez (1949), and 1952's Aasmaan (produced by Dalsukh M. Pancholi), was his first film as music director. Nayyar then composed music for Chham Chhama Chham (1952) and Baaz (1953). Film producer, director and actor Guru Dutt enlisted him to compose and conduct music for Aar Paar (1954), Mr. & Mrs. '55 (1955) and C.I.D. (1956). Nayyar's early work was primarily performed by Shamshad Begum, Geeta Dutt and Mohammed Rafi, with Asha Bhosle introduced in C.I.D. Nayyar never worked with Lata Mangeshkar, though her song Saari Saari Raat Teri Yaad Satayein from the 1958 film Aji Bas Shukriyawas used in the 1973 Hindi film Taxi Driver, for which he was the music director. In 1957 Filmalaya introduced Nasir Hussain, who wanted a composer to provide romantic scores for newcomers Shammi Kapoor and Ameeta. Nayyar's scores were featured in the Hussain films Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957) and Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon (1964). During the decade, state-controlled All India Radio banned most of Nayyar's songs because the broadcaster considered them too \\"trendy\\".O.P.Nayyar’s immortal relationship with Mohammad Rafi Rafians tribute to a true Maestro – Mohd Rafi.

According to music and film expert Rajesh Subramanian, \\"Aap Ke Haseen Rukh\\" (from Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi) was planned with full orchestration but many of the musicians were late for the recording. After a disagreement with Mohammed Rafi, Nayyar began working with singer Mahendra Kapoor. Kapoor performed Nayyar's song \\"Badal Jaaye Agar Maali, Chaman Hotaa Nahi Khaali\\" in Bahaaren Phir Bhi Aayengi. Based on a Bengali language work by Rabindranath Tagore, Nayyar composed \\"Chal Akelaa, Chal Akelaa\\" (sung by Mukesh in 1969 film Sambandh). Nayyar co-produced songs with Shamshad Begum (including \\"Kajra Mohabbatwala\\"), and after Madhubala's 1969 death Vyjayanthimala, Sadhana, Mala Sinha, Padmini, Asha Parekh and Sharmila Tagore lip-synced several Nayyar- Bhosle songs. Nayyar and Bhosle parted ways in 1974, and he then worked with Dilraj Kaur, Alka Yagnik, Krishna Kalle, Vani Jayaram and Kavita Krishanmurthy. Majrooh Sultanpuri and Sahir Ludhianvi wrote the lyrics for some of Nayyar's earlier songs, including \\"Naya Daur\\". Nayyar also worked with developing lyricists such as Jan Nisar Akhtar, Qamar Jalalabadi, S. H. Bihari and Ahmed Wasi. He began the tradition of assigning full, three-minute songs to comedians. Om Prakash sang Nayyar's \\"Churi Bane Kanta Bane\\" in Jaali Note and Eent ki dukhi paan ka ikka in Howrah Bridge and Johnny Walker sang \\"Aye Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahaan\\" in CID, \\"Jaane Kahan Mera Jigar Gaya Jee\\" in Mr. & Mrs. 55, \\"Main Bambaika Baaboo, Naam Meraa Anjaanaa\\" in Naya Daur and \\"Bajewala\\" in Basant. In addition to songs for Asha Bhosle and Geeta Dutt's, Thandi Thandi Hawaa, Nayyar wrote \\"Yeh Desh Hai Veer Jawaanonkaa\\" (featuring Dilip Kumar and Ajit) for Naya Daur (1957). The song earned him the 1958 Filmfare Best Music Director Award. The last Nayyar song performed by Bhosle was \\"Chain Se Humko Kabhi\\". Intended for Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1973), disappeared in the film's final cut but won Bhosle the 1975 Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer. Nayyar was less active in the 1970s and did not compose music for younger actors such as Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan. His films included Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Guru Dutt, Dharmendra, Shammi Kapoor, Joy Mukherjee, Biswajit, Feroz Khan, Bharat Bhushan, Madhubala, Asha Parekh, Sadhana, Mumtaz, Sharmila Tagore, Rajshree, Rekha, Ameeta and Shyama. In addition to Hindi films, Nayyar composed for Neerajanam in Telugu. He made a brief comeback during the 1990s with Mangni and Nishchay in 1992 and Zid in 1994. O.P. Nayyar played a major part in shaping up Asha's career, but Asha rarely mentions it. She mentions S. D. Burman's name instead. Why OP and Asha parted away in 1974, both of them never talked about it. Personal life In retirement Nayyar stayed in touch with only a few people, including Gajendra Singh and Ahmed Wasi; Singh included him as a judge for his television show, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. Wasi interviewed Nayyar twice on Vividh Bharati and presented a series of six one-hour episodes, Mujhe Yaad Sab Hai Zaraa Zaraa, about his life. He had two brothers: P. P. (a physician) and G. P.

The company was acquired by Brocade Communications Systems on December 18, 2008. History Brocade FastIron Edge 24-port switch, front Brocade FastIron Edge 24-port switch, back Foundry FastIron II Plus chassis with two fiber management cards and six 16-port gigabit Ethernet cards The company was founded in 1996 by Bobby R. Johnson, Jr. and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California, United States. In its first year the company operated under the names Perennium Networks and StarRidge Networks, but by January 1997 the name Foundry Networks was adopted. Foundry Networks had their initial public offering in 1999, during the Internet bubble, with the company reaching a valuation of $9 billion on its first day of trading on NASDAQ with the symbol FDRY. Foundry Networks designed, manufactured and sold high-end enterprise and service provider switches and routers, as well as wireless, security, and traffic management solutions. It was best known for its Layer 2 & 3 Ethernet switches. Foundry Networks was the first company to build and ship a gigabit Ethernet switch in 1997; to build a Layer 3 switch, also in 1997; to build the first Layer 4-7 switch in 1998 and to include 10 Gigabit Ethernet single connectors in its boxes (since 2001). Foundry Networks early product lines consisted of the Workgroup, Backbone, and ServerIron products. The TurboIron all GigE switch and then router models were later introduced. Foundry Networks' later product lines consisted of the BigIron, EdgeIron, FastIron, IronPoint, NetIron, SecureIron, and ServerIron. After the early BigIron modular chassis, the Mucho Grande (MG) series chassis were introduced. Later the RX series in 4, 8, 16, and 32 slot versions. The largest and final product, the XMR was a full rack sized switch/router. Their software products included IronView and ServerIron TrafficWorks. According to a Dell’Oro report published in 1Q2006, Foundry Networks ranked number 4 in a total market share of over US$3,659 million, and its ServerIron application switch ranked first for total port shipments.B NET Article - Foundry ServerIron App Switch keeps Worldwide Leadership (archived)B NET Article - Foundry ServerIron App Switch keeps Worldwide Leadership (archived)  Acquisition On July 21, 2008, Foundry management agreed to allow the company to be acquired by storage networking company Brocade Communications Systems for approximately $3 billion in cash and stock.

He went to Oxford, where he became Public Orator. Crowe was a clergyman and Rector of Alton Barnes in Wiltshire. He wrote a smooth, but somewhat conventional poem, Lewesdon Hill in 1789, edited William Collins's Poems in 1828, and lectured on poetry at the Royal Institution. His poems were collected in 1804 and 1827. Life William Crowe was born at Midgham, Berkshire, and baptised 13 October 1745. His father, a carpenter by trade, lived during Crowe's childhood at Winchester, where the boy occasionally sang as a chorister in Winchester College chapel. At the election in 1758, he was placed on the roll for admission as a scholar at the college, and was duly elected a \\"poor scholar\\". He was fifth on the roll for New College, Oxford at the election in 1764, and succeeded to a vacancy on 11 August 1765. After two years of probation he was admitted as Fellow in 1767, and became a tutor of his college. On 10 October 1773, he took the degree of B.C.L. Crowe continued to hold his fellowship until November 1783, although, according to Thomas Moore, he had several years previously married \\"a fruitwoman's daughter at Oxford\\" and had become the father of several children. In 1782, on the presentation of his college, he was admitted to the rectory of Stoke Abbott in Dorset, which he exchanged for Alton Barnes in Wiltshire in 1787, and on 2 April 1784 he was elected the public orator of Oxford University. This position and the rectory of Alton Barnes, Crowe retained until his death in 1829, and the duties of oratorship he discharged until he was advanced in years. According to the Clerical Guide Crowe was also rector until his death at Llanymynech in Denbighshire, from 1805, and incumbent of Saxton in Yorkshire, valued at about £80 a year, from the same date. A portrait of Crowe is preserved in New College library. A grace for the degree of D.C.L. was passed by his college on 30 March 1780, but he does not seem to have proceeded to take it. Crowe and Samuel Rogers were close friends. After a short illness, he died at Queen Square, Bath, Somerset on 9 February 1829, aged 83. Reputation Anecdotes were told of his eccentric speech and his rustic manners. In politics he was an extreme Whig, close to being a republican, and he sympathised with the early stages of the French Revolution. He was accustomed to walk from his living in Wiltshire to his college at Oxford. His appearances in the pulpit or in the Sheldonian theatre at Oxford were always welcomed by the graduates of the university; his Latin sermons at St. Mary's or his orations at commemoration, graced as they were by a fine rich voice, enjoyed great popularity. Crowe was interested in architecture, and occasionally read a course of lectures on that subject in New College hall. The merits of his lectures at the Royal Institution on poetry were praised by Thomas Frognall Dibdin. When he visited Horne Tooke at Wimbledon, a considerable portion of his time was spent in the garden. He was skilled in valuing timber, from associating with farmers. His portrait as \\"a celebrated public orator\\" was drawn by Robert Dighton January 1808 in full-length academicals and with a college cap in his hand. Works Lewesdon Hill is Crowe's poem on a hill in the western part of Dorset, on the edge of the parish of Broadwindsor, of which Tom Fuller was rector, and near Crowe's benefice of Stoke Abbott. The poet is depicted as climbing the hill-top on a May morning and describing the prospect, with its associations, which his eye surveys. The first edition, issued anonymously and dedicated to Jonathan Shipley, was published at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, in 1788. A second impression, with its authorship avowed, was demanded in the same year, and later editions, in a much enlarged form, and with several other poems, were published in 1804 and 1827. Crowe's other works were: * ‘A Sermon before the University of Oxford at St. Mary's, 5 Nov. 1781.’ * ‘On the late Attempt on her Majesty's Person, a sermon before the University of Oxford at St. Mary's, 1786.’ * ‘Oratio ex Instituto ... Dom. Crew.’ 1788. From the preface it appears that the oration was printed in refutation of certain slanders as to its character which had been circulated. It contained his views on the Glorious Revolution of 1688. * ‘Oratio Crewiana,’ 1800. On poetry and the poetry professorship at Oxford. * ‘Hamlet and As you like it, a specimen of a new edition of Shakespeare’; anonymous by Thomas Caldecott and Crowe, 1819, with later editions in 1820 and 1832. The two authors contemplated a new edition of Shakespeare. Caldecott was Crowe's schoolfellow at Winchester and lifelong friend. * ‘A Treatise on English Versification,’ 1827, dedicated to Caldecott. * ‘Poems of William Collins, with notes, and Dr. Johnson's Life, corrected and enlarged,’ Bath, 1828. Crowe's son died in battle in 1815, and in Notes and Queries 1st ser. vii. 6, 144 (1853), there is a Latin monody by his father on his loss. His verses intended to have been spoken at the theatre at Oxford on the installation of the Duke of Portland as chancellor were praised by Rogers and Moore. His sonnet to Petrarch is included in the collections of English sonnets by Robert Fletcher Housman and Alexander Dyce. Crowe contributed articles to Rees's Cyclopædia, but the topics are not known.

With Duarte Lobo and John IV of Portugal, he represented the \\"golden age\\" of Portuguese polyphony. Cardoso is not known to be related to an older contemporary composer of the same name; the precentor Manuel Cardoso, who published a book of Latin passions in Leiria in 1575. Cardoso was born in Fronteira, near Portalegre, most likely in 1566. He attended the Colégio dos Moços do Coro, a choir school associated with the Évora cathedral, studying with Manuel Mendes and Cosme Delgado. In 1588 he joined the Carmelite order, taking his vows in 1589. In the early 1620s he was resident at the ducal household of Vila Viçosa, where he was befriended by the Duke of Barcelos--later to become King John IV. For most of his career he was the resident composer and organist at the Carmelite Convento do Carmo in Lisbon. Cardoso's works are models of Palestrinian polyphony, and are written in a refined, precise style which completely ignores the development of the Baroque idiom elsewhere in Europe. His style has much in common with Tomás Luis de Victoria, in its careful treatment of dissonance, occasional polychoral writing, and frequent cross-relations, which were curiously common among both Iberian and English composers of the time. Three books of masses survive; many of the works are based on motets written by King John IV himself, and others are based on motets by Palestrina. Cardoso was widely published, often with the help of King John IV to defray costs. Many of his works--especially the elaborate polychoral compositions, which probably were the most progressive--were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake and fire of 1755.

History The islands were settled by American Loyalists in the late 1780s who set up cotton plantations maintained by over 1,000 slaves. After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire the plantations became uneconomical, and the replacement income from sponge diving has now dwindled as well with the rest of the natural sponge industry after the advent of synthetics. The inhabitants now live by fishing and small-scale farming. Map of the Bahamas Although Acklins Island has relatively few historical landmarks, there are some noteworthy places. Acklins is home to numerous Lucayan people sites. An ancient site, thought to be one of the largest Lucayan settlements in The Bahamas, sits along Pompey Bay Beach, just south of Spring Point. Ten ancient Lucayan sites have been unearthed by National Geographic Society archeologists on Samana Cay alone, which is northeast of Spring Point in Acklins.

Precursors Prior to the construction of the canal, there had been several plans over the previous 50 years to build a ship canal from the Bristol Channel to the English Channel, in order to avoid the route around Cornwall and Devon. The first which would have connected Chard to the canal network was a scheme surveyed in 1769 by Robert Whitworth, to link the River Parrett to Seaton in Devon. Whitworth was asked to reassess this route in the early 1790s, and again thought it was feasible. The plan was revived in 1793, while another route was suggested in 1794 by Josiah Easton, again passing through Chard. The 1793 Chard Canal plan was revived in 1809, by now renamed as the English and Bristol Channels Canal, and the engineer John Rennie was asked to survey it in 1810. He advocated a small ship canal, suitable for vessels up to 120 tons. The cost of a barge canal had been estimated at £70,000, but Rennie's estimate for a ship canal was £1.33M. One further attempt to build a ship canal took place in 1825, when a canal capable of taking vessels of 200 tons, with a draught of was proposed. 30 locks would have been required, on a canal from Stolford on the Bristol Channel to Beer on the English Channel, passing through Creech St Michael, Ilminster and Chard, at an estimated cost of £1.7M. Thomas Telford produced the survey, an Act of Parliament was obtained on 6 July 1825, and although subscriptions of over £1.5M were promised, no further action occurred, with the Company disappearing after 1828. History With the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal having opened in 1827, there was further initiative to link Chard to it, and James Green carried out a survey in 1831. The route was long, but with Chard some higher than the canal at Creech St Michael, his plan involved two boat lifts, two inclined planes and two tunnels, and was costed at £57,000. An Act of Parliament was obtained in June 1834, authorising the raising of £57,000, with an additional £20,000 if required, but local enthusiasm for the scheme was muted, and most of the capital was provided by just five men, all of whom were involved in the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. Work began at Wrantage in June 1835, but the Act did not allow parts of the canal to be built until tunnelling was well- advanced, and so work on the upper sections did not start until Autumn 1837. Green was replaced as engineer by Sydney Hall from the start of construction, and in view of the problems Green was experiencing on the Grand Western Canal with commissioning his boat lifts, Hall decided to replace the lifts with inclined planes instead. Further changes to the original plans were made above Ilminster inclined plane, where another tunnel was constructed, enabling the line of the canal to be built at a lower level. A lock was added at Bere Mills, to raise the line by and the length of the Chard incline was increased. Construction costs were much higher than anticipated, and another Act of Parliament was obtained in March 1840, allowing the Company to raise another £80,000 in shares, and to obtain a mortgage for £26,000, while a third Act in 1841 allowed construction to continue beyond the original seven year limit. The canal opened to Ilminster on 15 May 1841, and to Dowlish Ford wharfs on 3 February 1842. There were delays caused by the rope on the Wrantage plane breaking, resulting in damage to the caissons, and further delays caused by the Bristol and Exeter Railway constructing their line under the canal at Creech, but the work was finally completed on 24 May 1842. There were immediate benefits to the community, as coal prices fell, but the total cost of construction had been about £140,000, and as income was only a third of what had been projected, the canal company was never able to meet even the interest payments on its debts. Operation The canal was designed for tub- boats which were . The inclines at Thornfalcon, Wrantage and Ilminster were double-acting inclines, consisting of two parallel tracks, each containing a six-wheeled caisson, in which the boats floated. A chain linked the two caissons together, passing round a horizontal drum situated at the top of the incline. Power for the movement of the boats was provided by over-filling the top caisson, the extra weight causing that caisson to descend and the other to rise. Because the majority of traffic passed up the canal, and a boat displaces its own weight in water (Archimedes' principle), considerably more water passed down the incline than up it. However, the system was still more economical than using locks, and a large new Chard Reservoir supplied the necessary water. The incline at Chard Common was quite different, consisting of a single track, with the tub-boats being carried on a cradle with four wheels. Power was supplied by a Whitelaw and Stirrat water turbine, with a head, which used of water per minute. Boats were raised in a wheeled cradle up a slope of 1:10. The cradle was attached to the turbine by a substantial wire rope, after breakages of the original rope. The Ilminster tunnel was wide, allowing boats travelling in opposite directions to pass, but the tunnels at Lillesdon and Crimson Hill were only wide enough for one boat. However the Crimson Hill Tunnel has a double width \\"passing area\\" about halfway through its course to allow passing of the boats from either direction. The main cargoes were coal and stone. Traffic for the first three years rose from 25,835 tons to 33,284 tons, about two thirds of which was coal or culm (anthracite). Competition started immediately, with the railway arriving at Taunton in 1842, and the Westport Canal being completed in 1840. Attempts were made to convert the canal to a railway, and an Act of Parliament obtained in 1847 changed the name of the Company to the Chard Railway Company, but successive plans were thwarted by the inability of the Company to repay its debts. The canal went into receivership in 1853, after which there were discussions with the Bristol and Exeter Railway and the London and South Western Railway, with a view to building a branch to Chard. A new Chard Railway Company was constituted in 1860, and another Company was formed in 1861, to construct a branch from Taunton to Chard. The London and South Western Railway took over the Chard Railway, and the Bristol and Exeter built the branch from Taunton to Chard. In order to prevent competition from the L&SWR;, the Bristol and Exeter Railway bought the Grand Western Canal, the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal and the Chard Canal, so that the L&SWR; could not. They paid £5,945 for the Chard Canal, with the takeover and closing of the canal being authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1867. The receivers were discharged in February 1868, and it seems likely that the canal was closed then. Remains The canal aqueduct at Wrantage now supports farm buildings The Chard reservoir, which was the main supply for the canal, was sold to Lord Poulett. In 1990, South Somerset District Council bought it, and it is now a designated nature reserve. Surrounded by woodland, it provides habitat for over 150 species of birds. The remains of the inclines have survived over 140 years of neglect, as have the three tunnels. Near Lower Farm, a bridge on the Thornfalcon to Creech road is now a grade II listed structure, and the three-arched aqueduct which carried the canal over the River Tone is largely intact, although it no longer has its parapets. During World War II part of the Taunton Stop Line invasion defence project ran along the canal.

The height of the kinetic energy decreases as the orbiting body's speed decreases and distance increases according to Kepler's laws. In astrodynamics or celestial mechanics, an elliptic orbit or elliptical orbit is a Kepler orbit with an eccentricity of less than 1; this includes the special case of a circular orbit, with eccentricity equal to 0. In a stricter sense, it is a Kepler orbit with the eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 (thus excluding the circular orbit). In a wider sense, it is a Kepler's orbit with negative energy. This includes the radial elliptic orbit, with eccentricity equal to 1. In a gravitational two-body problem with negative energy, both bodies follow similar elliptic orbits with the same orbital period around their common barycenter. Also the relative position of one body with respect to the other follows an elliptic orbit. Examples of elliptic orbits include: Hohmann transfer orbit, Molniya orbit, and tundra orbit. Velocity Under standard assumptions the orbital speed (v\\\\,) of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed from the vis-viva equation as: :v = \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu\\\\left({2\\\\over{r}} - {1\\\\over{a}}\\\\right)} where: *\\\\mu\\\\, is the standard gravitational parameter, *r\\\\, is the distance between the orbiting bodies. *a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the length of the semi-major axis. The velocity equation for a hyperbolic trajectory has either + {1\\\\over{a}}, or it is the same with the convention that in that case a is negative.  Orbital period  Under standard assumptions the orbital period (T\\\\,\\\\\\\\!) of a body travelling along an elliptic orbit can be computed as: :T=2\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{a^3\\\\over{\\\\mu}} where: *\\\\mu\\\\, is the standard gravitational parameter, *a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the length of the semi- major axis. Conclusions: *The orbital period is equal to that for a circular orbit with the orbital radius equal to the semi-major axis (a\\\\,\\\\\\\\!), *For a given semi-major axis the orbital period does not depend on the eccentricity (See also: Kepler's third law). Energy Under standard assumptions, the specific orbital energy (\\\\epsilon\\\\,) of an elliptic orbit is negative and the orbital energy conservation equation (the Vis-viva equation) for this orbit can take the form: :{v^2\\\\over{2}}-{\\\\mu\\\\over{r}}=-{\\\\mu\\\\over{2a}}=\\\\epsilon<0 where: *v\\\\, is the orbital speed of the orbiting body, *r\\\\, is the distance of the orbiting body from the central body, *a\\\\, is the length of the semi-major axis, *\\\\mu\\\\, is the standard gravitational parameter. Conclusions: *For a given semi-major axis the specific orbital energy is independent of the eccentricity. Using the virial theorem we find: *the time-average of the specific potential energy is equal to −2ε **the time-average of r−1 is a−1 *the time-average of the specific kinetic energy is equal to ε = Energy in terms of semi major axis = It can be helpful to know the energy in terms of the semi major axis (and the involved masses). The total energy of the orbit is given by :E = - G \\\\frac{M m}{2a}, where a is the semi major axis.  Derivation  Since gravity is a central force, the angular momentum is constant: :\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{L}} = \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times F(r)\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}} = 0 At the closest and furthest approaches, the angular momentum is perpendicular to the distance from the mass orbited, therefore: :L = r p = r m v. The total energy of the orbit is given by :E = \\\\frac{1}{2}m v^2 - G \\\\frac{Mm}{r}. We may substitute for v and obtain :E = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{L^2}{mr^2} - G \\\\frac{Mm}{r}. This is true for r being the closest / furthest distance so we get two simultaneous equations which we solve for E: :E = - G \\\\frac{Mm}{r_1 + r_2} Since r_1 = a + a \\\\epsilon and r_2 = a - a \\\\epsilon, where epsilon is the eccentricity of the orbit, we finally have the stated result. Flight path angle The flight path angle is the angle between the orbiting body's velocity vector (= the vector tangent to the instantaneous orbit) and the local horizontal. Under standard assumptions of the conservation of angular momentum the flight path angle \\\\phi satisfies the equation: :h\\\\, = r\\\\, v\\\\, \\\\cos \\\\phi where: * h\\\\, is the specific relative angular momentum of the orbit, * v\\\\, is the orbital speed of the orbiting body, * r\\\\, is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the central body, * \\\\phi \\\\, is the flight path angle \\\\psi is the angle between the orbital velocity vector and the semi-major axis. u is the local true anomaly. \\\\phi = u + \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} - \\\\psi, therefore, :\\\\cos \\\\phi = \\\\sin(\\\\psi - u) = \\\\sin\\\\psi\\\\cos u - \\\\cos\\\\psi\\\\sin u = \\\\frac{1 + e\\\\cos u}{\\\\sqrt{1 + e^2 + 2e\\\\cos u}} where e is the eccentricity. The angular momentum is related to the vector cross product of position and velocity, which is proportional to the sine of the angle between these two vectors. Here \\\\phi is defined as the angle which differs by 90 degrees from this, so the cosine appears in place of the sine. Equation of motion =From Initial Position and Velocity= An orbit equation defines the path of an orbiting body m_2\\\\,\\\\\\\\! around central body m_1\\\\,\\\\\\\\! relative to m_1\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, without specifying position as a function of time. If the eccentricity is less than 1 then the equation of motion describes an elliptical orbit. Because Kepler's equation M = E - e \\\\sin E has no general closed-form solution for the Eccentric anomaly (E) in terms of the Mean anomaly (M), equations of motion as a function of time also have no closed-form solution (although numerical solutions exist for both). However, closed-form time-independent path equations of an elliptic orbit with respect to a central body can be determined from just an initial position (\\\\mathbf{r}) and velocity (\\\\mathbf{v}). For this case it is convenient to use the following assumptions which differ somewhat from the standard assumptions above: :# The central body’s position is at the origin and is the primary focus (\\\\mathbf{F1}) of the ellipse (alternatively, the center of mass may be used instead if the orbiting body has a significant mass) :# The central body’s mass (m1) is known :# The orbiting body’s initial position(\\\\mathbf{r}) and velocity(\\\\mathbf{v}) are known :# The ellipse lies within the XY-plane The fourth assumption can be made without loss of generality because any three points (or vectors) must lie within a common plane. Under these assumptions the second focus (sometimes called the “empty” focus) must also lie within the XY-plane: \\\\mathbf{F2} = \\\\left(f_x,f_y\\\\right) . Using Vectors The general equation of an ellipse under these assumptions using vectors is: : |\\\\mathbf{F2} - \\\\mathbf{r}+ |\\\\mathbf{r}= 2a \\\\qquad\\\\mid z=0 where: *a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the length of the semi-major axis. *\\\\mathbf{F2} = \\\\left(f_x,f_y\\\\right) is the second (“empty”) focus. *\\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\left(x,y\\\\right) is any (x,y) value satisfying the equation. The semi-major axis length (a) can be calculated as: :a = \\\\frac{\\\\mu |\\\\mathbf{r}|}{2\\\\mu - |\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\mathbf{v}^2} where \\\\mu\\\\ = Gm_1 is the standard gravitational parameter. The empty focus (\\\\mathbf{F2} = \\\\left(f_x,f_y\\\\right)) can be found by first determining the Eccentricity vector: :\\\\mathbf{e} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r}}{|\\\\mathbf{r}|} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times \\\\mathbf{h}}{\\\\mu} Where \\\\mathbf{h} is the specific angular momentum of the orbiting body: :\\\\mathbf{h} = \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} Then :\\\\mathbf{F2} = 2a\\\\mathbf{e} Using XY Coordinates This can be done in cartesian coordinates using the following procedure: The general equation of an ellipse under the assumptions above is: : \\\\sqrt{ \\\\left(f_x - x\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(f_y - y\\\\right)^2} + \\\\sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 } = 2a \\\\qquad\\\\mid z=0 Given: :r_x, r_y \\\\quad the initial position coordinates :v_x, v_y \\\\quad the initial velocity coordinates and :\\\\mu = Gm_1 \\\\quad the gravitational parameter Then: :h = r_x v_y - r_y v_x \\\\quad specific angular momentum :r = \\\\sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2} \\\\quad initial distance from F1 (at the origin) :a = \\\\frac{\\\\mu r}{2\\\\mu - r \\\\left(v_x^2 + v_y^2 \\\\right)} \\\\quad the semi-major axis length :e_x = \\\\frac{r_x}{r} - \\\\frac{h v_y}{\\\\mu} \\\\quad the Eccentricity vector coordinates :e_y = \\\\frac{r_y}{r} + \\\\frac{h v_x}{\\\\mu} \\\\quad Finally, the empty focus coordinates :f_x = 2 a e_x \\\\quad :f_y = 2 a e_y \\\\quad Now the result values fx, fy and a can be applied to the general ellipse equation above.  Orbital parameters  The state of an orbiting body at any given time is defined by the orbiting body's position and velocity with respect to the central body, which can be represented by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (position of the orbiting body represented by x, y, and z) and the similar Cartesian components of the orbiting body's velocity. This set of six variables, together with time, are called the orbital state vectors. Given the masses of the two bodies they determine the full orbit. The two most general cases with these 6 degrees of freedom are the elliptic and the hyperbolic orbit. Special cases with fewer degrees of freedom are the circular and parabolic orbit. Because at least six variables are absolutely required to completely represent an elliptic orbit with this set of parameters, then six variables are required to represent an orbit with any set of parameters. Another set of six parameters that are commonly used are the orbital elements. Solar System In the Solar System, planets, asteroids, most comets and some pieces of space debris have approximately elliptical orbits around the Sun. Strictly speaking, both bodies revolve around the same focus of the ellipse, the one closer to the more massive body, but when one body is significantly more massive, such as the sun in relation to the earth, the focus may be contained within the larger massing body, and thus the smaller is said to revolve around it. The following chart of the perihelion and aphelion of the planets, dwarf planets and Halley's Comet demonstrates the variation of the eccentricity of their elliptical orbits. For similar distances from the sun, wider bars denote greater eccentricity. Note the almost-zero eccentricity of Earth and Venus compared to the enormous eccentricity of Halley's Comet and Eris. Radial elliptic trajectory A radial trajectory can be a double line segment, which is a degenerate ellipse with semi-minor axis = 0 and eccentricity = 1. Although the eccentricity is 1, this is not a parabolic orbit. Most properties and formulas of elliptic orbits apply. However, the orbit cannot be closed. It is an open orbit corresponding to the part of the degenerate ellipse from the moment the bodies touch each other and move away from each other until they touch each other again. In the case of point masses one full orbit is possible, starting and ending with a singularity. The velocities at the start and end are infinite in opposite directions and the potential energy is equal to minus infinity. The radial elliptic trajectory is the solution of a two-body problem with at some instant zero speed, as in the case of dropping an object (neglecting air resistance). History The Babylonians were the first to realize that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic was not uniform, though they were unaware of why this was; it is today known that this is due to the Earth moving in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with the Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion. In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun at one focus, and described this in his first law of planetary motion. Later, Isaac Newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation.

It offered passage to free black Americans to the ACS colony in west Africa. It bought land from chiefs of the indigenous Africans. Because of his influence in fundraising and education about the ACS, Gurley is considered one of the founders of Liberia, which he named. Biography Gurley was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, and gained an early education. He graduated from Yale College, B.A. in 1818. He moved to Washington, D.C., where he was licensed to preach as a Presbyterian. On May 25, 1827, he married Eliza McLellan (1810?-1872). \\\\- (Note: different spelling in Gurley source - Eliza McLellen (1812-1872, uncertain). They had a large family, including William Henry Fitzhugh (1820) (this seems questionable as this birth was seven years before the couple married), Felicia Liberia Heneaus (1829), Ralph Randolph (1832-1833), Eliza (1834), Julia (1835), Mary Custis (1836), Ralph Randolph Gurley (b. 1841), Archibald Alexander (1841), Marion Ann Muirhead (1844), John McDonough \\"Mackie\\" (1846), and Caroline Rose Gurley (1847-died in infancy). From 1822, Gurley began to work with the American Colonization Society. Although he was never ordained as a minister, Gurley was also appointed to serve as Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives for the 21st and 22nd Congresses (1829-1833), and again for the 30th and 31st (1847-1851), opening each day's proceedings with a prayer. American Colonization Society Starting as a young man of about 25, Gurley acted as the agent and secretary of the American Colonization Society from 1822, soon after its founding, until 1872. By that time the West African colony founded by the Society had declared independence in 1847 as the Republic of Liberia. The ACS was founded as an uneasy alliance of abolitionists and slaveholders. Members of each group were seeking solutions to the place of free people of color or free blacks in United States society. Together members of this group proposed to relocate free American blacks to a new colony in West Africa. Chapters of the ACS were set up in several southern states, some of which initially funded their own relocation efforts to property they purchased in contiguous parcels along the African coast. Eventually they allowed it to be absorbed into the larger ACS enterprise. While some ACS members referred to this transportation of blacks as \\"repatriation\\", by this time most blacks in America, including slaves, were native born. Most free blacks, some of whom had achieved freedom before the Revolution, wanted to gain equal civil rights in the nation they regarded as their own. But over time, the ACS did attract some black pioneers willing to settle in West Africa. Because of continued discrimination against free blacks in American society, and especially among the slave societies of the South, where they were thought to threaten the stability of the slave regimes, even some abolitionists believed that free American blacks and newly manumitted slaves might be better off founding their own society in West Africa, with the eventual goal of self-government. Such members believed that if alternative settlement for free blacks were available, with financial support by the ACS, more slaveholders might be encouraged to manumit their slaves. After the Nat Turner slave rebellion of 1831, most Southern states repealed the already limited rights of free blacks and free people of color, and strengthened laws meant to control them through banning education, worship without white ministers, and group assemblies, for instance. Manumissions were sharply limited, generally available only by individual act of the state legislatures for each person to be freed. This procedure was so difficult that few slaveholders pursued freeing their slaves. During the first ten years of Gurley's agency, the annual income of the society increased from $778 to $40,000. He traveled widely to deliver addresses in its behalf, as it needed funds to support the ships and relocation expenses of new settlers to Monrovia. He is considered one of the founders of Liberia, which he named. Gurley also edited the public-relations organ of the ACS, the African Repository and Colonial Journal. He sailed to England to solicit aid in the work of colonization. As in the British effort, American missionaries accompanied the settlers to the major settlement, Monrovia, in order to aid in converting the indigenous Africans they encountered. He continued to express the highest motives for the project, even after Liberia gained independence from the ACA: :\\"How should Virginians universally rejoice in the great evidences of Civilization growing & expanding on the west coast of Africa, through civilized Africans sent forth from their homes!\\" (letter, November 4, 1857) The British had earlier established their own colony in West Africa, at Freetown (now the capital of Sierra Leone), for resettlement of blacks from London, Nova Scotia (Black Loyalists had been settled there from the American colonies after the Revolutionary War), and Jamaican Maroons. In time, the British also resettled here captives who had been liberated from illegal slave ships after the banning of the Atlantic slave trade. Former President James Madison was among prominent American slaveholders who supported the work of the ACS. He bequeathed $2000 in his will through Gurley to the Society. Gurley visited Africa three times: in 1824 for the ACS, in order to resolve a dispute between the settlers and the appointed governor, Jehudi Ashmun; in 1849 representing the US government, in order to report to it on the newly independent republic; and late in life, in 1868, on an independent trip on an ACS ship in a desire to see Liberia again, his life's work. Gurley also wrote a biography, Life of Jehudi Ashmun (1835), about the secretary of the Society who served as an early governor of the colony. He reported his Mission to England for the American Colonization Society (1841), and wrote an encomium, the Life and Eloquence of Reverend Sylvester Larned (1844).

Bolton served as a United States Assistant Attorney General for President Ronald Reagan from 1985 to 1989. He served in the State Department as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs from 1989 to 1993 and Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs from 2001 to 2005. He was an advocate of the Iraq War as a Director of the Project for the New American Century, which favored going to war with Iraq. He was the United States Ambassador to the United Nations from August 2005 to December 2006, as a recess appointee by President George W. Bush. He stepped down at the end of his recess appointment in December 2006 because he was unlikely to win confirmation from the Senate, of which the Democratic Party had gained control at the time. Bolton later served as the National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump from April 2018 to September 2019. He repeatedly called for the termination of the Iran nuclear deal, from which the U.S. withdrew in May 2018. He wrote a best-selling book about his tenure in the Trump administration, The Room Where It Happened, published in June 2020. Bolton is a foreign policy hawk and is an advocate for regime change in Iran, Syria, Libya, Venezuela, Cuba, Yemen, and North Korea. He has continuously supported military action and regime change in Syria, Libya, and Iran. A Republican, his political views have been described as American nationalist, conservative,David Ramm, \\"Bolton, John R.\\", Current Biography Yearbook, 2006. and neoconservative. Bolton rejects the last term. Bolton is a former senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), and Fox News Channel commentator. He was a foreign policy adviser to 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney.  Early life, education, and early career  Bolton was born on November 20, 1948, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Virginia Clara \\"Ginny\\" (née Godfrey), a housewife, and Edward Jackson \\"Jack\\" Bolton, a Baltimore City fireman. He grew up in the working-class neighborhood of Yale Heights, and won a scholarship to the McDonogh School in Owings Mills, Maryland, graduating in 1966. He also ran the school's Students For Goldwater campaign in 1964. Bolton attended Yale University, earning a B.A. and graduating summa cum laude in 1970. He was a member of the Yale Political Union. He attended Yale Law School from 1971 to 1974, where he shared classes with his friend Clarence Thomas, earning a J.D. in 1974. In 1972, Bolton was a summer intern for Vice President Spiro Agnew. He was hired for the position by David Keene. = Vietnam War = Bolton was a supporter of the Vietnam War, but avoided combat through a student deferment followed by enlistment in the Maryland Air National Guard. During the 1969 Vietnam War draft lottery, Bolton drew number 185. (Draft numbers were assigned by birth date. Numbers 1 to 195 were eventually called up.) As a result of the Johnson and Nixon administrations' decisions to rely largely on the draft rather than on the reserve forces, joining a Guard or Reserve unit became a way to reduce the chances of service in Vietnam. Before graduating from Yale in 1970, Bolton enlisted in the Maryland Army National Guard rather than waiting to find out if his draft number would be called. He attended Active Duty for Training (ADT) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, from July to November 1970. After serving in the National Guard for four years, he served in the United States Army Reserve until the end of his enlistment two years later. He wrote in his Yale 25th reunion book: \\"I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy. I considered the war in Vietnam already lost.\\" In a 2007 interview, Bolton explained his comment in the reunion book saying his decision to avoid service in Vietnam was because \\"by the time I was about to graduate in 1970, it was clear to me that opponents of the Vietnam War had made it certain we could not prevail, and that I had no great interest in going there to have Teddy Kennedy give it back to the people I might die to take it away from.\\" In his 2007 book, Surrender Is Not an Option, Bolton described his perception of the war as a \\"futile struggle\\", and that \\"[d]ying for your country was one thing, but dying to gain territory that antiwar forces in Congress would simply return to the enemy seemed ludicrous to me. Looking back, I am not terribly proud of this calculation...\\" = Attorney = From 1974 to 1981, Bolton was an associate at the Washington, D.C. office of Covington & Burling; he returned to the firm again from 1983 to 1985. Bolton was also a partner in the law firm of Lerner, Reed, Bolton & McManus, from 1993 to 1999. He was of counsel in the Washington office of Kirkland & Ellis from 2008 until his appointment as National Security Advisor in 2018. In September 2015, Freedom Capital Investment Management appointed Bolton as a senior advisor. = Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations = During the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, his governmental roles were within the State Department, the Justice Department, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was a protégé of conservative North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms. His Justice Department position as an assistant attorney general required him to advance Reagan administration positions, including opposition to financial reparations to Japanese-Americans held in World War II-era internment camps; the insistence on Reagan's executive privilege during William Rehnquist's chief justice confirmation hearings, when Congress asked for memos written by Rehnquist as a Nixon Justice Department official; shepherding the judicial nomination process for Antonin Scalia; and the framing of a bill to control illegal immigration as an essential drug war measure. He was also involved in the Iran–Contra affair. Bolton's government service included positions such as: * Assistant secretary for International Organization Affairs at the Department of State (1989–1993); * Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division (1988–1989); * Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs, Department of Justice (1985–1988); * Assistant administrator for program and policy coordination, USAID (1982–1983); and * General counsel, USAID (1981–1982). While working for USAID, Lynne Finney, a legal adviser for the agency, alleged that Bolton threatened to fire her for refusing to lobby for the deregulation of baby formula in developing nations.  Under Secretary of State (2001–2005)  Bolton joins Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld in negotiations with Rumsfeld's Russian counterpart Bolton worked as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, sworn into this position on May 11, 2001. In this role, a key area of his responsibility was the prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Bolton negotiated so-called \\"Article 98\\" agreements with countries to prohibit them from turning Americans over to the International Criminal Court, which is not recognized by the U.S. Bolton said the decision to pull out of the ICC was the \\"happiest moment\\" of his political career to date. = Weapons of mass destruction = Bolton was instrumental in derailing a 2001 biological weapons conference in Geneva convened to endorse a UN proposal to enforce the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. He argued that the plan would have jeopardized U.S. national security by allowing spot inspections of suspected U.S. weapons sites. In May 2002, Bolton gave a speech entitled \\"Beyond the Axis of Evil\\" in response to President Bush's State of the Union Address (where Bush characterized Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as part of an \\"Axis of Evil\\"). Bolton added three more nations to be grouped with the aforementioned rogue states: Cuba, Libya, and Syria. Bolton said they were all \\"state sponsors of terrorism that are pursuing or who have the potential to pursue weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or have the capability to do so in violation of their treaty obligations.\\" During his time as Under Secretary of State, Bolton \\"sought to block, and often succeeded in sabotaging\\" the negotiations that Secretary of State Colin Powell had conducted with North Korea. Also in 2002, Bolton is said to have flown to Europe to demand the resignation of Brazilian José Bustani, head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and to have orchestrated his removal at a special session of the organization. Bustani was deemed to be an obstacle in creating the case for the invasion of Iraq. The United Nations' highest administrative tribunal later condemned the action as an \\"unacceptable violation\\" of principles protecting international civil servants. Bustani had been unanimously re-elected for a four-year term—with strong U.S. support—in May 2000, and in 2001 was praised for his leadership by Colin Powell. According to Bustani, John Bolton demanded that he step down in 24 hours, adding, \\"We know where your children are.\\" He also pushed for reduced funding for the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program to halt the proliferation of nuclear materials. At the same time, he was involved in the implementation of the Proliferation Security Initiative, working with a number of countries to intercept the trafficking in weapons of mass destruction and in materials for use in building nuclear weapons. = Diplomacy = According to an article in The New Republic, Bolton was highly successful in pushing his agenda, but his bluntness made him many enemies. \\"Iran's Foreign Ministry has called Bolton 'rude' and 'undiplomatic'.\\" In response to critics, Bolton says his record \\"demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy.\\" Bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position. \\"It's like the Palestinians' having to negotiate with [Israeli Prime Minister] Ariel Sharon. If you have a deal, you know you have a deal,\\" an anonymous official told CNN. He also \\"won widespread praise for his work establishing the Proliferation Security Initiative, a voluntary agreement supported (at the time) by 60 countries\\". = Unsubstantiated claims about a Cuban WMD program = In 2002, Bolton delivered a speech at the Heritage Foundation where he accused Cuba of having a secret biological weapons program, and of collaborating with Libya and Iran. Bolton asserted, \\"The United States believes that Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort. Cuba has provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue states.\\" Bolton made the remarks a week before former President Jimmy Carter was scheduled to meet Fidel Castro in Cuba, becoming the first U.S. President since the Cuban Revolution to visit Cuba in an effort to build bridges between the two countries. The State Department's chief bioweapons analyst refused to approve the accusation made in the speech, telling Bolton that the State Department did not have evidence to substantiate Bolton's accusation. Subsequently, Bolton berated the analyst, unsuccessfully sought to fire him, began to exclude the analyst's supervisor from meetings, and tried to transfer the analyst to a different office. Bolton was also alleged to have sought to punish other intelligence officers who refused to endorse his claims about Cuba. Paul Pillar described Bolton's attempts to get the intelligence community to endorse his views as among the most egregious recent instances of \\"arm-twisting\\" the intelligence community, while Columbia University international relations scholar Richard K. Betts described the reports about Bolton's pressure as \\"most blatant top-down pressure on intelligence\\" in the Bush administration. Bolton claims the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers, who did not work under him, behaved unprofessionally. In April 2004, Bolton again accused Cuba of being a \\"terrorist and (biological weapons) threat to the United States.\\" Experts at the time disputed the veracity of Bolton's claims, saying the evidence in support of the claim was weak. In September 2004 and in the wake of the failure to locate WMDs in Iraq, the Bush administration backed off claims that Cuba had an active biological weapons program. = Criticism = Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman alleged that Bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of the statement that British Intelligence had determined Iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from Niger in Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address. These statements were claimed by critics of the President to be partly based on documents found to be forged. Waxman's allegations could not be confirmed, as they were based on classified documents. Bolton stated in June 2004 congressional testimony that Iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination: \\"Another unmistakable indicator of Iran's intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to ... the IAEA ... when evidence of uranium enriched to 36 percent was found, it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts.\\" However, later isotope analysis supported Iran's explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium. At their August 2005 meeting the IAEA's Board of Governors concluded: \\"Based on the information currently available to the Agency, the results of that analysis tend, on balance, to support Iran's statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed HEU [highly enriched uranium] contamination.\\" Bolton has often been accused of attempting to pressure the intelligence community to endorse his views. According to former coworkers, Bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from Secretary of State Colin Powell on multiple occasions, and from Powell's successor Condoleezza Rice on at least one occasion.  Ambassador to the United Nations (2005–2006)  President George W. Bush announces Bolton's nomination as U.S. ambassador to the UN. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice looks on. On March 7, 2005, Bolton was nominated to the post of United States Ambassador to the United Nations by President George W. Bush. As a result of a Democratic filibuster, he was recess-appointed to the post on August 1, 2005. Bolton's nomination received strong support from Republicans but faced heavy opposition from Democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the United Nations. Holding a 10–8 majority in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees), the Republican leadership hoped to send Bolton's nomination to the full Senate with a positive recommendation. Concern among some Republicans on the committee, however, prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation. In the full Senate, Republican support for the nomination remained uncertain, with the most vocal Republican critic, Ohio Senator George V. Voinovich, circulating a letter urging his Republican colleagues to oppose the nomination. Democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature, given the resistance of the White House to share classified documents related to Bolton's alleged actions. The Republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate, but because a supermajority of 60 votes is needed to end debate, the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a 55–44 majority in the body. An earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the Democrats to relate only to judicial nominees, not ambassadorships, although the leader of the effort, Sen. John McCain, said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees. On November 9, 2006, Bush, only days after losing both houses to a Democratic majority, sent the nomination for Bolton to continue as representative for the United States at the UN. He said: \\"I believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences. And I believe we will be able to work through differences. I reassured the House and Senate leaders that I intend to work with the new Congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country.\\" = Views on the United Nations = Ambassador Bolton briefing on \\"The Human Rights Commission and UN Management Reform\\" at the New York Foreign Press Center Bolton has been a strong critic of the United Nations for much of his career. Bolton's opposition to the UN was rooted in a disdain for international organizations, which he believed infringed on the sovereignty of the United States. He also opposed the International Criminal Court. In 1994, he stated, \\"There is no United Nations. There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along.\\" He also stated that \\"The Secretariat Building in New York has 38 stories. If you lost ten stories today, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\\" When pressed on the statement during the confirmation process, he responded, \\"There's not a bureaucracy in the world that couldn't be made leaner.\\" However, in a paper on U.S. participation in the UN, Bolton stated \\"the United Nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of American foreign policy.\\" = 2005 nomination, Senate confirmation hearings = On April 11, 2005, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reviewed Bolton's qualifications. Bolton said he and his colleagues \\"view the U.N. as an important component of our diplomacy\\" and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths, echoing Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's words from a month earlier. On the first day of the hearings, Republican committee chairman Richard Lugar criticized Bolton for ignoring the \\"policy consequences\\" of his statements, saying diplomatic speech \\"should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the U.S. public opinion or to validate a personal point of view.\\" The committee's top Democrat, Joe Biden, compared sending Bolton to the UN to sending a \\"bull into a china shop,\\" and expressed \\"grave concern\\" about Bolton's \\"diplomatic temperament\\" and his record: \\"In my judgment, your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful,\\" Biden said. Republican Senator George Allen said Bolton had the \\"experience,\\" \\"knowledge,\\" \\"background,\\" \\"and the right principles to come into the United Nations at this time,\\" calling him \\"the absolute perfect person for the job.\\" Democratic Senator Russ Feingold asked Bolton about what he would have done had the Rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the United Nations, and criticized his answer—which focused on logistics—as \\"amazingly passive.\\" On the second day, April 12, 2005, the Senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that Bolton pressured intelligence analysts. Calling Bolton a \\"serial abuser\\", former State Department intelligence chief Carl W. Ford Jr. said, \\"I've never seen anybody quite like Secretary Bolton... I don't have a second, third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people.\\" Ford contradicted Bolton's earlier testimony, saying: \\"I had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done.\\" Ford also characterized Bolton as a \\"kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy\\", implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him, while having very little regard for people working under him. Lugar, who criticized Bolton at his April 11 hearing, said the \\"paramount issue\\" was supporting Bush's nominee. He conceded that \\"bluntness... may be required\\", even though it is not \\"very good diplomacy\\". Chafee, the key member for Bolton's approval, said \\"the bar is very high\\" for rejecting the president's nominees, suggesting that Bolton would make it to the Senate. On April 19, Democrats, with support from Voinovich, forced Lugar to delay the committee vote on Bolton's nomination until May. The debate concerning his nomination raged in the Senate prior to the Memorial Day recess. Two other Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee, Chafee and Chuck Hagel, also expressed serious concerns about the Bolton nomination. Asked on April 20 if he was now less inclined to support the nomination, Chafee said, \\"That would be accurate.\\" He elaborated that Bolton's prospects were \\"hard to predict\\" but said he expected that \\"the administration is really going to put some pressure on Senator Voinovich. Then it comes to the rest of us [who] have had some reservations.\\" On April 20, it emerged that Melody Townsel, a former USAID contractor, had reported to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in Moscow. Townsel's encounter with Bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for USAID, IBTCI. Townsel told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff that Bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight, among other workplace improprieties. In an official interview with Senate Foreign Relation Committee staff, Townsel detailed her accusations against Bolton, which were confirmed by Canadian designer Uno Ramat, who had served as an IBTCI employee and one of Townsel's AID colleagues. Time magazine, among other publications, verified Townsel's accusations and Ramat's supporting testimony, and Townsel's story was transcribed and entered into the official Senate committee record. Townsel, who was an employee of Young & Rubicam at the time of her encounter with Bolton, continued working for the company on a variety of other USAID projects. On April 22, The New York Times and other media reported that Bolton's former boss, Colin Powell, personally opposed the nomination and had been in personal contact with Chafee and Hagel. The same day, Reuters reported that a spokesman for Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had said the Senator felt the committee \\"did the right thing delaying the vote on Bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee.\\" Also on May 11, Newsweek reported allegations that the American position at the 7th Review Conference in May 2005 of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty had been undercut by Bolton's \\"absence without leave\\" during the nomination fight, quoting anonymous sources \\"close to the negotiations\\". = Democrats' filibuster = On May 26, 2005, Senate Democrats postponed the vote on Bolton's UN nomination. The Republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over Bolton, and minority leader Harry Reid conceded the move signaled the \\"first filibuster of the year.\\" The Democrats claimed that key documents regarding Bolton and his career at the Department of State were being withheld by the Bush administration. Scott McClellan, White House press secretary, responded by saying, \\"Just 72 hours after all the good will and bipartisanship (over a deal on judicial nominees), it's disappointing to see the Democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach.\\" The failure of the Senate to end debate on Bolton's nomination provided one surprise for some: Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) voted against cloture for procedural reasons, so he could bring up a cloture vote in the future. (Although Voinovich once spoke against confirming Bolton, he voted for cloture.) Senator John Thune (R-SD) voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against Bolton in the up- or-down vote as a protest against the government's plans to close a military base (Ellsworth) in his home state. On June 20, 2005, the Senate voted again on cloture. The vote failed 54–38, six votes short of ending debate. That marked an increase of two \\"no\\" votes, including the defection of Voinovich, who switched his previous \\"yes\\" vote and urged President Bush to pick another nominee (Democrats Mark Pryor, Mary Landrieu and Ben Nelson voted to end debate both times). On June 21, Frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless, but later that day, following a lunch at the White House, changed his position, saying he would continue to push for an up- or-down vote. Voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if Bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination. = Accusations of false statement = On July 28, 2005, it was revealed that a statement made by Bolton on forms submitted to the Senate was false. Bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation, but in fact he had been interviewed by the State Department's Inspector General as part of an investigation into the sources of pre-war claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. After insisting for weeks that Bolton had testified truthfully on the form, the State Department reversed itself, saying Bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation. = Recess appointment = On August 1, 2005, Bush officially made a recess appointment of Bolton, installing him as Permanent U.S. Representative to the UN. A recess appointment lasts until the next session of Congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the Senate. During the announcement, Bush said, \\"This post is too important to leave vacant any longer, especially during a war and a vital debate about U.N. reform.\\" Democrats criticized the appointment, and Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Bolton would lack credibility in the U.N. because he lacked Senate confirmation. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed Mr. Bolton, but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the United Nations. = Term at the UN = The Economist called Bolton \\"the most controversial ambassador ever sent by America to the United Nations.\\" Some colleagues in the UN appreciated the goals Bolton was trying to achieve, but not his abrasive style. The New York Times, in its editorial The Shame of the United Nations, praised Bolton's stance on \\"reforming the disgraceful United Nations Human Rights Commission\\", saying \\"John Bolton, is right; Secretary-General Kofi Annan is wrong.\\" The Times also said the commission at that time was composed of \\"some of the world's most abusive regimes\\" who used their membership as cover to continue their abusiveness. Bolton also opposed the proposed replacement for the Human Rights Commission, the UN Human Rights Council, as not going far enough for reform, saying: \\"We want a butterfly. We don't intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success.\\" = 2006 nomination = Bush announced his intention to renominate Bolton for confirmation as U.N. ambassador at the beginning of 2006, and a new confirmation hearing was held on July 27, 2006, in the hope of completing the process before the expiration of Bolton's recess appointment at the end of the 109th Congress. Voinovich, who had previously stood in opposition to Bolton, had amended his views and determined that Bolton was doing a \\"good job\\" as UN ambassador; in February 2006, he said \\"I spend a lot of time with John on the phone. I think he is really working very constructively to move forward.\\" Over the summer and during the fall election campaign, no action was taken on the nomination because Chafee, who was in a difficult re-election campaign, blocked a Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote. Without his concurrence, the SFRC would have been deadlocked 9–9, and the nomination could not have gone to the Senate floor for a full vote. Bush formally resubmitted the nomination on November 9, 2006, immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the 110th Congress to the Democratic party. Chafee, who had just lost his re-election bid, issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending Bolton for a Senate vote, citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results: \\"On Tuesday, the American people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the Bush administration. To confirm Mr. Bolton to the position of U.N. ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for.\\" = Termination of service = On December 4, 2006, Bolton announced that he would terminate his work as U.S. representative to the UN at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation. His letter of resignation from the Bush administration was accepted on December 4, 2006, effective when his recess appointment ended December 9 at the formal adjournment of the 109th Congress. The announcement was characterized as Bolton's \\"resignation\\" by the Associated Press, United Press International,: \\"They were reacting to the resignation of U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton earlier Monday, Bolton resigned after it became clear that the incoming Democratic-controlled Senate in the 110th Congress would not vote to confirm his appointment as ambassador.\\" ABC News, and other news sources, as well as a White House press release and President Bush himself.: \\"I received the resignation of Ambassador John Bolton. I accepted.\\" The White House, however, later objected to the use of this language. Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino told CBS News \\"it is not a resignation.\\" The actual language of the President's written acceptance was: \\"It is with deep regret that I accept John Bolton's decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the United States to the United Nations when his commission expires.\\" However, at a press conference, the President said, \\"I received the resignation of Ambassador John Bolton. I accept it. I'm not happy about it. I think he deserved to be confirmed.\\" Some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as \\"to step down,\\" \\"to leave,\\" or \\"to exit.\\" John Bolton in 2008 = Support for Bolton = During his confirmation hearings in 2005, letters with signatures of more than 64 co-workers and professional colleagues were sent to Senator Richard Lugar, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in praise of Bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff. In late 2006, when his nomination was again before the Committee, another letter signed by professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to Senator Lugar. A Wall Street Journal op ed by Claudia Rosett on December 5, 2006, said in part, \\"Bolton has been valiant in his efforts to clean up UN corruption and malfeasance, and follow UN procedure in dealing with such threats as a nuclear North Korea, a Hezbollah bid to take over Lebanon, and the nuclearization of Hezbollah's terror-masters in Iran. But it has been like watching one man trying to move a tsunami of mud.\\"  National Security Advisor (2018–2019)  May 2, 2018: (from left) Bolton, Mike Pompeo, President Trump, Vice President Pence = Speculation on position (2016–2017) = In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt during the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump named Bolton as a possible choice for Secretary of State. Appearing on Fox News' Fox and Friends on December 1, 2016, Bolton admitted he was being considered as a Secretary of State candidate for the incoming Trump administration. Several Trump associates claim Bolton was not chosen, in part, due to Trump's disdain for Bolton's signature mustache. The evening of December 10, the BBC cited NBC reports that \\"sources close to Mr Trump [were]... saying that Mr Tillerson is likely to be named next week\\" and that former UN ambassador John Bolton \\"will serve as his deputy\\". Bolton has supported theories about the health of Hillary Clinton and about her aide Huma Abedin, and in December 2016, Bolton said the conclusion of the United States Intelligence Community that Russian hackers had intervened to help elect Donald Trump in 2016 may have been a \\"false flag\\" operation. In a subsequent interview on Fox News, Bolton criticized the Obama administration's retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggested that the US response should \\"make them [the Russians] feel pain\\". = Tenure = In February 2017 President Trump interviewed Bolton and three others to determine who would fill the position of National Security Advisor vacated by Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn. The position ultimately went to H. R. McMaster. Trump \\"made a point on Monday of praising Mr. Bolton and saying that he would find a position for him in his administration eventually.\\" Bolton was seen at the White House on the evening of March 6, 2018, presumably to be interviewed as a candidate for national security adviser. James N. Mattis greets the National Security Advisor-designate Bolton at the Pentagon in March 2018 The New York Times reported on March 22, 2018, that John Bolton would replace National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, which was confirmed by Trump in a tweet later that day. Bolton began his position as National Security Advisor on April 9, 2018. The New York Times wrote that the rise of Bolton and Mike Pompeo, coupled with the departure of Rex Tillerson and General McMaster, meant Trump's foreign policy team was now \\"the most radically aggressive foreign policy team around the American president in modern memory\\", and compared it to the foreign policy team surrounding George W. Bush, notably with Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. On April 10, 2018, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert resigned at Bolton's request, and Bolton said he was considering a merger of the NSC with the Homeland Security Council. During his first week in office Bolton requested and obtained the resignations of multiple National Security Council (NSC) employees including NSC spokesman Michael Anton (April 8), deputy national security adviser Nadia Schadlow (April 10), and deputy national security adviser Ricky L. Waddell (April 12). CNN reported in September 2018 that Bolton had significantly shrunk the number of NSC personnel, cutting it to under 300. In April 2018, Bolton pressed President Trump to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal, which Trump did a month later. The Huffington Post reported that on May 8, 2018, Bolton removed Timothy Ziemer and dissolved his Global Health Security team formerly on the NSC leaving the administration's high level preparation for and ability to respond to pandemics, infectious disease, and other biological threats unclear. The choice to remove and not replace Ziemer in the midst of an emerging Ebola outbreak in The Democratic Republic of Congo was criticized in several news outlets. December 26, 2018: Bolton and President Trump on the phone with Iraq Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi during visit to U.S. troops On September 10, 2018, in his first major address as National Security Advisor, Bolton criticized the International Criminal Court, saying it lacks checks and balances, exercises \\"jurisdiction over crimes that have disputed and ambiguous definitions,\\" and has failed to \\"deter and punish atrocity crimes.\\" Calling the ICC a threat to \\"American sovereignty and U.S. national security,\\" Bolton said it is \\"superfluous,\\" given that \\"domestic judicial systems already hold American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards.\\" He added that the U.S. would do everything \\"to protect our citizens\\" should the ICC attempt to prosecute U.S. servicemen over alleged detainee abuse in Afghanistan, and it would bar ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the U.S. and sanction their funds. He also criticized Palestinian efforts to bring Israel before the ICC over allegations of human rights abuses in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. In 2018, Bolton requested that the Pentagon provide the White House with options for military strikes against Iran. According to the New York Times, Bolton \\"intensified the administration's policy of isolating and pressuring Iran—reflecting an animus against Iran's leaders that dates back to his days as an official in the George W. Bush administration. As a private citizen, he later called for military strikes on Iran, as well as regime change.\\" As National Security Advisor, Bolton eliminated the kinds of internal policy debates that his predecessor H. R. McMaster had in place. The New York Times writes that this change in practices contributed to Trump's sudden decision to withdraw the United States from Syria in January 2019. As National Security Advisor, Bolton advanced policies skeptical and hostile toward international organizations. By his first year as National Security Advisor, Bolton had reshaped the National Security Council and become influential within the Trump Administration. By May 2019, Trump had undercut some of Bolton's major hard line positions, stating he was not seeking regime change in Iran and contradicting Bolton's correct assertion that North Korea had recently violated United Nations resolutions by testing new short-range missiles. As Trump prepared for his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in June 2019, Bolton flew to Mongolia. In 2019, John Bolton, then U.S. National Security Advisor meeting British Chancellor Sajid Javid (left) at 11 Downing Street In late August 2019, Bolton met Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk, Belarus. On September 10, 2019, President Trump claimed on Twitter that he had told Bolton on September 9 his \\"services are no longer needed\\" given \\"many\\" disagreements with Trump, thus Bolton gave his resignation on September 10. Just minutes later, Bolton contradicted Trump's account, tweeting out this claim: Bolton offered to resign on September 9, with Trump replying: \\"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\\" Bolton later told the media Trump \\"never asked\\" for his resignation \\"directly or indirectly\\", and that he had both offered to resign and actually resigned of his own accord. Meanwhile, the White House endorsed Trump's version of the events. After Bolton's departure, Trump claimed that Bolton's views were \\"not necessarily tougher\\" than his own: \\"in some cases, he thought it was too tough what we were doing\\". On Cuba and Venezuela, Trump claimed that his own views were \\"far stronger\\" than Bolton's: \\"He was holding me back!\\" Bolton himself was known for his hawkish positions, including on Cuba and Venezuela, while Trump previously in May 2019 offered a different view of Bolton: \\"I actually temper John, which is pretty amazing.\\" = Trump–Ukraine scandal = Following Bolton's departure, Fiona Hill, who served as the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia, testified before a Congressional committee that Bolton had disassociated himself from what he viewed as the Trump administration's effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the President's political rivals. Bolton refused to attend his scheduled deposition in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump on November 7, 2019, and threatened to take legal action if he was subpoenaed. Bolton said he was willing to testify, but wanted a federal court to first rule on a lawsuit by his former deputy seeking a court ruling on the competing claims of the Trump administration and Congress. However, in a written statement obtained by NBC News on January 6, 2020, Bolton announced that he would testify during the Senate impeachment trial should he be issued a subpoena to do so. A 51-vote majority would be required from the Senate in order to obtain the subpoena. As the second week of opening statements was set to begin, to be followed by a vote on whether to call witnesses, The New York Times reported that Bolton wrote in his forthcoming book that the President had told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing the Ukraine aid until officials there pursued investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. The Times also stated that \\"Drafts of the book outline the potential testimony of the former national security adviser if he were called as a witness in the president's impeachment trial.\\" On January 23, as Bolton was preparing for possible Senate testimony about the assertions in his manuscript, the National Security Council informed him that it contained classified information and \\"may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.” Bolton's attorney stated he did not believe the manuscript contained sensitive information. The dispute set the stage for a prolonged review, with Bolton's attorney asking that access to the manuscript be limited to \\"those career government officials and employees regularly charged with responsibility for such reviews.\\" The leaked contents from the book also resulted in Trump impeachment lawyer Jay Sekulow dismissing Bolton's claims as \\"inadmissible\\" when he argued before the Senate in defense of Trump on January 28, 2020. Democratic trial manager Adam Schiff later remarked that Sekulow's assertion validated the argument that Bolton should be called to testify. The Senate rejected (51 to 49) a measure to consider calling new witnesses and evidence.  Punditry and conservative activism  Bolton was executive director of the Committee on Resolutions in the Republican National Committee from 1983 to 1984. Between 1997 and 2000, Bolton worked as an assistant to James Baker when he was the UN Secretary-General envoy to the Western Sahara. Since 2006, he has been a paid Fox News contributor and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. For 2017, he reported an income of $569,000 from Fox News. Bolton was a contributor to The Weekly Standard, an American conservative opinion magazine, from 1997 to 2000, and again from 2014 to 2016. Bolton speaks at Chatham House on foreign policy challenges facing the Obama Administration From 2013 until March 2018, Bolton was chairman of the far- right anti-Muslim Gatestone Institute, which is prominent for disseminating false anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim information. In 2018, the White House reported that Bolton's total income for 2017 had been $2.2 million which included $569,000 from Fox News and $747,000 in speaking fees from, among others, the Victor Pinchuk Foundation (a Ukrainian NGO), Deutsche Bank, and HSBC. = 2012 presidential election = Bolton considered running for president in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. He received attention in conservative circles, including the cover of the December 31, 2010 issue of National Review magazine. He told Politico: \\"As I survey the situation, I think the Republican field is wide open. I don't think the party's anywhere close to a decision. And stranger things have happened. For example, inexperienced senators from Illinois have gotten presidential nominations.\\" In September 2011, Bolton said he would not run for president in 2012. During the Republican primary, Republican presidential-hopeful Newt Gingrich said he would ask Bolton to serve as his Secretary of State. In January 2012, Bolton endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 Republican Nomination. = American Enterprise Institute = Bolton was senior vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, from 1997 to 2001. At the time, he frequently wrote columns criticizing the Clinton administration's foreign policy. Bolton said Clinton's policy on Iraq was \\"worse than incompetent\\", his policy on North Korea was \\"egregiously wrong\\", and his Libya policy was a \\"catastrophic loss of U.S. credibility.\\" After leaving the George W. Bush Administration in 2006, Bolton returned to the American Enterprise Institute as a Senior Fellow. From 2010 until 2018, Bolton served as Director, Foreign and Defense Policy Studies for AEI. In Bolton's time at the American Enterprise Institute, he spoke against the policy of rewarding North Korea for ending its nuclear weapons program. He said the policy would encourage others to violate nuclear non-proliferation rules so they could then be rewarded for following the rules they'd already agreed to. In July 2013, Bolton was identified as a key member of Groundswell, a secretive coalition of right-wing activists and journalists attempting to advance political change behind the scenes through lobbying of high-level contacts. = John Bolton Super PAC = In 2013, Bolton set up the John Bolton Super PAC. It raised $11.3 million for Republican candidates in the 2014 and 2016 elections and spent $5.6 million, paying Cambridge Analytica at least $650,000 for voter data analysis and digital video ad targeting in support of the campaigns of Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), and of former U.S. Senator (R-MA) Scott Brown's unsuccessful 2014 bid for a U.S. Senate seat for New Hampshire. In September 2016, Bolton announced that his Super PAC would spend $1million on (R-N.C.) Senator Richard Burr's reelection effort by targeting ads at \\"social media users and Dish Network and Direct TV subscribers\\". The Center for Public Integrity analysed the John Bolton Super PAC's campaign finance filings and found that they had paid Cambridge Analytica more than $1.1 million since 2014 for \\"research\\" and \\"survey research\\". According to Federal Election Commission filings, Cambridge Analytica was paid more than $811,000 by them in the 2016 presidential election; in the same election cycle, the Super PAC spent around $2.5 million in support of Republican U.S. Senate candidates. Bolton said he aims to raise and spend $25 million for up to 90 Republican candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. In January 2018, Bolton announced a $1 million advertising campaign in support of Kevin Nicholson's bid for the Republican nomination to run against incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. The Super PAC ran an ad campaign in the Green Bay area in January 2018; on March 19, 2018, the Super PAC announced a two-week $278,000 television and radio ad campaign in the Milwaukee area. Major donors to the John Bolton Super PAC are Robert Mercer, who gave $4 million from 2012 to 2016; Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus, and Los Angeles real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer. After Bolton was appointed National Security Advisor in March 2018, the John Bolton Super PAC and the John Bolton PAC announced that their political activities were suspended temporarily, effective March 31, 2018. The Super PAC's FEC filings showed a balance of $2.6 million in unspent donations at the end of March 2018. Memoir and legal concerns On June 16, 2020, the Trump Justice Department attempted to block publication of Bolton's memoir, The Room Where It Happened, seeking to confiscate Bolton's $2 million advance for breach of contract, asserting he had not completed the prepublication security review as he had agreed to receive his security clearance. Bolton had submitted the book for security review in December 2019, and after months of discussions, was told on April 27 by Ellen Knight—the National Security Council's senior director for prepublication review—that no other classification issues remained. However, the White House did not provide Bolton written notice that he could proceed with publication, and in May another NSC official was asked to further review the manuscript. On June 17, the Justice Department asked a federal judge to issue an injunction to block publication of the book, which had already been printed, bound and shipped to distribution warehouses for its official release the following week. By that day, media outlets had acquired copies of the book and begun publishing articles about its contents. In its brief filed with the court, the Justice Department provided six examples of what it asserted were classified items that remained in the book. Trump had previously asserted that any conversation with him is \\"highly classified.\\" During a hearing on June 19, federal judge Royce Lamberth castigated Bolton for proceeding to publish his book without formal clearance, but ruled that publication of the book could proceed. Bolton's attorney asserted that the White House was slow-walking the review process to prevent the book, which contained extensive harsh criticism of Trump, from being released during the 2020 election campaign. According to reporting, Trump claimed that the book contained \\"highly classified\\" information but also characterized the book as \\"pure fiction.\\" On June 21, a pirated copy of the book appeared online. The book was released on June 23.Libby Cathey, Bolton book releases Tuesday even as judge says his profits might be seized, ABC News (June 23, 2020). Later that summer, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into whether the book revealed classified information, empaneling a grand jury that subpoenaed the publisher’s communications records.  Political positions  Bolton, President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12, 2018 Bolton with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in September 2018 He declared himself in an interview with Edward Luce of the Financial Times in 2007 to be a \\"Goldwater conservative\\", as opposed to being a neoconservative. He also pointed out that he was a follower of Edmund Burke. He also said \\"I have always been a conservative. The idea of big-government conservatism has more neocon adherents than from unmodified conservatives.\\" = Unilateralism and Americanism = Americanism is Bolton's core belief, according to The New York Times: Bolton is skeptical of international organizations and international law, believing them to endanger American sovereignty, and does not believe they have legitimate authority under the U.S. Constitution. He criticized the Obama administration's foreign policy for what he perceived as surrendering U.S. sovereignty. He also prefers unilateralism over multilateralism. In a 2000 article in the Chicago Journal of International Law, Bolton described himself as a \\"convinced Americanist\\", favoring it over what he described as \\"globalism\\". In his roles in the U.S. government, however, Bolton has been more pragmatic in his actions toward international organizations, though according to Foreign Policy, he effectively advanced his views on this subject during his tenure in the Trump Administration. Bolton has criticized the International Criminal Court, seeing it as a threat to U.S. sovereignty. Bolton said: \\"If the court comes after us, Israel or other US allies, we will not sit quietly. We will ban its judges and prosecutors from entering the United States. We will sanction their funds in the US financial system, and we will prosecute them in the US criminal system.\\" = European Union = Bolton is a critic of the European Union. In his book Surrender Is Not an Option, he criticized the EU for pursuing \\"the endless process of diplomatic mastication\\" rather than satisfactorily solving problems, and he labeled the organization's diplomats as \\"EUroids\\". He has also criticized the EU for advancing what he considers liberal policies. Bolton campaigned in Ireland against further EU integration in 2008, and he criticized the Treaty of Lisbon for expanding EU powers. In 2016, Bolton praised the UK's referendum vote to leave the EU, and Axios reported in January 2019 that Bolton continued to advocate for a hard Brexit as National Security Advisor. In a March 2019 interview with Sky News, Bolton criticized the UK \\"political class\\" for not implementing the Brexit vote. Bolton, President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, December 1, 2018 =Targeted killings of terrorist leaders= In September 2011, when the Obama administration declared the death of Al Qaeda target and American-born radical Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, Bolton commented \\"I think it's important as individual Al Qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is. Consider this analogy if you were around in the 1920s and somebody said, my God, Vladimir Lenin is dead. The Bolsheviks will never recover from this...So while Al-Awlaki's death is significant, I would not read cosmic consequences into it.\\" = Libya = Bolton opposed the deal that George W. Bush made with then Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to eliminate the country's weapons of mass destruction program. He was in a key role during initial negotiations but his role became limited over time. According to a 2005 study, Bolton was intentionally kept out of the loop so a final agreement could be reached: \\"Bolton reportedly was unaware of the December 19 WMD agreement until very shortly before its public announcement. And after initially being given a lead role in implementing it, he pushed so hard to backtrack from the agreement that the British convinced the Bush administration to restrict his involvement in the Libya matter.\\" Bolton supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya that toppled the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. = Iraq = Bolton is regarded to be an \\"architect\\" of the Iraq War. In 1998, he was a signatory to a letter sent to President Bill Clinton urging him to remove Saddam Hussein from power using U.S. diplomatic, political and military power. He supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein and continued to stand by his support of the invasion by 2018. In 2007, Bolton said the only mistake the United States made with regard to Iraq was to not leave earlier after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and tell the Iraqis \\"Here's a copy of the Federalist Papers. Good luck.\\" = Kosovo = During 2008, Bolton opposed the declaration of independence by Kosovo. In 2018 he said, \\"US policy is that if the two parties can work it out between themselves and reach agreement, we don't exclude territorial adjustments,\\" and that the US or Europe would not \\"stand in the way if the two parties to the dispute reached a mutually satisfactory settlement.\\" = Israel = Bolton greeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in August 2018 Bolton with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in August 2018 Netanyahu behind, signs the proclamation recognizing Israel's 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights, March 25, 2019 Bolton is known for his strong support for Israel. Bolton opposes the two- state solution of creating an independent Palestinian state alongside the existing state of Israel. Bolton supported moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, and he testified in front of Congress in 2017 on the matter. In 2010, Bolton co-founded the Friends of Israel Initiative with 12 other international figures. =North Korea and Iran= Bolton has advocated for pre-emptive strikes against North Korea and Iran. In March 2018, he suggested that South Korea take North Korea and terminate the North Korean regime as the only \\"diplomatic option\\", and said that the war between the two countries is their problem and not the US problem. In 2006, Bolton attempted to bring prosecution against Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for incitement to genocide in the International Court of Justice, along with Alan Dershowitz, Dore Gold, and other experts from the United States, Canada, and Israel, based on Ahmadinejad's comments that \\"Israel must be wiped off the map\\". In 2008, Bolton said: \\"The idea here is not to have much larger hostilities, but to stop the Iranians from engaging in the hostilities that they're already doing against us inside Iraq. And they're doing much the same by aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan. So this is not provocative or preemptive, this is entirely responsive on our part.\\" In 2018, Bolton stated: \\"Russia, China, Syria, Iran, North Korea. These are regimes that make agreements and lie about them. A national security policy that is based on the faith that regimes like that will honor their commitments is doomed to failure.\\" He also said, \\"Our goal should be regime change in Iran.\\" The New Yorker, described the people who have worked with Bolton as saying \\"he is focused less on North Korea than on Iran\\". H. R. McMaster has reportedly told Dexter Fikins that Bolton has had \\"[the] anal focus on Iran for twenty years\\". Unlike several of President Trump's early national security officials like National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Bolton campaigned to press President Trump for a complete withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran (the JCPOA) and rejected the idea it could be fixed. Unable at the time to directly present his position to President Trump, Bolton published his proposal on how to withdraw from the Iran deal in an August 28, 2017 National Review Online article. After he was named to succeed McMaster as Nation Security Adviser in April 2018, Bolton pressed the President to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, a decision President Trump announced a month later. Bolton has been one of the biggest anti-Iran hawks in the Trump administration. Speaking to a meeting of Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq in March 2018, Bolton said the Trump administration should follow the goal of regime change in Iran and that \\"before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\\" In 2019, Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo successfully sabotaged Trump’s attempts to open diplomatic channels with Iran. On January 3, 2020, the high-level Iranian General, Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike, which considerably heightened the existing tensions between the two countries. In a tweet, Bolton called the airstrike a \\"long in the making, this was a decisive blow against Iran's malign Quds Force activities worldwide. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.\\" People's Mujahedin of Iran Prior to it being de-listed by the U.S. as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2012, Bolton spoke in favor of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (also known as the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK), in at least one case being paid to do so. MEK has opposed the Iranian theocratic state since shortly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. They also have a long history of criticism of and opposition to U.S. policy in the region. According to the State Department, the MEK \\"[f]ollow[s] a philosophy that mixes Marxism and Islam.\\" According to his financial disclosure, he was given $40,000 for his 2016 speech to MEK. According to the 5 U.S.C. app. § 101-required 'US Public Financial Disclosure Report' (2018) for Bolton, released by Al-Monitor, he has received $40,000 of speaking fee for \\"Global Events–European Iranian Events\\" on June 1, 2017, the same day he made a speech for the MEK in a gathering in Paris, France. In May 2018, Joanne Stocker, a journalist and researcher studying the MEK, told Richard Engel of MSNBC that she estimates Bolton was paid \\"on the low-end, $180,000\\". Bolton's office has refused to comment on the matter. = Russia = Bolton meets with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu in Moscow in October 2018 In 2013, after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden had been granted asylum in Russia, Bolton said: \\"I think in order to focus Putin's thinking, we need to do things that cause him pain as well. And while I know that not having a chance to have a bilateral meeting with his buddy Barack Obama will cause Putin to lose sleep, it's not damaging Russian interests.\\" Russian Senator Aleksey Pushkov, former chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said after Bolton's appointment: \\"Bolton, along with Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld, was an ardent supporter of the war in Iraq. A supporter of jihadists for the sake of overthrowing [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad]. A great specialist in interventions and aggression, and adept at the use of force. McMaster is a general. Bolton is the ideologue of a new cold war, a convinced opponent of Russia.\\" In a June 2017 article entitled \\"Vladimir Putin looked Trump in the eye and lied to him. We negotiate with Russia at our peril,\\" Bolton called Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections \\"a true act of war.\\" As Trump's national security advisor in July 2018, Bolton referred to the investigation into the Russian interference as \\"the Russia witch hunt\\". = China = Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit in Osaka, June 28, 2019 In 2018, Bolton criticized Washington's One-China policy, under which Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, is not recognized as an independent nation, with recognition being given only to the People's Republic of China. On China's notoriety in intellectual property matters, he remarked in 2018 that \\"There's simply no excuse for the stealing of intellectual property, forced technology transfers it's sometimes called.\\" Bolton said in October 2018 that the United States' need to counter a Chinese arms buildup in the Pacific, including within South China Sea, was one of the reasons for their move to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, because China is not a signatory to the treaty. = Latin America = Bolton with Brazil's president-elect Jair Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro in November 2018 In a speech as National Security Advisor on November 1, 2018, Bolton praised Brazil's president-elect Jair Bolsonaro and Colombia's president Iván Duque Márquez, both right-wing conservatives, calling them \\"like-minded\\" partners. In the speech, he also framed Bolsonaro's election victory as a \\"positive sign\\" for Latin America, and he criticized Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a \\"troika of tyranny.\\" = Criticism of the Obama administration = In December 2012, Bolton suggested that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had faked a concussion to avoid testifying before Congress regarding the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Bolton stated \\"When you don't want to go to a meeting or conference or an event you have a 'diplomatic illness'. And this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band.\\" In 2010, he wrote a foreword for the book The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America, authored by far-right anti-Muslim commentators Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer. Bolton endorsed their book, writing: \\"This book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of Barack Obama as our first post-American president. What it recounts is disturbing, and its broader implications are more disturbing still.\\"  Personal life  Bolton married Christine Bolton in 1972; they divorced in 1983. He has been married to Gretchen Smith Bolton, a financial planner with AXA Advisors, since January 1986. Together they have a daughter, Jennifer, and reside in Bethesda, Maryland. Bolton identifies as a Lutheran.  Bibliography   * The Room Where It Happened. Simon & Schuster. 2020.

Weisman Art Museum is an art museum located at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The museum was founded in 1934 and is named in honor of art collector Frederick R. Weisman. Originally based in Northrop Auditorium, it moved into its current building (designed by Frank Gehry) in 1993. Widely known as a \\"modern art museum,\\" the 25,000+ image collection has large collections of Marsden Hartley, Alfred Maurer, Charles Biederman, Native American Mimbres pottery, and traditional Korean furniture. Frederick R. Weisman Frederick R. Weisman (April 27, 1912 – September 11, 1994) was a Minneapolis native who became well known as an art collector in Los Angeles. In 1982 Weisman purchased an estate in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles that would serve as a showcase for his personal collection of 20th-century art. When he opened the art collection to the public, he wanted to share the experience of living with art, rather than the usual, more formal protocol of seeing art in a gallery or museum. The estate remains the home of the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation to this day. The Weisman Foundation estate is a two-story Mediterranean Revival house designed in the late 1920s by Los Angeles architect Gordon B. Kaufmann. The Weisman home exhibits the fine craftsmanship characteristic of the period, including custom decorative treatments on the walls and ceilings. Today the Foundation estate, annex, and surrounding gardens are made accessible to the public by appointment only.Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation Collection, 2007 Another museum bearing Weisman's name, the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art, is located on the campus of Pepperdine University in Malibu, California. Museum building The current museum building was designed by world-renowned architect Frank Gehry with MSR Design as architect of record and completed in November 1993. It is one of the major landmarks on the University of Minnesota campus, situated on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River at the east end of the Washington Avenue Bridge. The abstract structure is considered highly significant because it was built prior to the widespread use of computer aided design in architecture. The building presents two faces, depending on which side it is viewed from. To the south and east, it presents a brick facade that blends with the historic buildings along Northrop Mall. To the north and west, it is an abstraction of a fish and waterfall in curving and angular brushed steel sheets. The stainless steel skin was fabricated and installed by the A. Zahner Company, a frequent collaborator with Gehry's office. The museum received a major addition, also designed by Frank Gehry, in 2011. HGA Architects and Engineers served as local consultants for the project. Gallery File:Weisman-Art-Museum-2006-11-05.jpg|A closeup of the Frank Gehry-designed building File:Frederick R.

Areo­stationary orbit is a concept similar to Earth's geo­stationary orbit. The prefix areo- derives from Ares, the ancient Greek god of war and counterpart to the Roman god Mars, with whom the planet was identified. The modern Greek word for Mars is Άρης (Áris). To date, no artificial satellites have been placed in this orbit, but it is of interest to some scientists foreseeing a future tele­communications network for the exploration of Mars. An asteroid or station placed in areostationary orbit could also be used to construct a Martian space elevator for use in transfers between the surface of Mars and orbit.  Formula  Orbital speed (how fast a satellite is moving through space) is calculated by multiplying the angular speed of the satellite by the orbital radius: : R_{syn} = \\\\sqrt[3] : G = Gravitational constant : m2 = Mass of the celestial body : T = rotational period of the body By this formula one can find the geostationary-analogous orbit of an object in relation to a given body, in this case, Mars (this type of orbit above is referred to as an areostationary orbit if it is above Mars). The mass of Mars being 6.4171×1023 kg and the sidereal period 88,642 seconds.Lodders, Katharina; Fegley, Bruce (1998). The Planetary Scientist's Companion. Oxford University Press. p. 190. . The synchronous orbit thus has a radius of 20,428 km (12693 mi) from the centre of mass of Mars, and therefore areostationary orbit can be defined as approximately 17,032 km above the surface of the Mars equator.  Stationkeeping  Any satellites in areostationary orbit will suffer from increased orbital station keeping costs, Silva and Romero's paper even includes a graph of acceleration, where a reaction force could be calculated using the mass of desired object: because the Clarke belt of Mars lies between the orbits of the planet's two natural satellites. Phobos has a semi- major axis of 9,376 km, and Deimos has a semi-major axis of 23,463 km. The close proximity to Phobos' orbit in particular (the larger of the two moons) will cause unwanted orbital resonance effects that will gradually shift the orbit of areostationary satellites.

Early life Harvey was born in Windsor, Colorado, the son of Everett and Minnie R. Prewitt Harvey. He grew up in Waverly, Illinois and in Fort Collins and was a graduate of Fort Collins High School before serving in the U.S. Navy as a Quartermaster, 3rd Class, during World War II, during which time he was studying chemical engineering. \\"But when I got out,\\" Harvey has said, \\"I decided that wasn't for me and so I went into the theater.\\" Harvey came to Lawrence, Kansas in 1945 to study at the University of Kansas, where he majored in theater and acted in scores of college stage productions, including Hay Fever, The Skin of Our Teeth, Beggar on Horseback, Juno and the Paycock, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Joan of Lorraine, Blithe Spirit, Harvey, and Hamlet. During his years at KU, Harvey served as vice-president of the Dramatics Workshop and was a member of the Owl Society, an honorary organization for male juniors. He earned a bachelor of science degree in education from the KU speech and drama department in 1948 and subsequently became employed by that department as an instructor, while also a graduate student. Harvey made his directorial debut with an \\"experimental\\" production of Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead in 1949, and went on to direct several other plays and pageants at the university. He received his master of arts degree in speech and dramatics from KU in 1950. The subject of his master's thesis was his experience directing Bury the Dead for the KU stage. Besides his student appearances, Harvey gained acting experience through some work in summer stock, performing on the stages of the Topeka Civic Theater and Kansas City's Resident Theater. It was with the latter organization that Harvey portrayed Stanley Kowalski in a 1958 production of A Streetcar Named Desire. On June 3, 1950, Harvey's 26th birthday, he married Bernice \\"Bea\\" Brady, a Wichita native with whom he had performed in numerous KU theater productions. Immediately following the marriage, Harvey did a graduate study in drama during the 1950 summer session at the University of Denver, and then studied at the University of Colorado for a doctorate. \\"I made it through summer school and then I decided to go back to Kansas,\\" Harvey has said. He and his wife then returned to Lawrence and both landed jobs teaching theater, Harvey at KU and his wife at the local high school. Centron Films While teaching and directing at the university, Harvey broke into the film business as an actor in some of the movies being made by Centron Corporation of Lawrence, an independent industrial and educational film production company. Founded in 1947 in Lawrence by Arthur H. Wolf and Russell A. Mosser, Centron would come to the forefront of the industrial and educational film companies in the United States. Harvey joined the staff in 1952 and went on to work for Centron as a film director, writer, and producer for over three decades, making a variety of short industrial, educational, documentary, and government films. Centron competed with large companies on both coasts to become one of the top producers of industrial and educational films. Harvey was known for his high quality films, coming in on time and under budget. Harvey and his film crews were dispatched to far-flung locations around the globe to bring back images for geography and travel films. Harvey also worked with many well-known professional actors and entertainers in Centron films, such as Walter Pidgeon, Rowan and Martin, Dennis Day, Louis Nye, George Gobel, Billy Barty, Anita Bryant, Eddie Albert, Ed Ames, Jesse White, and Ricardo Montalban. The director won many national and international awards for his work, including the highest honors from the American Film Festival, C.I.N.E., and the Columbus Film Festival. An article written by Harvey was published in the March 1956 issue of American Cinematographer magazine, concerning innovative special effects techniques that had been developed by the Centron crew during the production of an industrial film. pg. 162 and 178. Harvey also occasionally penned reviews of local theater productions for the Lawrence newspaper. In 1957, Harvey commissioned the construction of a custom-built house within a block of the Centron studios. The resultant home was hailed regionally as an exceptional display of modern suburban architecture and attracted thousands of spectators when opened for public inspection upon its completion. The home's hillside yard was criss-crossed with a winding network of stone walls and terraces, built by Harvey himself. Harvey and his first wife Bea were divorced in 1960, due to the latter's infidelity, and shortly afterward Harvey met Pauline G. Pappas, who was one of the investors for Carnival of Souls. The two were married in 1967. When a crew from ABC came to Lawrence in 1982 to shoot the controversial television movie on nuclear war, The Day After, they cast Harvey in a small speaking role as a farmer, while also casting a handful of other local thespians. The film was broadcast to much international publicity and controversy in 1983. In 1981, Arthur Wolf and Russell Mosser had sold Centron to the Coronet division of Esquire, Inc., though production operations continued in Lawrence until decade's end. After 33 years with the firm, Harvey retired from Centron in 1985. His last project for the company was a prize- winning series of educational travelogues shot in Korea. After his retirement, Harvey continued in various activities, teaching film production at the University of Kansas, adjudicating films for the American Film Festival and the Kansas Film and Video Festival, and directing and acting in plays for the Lawrence Community Theater. He also had small speaking parts in the made-for- TV movies Murderer Ordained and Where Pigeons Go to Die, both of which were filmed on location in Kansas. Carnival of Souls Herk Harvey as \\"The Man\\" in Carnival of Souls Harvey is best known for his sole feature film, Carnival of Souls, a low budget 1962 horror film starring Candace Hilligoss. It was produced and directed by Harvey for an estimated $33,000. Harvey had witnessed the recent success of Elmer Rhoden Jr. and fellow industrial filmmaker Robert Altman in producing low-budget feature films in nearby Kansas City, and began to secure backing from local investors in order to mount a similar project in Lawrence. While returning to Kansas after shooting a Centron film in California, Harvey developed the idea for Carnival of Souls after driving past the abandoned Saltair Pavilion in Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiring an unknown New York actress, Lee Strasberg-trained Hilligoss, and otherwise employing mostly local talent, Harvey shot Carnival of Souls in three weeks, on location in Lawrence and Salt Lake City, using a script penned by Centron associate John Clifford. Harvey also played an uncredited role as the film's most prominent \\"ghoul.\\" Originally marketed as a B film and released by an upstart distribution company that quickly went bankrupt, Carnival of Souls never gained widespread public attention upon its original release but today has become hailed as a cult classic. Set to an organ score by Gene Moore, Carnival of Souls relies more on atmosphere than on special effects to create its mood of psychological horror. The film has a large cult following, built up primarily via late-night television screenings, and has been released on DVD by the Criterion Collection (complete with a host of special features, including an hour of excerpts from Harvey's Centron productions). To this day, the movie is still discussed by film buffs and occasionally has screenings at Halloween and art film festivals. Discouraged by the apparent failure of Carnival of Souls and busy with Centron assignments, Harvey never directed another feature, though he did make several aborted attempts. One was Flannagan's Smoke, a comedy script written by John Clifford concerning an escaped gas from a chemist's laboratory and its effect on the townspeople. Another was The Reluctant Witch, with a screenplay adapted by KU professor James E. Gunn from his own science fiction short story of the same title. Unlike Carnival of Souls, this was actually to be a Centron production, as Harvey had persuaded the company to delve into feature films. Shooting did begin, in the late 1960s, but it was not long before budgetary problems and conflicts with the lead actor ultimately shut down the production of The Reluctant Witch. Some unedited footage still survives. Harvey also wrote an un-produced feature screenplay of his own, entitled Windwagon, which was a historical dramatization of the Kansas territorial period and \\"sailing wagon\\" innovations of the late nineteenth century. Harvey did live to see the belated recognition of Carnival of Souls, which began in earnest during the mid-1980s. The peak of this revival of interest was a nationally publicized cast and crew reunion in Lawrence in 1989, followed by the movie's first legal release on home video, which sparked a number of high-profile reviews and articles. Several years later, Harvey was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On April 3, 1996, weeks after the sound stage at KU's Oldfather Studios (home of the KU film school and formerly Centron's headquarters) was officially christened the \\"Herk Harvey Sound Stage\\" in a large ceremony, Harvey died at his home in Lawrence. The Academy Film Archive preserved Carnival of Souls in 2012.

It meanders around the base of the Port Hills from west to south-east. Course The catchment of the Heathcote River extends to the suburb of Yaldhurst. It drains an area of approximately , with the Cashmere Stream the largest tributary. It flows through Wigram, Hillmorton (where the main springs are located), Hoon Hay (and from there around the base of the Port Hills), Spreydon, Cracroft, Cashmere, Beckenham, St Martins, Opawa, Woolston and Ferrymead. It drains into the Avon Heathcote Estuary before draining into Pegasus Bay.  Pre-European settlement and naming  Heathcote River in Beckenham The original name of this river, Ō-pa-waho means 'The Place of the Outward Pā', or 'The Outpost' and refers to this pā being an outpost (Māori: waho) of Kaiapoi. The pā was built in a higher location just downstream of the present Opawa Road Bridge. It was a resting place for Ngāi Tahu travelling between Kaiapoi and Horomaka (Banks Peninsula). The surrounding area was an important mahinga kai, a source of plentiful food, especially tuere (blind eel) and kanakana (lamprey). The river historically meandered through extensive wetlands prior to urbanisation. Historic survey maps from the mid-19th century (the so-called 'Black Maps') indicate that the habitat that the river passed through was abundant in flax (harakeke), toetoe, raupo, tutu and ferns and was dotted with ti kouka (cabbage tree). The Heathcote River in flood in Beckenham in April 2014 The river corridor was low-lying and very wet. When the Waimakariri River rose and flowed across the plains, even higher ground was prone to flooding. Over many centuries of using the river as a food source and transport corridor, the iwi of Waitaha, Kāti Māmoe and Ngāi Tahu fostered a close relationship with this resource. The swamp forest around the river provided gathering grounds for water fowl and forest birds. Traps were regularly set for inanga (whitebait), pātiki (flounder), and tuna (eel). The Heathcote River is named after Sir William Heathcote, secretary of the Canterbury Association. Management The Woolston Tidal Barrage and the Woolston Cut The Heathcote River provided Woolston plentiful water for industries like wool scouring. In 1966 the Woolston industrial sewer was built, and up until that time the river had become increasingly polluted. Flooding had also become a problem and in 1986 the Woolston Cut began to allow flood waters to bypass a long loop of the river, known as the Woolston Loop. The long project, which cost NZ$2m, had as a consequence that the trees on the riverbank died as far upstream as the Opawa bridge, and that banks collapsed. Extensive investigations revealed that the trees died from salt water travelling further upstream with every tide (with the salt killing the trees), that the soil structure changed (a sodium / calcium exchange in the clay molecules weakened the soils) and the Tunnelling mud crab had extended its range up the river, further weakening the banks. As a mitigating measure, the Woolston Tidal Barrage was built at the upstream end of the cut, which is only opened in time of floods. During normal flow regimes, the Heathcote remains to flow through the Woolston Loop. But despite the Woolston Cut, parts of the Heathcote River flood about annually. During 2008, Christchurch City Council consulted on a management plan for the section of river located between Colombo Street and Opawa Road, which was formally adopted on 9 April 2009.

Electromyographic Kinesiology. In Robertson, DGE et al. Research Methods in Biomechanics. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics Publ., 2004. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram. An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities, activation level, or recruitment order, or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement. In Computer Science, EMG is also used as middleware in gesture recognition towards allowing the input of physical action to a computer as a form of human-computer interaction. Medical uses EMG testing has a variety of clinical and biomedical applications. EMG is used as a diagnostics tool for identifying neuromuscular diseases, or as a research tool for studying kinesiology, and disorders of motor control. EMG signals are sometimes used to guide botulinum toxin or phenol injections into muscles. EMG signals are also used as a control signal for prosthetic devices such as prosthetic hands, arms and lower limbs An acceleromyograph may be used for neuromuscular monitoring in general anesthesia with neuromuscular-blocking drugs, in order to avoid postoperative residual curarization (PORC).Harvey AM, Masland RL: Actions of durarizing preparations in the human. Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 73, Issue 3, 304-311, 1941 Except in the case of some purely primary myopathic conditions EMG is usually performed with another electrodiagnostic medicine test that measures the conducting function of nerves. This is called nerve conduction studies (NCS). Needle EMG and NCSs are typically indicated when there is pain in the limbs, weakness from spinal nerve compression, or concern about some other neurologic injury or disorder., which cites  Spinal nerve injury does not cause neck, mid back pain or low back pain, and for this reason, evidence has not shown EMG or NCS to be helpful in diagnosing causes of axial lumbar pain, thoracic pain, or cervical spine pain. Needle EMG may aid with the diagnosis of nerve compression or injury (such as carpal tunnel syndrome), nerve root injury (such as sciatica), and with other problems of the muscles or nerves. Less common medical conditions include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and muscular dystrophy.  Technique  =Skin preparation and risks= The first step before insertion of the needle electrode is skin preparation. This typically involves simply cleaning the skin with an alcohol pad. The actual placement of the needle electrode can be difficult and depends on a number of factors, such as specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle. Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation of the muscle of interest, although EMG is more effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles. Also, the more body fat an individual has, the weaker the EMG signal. When placing the EMG sensor, the ideal location is at the belly of the muscle: the longitudinal midline. The belly of the muscle can also be thought of as in-between the motor point (middle) of the muscle and the tendonus insertion point.https://www.delsys.com/Attachments_pdf/TN101%20-%20EMG%20Sensor%20Placement- web.pdf Cardiac pacemakers and implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are used increasingly in clinical practice, and no evidence exists indicating that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices pose a safety hazard. However, there are theoretical concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies (NCS) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the device. In general, the closer the stimulation site is to the pacemaker and pacing leads, the greater the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the pacemaker. Despite such concerns, no immediate or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS. No known contraindications exist for performing needle EMG or NCS on pregnant patients. Additionally, no complications from these procedures have been reported in the literature. Evoked potential testing, likewise, has not been reported to cause any problems when it is performed during pregnancy. Patients with lymphedema or patients at risk for lymphedema are routinely cautioned to avoid percutaneous procedures in the affected extremity, namely venipuncture, to prevent development or worsening of lymphedema or cellulitis. Despite the potential risk, the evidence for such complications subsequent to venipuncture is limited. No published reports exist of cellulitis, infection, or other complications related to EMG performed in the setting of lymphedema or prior lymph node dissection. However, given the unknown risk of cellulitis in patients with lymphedema, reasonable caution should be exercised in performing needle examinations in lymphedematous regions to avoid complications. In patients with gross edema and taut skin, skin puncture by needle electrodes may result in chronic weeping of serous fluid. The potential bacterial media of such serous fluid and the violation of skin integrity may increase the risk of cellulitis. Before proceeding, the physician should weigh the potential risks of performing the study with the need to obtain the information gained. =Surface and intramuscular EMG recording electrodes= There are two kinds of EMG: surface EMG and intramuscular EMG. Surface EMG assesses muscle function by recording muscle activity from the surface above the muscle on the skin. Surface electrodes are able to provide only a limited assessment of the muscle activity. Surface EMG can be recorded by a pair of electrodes or by a more complex array of multiple electrodes. More than one electrode is needed because EMG recordings display the potential difference (voltage difference) between two separate electrodes. Limitations of this approach are the fact that surface electrode recordings are restricted to superficial muscles, are influenced by the depth of the subcutaneous tissue at the site of the recording which can be highly variable depending of the weight of a patient, and cannot reliably discriminate between the discharges of adjacent muscles. Intramuscular EMG can be performed using a variety of different types of recording electrodes. The simplest approach is a monopolar needle electrode. This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other. Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies. Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin, with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference. Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference, in this case, however, the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle, insulated so that only the tip is exposed, is used both to record signals and to inject. Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle electrode. These needles have a fine wire, embedded in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of a hypodermic needle, that has an exposed shaft, and the shaft serves as the reference electrode. The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode. As a result of this configuration, signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable. However, because the shaft is exposed throughout its length, superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles. Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas, and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated. To perform intramuscular EMG, typically either a monopolar or concentric needle electrode is inserted through the skin into the muscle tissue. The needle is then moved to multiple spots within a relaxed muscle to evaluate both insertional activity and resting activity in the muscle. Normal muscles exhibit a brief burst of muscle fiber activation when stimulated by needle movement, but this rarely lasts more than 100ms. The two most common pathologic types of resting activity in muscle are fasciculation and fibrillation potentials. A fasciculation potential is an involuntary activation of a motor unit within the muscle, sometimes visible with the naked eye as a muscle twitch or by surface electrodes. Fibrillations, however, are detected only by needle EMG, and represent the isolated activation of individual muscle fibers, usually as the result of nerve or muscle disease. Often, fibrillations are triggered by needle movement (insertional activity) and persist for several seconds or more after the movement ceases. After assessing resting and insertional activity, the electromyographer assess the activity of muscle during voluntary contraction. The shape, size, and frequency of the resulting electrical signals are judged. Then the electrode is retracted a few millimetres, and again the activity is analyzed. This is repeated, sometimes until data on 10–20 motor units have been collected in order to draw conclusions about motor unit function. Each electrode track gives only a very local picture of the activity of the whole muscle. Because skeletal muscles differ in the inner structure, the electrode has to be placed at various locations to obtain an accurate study. Single fiber electromyography assesses the delay between the contractions of individual muscle fibers within a motor unit and is a sensitive test for dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction caused by drugs, poisons, or diseases such as myasthenia gravis. The technique is complicated and typically performed only by individuals with special advanced training. Surface EMG is used in a number of settings; for example, in the physiotherapy clinic, muscle activation is monitored using surface EMG and patients have an auditory or visual stimulus to help them know when they are activating the muscle (biofeedback). A review of the literature on surface EMG published in 2008, concluded that surface EMG may be useful to detect the presence of neuromuscular disease (level C rating, class III data), but there are insufficient data to support its utility for distinguishing between neuropathic and myopathic conditions or for the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular diseases. EMGs may be useful for additional study of fatigue associated with post-poliomyelitis syndrome and electromechanical function in myotonic dystrophy (level C rating, class III data). Recently, with the rise of technology in sports, sEMG has become an area of focus for coaches to reduce the incidence of soft tissue injury and improve player performance. Athos, a Silicon Valley startup, has led the way as the only company to have their measurements validated as accurate and reliable compared to a medical grade sEMG system. Certain US states limit the performance of needle EMG by nonphysicians. New Jersey declared that it cannot be delegated to a physician's assistant.Arthur C. Rothman, MD, v. Selective Insurance Company of America, Supreme Court of New Jersey, Jan. 19Texas Court of Appeals, Third District, at Austin, Cause No. 03-10-673-CV. April 5, 2012 Michigan has passed legislation saying needle EMG is the practice of medicine.Section 333.17018 Michigan Compiled Laws http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-333-17018 Special training in diagnosing medical diseases with EMG is required only in residency and fellowship programs in neurology, clinical neurophysiology, neuromuscular medicine, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. There are certain subspecialists in otolaryngology who have had selective training in performing EMG of the laryngeal muscles, and subspecialists in urology, obstetrics and gynecology who have had selective training in performing EMG of muscles controlling bowel and bladder function. =Maximal voluntary contraction= One basic function of EMG is to see how well a muscle can be activated. The most common way that can be determined is by performing a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the muscle that is being tested.Behm, D.G., Whittle, J., Button, D., & Power, K. (2002). Intermuscle differences in activation. Muscle and Nerve. 25(2); 236-243. Muscle force, which is measured mechanically, typically correlates highly with measures of EMG activation of muscle. Most commonly this is assessed with surface electrodes, but it should be recognized that these typically record only from muscle fibers in close proximity to the surface. Several analytical methods for determining muscle activation are commonly used depending on the application. The use of mean EMG activation or the peak contraction value is a debated topic. Most studies commonly use the maximal voluntary contraction as a means of analyzing peak force and force generated by target muscles. According to the article, Peak and average rectified EMG measures: Which method of data reduction should be used for assessing core training exercises?,Hibbs, A.E., Thompson, K.G., French, D.N., Hodgson, D., Spears, I.R. Peak and average rectified EMG measures: Which method of data reduction should be used for assessing core training exercises? Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology. 21(1), 102 – 111. 2011. concluded that the “average rectified EMG data (ARV) is significantly less variable when measuring the muscle activity of the core musculature compared to the peak EMG variable.” Therefore, these researchers would suggest that “ARV EMG data should be recorded alongside the peak EMG measure when assessing core exercises.” Providing the reader with both sets of data would result in enhanced validity of the study and potentially eradicate the contradictions within the research.Buchanan, T.

ROLLER MASSAGER IMPROVES RANGE OF MOTION OF PLANTAR FLEXOR MUSCLES WITHOUT SUBSEQUENT DECREASES IN FORCE PARAMETERS. International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy, 9(1), 92. =Other measurements= EMG can also be used for indicating the amount of fatigue in a muscle. The following changes in the EMG signal can signify muscle fatigue: an increase in the mean absolute value of the signal, increase in the amplitude and duration of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to lower frequencies. Monitoring the changes of different frequency changes the most common way of using EMG to determine levels of fatigue. The lower conduction velocities enable the slower motor neurons to remain active.Cifrek, M., Medved, V., Tonković, S., & Ostojić, S. (2009). Surface EMG based muscle fatigue evaluation in biomechanics. Clinical Biomechanics, 24(4), 327-340. A motor unit is defined as one motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates. When a motor unit fires, the impulse (called an action potential) is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle. The area where the nerve contacts the muscle is called the neuromuscular junction, or the motor end plate. After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, an action potential is elicited in all of the innervated muscle fibers of that particular motor unit. The sum of all this electrical activity is known as a motor unit action potential (MUAP). This electrophysiologic activity from multiple motor units is the signal typically evaluated during an EMG. The composition of the motor unit, the number of muscle fibres per motor unit, the metabolic type of muscle fibres and many other factors affect the shape of the motor unit potentials in the myogram. Nerve conduction testing is also often done at the same time as an EMG to diagnose neurological diseases. Some patients can find the procedure somewhat painful, whereas others experience only a small amount of discomfort when the needle is inserted. The muscle or muscles being tested may be slightly sore for a day or two after the procedure. = EMG signal decomposition = EMG signals are essentially made up of superimposed motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) from several motor units. For a thorough analysis, the measured EMG signals can be decomposed into their constituent MUAPs. MUAPs from different motor units tend to have different characteristic shapes, while MUAPs recorded by the same electrode from the same motor unit are typically similar. Notably MUAP size and shape depend on where the electrode is located with respect to the fibers and so can appear to be different if the electrode moves position. EMG decomposition is non-trivial, although many methods have been proposed. =EMG signal processing= Rectification is the translation of the raw EMG signal to a signal with a single polarity, usually positive. The purpose of rectifying the signal is to ensure the signal does not average to zero, due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components. Two types of rectification are used: full- wave and half-wave rectification. Full-wave rectification adds the EMG signal below the baseline to the signal above the baseline to make a conditioned signal that is all positive. If the baseline is zero, this is equivalent to taking the absolute value of the signal. This is the preferred method of rectification because it conserves all of the signal energy for analysis. Half-wave rectification discards the portion of the EMG signal that is below the baseline. In doing so, the average of the data is no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical analyses. =Identification of human intention for control assistive devices= EMG signals have been used extensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic devices. In the past century, researchers proposed various hand-crafted features to interpret EMG signals. Recently, the end-to-end deep learning technique is used identify of human intention from raw image signals . = Limitations = Needle EMG used in clinical settings has practical applications such as helping to discover disease. Needle EMG has limitations, however, in that it does involve voluntary activation of muscle, and as such is less informative in patients unwilling or unable to cooperate, children and infants, and in individuals with paralysis. Surface EMG can have limited applications due to inherent problems associated with surface EMG. Adipose tissue (fat) can affect EMG recordings. Studies show that as adipose tissue increased the active muscle directly below the surface decreased. As adipose tissue increased, the amplitude of the surface EMG signal directly above the center of the active muscle decreased. EMG signal recordings are typically more accurate with individuals who have lower body fat, and more compliant skin, such as young people when compared to old. Muscle cross talk occurs when the EMG signal from one muscle interferes with that of another limiting reliability of the signal of the muscle being tested. Surface EMG is limited due to lack of deep muscles reliability. Deep muscles require intramuscular wires that are intrusive and painful in order to achieve an EMG signal. Surface EMG can measure only superficial muscles and even then it is hard to narrow down the signal to a single muscle. = Electrical characteristics = The electrical source is the muscle membrane potential of about -90 mV.Nigg B.M., & Herzog W., 1999. Biomechanics of the Musculo-Skeletal system. Wiley. Page:349. Measured EMG potentials range between less than 50 μV and up to 30 mV, depending on the muscle under observation. Typical repetition rate of muscle motor unit firing is about 7-20 Hz, depending on the size of the muscle (eye muscles versus seat (gluteal) muscles), previous axonal damage and other factors. Damage to motor units can be expected at ranges between 450 and 780 mV. Procedure outcomes = Normal results = Muscle tissue at rest is normally electrically inactive. After the electrical activity caused by the irritation of needle insertion subsides, the electromyograph should detect no abnormal spontaneous activity (i.e., a muscle at rest should be electrically silent, with the exception of the area of the neuromuscular junction, which is, under normal circumstances, very spontaneously active). When the muscle is voluntarily contracted, action potentials begin to appear. As the strength of the muscle contraction is increased, more and more muscle fibers produce action potentials. When the muscle is fully contracted, there should appear a disorderly group of action potentials of varying rates and amplitudes (a complete recruitment and interference pattern). = Abnormal results = EMG findings vary with the type of disorder, the duration of the problem, the age of the patient, the degree to which the patient can be cooperative, the type of needle electrode used to study the patient, and sampling error in terms of the number of areas studied within a single muscle and the number of muscles studied overall. Interpreting EMG findings is usually best done by an individual informed by a focused history and physical examination of the patient, and in conjunction with the results of other relevant diagnostic studies performed including most importantly, nerve conduction studies, but also, where appropriate, imaging studies such as MRI and ultrasound, muscle and nerve biopsy, muscle enzymes, and serologic studies. Abnormal results may be caused by the following medical conditions (please note this is not an exhaustive list of conditions that can result in abnormal EMG studies): Disorders of Muscle: * Inflammatory myopathies * Polymyositis * Dermatomyositis * Inclusion body myopathy * Myotonia Congenita * Muscular dystrophies: * Duchenne muscular dystrophy * Becker muscular dystrophy * Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy * Limb girdle muscular dystrophy * Centronuclear myopathy * Myotonic dystrophy * Mitochondrial myopathies Disorders of the neuromuscular junction: * Myasthenia Gravis * Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome * Botulism poisoning * Organophosphate poisoning * Hypermagnesemia * Hypocalcemia Disorders of Nerves: * Carpal tunnel syndrome * Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow * Radial nerve palsy (Saturday night palsy) * Peroneal (fibular) nerve palsy * Diabetic neuropathy * Alcohol related neuropathy * Nutritional neuropathy * Amyloid neuropathy * AIDP * CIDP * Bell’s palsy * Laryngeal neuropathy * Pudendal neuropathy * Femoral neuropathy * Sciatic Neuropathy * Tibial neuropathy * Tarsal tunnel syndrome * Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome * Zoster neuropathy * Oculomotor, Facial, vagal, trigeminal, glossopharyngeal, spinal accessory neuropathies * Hemifacial spasm * Multifocal motor neuropathy * Axillary neuropathy * Long thoracic neuropathy * Suprascapular neuropathy * Toxic neuropathies * Drug-induced neuropathies * Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Plexus disorders: * Neuralgic Amyotrophy (idiopathic brachial plexitis) * Traumatic brachial plexopathy * Lumbosacral radiculopathy * Hirayama disease Root disorders: * Cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral radiculopathy * Spinal stenosis * Arachnoiditis * Leptomeningeal disorders Motor neuron disease * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis * West Nile virus * Poliomyelitis * Kennedy’s syndrome (Spinobulbar muscular atrophy).  History  The first documented experiments dealing with EMG started with Francesco Redi’s works in 1666. Redi discovered a highly specialized muscle of the electric ray fish (Electric Eel) generated electricity. By 1773, Walsh had been able to demonstrate that the eel fish’s muscle tissue could generate a spark of electricity. In 1792, a publication entitled De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius appeared, written by Luigi Galvani, in which the author demonstrated that electricity could initiate muscle contraction. Six decades later, in 1849, Emil du Bois-Reymond discovered that it was also possible to record electrical activity during a voluntary muscle contraction. The first actual recording of this activity was made by Marey in 1890, who also introduced the term electromyography. In 1922, Gasser and Erlanger used an oscilloscope to show the electrical signals from muscles. Because of the stochastic nature of the myoelectric signal, only rough information could be obtained from its observation. The capability of detecting electromyographic signals improved steadily from the 1930s through the 1950s, and researchers began to use improved electrodes more widely for the study of muscles. The AANEM was formed in 1953 as one of several currently active medical societies with a special interest in advancing the science and clinical use of the technique. Clinical use of surface EMG (sEMG) for the treatment of more specific disorders began in the 1960s. Hardyck and his researchers were the first (1966) practitioners to use sEMG. In the early 1980s, Cram and Steger introduced a clinical method for scanning a variety of muscles using an EMG sensing device. 7/12/1954 Mayo Clinic Medical Sciences EMG Lab. Ervin L Schmidt in the chair, Mildred Windesheim’s arm holding the electrode. Research began at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota under the guidance of Dr Edward H. Lambert, MD, PhD (1915–2003) in the early 1950s. Dr Lambert, \\"Known as the \\"Father of EMG...\\" with the assistance of his Research Technician, Ervin L Schmidt, a self taught electrical engineer, developed a machine that could be moved from the EMG Lab, and was relatively easy to use. As oscilloscopes had no “store” or “print” features at the time, a Polaroid camera was affixed to the front on a hinge. It was synchronized to photo the scan. Fellows studying at Mayo soon learned that this was a tool they wanted, too. As Mayo has no interest in marketing their inventions, Mr. Schmidt went on to continue to develop them in his basement for decades, selling them under the name ErMel Inc. It was not until the middle of the 1980s that integration techniques in electrodes had sufficiently advanced to allow batch production of the required small and lightweight instrumentation and amplifiers. At present, a number of suitable amplifiers are commercially available. In the early 1980s, cables that produced signals in the desired microvolt range became available. Recent research has resulted in a better understanding of the properties of surface EMG recording. Surface electromyography is increasingly used for recording from superficial muscles in clinical or kinesiological protocols, where intramuscular electrodes are used for investigating deep muscles or localized muscle activity. There are many applications for the use of EMG. EMG is used clinically for the diagnosis of neurological and neuromuscular problems. It is used diagnostically by gait laboratories and by clinicians trained in the use of biofeedback or ergonomic assessment. EMG is also used in many types of research laboratories, including those involved in biomechanics, motor control, neuromuscular physiology, movement disorders, postural control, and physical therapy. Research EMG can be used to sense isometric muscular activity where no movement is produced. This enables definition of a class of subtle motionless gestures to control interfaces without being noticed and without disrupting the surrounding environment. These signals can be used to control a prosthesis or as a control signal for an electronic device such as a mobile phone or PDA . EMG signals have been targeted as control for flight systems. The Human Senses Group at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, CA seeks to advance man-machine interfaces by directly connecting a person to a computer. In this project, an EMG signal is used to substitute for mechanical joysticks and keyboards. EMG has also been used in research towards a \\"wearable cockpit,\\" which employs EMG-based gestures to manipulate switches and control sticks necessary for flight in conjunction with a goggle-based display. Unvoiced speech recognition recognizes speech by observing the EMG activity of muscles associated with speech. It is targeted for use in noisy environments, and may be helpful for people without vocal cords and people with aphasia. EMG has also been used as a control signal for computers and other devices. An interface device based on an EMG Switch can be used to control moving objects, such as mobile robots or an electric wheelchair.Andreasen, DS.; Gabbert DG,: EMG Switch Navigation of Power Wheelchairs, RESNA 2006. This may be helpful for individuals that cannot operate a joystick-controlled wheelchair. Surface EMG recordings may also be a suitable control signal for some interactive video games.Park, DG.; Kim, HC. Muscleman: Wireless input device for a fighting action game based on the EMG signal and acceleration of the human forearm. In 1999 an EMG program called Echidna was used to enable a man with locked in syndrome to send a message to a computer. That program, now called NeuroSwitch, developed by Control Bionics enables people with severe disabilities to communicate by text, email, SMS, computer-generated voice and to control computer games and programs, and - through the internet - Anybots telepresence robots. A joint project involving Microsoft, the University of Washington in Seattle, and the University of Toronto in Canada has explored using muscle signals from hand gestures as an interface device. A patent based on this research was submitted on June 26, 2008. In September 2019 Facebook bought a startup called CTRL-labs that was working on EMG  See also  * Chronaxie * Compound muscle action potential * Electrical impedance myography * Electrical muscle stimulation * Electrodiagnostic medicine * Electromyoneurography * Magnetomyography * Nerve conduction study * Neuromuscular ultrasound * Phonomyography  References  Further reading * Piper, H.: Elektrophysiologie menschlicher Muskeln.

Plot In Southport, Maryland, Susan Morrison (Teri Polo), recently divorced from her husband Frank (John Travolta) who is a struggling boat builder, is marrying a younger and wealthier Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). Danny (Matt O'Leary), Susan and Frank's twelve-year-old son, is clearly unhappy that his mother is remarrying. Susan asks Frank to allow Rick to go sailing with him and Danny, to help Danny bond with and accept Rick as a stepfather. After the wedding and a brief improvement in Danny's and Rick's relationship, Danny dislikes Rick once again. During a game of catch between the two, Rick clearly becomes agitated with Danny's ambivalent playing style and starts criticizing him harshly. The revelation that Susan and Rick are having a baby worsens the situation. After finding out about the baby, Danny stows away in Rick's Chevy Suburban, planning to drop off it en route and visit his father. But while Danny is inside, he sees Rick murdering mysterious stranger Ray Coleman (Steve Buscemi), who earlier attended the wedding unannounced, claiming to be an ex-business associate of Rick. Danny reports the murder to his father and to the local police. Rick, however, has managed to dispose of most of the evidence, and is widely considered a pillar of the local community as he invested his money in the area, whereas Danny has a history of lying and misdemeanors. Frank believes his son, though, stemming from Rick's notable unease around Coleman at the ceremony and the fact that Danny never lies to him. Frank does some investigating of his own and unearths Rick's criminal past, which now stands to put his son and ex-wife at risk. Frank learns that Rick's real name is Jack Parnell and that he is a criminal who was acquitted while his partners, which included Coleman, were convicted. Jack tries to kill Frank by setting his boathouse on fire, but Frank manages to escape. Susan realizes the truth when she sees a large burn on Jack's arm, having heard about the fire at the boathouse hours earlier. She tries to escape with Danny but Jack knocks her out and takes Danny as a hostage. Frank arrives to confront Jack, as he tries to flee. Jack and Frank fight, and Jack is killed when a tied-up Danny pushes him to a fuse box, electrocuting him. Susan has no serious physical injury from the conflict, aside from suffering a miscarriage.

This zone occurs at depths of about , depending on local circumstances. OMZs are found worldwide, typically along the western coast of continents, in areas where an interplay of physical and biological processes concurrently lower the oxygen concentration (biological processes) and restrict the water from mixing with surrounding waters (physical processes), creating a “pool” of water where oxygen concentrations fall from the normal range of 4–6 mg/l to below 2 mg/l.  Physical and biological processes  Surface ocean waters generally have oxygen concentrations close to equilibrium with the Earth's atmosphere. In general, colder waters hold more oxygen than warmer waters. As water moves out of the mixed layer into the thermocline, it is exposed to a rain of organic matter from above. Aerobic bacteria feed on this organic matter; oxygen is used as part of the bacterial metabolic process, lowering its concentration within the water. Therefore, the concentration of oxygen in deep water is dependent on the amount of oxygen it had when it was at the surface, minus depletion by deep sea organisms. Annual mean dissolved oxygen (upper panel) and apparent oxygen utilisation (lower panel) from the World Ocean Atlas. The data plotted show a section running north-south at the 180th meridian (approximately the centre of the Pacific Ocean). White regions indicate section bathymetry. In the upper panel a minimum in oxygen content is indicated by light blue shading between 0° (equator) and 60°N at an average depth of ca. . The downward flux of organic matter decreases sharply with depth, with 80–90% being consumed in the top . The deep ocean thus has higher oxygen because rates of oxygen consumption are low compared with the supply of cold, oxygen-rich deep waters from polar regions. In the surface layers, oxygen is supplied by exchange with the atmosphere. Depths in between, however, have higher rates of oxygen consumption and lower rates of advective supply of oxygen-rich waters. In much of the ocean, mixing processes enable the resupply of oxygen to these waters (i.e. waters that are part of the wind- driven subtropical gyre circulations are rapidly exchanged with the surface and never acquire a strong oxygen deficit). The distribution of the open-ocean oxygen minimum zones is controlled by the large-scale ocean circulation as well as local physical as well as biological processes. For example, wind blowing parallel to the coast causes Ekman transport that upwells nutrients from deep water. The increased nutrients support phytoplankton blooms, zooplankton grazing, and an overall productive food web at the surface. The byproducts of these blooms and the subsequent grazing sink in the form of particulate and dissolved nutrients (from phytodetritus, dead organisms, fecal pellets, excretions, shed shells, scales, and other parts). This \\"rain\\" of organic matter (see the biological pump) feeds the microbial loop and may lead to bacterial blooms in water below the euphotic zone due to the influx of nutrients. Since oxygen is not being produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis below the euphotic zone, these microbes use up what oxygen is in the water as they break down the falling organic matter thus creating the lower oxygen conditions. Physical processes then constrain the mixing and isolate this low oxygen water from outside water. Vertical mixing is constrained due to the separation from the mixed layer by depth. Horizontal mixing is constrained by bathymetry and boundaries formed by interactions with sub-tropical gyres and other major current systems. Low oxygen water may spread (by advection) from under areas of high productivity up to these physical boundaries to create a stagnant pool of water with no direct connection to the ocean surface even though (as in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific) there may be relatively little organic matter falling from the surface.  Life in the OMZ  Despite the low oxygen conditions, organisms have evolved to live in and around OMZs. For those organisms, like the vampire squid, special adaptations are needed to either make do with lesser amounts of oxygen or to extract oxygen from the water more efficiently. For example, the giant red mysid (Gnathophausia ingens) continues to live aerobically (using oxygen) in OMZs. They have highly developed gills with large surface area and thin blood-to-water diffusion distance that enables effective removal of oxygen from the water (up to 90% O2 removal from inhaled water) and an efficient circulatory system with high capacity and high blood concentration of a protein (hemocyanin) that readily binds oxygen. Another strategy used by some classes of bacteria in the oxygen minimum zones is to use nitrate rather than oxygen, thus drawing down the concentrations of this important nutrient. This process is called denitrification. The oxygen minimum zones thus play an important role in regulating the productivity and ecological community structure of the global ocean. For example, giant bacterial mats floating in the oxygen minimum zone off the west coast of South America may play a key role in the region's extremely rich fisheries as bacterial mats the size of Uruguay have been found there.  Changes  OMZs have changed over time due to effects from numerous global chemical and biological processes. To assess these changes, scientists utilize climate models and sediment samples to understand changes to dissolved oxygen in OMZs. Many recent studies of OMZs have focused on their fluctuations over time and how they may be currently changing as a result of climate change. Some research has aimed to understand how OMZs have changed over geological time scales. Throughout the history of Earth’s oceans, OMZs have fluctuated on long time scales, becoming larger or smaller depending on multiple variables. The factors that change OMZs are the amount of oceanic primary production resulting in increased respiration at greater depths, changes in the oxygen supply due to poor ventilation, and amount of oxygen supplied through thermohaline circulation. From recent observations, it is evident that the extent of OMZs has expanded in tropical oceans during the past half century. Vertical expansion of tropical OMZs has reduced the area between the OMZ and surface where oxygen is used by many organisms. Currently, research aims to better understand how OMZ expansion affects food webs in these areas. Studies on OMZ expansion in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic have observed negative effects on fish populations and commercial fisheries that likely occurred from reduced habitat when OMZs shoal. Other research has attempted to model potential changes to OMZs as a result of rising global temperatures and human impact. This is challenging due to the many factors that could contribute to changes in OMZs. The factors used for modeling change in OMZs are numerous, and in some cases hard to measure or quantify. Some of the processes being studied are changes in oxygen gas solubility as a result of rising ocean temperatures, as well as changes in the amount of respiration and photosynthesis occurring around OMZs. Many studies have concluded that OMZs are expanding in multiple locations, but fluctuations of modern OMZs are still not fully understood. Existing Earth system models project considerable reductions in oxygen and other physical-chemical variables in the ocean due to climate change, with potential ramifications for ecosystems and humans.

It also markets the ThinkPad and ThinkBook business lines of notebook computers; IdeaPad, Yoga, and Legion consumer lines of notebook laptops; and the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktops. Lenovo has operations in over 60 countries and sells its products in around 180 countries. It has research centers in Beijing, Chengdu, Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan), Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Morrisville (North Carolina, US), and also has Lenovo NEC Holdings, a joint venture with NEC that produces personal computers for the Japanese market. Lenovo was founded in Beijing in November 1984 as Legend, and was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1988. Lenovo acquired IBM's personal computer business in 2005 and agreed to acquire its Intel-based server business in 2014. Lenovo entered the smartphone market in 2012 and as of 2014 was the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China. In 2014, Lenovo acquired Motorola Mobility from Google. In 2017, Lenovo acquired Fujitsu's personal computer business. Lenovo is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index, often referred to as the \\"red chip\\" stocks. History =Early years= Liu Chuanzhi, along with a group of ten experienced engineers, founded Lenovo in Beijing on 1 November 1984 with 200,000 yuan. The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Jia Xufu (贾续福), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicated that the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Zeng Maochao (曾茂朝). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company. Their first significant effort, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. Lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \\"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\\" The fact that its staff had little business experience compounded Lenovo's early difficulties. \\"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market\\", Liu said, adding that \\"we just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting—but also very dangerous\\". In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name. In May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement on the front page of the China Youth News. Such ads were quite rare in China at the time. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Their average age was 26. Yang Yuanqing, the current CEO of Lenovo, was among that group. Liu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings. =IPO, second offerings, and bond sales= Lenovo became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong listing that raised nearly US$30 million. Prior to its IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital. When Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \\"roadshow\\" to discuss his company's stock, he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \\"Before I only had one boss, but the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\\" To fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million. Mary Ma, Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. All major issues regarding its board, management, major share transfers, and mergers and acquisitions were fairly and accurately reported. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on China Central Television (CCTV). Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance. In May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \\"Innovation Never Stands Still\\" (). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, New York, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \\"e\\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \\"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first … designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\\" In early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds will be sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history. Financial commentators noted that Lenovo was paying a premium to list the bonds in yuan given relatively low costs for borrowing in US dollars. =Tianxi= The Tianxi computer was designed to make it easy for inexperienced Chinese consumers to use computers and access the Internet. One of its most important features was a button that instantly connected users to the Internet and opened the Web browser. It was co-branded with China Telecom and it was bundled with one year of Internet service. The Tianxi was released in 1998. It was the result of two years of research and development. It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone. =Mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships= Lenovo works to integrate the management of each newly acquired company into its larger culture. Lenovo has a dedicated mergers and acquisitions team that tracks the progress of these integrations. Lenovo has an annual meeting where the management of newly acquired companies meets with its top 100 executives. In these meetings, held in English, Lenovo explains its global strategy and how new executives fit into its plans. IBM The ThinkPad logo, as seen on the ThinkPad X100e notebook computer Lenovo acquired IBM's personal computer business in 2005, including the ThinkPad laptop and tablet lines. Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's personal computer division accelerated access to foreign markets while improving both Lenovo's branding and technology. Lenovo paid US$1.25 billion for IBM's computer business and assumed an additional US$500 million of IBM's debt. This acquisition made Lenovo the third-largest computer maker worldwide by volume. In regards to the purchase of IBM's personal computer division, Liu Chuanzhi said, \\"We benefited in three ways from the IBM acquisition. We got the ThinkPad brand, IBM's more advanced PC manufacturing technology and the company's international resources, such as its global sales channels and operation teams. These three elements have shored up our sales revenue in the past several years.\\" IBM acquired an 18.9% shareholding in Lenovo in 2005 as part of Lenovo's purchase of IBM's personal computing division. Since then, IBM has steadily reduced its holdings of Lenovo stock. In July 2008, IBM's interest in Lenovo fell below the 5% threshold that mandates public disclosure. IBM's sold its Intel-based server lines, including IBM System x and IBM BladeCenter, to Lenovo in 2014. Lenovo says it will gain access to more enterprise customers, improve its profit margins, and develop a closer relationship with Intel, the maker of most server processors, through its acquisition of IBM's x86-based server business. On 1 October 2014, Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's server division, with the final price put at $2.1 billion. Lenovo said this acquisition came in at a price lower than the previously announced $2.3 billion partially because of a change in the value of IBM inventories. The deal has been already approved by Europe, China and the United States. The United States Department of Treasury Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was reportedly the last hurdle for Lenovo, since the United States has the strictest policies. According to Timothy Prickett-Morgan from Enterprise Tech, the deal still awaits \\"approval of regulators in China, the European Commission, and Canada\\". After closing, Lenovo said that its goal was to become the world's largest maker of servers. Lenovo also announced plans to start integrating IBM's workforce. The acquisition added about 6,500 new employees to Lenovo. Lenovo said that it has no immediate intent to cut jobs. Lenovo said that positions in research and development and customer- facing roles such as marketing would be \\"100% protected\\", but expected \\"rationalization\\" of its supply chain and procurement. Lenovo said that its x86 servers will be available to all its channel partners. Lenovo plans to cut prices on x86 products in order to gain market share. This goes in alliance with IBM's vision of the future around cloud technologies and their own POWER processor architecture. Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's businesses is arguably one of the greatest case studies on merging massive international enterprises. Though this acquisition in 2005 ultimately resulted in success, the integration of the businesses had a difficult and challenging beginning. Lenovo had employees from different cultures, different backgrounds, and different languages. These differences caused misunderstandings, hampering trust and the ability to build a new corporate culture. At the end of its first two years, Lenovo Group had met many of its original challenges, including integrating two disparate cultures in the newly formed company, maintaining the Think brand image for quality and innovation, and improving supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies. However, Lenovo had failed to meet a key objective of the merger: leveraging the combined strength of the two companies to grow volume and market share. In order to achieve success, Lenovo embraced diversify at multiple levels- business model, culture, and talent. By 2015, Lenovo grew into the world's number 1 PC maker, number 3 smartphone manufacturer and number 3 in the production of tablet computers. Mobile devices Vibe X smartphone presented by models at launch Lenovo sold its smartphone and tablet division in 2008 for US$100 million in order to focus on personal computers and then paid US$200 million to buy it back in November 2009. , the mobile division ranked third in terms of unit share in China's mobile handset market. Lenovo invested CN¥100 million in a fund dedicated to providing seed funding for mobile application development for its LeGarden online app store. As of 2010, LeGarden had more than 1,000 programs available for the LePhone. At the same time, LeGarden counted 2,774 individual developers and 542 developer companies as members. Lenovo entered the smartphone market in 2012 and quickly became the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China. Entry into the smartphone market was paired with a change of strategy from \\"the one-size-fits-all\\" to a diverse portfolio of devices. These changes were driven by the popularity of Apple's iPhone and Lenovo's desire to increase its market share in mainland China. Lenovo surpassed Apple Inc. to become the No. 2 provider of smartphones in the domestic Chinese market in 2012. However, due to there being about 100 smartphone brands sold in China, this second only equated to a 10.4% market share. In May 2012, Lenovo announced an investment of US$793 million in the construction of a mobile phone manufacturing and R&D; facility in Wuhan, Hubei. NEC On January 27, 2011, Lenovo formed a joint venture to produce personal computers with Japanese electronics firm NEC. The companies said in a statement that they would establish a new company called Lenovo NEC Holdings, to be registered in the Netherlands. NEC received US$175 million in Lenovo stock. Lenovo was to own a 51% stake in the joint venture, while NEC would have 49%. Lenovo has a five-year option to expand its stake in the joint venture. This joint venture was intended to boost Lenovo's worldwide sales by expanding its presence in Japan, a key market for personal computers. NEC spun off its personal computer business into the joint venture. As of 2010, NEC controlled about 20% of Japan's market for personal computers while Lenovo had a 5% share. Lenovo and NEC also agreed to explore cooperating in other areas such as servers and tablet computers. Roderick Lappin, chairman of the Lenovo–NEC joint venture, told the press that the two companies will expand their co-operation to include the development of tablet computers. In April 2014, Lenovo purchased a portfolio of patents from NEC related to mobile technology. These included over 3,800 patent families in countries around the world. The purchase included standards-essential patents for 3G and LTE cellular technologies and other patents related to smartphones and tablets. Medion In June 2011, Lenovo announced that it planned to acquire control of Medion, a German electronics manufacturing company. Lenovo said the acquisition would double its share of the German computer market, making it the third-largest vendor by sales (after Acer and Hewlett-Packard). The deal, which closed in the third quarter of the same year, was claimed by The New York Times as \\"the first in which a Chinese company acquired a well-known German company.\\" This acquisition will give Lenovo 14% of the German computer market. Gerd Brachmann, chairman of Medion, agreed to sell two-thirds of his 60 percent stake in the company. He will be paid in cash for 80 percent of the shares and will receive 20 percent in Lenovo stock. That would give him about one percent of Lenovo. CCE In September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the Brazil-based electronics company Digibras, which sells products under the brand-name CCE, for a base price of 300 million reals (US$148 million) in a combination of stock and cash. An additional payment of 400 million reals was made dependent upon performance benchmarks. Prior to its acquisition of CCE, Lenovo already established a $30 million factory in Brazil, but Lenovo's management had felt that they needed a local partner to maximize regional growth. Lenovo cited their desire to take advantage of increased sales due to the 2014 World Cup that would be hosted by Brazil and the 2016 Summer Olympics and CCE's reputation for quality. Following the acquisition, Lenovo announced that its subsequent acquisitions would be concentrated in software and services. Stoneware In September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the United States-based software company Stoneware, in its first software acquisition. The transaction was expected to close by the end of 2012; no financial details have been disclosed. Lenovo said that the company was acquired in order to gain access to new technology and that Stoneware is not expected to significantly affect earnings. More specifically, Stoneware was acquired to further Lenovo's efforts to improve and expand its cloud-computing services. For the two years prior to its acquisition, Stoneware partnered with Lenovo to sell its software. During this period Stoneware's sales doubled. Stoneware was founded in 2000. As of September 2012, Stoneware is based in Carmel, Indiana and has 67 employees. Lenovo and NetApp In September 2018 Lenovo and NetApp announced about strategic partnership and joint venture in China. As part of strategic partnership Lenovo started two new lines of storage systems: DM-Series and DE-Series. Both storage systems using Lenovo hardware and NetApp software: DM-Series using ONTAP OS and DE-Series SANtricity OS. LenovoEMC The signing ceremony for the LenovoEMC joint venture LenovoEMC was a joint venture of Lenovo and EMC and offered network- attached storage (NAS) solutions. LenovoEMC's products were formerly offered under the Iomega brand name. As of 2018, lenovoemc.com now redirects to lenovo.com, and Lenovo has retired all of the LenovoEMC products on their product page advising that the product(s) are no longer available for purchase on lenovo.com. Motorola Mobility Motorola Moto X On 29 January 2014, Google announced it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for US$2.91 billion. When Google and Lenovo first announced the acquisition of Motorola, they said the purchase would be funded with $660 million in cash, $750 million in Lenovo stock, and a $1.5 billion promissory note due in three years. As of February 2014, Google owns about 5.94% of Lenovo's stock. The deal includes smartphone lines like the Moto X and Moto G and the Droid Turbo. Lenovo also got the future Motorola Mobility product roadmap. Google will retain the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit and all but 2,000 of the company's patents. Lenovo will receive royalty free licenses to all the patents retained by Google. Lenovo has stated that Motorola was purchased in large part due to its long-standing relationships with cellular network operators in the United States and the United Kingdom. Lenovo previously had difficulty breaking into the United Kingdom due to the high proportion of customers who sign contracts and receive phones from carriers. A Lenovo executive said, \\"There are lots of reasons why we bought Motorola but primarily because it has a history of distribution in the UK. Motorola has long and established relationships with routes to market in North America and the UK, where people are tied to their network operator.\\" Lenovo received approval from the European Union for its acquisition of Motorola in June 2014. In a statement the European Union said, \\"The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would not raise competition concerns in relation to smart mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), given the limited market position of the parties and the presence of other strong suppliers in the market.\\" At the time of the EU approval Lenovo said it was on track to win final approval of the merger in the United States. The acquisition was completed on 30 October 2014. Motorola Mobility will remain headquartered in Chicago, and continue to use the Motorola brand, but Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's leader. DataCore In March 2017, Lenovo announced it was partnering with Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based software storage virtualization company DataCore to add DataCore's parallel I/O-processing software to Lenovo's storage devices. The servers were reportedly designed to outperform Storage Area Network (SAN) SAN arrays. Fujitsu In 2017 Lenovo formed a joint venture with Fujitsu and the Development Bank of Japan.\\"Fujitsu, Lenovo and DBJ form PC Joint Venture\\", Fujitsu Global, 02 November, 2017. In the joint venture, Fujitsu will sell Lenovo a 51% stake in Fujitsu Client Computing Limited. DBJ will acquire a 5% stake. TOP500 In 2018, Lenovo became the world's largest provider for the TOP500 supercomputers.  Impact of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic  In late April 2020, Lenovo began to terminate contractors and put other cost saving measures in place due to financial strain from the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The company cut multiple internships and froze salaries for their employees. Cuts in the company primarily took place in the data center group, which is based in Research Triangle Park. Most of the layoffs took place in the company's US headquarters, located in Morrisville, North Carolina. The coronavirus pandemic also forced the company to close its factories in China. The factories reopened in April 2020. Lenovo also introduced a \\"Partner Stimulus Package\\" in light of the pandemic. The package came in response to the economic strain on Lenovo and the company's partners during the pandemic.The partnership made earnings more predictable for partners, enabled faster payouts, and extended financial terms. The partnership extended terms from sixty days to ninety days. The package was intended to free up cash flows for the company's U.S. and Canadian partners. DLL worked with the company to the financial offerings for the companies in these regions. Lenovo also extended their warranty dates seventy five days through May Thirty First for all Lenovo and Motorola products. Lenovo had a philanthropic response valued at more than thirteen million dollars USD. This includes donating technology to support social distancing efforts, along with schooling at home and work from home efforts. The CEO of the company also donated one and a half million dollars USD to the Chinese University of Science and Technology. Lenovo also allowed their employees in their offices based in China to work from home remotely during the pandemic. Offices based in Europe and the Americas were also allowing employees to work remotely once the pandemic reached that part of the world. The company also made an effort to find roles for employees whose positions were negatively affected and or made ineffective by the ongoing pandemic. Lenovo made a pledge to follow any and all guidelines put in to place by the government's of the respective areas where their office buildings are located. Lenovo also began to take the temperatures and screen the health of all of its employees at its manufacturing sites and factories. The company also required that the employees of the factories and manufacturing sites were to wear a face covering or surgical mask at all times while on site. Name \\"Lenovo\\" is a portmanteau of \\"Le-\\" (from Legend) and \\"novo\\", Latin ablative for \\"new\\". The Chinese name () means \\"association\\" (as in \\"word association\\") or \\"connected thinking\\". It can also imply creativity. \\"Lianxiang\\" was first used to refer to a layout of Chinese typewriters in the 1950s organized into groups of common words and phrases rather than the standard dictionary layout. Lenovo advertisement at the Consumer Electronics Show, 2012 For the first 20 years of its existence, the company's English name was \\"Legend\\" (; ). In 2002, Yang Yuanqing decided to abandon the Legend brand name to expand internationally. \\"Legend\\" was already in use by many businesses worldwide (whose products and services (in the United States, for example) would include those from both the technological and non-technological arenas of industry and commerce), making it impossible to register in most jurisdictions outside China. In April 2003, the company publicly announced its new name, \\"Lenovo\\", with an advertising campaign including huge billboards and primetime television ads. Lenovo spent 18 million RMB on an eight-week television advertising campaign. The billboards showed the Lenovo logo against blue sky with copy that read, \\"Transcendence depends on how you think.\\" By the end of 2003, Lenovo had spent a total of 200 million RMB on rebranding. Products and services =Personal and business computing= Lenovo markets the ThinkPad, IdeaPad, Yoga, Legion and Xiaoxin (only sells in China) lines of notebook laptops, as well as the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktops. It expanded significantly in 2005 through its acquisition of IBM's personal computer business, including its ThinkPad and ThinkCentre lines. As of January 2013, shipments of THINK-branded computers have doubled since Lenovo's takeover of the brand, with profit margins thought to be above 5%. Lenovo aggressively expanded the THINK brand away from traditional laptop computers in favor of tablets and hybrid devices such as the ThinkPad Tablet 2, ThinkPad Yoga, ThinkPad 8, ThinkPad Helix, and ThinkPad Twist; the shift came as a response to the growing popularity of mobile devices, and the release of Windows 8 in October 2012. Lenovo achieved significant success with this high-value strategy and in 2013 controlled more than 40% of the market for Windows computers priced above $900 in the United States. ThinkPad A Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Ultrabook The ThinkPad is a line of business oriented laptop computers known for their boxy black design, modeled after a traditional Japanese lunchbox (bento). ThinkPads were originally an IBM product; they have been manufactured and sold by Lenovo since early 2005, following its acquisition of IBM's personal computer division. The ThinkPad has been used in space and were the only laptops certified for use on the International Space Station. ThinkCentre The ThinkCentre is a line of business-oriented desktop computers which was introduced in 2003 by IBM and since has been produced and sold by Lenovo since 2005. ThinkCentre computers typically include mid-range to high-end processors, options for discrete graphics cards, and multi-monitor support. Similar to the ThinkPad line of computers, there have been budget lines of ThinkCentre branded computers in the past. Some examples of this include: M55e series, A50 series, M72 series. These \\"budget\\" lines are typically \\"thin clients\\" however. ThinkServer The ThinkServer product line began with the TS100 from Lenovo. The server was developed under agreement with IBM, by which Lenovo would produce single- socket and dual-socket servers based on IBM's xSeries technology. An additional feature of the server design was a support package aimed at small businesses. The focus of this support package was to provide small businesses with software tools to ease the process of server management and reduce dependence on IT support. ThinkStation Lenovo ThinkStations are workstations designed for high-end computing. In 2008, Lenovo expanded the focus of its THINK brand to include workstations, with the ThinkStation S10 being the first model released. ThinkVision displays High-end monitors are marketed under the ThinkVision name. ThinkVision displays share a common design language with other THINK devices such as the ThinkPad line of notebook computers and ThinkCentre desktops. At the 2014 International CES, Lenovo announced the ThinkVision Pro2840m, a 28-inch 4K display aimed at professionals. Lenovo also announced another 28-inch 4K touch-enabled device running Android that can function as an all-in-one PC or an external display for other devices. At the 2016 International CES, Lenovo announced two displays with both USB-C and DisplayPort connectivity. The ThinkVision X24 Pro monitor is a 24-inch 1920 by 1080 pixel thin-bezel display that uses an IPS LCD panel. The ThinkVision X1 is a 27-inch 3840 by 2160 pixel thin-bezel display that uses a 10-bit panel with 99% coverage of the sRGB color gamut. The X24 includes a wireless charging base for mobile phones. The X1 is the first monitor to receive the TUV Eye-Comfort certification. Both monitors have HDMI 2.0 ports, support charging laptops, mobile phones, and other devices, and have Intel RealSense 3D cameras in order to support facial recognition. Both displays have dual-array microphones and 3-watt stereo speakers. IdeaPad An IdeaPad 300 The IdeaPad line of consumer-oriented laptop computers was introduced in January 2008. The IdeaPad is the result of Lenovo's own research and development; Unlike the ThinkPad line, its design and branding were not inherited from IBM. The IdeaPad's design language differs markedly from the ThinkPad and has a more consumer-focused look and feel. On September 21, 2016, Lenovo confirmed that their Yoga series is not meant to be compatible with Linux operating systems, that they know it is impossible to install Linux on some models, and that it is not supported. This came in the wake of media coverage of problems that users were having while trying to install Ubuntu on several Yoga models, including the 900 ISK2, 900 ISK For Business, 900S, and 710, which were traced back to Lenovo disabling and removing support for the AHCI storage mode for the device's Solid State Drive in the computer's BIOS, in favor of a RAID mode that is only supported by Windows 10 drivers that come with the system. Lenovo has since released an alternative firmware that has restored the AHCI mode to the drive controller to allow installation of Linux operating systems. IdeaCentre All IdeaCentres are all-in-one machines, combining processor and monitor into a single unit. The desktops were described by HotHardware as being \\"uniquely designed\\". The first IdeaCentre desktop, the IdeaCentre K210, was announced by Lenovo on 30 June 2008. While the IdeaCentre line consists only of desktops, it shares design elements and features with the IdeaPad line. One such feature was Veriface facial recognition technology. At CES 2011, Lenovo announced the launch of four IdeaCentre desktops: the A320, B520, B320, and C205. In the autumn of 2012, the firm introduced the more powerful IdeaCentre A720, with a 27-inch touchscreen display and running Windows 8. With a TV tuner and HDMI in, the A720 can also serve as a multimedia hub or home theater PC. In 2013, Lenovo added a table computer to the IdeaCentre line. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC, introduced at the 2013 International CES is a 27-inch touchscreen computer designed to lay flat for simultaneous use by multiple people. Thanks to its use of Windows 8, the Horizon can also serve as a desktop computer when set upright. Legion Legion is a series of laptop from Lenovo targeting gaming performance. In year 2020, Lenovo launch Legion 3, 5 and 7 where Legion 7 is the highest specification of the series. =Smartphones= The ThinkPad Tablet 2 from front and back As of January 2013, Lenovo only manufactured phones that use the Android operating system from Google. Numerous press reports indicated that Lenovo planned to release a phone running Windows Phone 8, According to J. D. Howard, a vice president at Lenovo's mobile division, the company would release a Windows Phone product if there is market demand. Lenovo has implemented an aggressive strategy to replace Samsung Electronics as Mainland China market's top smartphone vendor. It has spent $793.5 million in Wuhan in order to build a plant that can produce 30 to 40 million phones per year. Data from Analysys International shows that Lenovo experienced considerable growth in smartphone sales in China during 2012. Specifically, it saw its market share increase to 14.2% during 2012's third quarter, representing an increase when compared to 4.8% in the same quarter of 2011. IDC analysts said that Lenovo's success is due to its \\"aggressive ramping-up and improvements in channel partnerships.\\" Analysys International analyst Wang Ying wrote, \\"Lenovo possesses an obvious advantage over rivals in terms of sales channels.\\" The company's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, said, \\"Lenovo does not want to be the second player ... we want to be the best. Lenovo has the confidence to outperform Samsung and Apple, at least in the Chinese market.\\" According to IHS iSuppli, Lenovo was a top-three smartphone maker in China with a 16.5% market share in the first quarter of 2012. According to a May report released by IDC Lenovo ranks fourth in the global tablet market by volume. As of November 2012, Lenovo was the second largest seller of mobile phones in China when measured by volume. In May 2013, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing indicated that the company had aimed to release smartphones in the United States within the next year. Later in October, Lenovo expressed interest in acquiring the Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry Ltd. However, its attempt was reportedly blocked by the Government of Canada, citing security concerns due to the use of BlackBerry devices by prominent members of the government. An official stated that \\"we have been pretty consistent that the message is Canada is open to foreign investment and investment from China in particular but not at the cost of compromising national security\\". In January 2014, Lenovo announced a proposed deal to acquire Motorola Mobility to bolster its plans for the U.S. market. Microsoft officially announced that Lenovo had become the hardware partner of Windows Phone platform at the Mobile World Congress 2014. In January 2016, Lenovo announced at CES that the company would be producing the first Project Tango phone.By author, outlet. \\"Lenovo Is Making The First Google Project Tango Phone.\\" 8 January 2016. Lenovo plus Motorola was the 3rd largest producer of smartphones by volume in the world between 2011 and 2014. Since Lenovo's acquisition of Motorola Mobility, the combined global market share of Lenovo plus Motorola has fallen from 7.2% in 2014 to 3.9% in the third quarter of 2016. A number of factors have been cited as the cause of this reduced demand, including the fact that Lenovo relied heavily on carriers to sell its phones, its phones lacked strong branding and unique features to distinguish them in the competitive Chinese market where a weak economy and saturated market is slowing demand and the culture clash between a more hierarchical PC company and the need to be nimble to sell rapidly-evolving smartphones. In response to the weak sales, Lenovo announced in August 2015 that it would lay off 3,200 employees, mostly in its Motorola smartphone business. In the reorganization which followed, Lenovo was uncertain how to brand its Motorola smartphones. In November 2015, members of Lenovo management made statements that Lenovo would use the Motorola brand for all its smartphones. Then, in January 2016, Lenovo announced that it would be eliminating the Motorola brand in favor of \\"Moto by Lenovo\\". The company reversed course in March 2017 and announced that the Motorola brand name would be used in all regions in future products. \\"In 2016, we just finished transforming ourselves,\\" Motorola Chairman and President Aymar de Lencquesaing said in an interview, \\"We have clarity on how we present ourselves.\\" =Smart televisions= A Lenovo A30 TV set-top box In November 2011, Lenovo said it would soon unveil a smart television product called LeTV, expected for release in the first quarter of 2012. \\"The PC, communications and TV industries are currently undergoing a 'smart' transformation. In the future, users will have many smart devices and will desire an integrated experience of hardware, software and cloud services.\\" Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile-Internet and digital-home-business division. In June 2013 Lenovo announced a partnership with Sharp to produce smart televisions. In March 2014, Lenovo announced that it projected smart television sales surpassing one million units for 2014. The same month Lenovo released its flagship S9 Smart TV. =Wearables= The Lenovo Smartwatch on display at the 2015 Mobile World Congress Rumors that Lenovo was developing a wearable device were confirmed in October 2014 after the company submitted a regulatory finding to the Federal Communications Commission. The device, branded a \\"Smartband\\", has a battery life of seven days. It has an optical heart-rate monitor and can be used to track distance and time spent running and calories burned. It can also notify the user of incoming calls and texts. It can also unlock computers without the use of a password. The Smartband went on sale in October 2014. Lenovo started offering the device for sale on its website without a formal product announcement. =IoT / Smart Home= In 2015 Lenovo launched a strategic cooperation with IngDan, a subsidiary of the Cogobuy Group to penetrate into the intelligent hardware sector. Lenovo wanted to procure High-Tech hardware in the then newly emerging Internet of Things (IoT) economy and formed a strategic partnership with Cogobuy in which it previously primarily bought IC components from. Cogobuy's supply chain was utilised by Lenovo to procure consumer devices and bridge gaps in their proprietary hardware and software development. At the IFA 2018, Lenovo launched several smart home products. =Lenovo Connect= At the Mobile World Congress in 2016 Lenovo introduced Lenovo Connect, a wireless roaming service. This service works across devices, networks, and international borders in China, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Lenovo Connect eliminates the need to buy new SIM cards when crossing borders. Lenovo Connect started service for phones and select ThinkPad laptops in China in February 2016. Operations Lenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing, China, Morrisville, North Carolina, US, and Singapore, with research centers in Beijing, Morrisville, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu, Nanjing, Wuhan and Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan).Locations , Lenovo.com (US). Retrieved 22 October 2009. Lenovo operates factories in Chengdu and Hefei in China, and in Japan. A flagship store opened in Beijing in February 2013. The Lenovo R&D; centre in Shenzhen, Guangdong Lenovo's manufacturing operations are a departure from the usual industry practice of outsourcing to contract manufacturers. Lenovo instead focuses on vertical integration in order to avoid excessive reliance on original equipment manufacturers and to keep down costs. Speaking on this topic, Yang Yuanqing said, \\"Selling PCs is like selling fresh fruit. The speed of innovation is very fast, so you must know how to keep up with the pace, control inventory, to match supply with demand and handle very fast turnover.\\" Lenovo benefited from its vertical integration after flooding affected hard- drive manufacturers in Thailand in 2011, as the company could continue manufacturing operations by shifting production towards products for which hard drives were still available. Lenovo began to emphasize vertical integration after a meeting in 2009 in which CEO Yang Yuanqing, and the head of Lenovo's supply chain, analyzed the costs versus the benefits of in-house manufacturing, and decided to make at least 50% of Lenovo's manufacturing in- house. Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development. He stated, \\"If you look at the industry trends, most innovations for\\" PCs, smartphones, tablets and smart TVs are related to innovation of key components—display, battery and storage. Differentiation of key parts is so important. So we started investing more ... and working very closely with key parts suppliers.\\" Previously, lack of integration due to numerous foreign acquisitions and an excessive number of \\"key performance indicators\\" (KPIs) was making Lenovo's expansion expensive and creating unacceptably slow delivery times to end- customers. Lenovo responded by reducing the number of KPIs from 150 to 5, offering intensive training to managers, and working to create a global Lenovo culture. Lenovo also doubled-down on vertical integration and manufacturing near target markets in order to cut costs at time when its competitors were making increased use of outsourcing off-shoring. By 2013, Lenovo ranked 20th on Gartner's list of top 50 supply chains, whereas in 2010 the company was unranked. In 2012, Lenovo partially moved production of its ThinkPad line of computers to Japan. ThinkPads will be produced by NEC in Yamagata Prefecture. Akaemi Watanabe, president of Lenovo Japan, said, \\"As a Japanese, I am glad to see the return to domestic production and the goal is to realize full-scale production as this will improve our image and make the products more acceptable to Japanese customers.\\" In October 2012, Lenovo announced that it would start assembling computers in Whitsett, North Carolina. Production of desktop and laptop computers, including the ThinkPad Helix began in January 2013. , 115 workers were employed at this facility. Lenovo has been in Whitsett since 2008, where it also has centers for logistics, customer service, and return processing. In 2015, Lenovo and Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, a government-sponsored business park for technology firms, reached a deal to \\"jointly build a cloud service and product research and development center\\". Lenovo's Asia Pacific data center will also be housed in Cyperport. Lenovo assembles smartphones in Chennai, India through a contract manufacturing agreement with Flextronics. In November 2015, Lenovo announced that it would start manufacturing computers in Pondicherry.

In early 2016, Lenovo carried out a comprehensive restructuring of its business units. =Financials and market share= From 4 March 2013, Lenovo was included as a constituent stock in the Hang Seng Index. Lenovo replaced the unprofitable Aluminum Corp of China, a state-owned enterprise, on the list of 50 key companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange that constitute the Hang Seng Index. The inclusion of Lenovo and Tencent, China's largest internet firm, significantly increased the weight of the technology sector on the index. Being added to the Hang Seng Index was a significant boon for Lenovo and its shareholders as it widened the pool of investors willing to purchase Lenovo's stock. For instance, index funds pegged to the Hang Seng and pension funds that consider index inclusion now have the opportunity to invest in Lenovo. In November 2013 Lenovo reported that they had achieved double-digit market share in the United States for the first time. Lenovo is the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales from 2013 to 2015. In 2016 Lenovo shipped an estimated 55.5 million PCs, for an estimated 21.3% market share, according to market research firm International Data Corporation. For the fiscal year ending March 2016, the company reported revenue of US$44.9 billion. The company's expansion was boosted in part by a joint venture with NEC in Japan called Lenovo NEC Holdings. Lenovo was able to reclaim its top spot in PC market share 2018. =Ownership= In 2009, China Oceanwide Holdings Group, a private investment firm based in Beijing, bought 29% of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo, for 2.76 billion yuan. , 65% of Lenovo stock was held by the general public, 29% by Legend Holdings, 5.8% by Mr. Yang, and 0.2% by other directors. Responding to claims that Lenovo is a state-owned enterprise CEO Yang Yuanqing said: \\"Our company is a 100% market oriented company. Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\\" As of 2014, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, owns 11.7% of Lenovo. In early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \\"We are not a government-controlled company.\\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment. The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress. Yang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 percent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \\"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership – we do what we say, and we own what we do. My decision to increase my holdings represents my steadfast belief in these principles.\\" =Corporate culture= Lenovo's senior executives, including many non-Chinese, rotate between two head offices, one in Beijing and the other in Morrisville, North Carolina, and Lenovo's research and development center in Japan. Two foreigners have previously served as Lenovo's CEO. Lenovo's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, initially did not understand English well, but relocated his family to Morrisville to improve his language skills and learn American ways of corporate governance. One American Lenovo executive interviewed by The Economist praised Yang for his efforts to make Lenovo a friendly place for foreigners to work. He said that Yang had created a \\"performance culture\\" in place of the traditional Chinese work style of \\"waiting to see what the emperor wants\\". =Leadership= Yang Yuanqing Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997. In 2001, Business Week named him one of Asia's rising stars in business. Yang was president and CEO of Lenovo until 2004, when Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's PC division, after which Yang was succeeded as Lenovo CEO by IBM's Stephen M. Ward, Jr. Ward was succeeded by Bill Amelio on 20 December 2005. In February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO. In 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \\"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, \\"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company.\\" The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314. This was almost equivalent to a monthly salary of an average worker in China. Yang made a similar gift of $3.25 million again in 2013. According to Lenovo's annual report, Yang earned $14 million, including $5.2 million in bonuses, during the fiscal year that ended in March 2012. In 2013, Barron's named Yang one of the \\"World's Best CEOs\\". Liu Chuanzhi Liu Chuanzhi is the founder and chairman of Lenovo. Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with The Economist he stated that \\"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China. In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \\"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\\" Board of directors In early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo founder Jerry Yang to its board. Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \\"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm ARM, was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \\"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\\" Marketing and sponsorships =Emerging markets= In 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach In 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising. While Lenovo has not revealed its total spending on marketing, it did increase marketing and advertising expenditures by $248 million in the fiscal year ending in 2012. China A Lenovo Store in China In China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products. As of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier Li Keqiang will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \\"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence. India Lenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of Tamil Nadu ordered a million laptops from Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as Ingram Micro and Redington. Given that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \\"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\\" As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo. Lenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15-20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in Gujarat and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities. In India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain market intelligence and speed up product development. Lenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014. Canalys, a market research firm, said Lenovo took market share away from Apple and Samsung in the country. Africa Lenovo first started doing business in South Africa, establishing a sales office, and then expanded to East African markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda. West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana. According to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \\"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\\" and roll out \\"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008. Lenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones. In the long term, according to Braum, \\"Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.\\" =United States= In the United States, Lenovo began the \\"For Those Who Do\\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi. The campaign was Lenovo's first to go global, except for its domestic market in China, where it retained its existing \\"Imagine\\" (Pinyin: lian xiang) slogan. The campaign did not reach China because \\"do\\" carries connotations of manual labor in the country, an image that Lenovo did not want attached to their brand. \\"For Those Who Do\\" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as \\"doers\\". One of Lenovo's operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States. Lenovo also started manufacturing products in the US in 2012. =Ashton Kutcher= In October 2013, Lenovo announced that it had hired Ashton Kutcher as a product engineer and spokesman. Kutcher announced Lenovo's Yoga Tablet at a media event the same month; he flew to China to meet with Lenovo executives shortly thereafter. David Roman, Lenovo's chief marketing officer, said, \\"His partnership goes beyond traditional bounds by deeply integrating him into our organization as a product engineer. Ashton will help us break new ground by challenging assumptions, bringing a new perspective and contributing his technical expertise to Yoga Tablet and other devices.\\" Kutcher co-founded A-Grade Investments, an investor in Airbnb, Foursquare, Spotify, Path, Uber, and other technology firms. Kutcher studied biochemical engineering at the University of Iowa.Ashton Kutcher joins Lenovo as product engineer. Usatoday.com (2013-10-30). Retrieved on 2013-12-08. =Kobe Bryant= Bryant appeared in advertisements in China and other Asian countries. Lenovo's intended goal was to make their company seem like an American company, as they believe citizens of Asian countries trust American brands rather than domestic brands =Olympics= The 2008 Summer Olympics Torch, which was designed by Lenovo Lenovo was an official computer sponsor of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. When asked about Lenovo's brand Yang Yuanqing said, \\"The Beijing Olympics were very good for brand awareness in countries like the US and Argentina, but not good enough.\\" =YouTube Space Lab= YouTube Space Lab logo In December 2011, Lenovo announced the YouTube Space Lab contest. It was held in conjunction with YouTube, NASA, the European Space Agency, and JAXA. The contest allowed students between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to devise experiments to be performed by astronauts on the International Space Station. The global winners had their experiment results live-streamed from space, and received a trip to either Japan or Russia. =NFL= In July 2012, Lenovo and the National Football League (NFL) announced that Lenovo had become the NFL's \\"Official Laptop, Desktop and Workstation Sponsor.\\" Lenovo said that this was its largest sponsorship deal ever in the United States. Lenovo will receive advertising space in NFL venues and events and be allowed to use the NFL logo on its products and ads. Lenovo said that this sponsorship would boost its efforts to market to the key 18- to 35-year-old male demographic. The NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007 and the sponsorship resulted from that relationship. NFL stars Jerry Rice, DeAngelo Williams, and Torry Holt were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees. Lenovo's sponsorship will last at least three years. =The Pursuit= Lenovo used a short-film entitled The Pursuit in its \\"For Those Who Do\\" campaign launched in 2011. The film depicted a mysterious young woman using the IdeaPad Yoga 13 to stay one-step-ahead of her evil pursuers. Martin Campbell, who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques. =Tech World= In May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever \\"Tech World\\" conference in Beijing. The CEOs of Intel, Microsoft, and Baidu delivered keynote addresses along with Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing. Lenovo also used Tech World to announce a refresh of its corporate logo and visual identity. The shift in Lenovo's visual presentation was accompanied by changes in Lenovo's business model. Lenovo said that it was transitioning from being solely a hardware maker to producing both hardware and software. Lenovo announced several concept and production devices at Tech World including Smart View, a concept smartwatch with two screens and a virtual display; Smart Cast, a concept smartphone with a built- in laser projector that displays content and virtual user interfaces such as keyboards and musical instruments; Lenovo Cast, an Android-based streaming video device; Smart Shoes, concept shoes with a screen to display the user's mood and fitness tracking sensors; the ThinkPad 10, a new tablet computer; and Cortana integration with Lenovo devices and software, including REACHit, which extends Cortana's search functions to non-Microsoft services. ZUK, a separate company formed by Lenovo in 2014, announced several products at Tech World, These included slim power banks, 3D printers that can print food such as chocolate, an outdoor sound box, and a Wi-Fi based control system for home automation. =Goodweird= Lenovo launched a multi-year advertising campaign called \\"Goodweird\\" in the last half of 2015. Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the Stealth Bomber. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent YouTubers and Viners. BuzzFeed has been engaged to create relevant content. = SentinelOne = In early 2020, Lenovo announced a partnership with endpoint security software company SentinelOne. SentinelOne's protection platform will be integrated with Lenovo's own ThinkShield to provide real time cloud protection in devices with SentinelOne protection. SentinelOne chose to partner with Lenovo due to their high percentage of usage in data centers and work places, where the SentinelOne CEO said it is \\"needed most.\\" =Lenovo slogans= * New World. New Thinking. (2005–2011) * For Those Who Do. (2011–2016) * We Make The Tools. You Make Them Do. (2012–2016) * Different is Better (2016–2019) * Smarter technology for all (2019–present) Controversies =Superfish= In February 2015, Lenovo became the subject of controversy for having bundled software identified as malware on some of its laptops. The software, Superfish Visual Discovery, is a web browser add-on that injects price comparison advertising into search engine results pages. To intercept HTTPS-encrypted communications, the software also installed a self-signed digital certificate. When the Superfish private key was compromised, it was also discovered that the same private key was used across all installations of the software, leaving users vulnerable to security exploits utilizing the key. Lenovo made between US$200,000 to US$250,000 on its deal with Superfish. In 2017 Lenovo agreed to pay $3.5 million as part of a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission. The head of Superfish responded to security concerns by saying the vulnerability was \\"inadvertently\\" introduced by Komodia, which built the application. In response to the criticism, Lenovo detailed that it would cease further distribution and use of the Superfish software, and offered affected customers free six-month subscriptions to the McAfee LiveSafe software. Lenovo issued a promise to reduce the amount of \\"bloatware\\" it bundles with its Windows 10 devices, promising to only include Lenovo software, security software, drivers, and \\"certain applications customarily expected by users\\". Salon tech writer David Auerbach compared the Superfish incident to the Sony DRM rootkit scandal, and argued that \\"installing Superfish is one of the most irresponsible mistakes an established tech company has ever made.\\" =Lenovo Service Engine= From October 2014 through June 2015, the UEFI firmware on certain Lenovo models had contained software known as \\"Lenovo Service Engine\\", which Lenovo says automatically sent non-identifiable system information to Lenovo the first time Windows is connected to the internet, and on laptops, automatically installs the Lenovo OneKey Optimizer program (software considered to be bloatware) as well. This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in Windows 8, Windows Platform Binary Table, which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \\"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a 'clean' configuration\\"; specifically, anti-theft security software. The software was discontinued after it was found that aspects of the software had security vulnerabilities, and did not comply with revised guidelines for appropriate usage of WPBT. On 31 July 2015, Lenovo released instructions and UEFI firmware updates meant to remove Lenovo Service Engine. =Lenovo Customer Feedback program= At a third time in 2015, criticism arose that Lenovo might have installed software that looked suspicious on their commercial Think-PC lines. This was discovered by Computerworld writer Michael Horowitz, who had purchased several Think systems with the Customer Feedback program installed, which seemed to log usage data and metrics. Further analysis by Horowitz revealed however that this was mostly harmless, as it was only logging the usage of some pre-installed Lenovo programs, and not the usage in general, and only if the user allowed the data to be collected. Horowitz also criticized other media for quoting his original article and saying that Lenovo preinstalled spyware, as he himself never used that term in this case and he also said that he does not consider the software he found to be spyware. = Lenovo Accelerator = As of June 2016, a Duo Labs report stated that Lenovo was still installing bloatware, some of which leads to security vulnerabilities as soon as the user turns on their new PC. Lenovo advised users to remove the offending app, \\"Lenovo Accelerator\\". According to Lenovo, the app, designed to \\"speed up the loading\\" of Lenovo applications, created a man-in-the-middle security vulnerability. = Foldable Moto Razr video plagiarism = In 2019 Lenovo was caught passing off enthusiast Waqar Khan's Foldable Moto Razr concept video as its own concept video in a presentation to the technology press. Khan asserted that he had never given Lenovo permission to use his video. While most of the watermarks had been removed the watermark \\"Concept by @WaqarKahnHD\\" was still visible in some segments of the video. It appears that Lenovo did not add any content to the video other than their logo. Multiple members of Chinese media who were present have confirmed the story. = Supplier controversy = In August 2020, The Intercept reported that Lenovo imported about 258,000 laptops from the Chinese manufacturer Hefei Bitland Information Technology, a company, among others, accused by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute of using Uyghur forced labor. In July 2020, the United States Commerce Department added 11 companies, including Hefei Bitland, implicated in human rights abuses on the Entity List. Lenovo took some shipments out of the distribution, but other shipments were distributed to consumers.

The band features Freddy Cricien and Hoya Roc (Madball); Toby Morse (H2O), David Kennedy (Box Car Racer, Over My Dead Body, later Angels & Airwaves), and Mackie (The Cro-Mags & Bad Brains). Chad Gilbert (Shai Hulud and later New Found Glory) co-wrote and helped record every song on the album, but he was soon dismissed from Hazen Street by New Found Glory's record label due to a contract dispute. He was replaced by Brian \\"Mitts\\" Daniels of Madball.  History  In April and May 2004, the group supported Story of the Year on their headlining US tour. Hazen Street released their self-titled debut album, Hazen Street on Joel and Benji Madden's DC Flag Records. On August 31, 2005, the band posted an update on their website, reporting that they would begin to work on a new record at the end of 2005, label to be announced. However, there has been no website updates since then, and nothing has been heard regarding this new album, presumably due to Kennedy's full-time involvement with Angels & Airwaves. In November 2006, it was announced that their song \\"Are You Ready?\\" would be the official theme song for WWE Survivor Series 2006, the twentieth annual Survival Series pay-per-view.

A circular orbit is the orbit with a fixed distance around the barycenter, that is, in the shape of a circle. Listed below is a circular orbit in astrodynamics or celestial mechanics under standard assumptions. Here the centripetal force is the gravitational force, and the axis mentioned above is the line through the center of the central mass perpendicular to the plane of motion. In this case, not only the distance, but also the speed, angular speed, potential and kinetic energy are constant. There is no periapsis or apoapsis. This orbit has no radial version. Circular acceleration Transverse acceleration (perpendicular to velocity) causes change in direction. If it is constant in magnitude and changing in direction with the velocity, circular motion ensues. Taking two derivatives of the particle's coordinates with respect to time gives the centripetal acceleration : a\\\\, = \\\\frac {v^2} {r} \\\\, = {\\\\omega^2} {r} where: *v\\\\, is orbital velocity of orbiting body, *r\\\\, is radius of the circle * \\\\omega \\\\ is angular speed, measured in radians per unit time. The formula is dimensionless, describing a ratio true for all units of measure applied uniformly across the formula. If the numerical value of \\\\mathbf{a} is measured in meters per second per second, then the numerical values for v\\\\, will be in meters per second, r\\\\, in meters, and \\\\omega \\\\ in radians per second. Velocity The speed (or the magnitude of velocity) relative to the central object is constant: : v = \\\\sqrt{ GM\\\\\\\\! \\\\over{r}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu\\\\over{r}} where: * G, is the gravitational constant * M, is the mass of both orbiting bodies (M_1+M_2), although in common practice, if the greater mass is significantly larger, the lesser mass is often neglected, with minimal change in the result. * \\\\mu = GM , is the standard gravitational parameter. Equation of motion The orbit equation in polar coordinates, which in general gives r in terms of θ, reduces to: :r={{h^2}\\\\over{\\\\mu}} where: *h=rv is specific angular momentum of the orbiting body. This is because \\\\mu=rv^2 Angular speed and orbital period :\\\\omega^2 r^3=\\\\mu Hence the orbital period (T\\\\,\\\\\\\\!) can be computed as: :T=2\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{r^3\\\\over{\\\\mu}} Compare two proportional quantities, the free-fall time (time to fall to a point mass from rest) :T_{ff}=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\sqrt{r^3\\\\over{\\\\mu}} (17.7% of the orbital period in a circular orbit) and the time to fall to a point mass in a radial parabolic orbit :T_{par}=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\\\sqrt{r^3\\\\over{\\\\mu}} (7.5% of the orbital period in a circular orbit) The fact that the formulas only differ by a constant factor is a priori clear from dimensional analysis. Energy The specific orbital energy (\\\\epsilon\\\\,) is negative, and :\\\\epsilon=-{v^2\\\\over{2}} :\\\\epsilon=-{\\\\mu\\\\over{2r}} Thus the virial theorem applies even without taking a time-average: *the kinetic energy of the system is equal to the absolute value of the total energy *the potential energy of the system is equal to twice the total energy The escape velocity from any distance is times the speed in a circular orbit at that distance: the kinetic energy is twice as much, hence the total energy is zero. Delta-v to reach a circular orbit Maneuvering into a large circular orbit, e.g. a geostationary orbit, requires a larger delta-v than an escape orbit, although the latter implies getting arbitrarily far away and having more energy than needed for the orbital speed of the circular orbit. It is also a matter of maneuvering into the orbit. See also Hohmann transfer orbit.  Orbital velocity in general relativity  In Schwarzschild metric, the orbital velocity for a circular orbit with radius r is given by the following formula: :v = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{GM}{r-r_S}} where \\\\scriptstyle r_S = \\\\frac{2GM}{c^2} is the Schwarzschild radius of the central body. = Derivation = For the sake of convenience, the derivation will be written in units in which \\\\scriptstyle c=G=1. The four-velocity of a body on a circular orbit is given by: :u^\\\\mu = (\\\\dot{t}, 0, 0, \\\\dot{\\\\phi}) (\\\\scriptstyle r is constant on a circular orbit, and the coordinates can be chosen so that \\\\scriptstyle \\\\theta=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}). The dot above a variable denotes derivation with respect to proper time \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tau. For a massive particle, the components of the four-velocity satisfy the following equation: :\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2M}{r}\\\\right) \\\\dot{t}^2 - r^2 \\\\dot{\\\\phi}^2 = 1 We use the geodesic equation: :\\\\ddot{x}^\\\\mu + \\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{ u\\\\sigma}\\\\dot{x}^ u\\\\dot{x}^\\\\sigma = 0 The only nontrivial equation is the one for \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mu = r. It gives: :\\\\frac{M}{r^2}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2M}{r}\\\\right)\\\\dot{t}^2 - r\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2M}{r}\\\\right)\\\\dot{\\\\phi}^2 = 0 From this, we get: :\\\\dot{\\\\phi}^2 = \\\\frac{M}{r^3}\\\\dot{t}^2 Substituting this into the equation for a massive particle gives: :\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2M}{r}\\\\right) \\\\dot{t}^2 - \\\\frac{M}{r} \\\\dot{t}^2 = 1 Hence: :\\\\dot{t}^2 = \\\\frac{r}{r-3M} Assume we have an observer at radius \\\\scriptstyle r, who is not moving with respect to the central body, that is, their four-velocity is proportional to the vector \\\\scriptstyle \\\\partial_t. The normalization condition implies that it is equal to: :v^\\\\mu = \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r}{r-2M}},0,0,0\\\\right) The dot product of the four- velocities of the observer and the orbiting body equals the gamma factor for the orbiting body relative to the observer, hence: :\\\\gamma = g_{\\\\mu u}u^\\\\mu v^ u = \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2M}{r}\\\\right) \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r}{r-3M}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r}{r-2M}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r-2M}{r-3M}} This gives the velocity: :v = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{M}{r-2M}} Or, in SI units: :v = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{GM}{r-r_S}} See also *Elliptic orbit *List of orbits *Two-body problem References Orbits ","title":"Circular orbit"},{"id":"997211","text":"Victor Brauner (, also spelled Viktor Brauner; 15 June 1903 – 12 March 1966) was a Romanian sculptor and painter of surrealistic images. Early life He was born in Piatra Neamț, Romania, the son of a Jewish timber manufacturer who subsequently settled in Vienna with his family for a few years. It is there that young Victor attended elementary school. When his family returned to Romania in 1914, he continued his studies at the Lutheran school in Brăila. His interests revolved around zoology during that period. He attended the National School of Fine Arts in Bucharest (1916–1918) and Horia IgiroşanuIMDb: Horia Igiroşanu private school of painting. He visited Fălticeni and Balcic, and started painting landscapes in the manner of Paul Cézanne. Then, as he testified himself, he went through all the stages: \\"Dadaist, Abstractionist, Expressionist\\". On 26 September 1924, the Mozart Galleries in Bucharest hosted his first personal exhibition. In that period he met poet Ilarie Voronca, together with whom he founded the 75HP magazine. It was in this magazine that Brauner published the manifesto The Pictopoetry and the article The Surrationalism. He painted and exhibited Christ at the Cabaret (in the manner of George Grosz) and The Girl in the Factory (in the manner of Hodler). He participated to the Contimporanul exhibition in November 1924. Cimetière de Montmartre, Paris In 1925, he undertook his first journey to Paris, from where he returned in 1927. In the period 1928–1931 he was a contributor of the unu magazine (an avant-garde periodical with Dadaist and Surrealist tendencies), which published reproductions of most of his paintings and graphic works: \\"clear drawings and portraits made by Victor Brauner to his friends, poets and writers\\" (Jaques Lessaigne – Painters I Knew). In 1930, he settled in Paris, where he met Constantin Brâncuși, who instructed him in methods of art photography. In that same period he became a friend of the Romanian poet Benjamin Fondane and met Yves Tanguy, who would later introduce him to the circle of the Surrealists. He lived on Moulin Vert Street, in the same building as Alberto Giacometti and Tanguy. He painted Self-portrait with enucleated eye, a premonitory theme. In 1934 André Breton wrote an introduction to the catalogue for Brauner’s first Parisian solo exhibition at the Pierre Gallery. The theme of the eye was omnipresent: Mr. K's power of concentration and The strange case of Mr. K are paintings that Breton compared with Alfred Jarry’s play Ubu Roi, \\"a huge, caricature-like satire of the bourgeoisie\\". In 1935, Brauner returned to Bucharest. He joined the ranks of the Romanian Communist Party for a short while, without a very firm conviction. On 7 April 1935, he opened a new personal exhibition at the Mozart Galleries. Saşa Pană wrote about it in his autobiographical novel Born in 02: > The catalogue shows 16 paintings; they are accompanied by verse, surrealist > images that are exquisite by their bizarreness – they are perhaps the > creations of automatic dictation and they certainly bear no connection to > the painting itself. They are written in French, but their colorful taste is > kept in their Romanian language translation. The exhibition brought about > many interesting articles and takings of position regarding Surrealism in > arts and literature. Another remark about Brauner’s participation to Surrealist exhibitions: \\"Despite its appearance of abstract formula … this trend is a point of transition to the art that is to come\\" (Dolfi Trost, in Rampa of 14 April 1935). In Cuvântul liber of 20 April 1935, Miron Radu Paraschivescu wrote in the article Victor Brauner’s exhibition: \\"In contrast to what one may see, for instance, in the neighboring exhibition halls, Victor Brauner’s painting means integration, an attitude that is a social one, as far as art allows it. For V. Brauner takes attitude through the very character and ideology of his art\\". On 27 April, he created the illustrations for Gellu Naum’s poetry collections – The Incendiary Traveler and The Freedom to Sleep on the Forehead. Exiles In 1938, he returned to France. On 28 August, he lost his left eye in a violent argument between Oscar Domínguez and Esteban Francés. Brauner attempted to protect Esteban and was hit by a glass thrown by Domínguez: the premonition became true. That same year, he met Jaqueline Abraham, who was to become his wife. He created a series of paintings called lycanthropic or sometimes chimeras. He left Paris during Nazi Germany's invasion of France in 1940, together with Pierre Mabille. He lived for a while in Perpignan, at Robert Rius', then at Cant-Blage, in the Eastern Pyrenees and at Saint Feliu d'Amont, where he was forcibly secluded. However, he kept in touch with the Surrealists who had taken refuge in Marseille. In 1941, he was granted the permission to settle in Marseille. Seriously ill, he was hospitalized at the \\"Paradis\\" clinic. He painted Prelude to a civilization in 1954, now in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The painting is in encaustic on Masonite.\\"Prelude to a civilization\\", encaustic on Masonite, 1954 . renownedart.com After the war, he took part in the Venice Biennale, and traveled to Italy. In 1959, he settled in a studio at 72, rue Lepic, in Montmartre. In 1961, he traveled to Italy again. In the same year, New York City's Bodley Gallery mounted a solo exhibition of Brauner's work. He settled in Varengeville in Normandy, where he spent most of his time working. In 1965, he created an ensemble of object-paintings, grouped under the titles Mythologie and Fêtes des mères. These paintings were made in Varengeville and in Athanor in 1964, where Brauner retreated. His last painting, La fin et le debut (made in 1965), reminds us that \\"when the painter's life ends, his work starts living\\". In 1966, he was chosen to represent France at the Venice Biennale, where an entire hall was dedicated to him. He died in Paris as a result of a prolonged illness. The epitaph on his tomb from the Montmartre cemetery is a phrase from his notebooks: \\"Peindre, c'est la vie, la vraie vie, ma vie\\" (\\"Painting is life, the real life, my life\\"). The painter’s notebooks with private notes, which he handed to Max Pol Fouchet, partly enclose the \\"key\\" of his creation: \\"Each painting that I make is projected from the deepest sources of my anxiety...\\" Victor Brauner's brother, Harry Brauner, was a folklorist who later married Lena Constante.

The two cities are connected by the 25 de Abril Bridge. The population in 2011 was 174,030,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 70.21 km². The urbanized center had a population of 101,500 in 2001.City parishes: Almada, Cova da Piedade, Pragal e Cacilhas and Laranjeiro e Feijó. UMA POPULAÇÃO QUE SE URBANIZA, Uma avaliação recente - Cidades, 2004 Nuno Pires Soares, Instituto Geográfico Português (Geographic Institute of Portugal) History Human presence in the area of Almada dates to the end of the Neolithic period about 5000 years ago; archeological excavations performed in the municipality suggest that non-sedentary nomadic tribes may have occupied this location sporadically. The gradual development of settlement here made its greatest advance with the coming of Islamic civilization, when Muslims constructed a fort at Almada to defend and monitor the entrance to the Tagus River. Lying across the river from Lisbon, the area of Almada was a crossroads for a succession of various peoples who traded along the Tagus, including Phoenicians, Romans and Moors. As one of the principal Arab military bases along the southern margin of the Tagus, Almada was conquered by the Christian forces of Afonso I with the aid of English Crusaders in 1147. Alongside these Christians there lived many free Moors and Jews, under the royal protection guaranteed them by Afonso I in the charter of 1170 (which applied to all the former Moorish strongholds at Lisbon, Almada, Palmela and Alcácer). Almada received a foral from King Sancho I in 1190, although it came at a price: Miramolim Jacub-Abu-Jassuf, son of the Moorish leader who had laid siege to Santarém in 1171, was angered by the Christian victories and gathered a large army. He boldly attacked in the north, conquering Alcácer do Sal and Silves, while forcing the residents of Almada, Palmela and other towns along the Tagus into hiding.John Felix Pereira (2009), p.31 It would be some time after the death of Sancho before this region would be restored to Portuguese control. When this event occurred with the success of the Reconquista in driving the Muslims out, the Order of Santiago, a donatorio of Almada after 28 October 1186, had an important role in the territory (especially between the Tagus and Sado Rivers). In this role, it facilitated the repopulation of acquired territories and was the beneficiary of the various local economies. Geography Sanctuary of Christ the King. Although small in area, the city of Almada has a large population. It is bounded to the southeast by Seixal, to the south by Sesimbra, to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and northeast by the Tagus River. At Cacilhas, its main port, ferry boats transport visitors and local residents across to Lisbon daily, while the 25 de Abril Bridge, which spans the Tagus, is traversed by rail, commercial and personal vehicles daily. Almada is considered a transportation hub and a fast- growing suburb; its coast has several sandy beaches and panoramic vistas. Located in the district of Setúbal, the municipality includes two cities, Almada and Costa da Caparica, and is divided into five civil parishes: * Almada, Cova da Piedade, Pragal e Cacilhas * Caparica e Trafaria * Charneca de Caparica e Sobreda * Costa da Caparica * Laranjeiro e Feijó International relations Almada is twinned with: * Porto Amboim, Angola * Regla, Cuba * Sal, Cape Verde Transportation Almada, Lisbon The 25 de Abril Bridge links Lisbon and Almada, which are on opposite sides of the Tagus river.

It is aimed at intermediate- level game designers, and combines an Integrated development environment (IDE) for setting up most aspects of the game with a scripting language based on C (programming language) to process the game logic. History Adventure Game Studio was created by British programmer Chris Jones. AGS was originally released in 1997 as an MS-DOS program entitled \\"Adventure Creator\\". Jones was inspired by the apparent simplicity of Sierra On-Line's adventure game interface, specifically as showcased in Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers. The first version of Adventure Creator allowed users to create only low-resolution, keyboard-controlled games. Initially only small tests and demo games were created with AGS, and most of the more ambitious projects were cancelled. As a result of the lack of completed games and engine features, the user base was small, but the community grew slowly. Game developers started requesting more features so that they could create more complex games. Gradually, as these requests were implemented, AGS became a more capable toolkit and it was finally possible to create high-quality games with it. After a long period of slow activity, Lassi Quest was released as the first complete AGS game in late 1999. It was not until Ben Croshaw's Rob Blanc and Philip Reed's Larry Vales games had been released in 2000-2001 that the engine gained widespread popularity. There is now an active community containing thousands of members, and a large output of completed games of all sizes. AGS itself continues to be added to and improved upon, with the release of version 3.0 in January 2008 including a complete rewrite of the editor using the .NET Framework and an update to the game engine to support 3D hardware acceleration. On 26 October 2010, Chris Jones released the source code for the editor under the terms of the Artistic License, version 2.AGS Editor Source Code Release AGS Forums, October 26, 2010 On 27 April 2011, the runtime engine code was released under the same licence.Initial AGS Engine Source Code release AGS Forums, April 27, 2011 In 2015, a small group of community developers keep maintaining and improving the engine and IDE, and started to implement cross-platform capabilities as well as support for more modern screen resolutions (4:3, 16:9 and custom high resolutions).changes.txt ags on github.com (2015) Capabilities The editor and runtime engine were originally designed for Windows operating systems; though the runtime engine has been ported to Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS X and PSP since the release of the source code. Prior to AGS 2.7, a DOS engine was also available; this has since been discontinued. It is not yet possible to run the editor to create games on operating systems other than Windows without an emulator or API wrapper such as Wine. AGS can create games with a graphical range from 256 colours and a resolution of 320×200, to truecolor games with any higher resolution supported by the player's graphic adapter and an alpha channel. It also supports the following graphics filters: none, 2x nearest-neighbor, 3x nearest-neighbor, 4x nearest-neighbor, hq2x, hq3x. The application supports the following multimedia formats: mod, S3M, wav, xm, MIDI, ogg, mp3, avi - version 2.61.

While his music remains obscure, he was important as the teacher of several of the composers of the golden age of Portuguese polyphony, including Duarte Lobo and Manuel Cardoso. He was born in Lisbon, and studied music with Cosme Delgado in Évora as a youth. Later he was appointed mestre de capela at the cathedral in Portalegre, but returned to Évora to receive a bachelor's degree in 1575. In 1575 he became a priest and teacher of the choirboys in the cathedral. His students included some of the most famous Portuguese composers of the early 17th century, such as Duarte Lobo, Manuel Cardoso, Filipe de Magalhães and Manuel Rebelo. He died at Évora. While Mendes was evidently a prolific composer, his works are only extant in manuscript. He was famous in the 16th century, and his music traveled to Spain as well as Mexico, where he was highly regarded. References *Robert Stevenson, \\"Manuel Mendes\\".

From 1820 to 1860, he was in practice, if not in law, the British viceroy for the whole of Rupert's Land, an enormous chunk of northern North America. His efficient administration of the west was a precondition for the confederation of western and eastern Canada. He was noted for his grasp of administrative detail and his physical stamina in traveling through the wilderness. Excepting voyageurs and their Siberian equivalents, few men have spent as much time traveling in the wilderness. Simpson was the first known person to have \\"circumnavigated\\" the world by land.  Early life Born at Dingwall, Ross- Shire, Scotland, as the illegitimate son of George Simpson, Writer to the Signet, he was raised by two aunts and his paternal grandmother, Isobel Simpson (1731–1821), daughter of George Mackenzie, 2nd Laird of Gruinard—grandson of George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth—and Elizabeth, daughter of Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden. Simpson's father was a first cousin of Sir Alexander Mackenzie's father-in-law. In 1808, he was sent to London to work in the sugar brokerage business run by his uncle, Geddes Mackenzie Simpson (1775–1848). (For the commercial context, see Colonial molasses trade and Sugar plantations in the Caribbean). When his uncle's firm merged with that of Andrew Colvile-Wedderburn in 1812, Simpson came into contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, as Colvile was a company director and brother-in-law of Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk.  Career  This was at the time of conflict between the HBC and the North West Company. Governor William Williams, who had been sent out in 1818, had arrested or captured several North West Company men. The Nor'Westers replied with a Quebec warrant for Williams' arrest. The London governors were unhappy with Williams' clumsy management and both companies were under British pressure to settle their differences. The in Simpson's title meant that if Williams had been arrested, Simpson would take his place. He went by ship to New York, by boat and cart to Montreal and left by the usual route for York Factory on Hudson Bay. He met Williams at Rock Depot on the Hayes River. Since Williams had not been arrested he was William's subordinate and was sent west to Fort Wedderburn on Lake Athabaska. There he spent the winter learning about, and reorganizing, the fur trade. On his return journey in 1821, he learned that the two companies had merged. This put an end to a ruinous and sometimes violent competition and converted the HBC monopoly into an informal government for western Canada. He escorted that year's furs to Rock Depot and returned upriver to Norway House for the first meeting of the merged companies. There he learned that he had been made governor of the Northern—that is, western—Department and Williams had been made his equal in the Southern Department south of Hudson Bay. In December 1821, the HBC monopoly was extended to the Pacific coast. After the meeting he returned downstream to take up his duties at York Factory. In December 1821, he set out on snowshoes for Cumberland House and then the Red River Colony. By July 1822, he was back at York Factory for the second meeting of the Northern Council, the first that he chaired. After the meeting he went by water to Lac Île-à-la-Crosse and then by dog sled to Fort Chipewyan and Fort Resolution on the Great Slave Lake. He then went south to Fort Dunvegan on the Peace River and then Fort Edmonton and after the thaw, back to York Factory. In August 1824, he left York Factory for the Pacific, taking the unorthodox Nelson–Burntwood River route, and ascended the Churchill River and Athabasca Rivers to Jasper House at the east side of Athabasca Pass. He crossed the pass on horseback to Boat Encampment and then down the Columbia River, reaching its mouth at Fort George on 8 November. This 80-day journey was 20 days faster than the previous record. He moved the headquarters of the Columbia District to Fort Vancouver, guessing that the south side of the river might fall to the Americans. He left in March 1825, and crossed the snow-covered Athabasca Pass. From Fort Assiniboine he went on horseback south to Fort Edmonton on the North Saskatchewan River. He had ordered this new road laid out on his outward voyage. It was a major saving over the old Methye Portage route. He went on horseback from Fort Carlton to the Red River settlements, and then by boat to York Factory. During this trip his servant, Tom Taylor, became separated on a hunting trip. After searching for half a day, Simpson left Taylor to his fate. Taylor reached the Swan River post after 14 days in the wilderness with no proper equipment. In 1825, he returned to Britain and learned that William Williams had retired, thereby adding the eastern area to his domain. Returning to Montreal, he went to the Red River settlements, Rock Depot for the annual meeting, the posts on James Bay to inspect his new domain, and back to Montreal. In May 1828, he started his second trip to the Pacific along with his dog, mistress and personal piper, going first to York Factory and then using the Peace River route. This trip remains the longest North American canoe journey ever made in one season.Raffan 2007, p. 243. He returned via Athabasca Pass to Moose Factory and Montreal and immediately went south to New York and took ship to Liverpool. After a brief courtship he married his first cousin, Frances Ramsay Simpson, in February 1830, and returned with his new wife to New York, Montreal, Michipicoten, Ontario, for the annual meeting, York Factory, and Red River. Here his wife gave birth to his first legitimate child, who soon died. In May 1833, he suffered a mild stroke. He and his wife returned to Scotland, where she remained for the next five years and gave birth to a baby girl. In the spring of 1834, he returned to Canada and attended the Southern Council at Moose Factory in May and the Northern Council at York Factory in June, inspected posts on the Saint Lawrence, and arrived back in England in October 1835\\\\. In the summer of 1838, he went to Saint Petersburg to negotiate with Ferdinand von Wrangel of the Russian-American Company. The Russians recognized the HBC posts and the HBC agreed to supply the Russian posts. He then went to Montreal, Red River, Moose Factory, the Saint Lawrence posts, and down the Hudson to New York, where he took ship to England. Simpson received the title of Knight Bachelor from Queen Victoria, giving him the non-hereditary title of Sir on 25 January 1841. = Circumnavigation = He left London in March 1841, and went by canoe to Fort Garry (now the site of Winnipeg). On this part of the trip he was accompanied by James Alexander, 3rd Earl of Caledon, who left to hunt on the prairie and later published a journal. Traveling on horseback to Fort Edmonton, Simpson caught up with James Sinclair's wagon train of over 100 settlers heading for the Oregon country – a sign of what would soon destroy his fur trade empire. Instead of taking the usual route, he went to what is now Banff, Alberta, made the first recorded passage of the pass named after him in August, and went down the Kootenay River to Fort Vancouver. Guessing that the 49th parallel border would be extended to the Pacific and considering the difficulties of the Columbia Bar, he proposed to move the HBC headquarters to what is now Victoria, British Columbia, a suggestion that earned him the enmity of John McLoughlin, who had done much to develop the Columbia district. Simpson took the north along the Pacific coast to the Russian post at Sitka, and then another boat as far south as Santa Barbara, stopping at the HBC post of Yerba Buena. At some point he met Mariano Vallejo, a Californio statesman and general. He sailed to the HBC post in Hawaii (then known as the Sandwich Islands) in February 1842, and back to Sitka, where he took a Russian ship to Okhotsk in June. He went on horseback to Yakutsk, up the Lena River by horse-drawn boat, visited Lake Baikal, went by horse and later carriage to Saint Petersburg and reached London by ship at the end of October. This trip was documented in his book, An overland journey round the world. = Hawaii = During his visit to Hawaii, Simpson, along with Timoteo Haalilio and William Richards were commissioned as joint Ministers Plenipotentiary on 8 April 1842. Simpson, shortly thereafter, left for England, via Alaska and Siberia, while Haalilio and Richards departed for the United States, via Mexico, on 8 July. The Hawaiian delegation, while in the United States, secured the assurance of President John Tyler of its recognition of Hawaiian independence on 19 December, and then proceeded to meet Simpson in Europe and secure formal recognition by Great Britain and France. On 17 March 1843, King Louis Philippe I of France recognized Hawaiian independence at the urging of King Leopold I of Belgium, and on 1 April, Lord Aberdeen on behalf of Queen Victoria, assured the Hawaiian delegation that: \\"Her Majesty's Government was willing and had determined to recognize the independence of the Sandwich Islands under their present sovereign.\\"  Later years  By this time Simpson and his wife had a large house on the Lachine Canal across from the depot from which the fur brigades started west. He began investing in railroads and canals. In the spring of 1845, he went to Washington, D.C., to discuss the Oregon boundary with the Americans, something he had already done with Sir Robert Peel. In 1846, the Oregon Treaty established the current border. His wife contracted tuberculosis in 1846, and died in 1853. In 1854, he was able to travel by rail to Chicago before boarding his voyageur canoe at Sault Ste. Marie. In 1855, he was in Washington DC discussing Oregon affairs and in 1857, defended the HBC monopoly in London. In May 1860, he went by rail to Saint Paul, Minnesota, decided that his health would not bear the trip to Red River, and returned to Lachine. In August 1860, he entertained the Prince of Wales at Lachine. Shortly after he suffered a massive stroke and died six days later in Lachine.  Children  Simpson sired at least eleven children by at least seven women, only one of whom was his wife.Raffan 2007, p. 432. While in London he produced two daughters by two unknown women. When he left for Canada they were sent to Scotland to be cared for by his relatives. The eldest, Mary Louisa Simpson, was given a £500 dowry on her marriage and moved to Canada. She has at least 111 descendants, including Shelagh Rogers. The other daughter died early. In 1817, he produced a daughter by half-Cree washerwoman Betsy Sinclair. Betsy Sinclair was soon passed to an accountant whom he promoted. The daughter married an English botanist and died in a canoe accident on her honeymoon. James Keith Simpson (1823–1901) is poorly documented. Ann Simpson, born in Montreal in 1828, is known only from her baptismal record. Simpson fathered two sons, George Stewart (1827) and John Mackenzie (1829), with Margaret (Marguerite) Taylor. Soon after the birth of John Mackenzie, Simpson left Margaret to marry his cousin. Simpson shocked his peers by neglecting to notify Margaret of his marriage or make any arrangements for the future of his two sons.Van Kirk, Sylvia.

One can show that it is a constant vector for a given orbit under ideal conditions. This essentially proves Kepler's second law. It's called specific angular momentum because it's not the actual angular momentum \\\\vec{L} , but the angular momentum per mass. Thus, the word \\"specific\\" in this term is short for \\"mass-specific\\" or divided-by-mass: : \\\\vec{h} = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{L}}{m} Thus the SI unit is: m2·s−1. m denotes the reduced mass \\\\frac{1}{m} = \\\\frac{1}{m_1}+\\\\frac{1}{m_2} .  Definition  The specific relative angular momentum is defined as the cross product of the relative position vector \\\\vec{r} and the relative velocity vector \\\\vec{v} . : \\\\vec{h} = \\\\vec{r}\\\\times \\\\vec{v} = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{L}}{m} The \\\\vec{h} vector is always perpendicular to the instantaneous osculating orbital plane, which coincides with the instantaneous perturbed orbit. It would not necessarily be perpendicular to an average plane which accounted for many years of perturbations. As usual in physics, the magnitude of the vector quantity \\\\vec{h} is denoted by h : : h = \\\\left \\\\\\\\vec{h} \\\\right \\\\ Proof that the specific relative angular momentum is constant under ideal conditions  = Prerequisites = The following is only valid under the simplifications also applied to Newton's law of universal gravitation. One looks at two point masses m_1 and m_2 , at the distance r from one another and with the gravitational force \\\\vec{F} = G\\\\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}}{r} acting between them. This force acts instantly, over any distance and is the only force present. The coordinate system is inertial. The further simplification m_1 \\\\gg m_2 is assumed in the following. Thus m_1 is the central body in the origin of the coordinate system and m_2 is the satellite orbiting around it. Now the reduced mass is also equal to m_2 and the equation of the two- body problem is : \\\\ddot{\\\\vec{r}} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}}{r} with the standard gravitational parameter \\\\mu = Gm_1 and the distance vector \\\\vec{r} (absolute value r ) that points from the origin (central body) to the satellite, because of its negligible mass.The derivation of the specific angular momentum works also if one does not make this assumption. Then the gravitational parameter is \\\\mu = G\\\\left(m_1 + m_2\\\\right) . It is important not to confound the gravitational parameter \\\\mu with the reduced mass, which is sometimes also denoted by the same letter \\\\mu . = Proof = Distance vector \\\\vec{r} , velocity vector \\\\vec{v} , true anomaly \\\\theta and flight path angle \\\\phi of m_2 in orbit around m_1 . The most important measures of the ellipse are also depicted (among which, note that the true anomaly \\\\theta is labeled as u). One obtains the specific relative angular momentum by multiplying (cross product) the equation of the two-body problem with the distance vector \\\\vec{r} : \\\\vec{r} \\\\times \\\\ddot{\\\\vec{r}} = - \\\\vec{r} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}}{r} = - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^3} \\\\left( \\\\vec{r} \\\\times \\\\vec{r} \\\\right) The cross product of a vector with itself (right hand side) is 0. The left hand side simplifies to : \\\\vec{r} \\\\times \\\\ddot{\\\\vec{r}} = \\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}} \\\\times \\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}} + \\\\vec{r} \\\\times \\\\ddot{\\\\vec{r}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\left(\\\\vec{r}\\\\times\\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}}\\\\right) }{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = 0 according to the product rule of differentiation. This means that \\\\vec{r}\\\\times\\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}} is constant (i.e., a conserved quantity). And this is exactly the angular momentum per mass of the satellite: : \\\\vec{h} = \\\\vec{r}\\\\times\\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}} \\\\text{ is const.} This vector is perpendicular to the orbit plane, the orbit remains in this plane because the angular momentum is constant. One can obtain further insight into the two-body problem with the definitions of the flight path angle \\\\phi and the transversal and radial component of the velocity vector (see illustration on the right). The next three formulas are all equivalent possibilities to calculate the absolute value of the specific relative angular momentum vector * h = rv\\\\cos\\\\phi * h = r^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta} * h = \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu p} Where p is called the semi-latus rectum of the curve.  Kepler's laws of planetary motion  Kepler's laws of planetary motion can be proved almost directly with the above relationships. = First law = The proof starts again with the equation of the two-body problem. This time one multiplies it (cross product) with the specific relative angular momentum : \\\\ddot{\\\\vec{r}} \\\\times \\\\vec{h} = - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}}{r} \\\\times \\\\vec{h} The left hand side is equal to the derivative \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\left(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}}\\\\times\\\\vec{h}\\\\right) because the angular momentum is constant. After some steps the right hand side becomes: : -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^3}\\\\left(\\\\vec{r} \\\\times \\\\vec{h}\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^3} \\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\vec{r}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{v}\\\\right)\\\\vec{r} - r^2\\\\vec{v}\\\\right) = -\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^2}\\\\dot{r}\\\\vec{r} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r}\\\\vec{v}\\\\right) = \\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}}{r}\\\\right) Setting these two expression equal and integrating over time leads to (with the constant of integration \\\\vec{C} ) : \\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}}\\\\times\\\\vec{h} = \\\\mu\\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}}{r} + \\\\vec{C} Now this equation is multiplied (dot product) with \\\\vec{r} and rearranged :\\\\begin{align} \\\\vec{r} \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}}\\\\times\\\\vec{h}\\\\right) &= \\\\vec{r} \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\mu\\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}}{r} + \\\\vec{C}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow{} \\\\left(\\\\vec{r}\\\\times\\\\dot{\\\\vec{r}}\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\vec{h} &= \\\\mu r + rC\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow{} h^2 &= \\\\mu r + rC\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\end{align} Finally one gets the orbit equation : r = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{h^2}{\\\\mu}}{1 + \\\\frac{C}{\\\\mu}\\\\cos\\\\theta} which is the equation of a conic section in polar coordinates with semi-latus rectum p = \\\\frac{h^2}{\\\\mu} and eccentricity e = \\\\frac{C}{\\\\mu} . This proves Kepler's first law, in words: = Second law = The second law follows instantly from the second of the three equations to calculate the absolute value of the specific relative angular momentum. If one connects this form of the equation \\\\mathrm{d}t = \\\\frac{r^2}{h} \\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta with the relationship \\\\mathrm{d}A = \\\\frac{r^2}{2} \\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta for the area of a sector with an infinitesimal small angle \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta (triangle with one very small side), the equation : \\\\mathrm{d}t = \\\\frac{2}{h}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}A comes out, that is the mathematical formulation of the words: = Third law = Kepler's third is a direct consequence of the second law. Integrating over one revolution gives the orbital period : T = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi ab}{h} for the area \\\\pi ab of an ellipse. Replacing the semi-minor axis with b=\\\\sqrt{ap} and the specific relative angular momentum with h = \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu p} one gets : T = 2\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{a^3}{\\\\mu}} There is thus a relationship between the semi- major axis and the orbital period of a satellite that can be reduced to a constant of the central body. This is the same as the famous formulation of the law:  See also  * Specific orbital energy, another conserved quantity in the two-body problem.

Noir fiction (or roman noir) is a subgenre of crime fiction. In this subgenre, right and wrong are not clearly defined, while the protagonists are seriously and often tragically flawed.  Definition  In its modern form, noir has come to denote a marked darkness in theme and subject matter, generally featuring a disturbing mixture of sex and violence. While related to and frequently confused with hardboiled detective fiction—due to the regular adaptation of hardboiled detective stories in the film noir style—the two are not the same. Both regularly take place against a backdrop of systemic and institutional corruption. However, noir fiction (French for \\"black\\") is centred on protagonists that are either victims, suspects, or perpetrators—often self-destructive. A typical protagonist of noir fiction is forced to deal with a corrupt legal, political or other system, through which the protagonist is either victimized and/or has to victimize others, leading to a lose-lose situation. Otto Penzler argues that the traditional hardboiled detective story and noir story are \\"diametrically opposed, with mutually exclusive philosophical premises\\". While the classic hardboiled private detective—as exemplified by the creations of writers such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane—may bend or break the law, this is done by a protagonist with meaningful agency in pursuit of justice, and \\"although not every one of their cases may have a happy conclusion, the hero nonethless will emerge with a clean ethical slate.\\" Noir works, on the other hand, > whether films, novels, or short stories, are existential pessimistic tales > about people, including (or especially) protagonists who are seriously > flawed and morally questionable. The tone is generally bleak and nihilistic, > with characters whose greed, lust, jealousy, and alienation lead them into a > downward spiral as their plans and schemes inevitably go awry. ... The > machinations of their relentless lust will cause them to lie, steal, cheat, > and even kill as they become more and more entangled in a web from which > they cannot possibly extricate themselves. Author and academic Megan Abbot described the two thusly: > Hardboiled is distinct from noir, though they’re often used interchangeably. > The common argument is that hardboiled novels are an extension of the wild > west and pioneer narratives of the 19th century. The wilderness becomes the > city, and the hero is usually a somewhat fallen character, a detective or a > cop. At the end, everything is a mess, people have died, but the hero has > done the right thing or close to it, and order has, to a certain extent, > been restored. > > Noir is different. In noir, everyone is fallen, and right and wrong are not > clearly defined and maybe not even attainable. Andrew Pepper, in an essay published in The Cambridge Companion to American Crime Fiction, listed the major thematic commonalities of noir fiction as “the corrosive effects of money, the meaninglessness and absurdity of existence, anxieties about masculinity and the bureaucratization of public life, a fascination with the grotesque and a flirtation with, and rejection of, Freudian psychoanalysis.” Eddie Duggan discusses the distinction between hardboiled and noir fiction, claiming that \\"psychological instability is the key characteristic of the protagonists of noir writing, if not the key characteristic of the noir writers themselves\\".Eddie Duggan (1999) \\"Writing in the Darkness: The World of Cornell Woolrich\\" Crime Time 2.6 pp. 113–126. Similarly, Johnny Temple, founder of Akashic Books, observed that noir fiction tends to be written by \\"authors whose life circumstances often place them in environments vulnerable to crime.\\"  Origins and later proponents  Beginning with 1940's The Bride Wore Black, author Cornell Woolrich wrote a series of six unrelated noir novels with \\"black\\" in the title, three of which were adapted for film in the 1940s. The word \\"noir\\" was used by the Paris- based publisher Gallimard in 1945 as the title for its Série Noire crime fiction imprint. In the English-speaking world, the term originated as a cinematic one—film noir. This term again first appeared in France, in 1946, though it did not enjoy wide use until the 1970s. Film noir refers to cinematic works based on novels of both the hardboiled and noir traditions, exhibiting realism and postwar disillusionment as influenced by German Expressionism. James M. Cain is regarded as an American pioneer of the hardboiled and noir genres. Other important early American writers in the noir genre include Cornell Woolrich, Jim Thompson, Horace McCoy, and David Goodis. In the 1950s, Fawcett Books' Gold Medal imprint was instrumental in releasing noir and crime novels from such writers as Elliott Chaze, Charles Williams, Gil Brewer, Harry Whittington, Peter Rabe, and Lionel White, as well as Goodis and Thompson. In the 1980s, American publisher Black Lizard would re-release many of these works. Today, publisher Akashic Books features an elaborate line of noir short-story anthologies. Prominent European authors of the genre include Jean-Claude Izzo and Massimo Carlotto. According to Italian publisher Sandro Ferri, \\"Mediterranean noir\\" is remarkable for its attention to the duality of Mediterranean life: > The prevailing vision in the novels belonging to the genre known as > Mediterranean noir is a pessimistic one. Authors and their literary > inventions look upon the cities of the Mediterranean and see places that > have been broken, battered, and distorted by crime. There is always a kind > of dualism that pervades these works. On one hand, there is the > Mediterranean lifestyle—fine wine and fine food, friendship, conviviality, > solidarity, blue skies and limpid seas—an art of living brought almost to > perfection. On the other hand, violence, corruption, greed, and abuses of > power. Of latter-day novelists who write in both the hardboiled and noir modes, the most prominent is James Ellroy. Calling noir \\"the most scrutinized offshoot of the hard-boiled school of fiction\\", he wrote: > The thrill of noir is the rush of moral forfeit and the abandonment to > titillation. The social importance of noir is its grounding in the big > themes of race, class, gender, and systemic corruption. The overarching and > lasting appeal of noir is that it makes doom fun.

Front row: Ike Eisenmann and Jared Martin The Fantastic Journey is an American science fiction television series that was originally aired on NBC from February 3 through June 16, 1977. It was originally intended to run 13 episodes, as a mid-season replacement, but NBC cancelled the series in April, after the ninth episode aired. A tenth episode, already produced, was burned off two months later.  Premise  The series concerns a family and their associates who charter a boat out into the Caribbean for a scientific expedition. After an encounter in the area of the Bermuda Triangle with an unnatural luminous green cloud accompanied by the eerie disembodied sound of ship's bells, the group find themselves shipwrecked on a mysterious uncharted island from which they are unable to escape. Christina Hart as Gwenith, with Jared Martin as Varian, in \\"An Act of Love\\" They encounter Varian (Jared Martin), initially disguised as an Arawak native, who is later revealed to be from the year 2230. A 23rd- century pacifist, musician and healer, Varian explains to the travelers that, like he and many before them, they have been caught in a space/time continuum where people from the past, present, future and from other worlds are trapped, co-existing on the island in a series of \\"Time Zones\\". The only way home can be found in a place called \\"Evoland\\", which lies \\"far to the rising sun\\". (It was indicated in interviews of the time that Evoland was also the name of the island.) The only way to travel between Time Zones is via invisible gateways that instantaneously transport individuals or groups from one zone to another. In one episode, \\"Beyond the Mountain\\", the group also encounters a second cloud, which has much the same effect, but which also splits up the group. After the initial pilot story, a steady group of travelers forms around Varian as de facto leader, and the series then follows this group as they travel across the many Time Zones of the island to find Evoland. On their way, they encounter people from different planets and times who are also trapped on the island and who have adapted to their plight in different ways. The pilot initially suggested the historical past would be explored; however, the producers of the show rapidly adopted a consistently futuristic tone during the series following pressure from the network. They also dropped three characters after the pilot, as they wanted a more exotic group of travelers, hence the arrival of Liana and Willoway. Liana disappears from the last two episodes when Katie Saylor fell ill. Cast * Varian (Jared Martin): \\"A man from the 23rd century possessing awesome powers\\", Varian generally uses a kind of crystalline \\"tuning fork\\" device called the Sonic Energizer through which he focuses his thoughts into what is described as a sonic manipulation of matter. The device is completely useless in anyone else's hands, and seems capable of a huge variety of tasks, from opening doors to disrupting electrical systems to large scale acts of destruction, as well as its apparently intended function as a diagnostic and healing device. Following the departure of Professor Paul Jordan at the end of the pilot film, Varian takes over as de facto leader to the travelers and adopts a parental role over Paul's teenage son, Scott (most notable in episodes such as \\"An Act of Love\\" and \\"Turnabout\\"). * Scott Jordan (Ike Eisenmann): \\"The 13-year-old son of a famous scientist\\", Scott has an excellent knowledge of Earth history and events, but is still young and has much to learn. * Dr. Fred Walters (Carl Franklin): \\"A young doctor just out of medical school\\" whose impulsive and rather hot-headed nature acts as a counterpoint to the calm, pacifistic Varian. A friend of Scott's father and the only other member of the group from the same time period, the athletic black physician takes the role of protective \\"older brother\\" with the young teen. * Liana (Katie Saylor): \\"Daughter of an Atlantean father and an extraterrestrial mother\\", the beautiful blonde Liana possessed greater than human physical strength (due to her mother being from a planet with a higher gravity than Earth) and powerful psychic abilities (presumably due to her mixed heritage) which allow her to, among other things, telepathically communicate with animals. Saylor left the show after the episode \\"Turnabout\\" due to illness. In the next episode \\"Riddles\\" the reason for her not being present with the group was given that she opted to stay a few days at Coriel to help the inhabitants work out their new government and would catch up with the group later. * Dr. Jonathan Willoway (Roddy McDowall): \\"Rebel scientist from the 1960s\\" who has a mastery of computers, robotics and scientific knowledge which is quite useful to the group. He is something of a never entirely trustworthy black sheep, basically a cooler version of Doctor Smith from Lost in Space without the congenital cowardice, who often tends to do things for his own mysterious reasons. Over the course of the episodes, however, the black-clad Willoway comes to care about Scott and his fellow travelers and becomes more integrated into the group, although Fred makes no secret about still not trusting him which leads to a bickering Spock/McCoy-style relationship between the two. * Sil-El (The Felix Teamhttp://www.cult.tv/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=210:fantastic- journey&catid;=37:series-formats&Itemid;=27): Liana's companion and pet, a \\"tuxedo cat\\" with which she can communicate telepathically and who sometimes scouts ahead for her, acting as an extra set of eyes and ears. Production D. C. Fontana recalled that once the show had been commissioned, she and the producers had a very short period of time to develop and produce the show before filming commenced. Additional scenes were filmed and inserted into the pilot which introduces the Atlanteans who are the focus of Episode 2, but this new material also quickly moves off-screen the characters Paul, Eve and Jill (who were originally intended to be regulars), as the network wanted a more diverse group of travelers. Also, a subplot involving the travelers finding a 1940s Air Force pilot held prisoner by 16th century pirates was removed from the first episode. The show benefited from a larger than normal amount of location filming, with familiar sites such as the Hollywood Hills, Zuma Beach, the Bonaventure Hotel in LA and Griffith Park Observatory all appearing in various episodes. The character Willoway was created specifically with Roddy McDowall in mind. Fortunately the actor was interested and took the role when approached. Although airing in a time when the nation's interest in the Bermuda Triangle, UFOs and fantasy was at a height, the show failed to last beyond the ten episodes, having been scheduled as a mid-season replacement (following the failure of another fantasy series, Gemini Man) against The Waltons and Welcome Back, Kotter, both very popular family shows. NBC ordered 12 episodes to follow the revised pilot, but production ended early when it was apparent that the ratings were low. The show was either pre-empted or its time-slot changed several times during its short run. By its tenth episode, its ratings had dropped, and it was cancelled. The script for an unproduced eleventh episode, \\"Romulus\\", was once available on the Internet. Within a few months of its abrupt ending, several of the production team would be producing the thematically similar Logan's Run for the Fall 1977 season.

Born and raised in the Atlantic coastal community of New Bedford, Massachusetts, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in October 1953. While in the Marines, he first became enamored of \\"imaginative literature\\" and began to compile A Checklist of the Ballet Scores of Cesare Pugni, eventually published in 1961 as Vol. VIII of Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo. Following his honorable discharge at the rank of sergeant in August 1956, he moved to California, where he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles; during this period, he engaged in the concomitant study of classical ballet, working under David Lichine and Tatiana Riaboushinska for a year. In 1958 and 1959, he visited Smith's home in Monterey, California; during these two excursions, Smith introduced him to the oeuvre of George Sterling. After graduating from UCLA in January 1961 with a B.A. in French and the death of Smith in August of that year, Sidney-Freyer commenced work on the poetry that would eventually comprise Songs and Sonnets Atlantean (1971) and The Emperor of Dreams (1976), a bibliography of Smith completed in 1965. From 1965 to 1971, he edited three volumes of Smith's work for Arkham House, a task he would reprise for Pocket Books a decade later. In 1969, he married Gloria Kathleen Braly, and started giving dramatic readings shortly thereafter at universities and other institutions, almost always incorporating material by Smith and Spenser. His poetry has continued to appear in a variety of weird fiction and speculative poetry-oriented journals. Sidney-Fryer's verse is marked by a strong imagination, and a Francophilic focus. He is a strong believer in \\"pure poetry,\\" and practices formalist verse, having developing his own specific poetic form: the Spenserian stanza-sonnet. He remains a prolific historian of 19th century ballet, and is an expert on the ballet theatre of the romantic era.

Phylogenetically, parvocellular neurons are more modern than magnocellular ones. Function Schematic diagram of the primate LGN. The parvocellular neurons of the visual system receive their input from midget cells, a type of retinal ganglion cell, whose axons are exiting the optic tract. These synapses occur in one of the four dorsal parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. The information from each eye is kept separate at this point, and continues to be segregated until processing in the visual cortex. The electrically-encoded visual information leaves the parvocellular cells via relay cells in the optic radiations, traveling to the primary visual cortex layer 4C-β. The parvocellular neurons are sensitive to colour, and are more capable of discriminating fine details than their magnocellular counterparts. Parvocellular cells have greater spatial resolution, but lower temporal resolution, than the magnocellular cells.

The cells are part of the visual system. They are termed \\"magnocellular\\" since they are characterized by their relatively large size compared to parvocellular cells. Structure Schematic diagram of the primate LGN. The full details of the flow of signaling from the eye to the visual cortex of the brain that result in the experience of vision are incompletely understood. Many aspects are subject to active controversy and the disruption of new evidence. In the visual system, signals mostly travel from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and then to the visual cortex. In humans the LGN is normally described as having six distinctive layers. The inner two layers, (1 and 2) are magnocellular cell (M cell) layers, while the outer four layers, (3,4,5 and 6), are parvocellular cell (P cell) layers. An additional set of neurons, known as the koniocellular cell (K cell) layers, are found ventral to each of the M cell and P cell layers. These layers were named this way because cells in the M layers of the LGN are larger than cells in the P layers.NB: \\"Parvus means \\"small\\" in Latin, per Latin Dictionary and \\"magnus\\" means large, per Latin Dictionary M cells in the LGN receive input from parasol ganglion cells (which some neuroscientists call M cells), and P cells receive input from midget retinal ganglion cells (which some neuroscientists call P cells). Visual representation of the parvocellular and magnocellular pathways From the LGN, the M pathway continues by sending information to the interblob regions of the 4Cα layer of the V1 region of the visual cortex, also called the \\"striate cortex\\". Other cells in the striate are more influenced from signaling from P cells and yet others from K cells. As signals are passed to other regions of the cortex, the signals start to be less separate, more integrated, and more influenced by signals from other parts of the brain. While classically it is said that signaling through the M pathway ultimately flow out of the visual cortex through the dorsal stream and signaling through the P pathway ultimately flows to the ventral stream, subsequent studies have shown that both pathways influence both streams. Human visual pathway Function The magnocellular pathway cannot provide finely detailed or colored information, but still provides useful static, depth, and motion information. The M pathway has high light/dark contrast detection, and is more sensitive at low spatial frequencies than high spatial frequencies. Due to this contrast information, M cells are essential for detecting changes in luminance, and performing visual search tasks and detecting edges. The M pathway is also important for providing information about the location of objects. M cells can detect the orientation and position of objects in space, information that is sent through the dorsal stream. This information is also useful for detecting the difference in positions of objects on the retina of each eye, an important tool in binocular depth perception. Cells in the M pathway have the ability to detect high temporal frequencies and can thus detect quick changes in the position of an object. This is the basis for detecting motion. The information sent to the Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS) of the posterior parietal cortex allows the M pathway to direct attention and guide saccadic eye movements to follow important moving objects in the visual field. In addition to following objects with the eyes, the IPS sends information to parts of the frontal lobe that allows the hands and arms to adjust their movements to correctly grasp objects based on their size, position, and location. This ability has led some neuroscientists to hypothesize that the purpose of the M pathway is not to detect spatial locations, but to guide actions related to the position and motion of objects. Some information has also been found to support the hypothesis that the M pathway is necessary for facial processing. Clinical significance Abnormal magnocellular pathways and magnocellular cells can be associated with various disorders and ocular impairments, including dyslexia, prosopagnosia and schizophrenia. = Dyslexia = Dyslexia is a disability which affects individual’s ability to read. It often first manifests in childhood, if at all; however, dyslexia can manifest itself in adulthood because of a brain tumor or lesion on/penetrating M cells. There is no clear idea of the role of M cells and the magnocellular pathway in dyslexia. One theory suggests that the nonlinearity, size, and compensation of miniature eye movements of M cells all help to focus on a single target and blur the surroundings, which is crucial in reading. This suggests that M cells are underdeveloped in many dyslexics. This may be due to genetics, autoimmunity, or nutrition. The KIAA0319 gene on chromosome six. controls cell migration to the LGN during development; and studies in transgenic mice and on brains of people with dyslexia examined after they died, show malformations in the LGN and cells expressing KIAA0319 growing in the wrong place. M cells are vulnerable to antineuronal antibodies which attack and render them unusable in the magnocellular pathway. This could be a cause of why dyslexics are more likely to have weakened immune systems. Another line of research suggests that defective eye movement caused by M cells is the cause of dyslexia. Since the magnocellular system is sensitive to image movement, and dyslexia is posited to be caused by abnormalities in M cells, dyslexics tend to focus on words longer, take shorter scans when reading, and stop more often per line. The study postulates that this is not caused by dyslexia but rather, low comprehension of the text causing abnormal eye movements in M cells. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude the importance of M cells in dyslexia from this study. = Schizophrenia = Schizophrenia is a mental disorder in which people are unable to differentiate what is real and what is not. It is believed that the magnocellular pathway may help with facial recognition and discrimination in children, but when this pathway is not developed completely or correctly, facial processing is more difficult for individuals later in life. This is seen in people with schizophrenia and occurs when there are issues in the integration of information from the M cell and P cell pathways, making it difficult for individuals with schizophrenia to differentiate between reality and hallucinations.

In Rinzai Zen, the term is reserved only for individuals who have received inka shōmei, meaning they have completed the entire kōan curriculum; this amounts to a total of less than 100 people at any given time. In Sōtō Zen and Sanbo Kyodan it is used more loosely. This is especially the case in the United States and Europe, where almost any teacher who has received dharma transmission might be called rōshi, or even use it to refer to themselves, a practice unheard of in Japan. Etymology The Japanese rōshi is a translation of the more antiquated Chinese Laozi (Wade-Giles; Lao Tzu) meaning 'Old Master' and connoting the archetype of a wise old man. The modern Chinese 老師/老师 (Chinese ) is a common word for teacher or professor without the religious or spiritual connotation of rōshi. Chinese Chán Buddhism (Zen is the Japanese transliteration of Chán) uses the semantically related title 師父/师父 or Mandarin shīfu (Cantonese \\"sifu), literally \\"master father\\" or \\"father of masters\\", or 師傅/师傅, literally \\"master teacher\\" or \\"teacher of masters\\"; both pronounced \\"shīfu\\" in Mandarin) as an honorific title for the highest masters, but it also may be used in respectful address of monks and nuns generally. Usage Traditionally, the term rōshi has been applied as a respectful honorific to a significantly older Zen teacher considered to have matured in wisdom and to have attained a superior understanding and expression of the Dharma (Japanese: mujōdō no taigen) . Typically, a rōshi will have received dharma transmission (Jap: inka shōmei) many years ago and although often the abbot or spiritual director of a monastery may in fact be too old to carry these responsibilities. Despite this historical reality, it has come in some modern Zen schools to be applied as a general title for a teacher regardless of the age of the individual who receives it. This is especially true in the United States and Europe where it appears that some confusion has arisen where the word rōshi has been conflated with the term oshō, which is the generic term for a Soto Buddhist teacher who has received shiho and completed her or his basic training. Historically, the term rōshi will only be applied to an oshō after they have given many years of service as a teacher. =Rinzai= In some Rinzai organizations, a monastic is sometimes called rōshi after they have received inka shōmei, meaning they have completed kōan study and received Dharma transmission from their master; According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of rōshi is equivalent to Zen master and shike: =Sōtō= In the Sōtō organization, a person is sometimes called rōshi after they have received the title of shike, but this is by no means standard practice: =Western Zen= Many Zen communities in the United States confer the honorific title of rōshi to their teachers as a regular title, in deference to perceived Japanese Zen tradition. In most western instances it is used synonymously with the term Zen master, which has a quite specific meaning in Japan, namely the select group of persons who are qualified to supervise the headtemples and monk training halls. In the west, Rinzai and Soto-uses of the term have been mixed: In the Sanbo Kyodan, a lay organization that combines Soto and Rinzai elements, a person is called rōshi when they have received inka, indicating they have passed the kōan curriculum and received Dharma transmission. Criticism The use of the term rōshi in the U.S. and Europe has at times led to confusion and controversy.Ogata, 37Seager, 107Katagiri, 184Gard, 193Muho Noelke, Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission Stuart Lachs has argued that Zen institutions in the West have often attributed a mythic status to the title rōshi with harmful consequences.Richard Baker and the Myth of the Zen Roshi by Stuart Lachs, 2002 See also * Dharma transmission * Oshō * Sensei * Zen master * Zen ranks and hierarchy References Web references Sources   * External links * Buddhadharma, Dharma Dictionary, Roshi Japanese Buddhist titles Zen Buddhist terminology ","title":"Rōshi"},{"id":"997339","text":"The Lincolnshire Wolds Railway (LWR) is a heritage railway based at Ludborough station, near Louth, Lincolnshire, England and the only standard gauge steam railway in Lincolnshire open to the public. The line is part of the original Great Northern Railway (GNR), a rail system that opened in 1848 and once linked Grimsby, Louth and East Lincolnshire with London. In early 2002, 2009 and 2013 the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway received a top national award from the Heritage Railway Association for its heritage railway efforts. History Construction of the railway began in 1846 and was completed in 1848. The line ran from Louth to New Holland and was officially opened on 28 March 1848 as the first section of the GNR. The line was constructed by the East Lincolnshire Railway Co (ELR), which leased it to the GNR when they could not raise sufficient funds to operate it. The GNR had obtained running rights over the MS&L; from Grimsby to New Holland Pier; in return it allowed the MS&L; running rights to Louth. The line south of Louth was extended as far as Boston in October 1848. The GNR ran the line with some of its famous C12 locomotives on the local services. From 1912-1913 Stirling single no.1 (preserved at the NRM York) was based at Louth shed (40c). In 1923 the GNR, and with it the East Lincolnshire Railway, was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The LNER carried out some improvements on the line, including the replacement of the GNR Somersault signals with the more common upper quadrant at some locations. Box name boards were also changed from the black background with white lettering to the usual (and later BR specifications) white background with black lettering, although Louth South obtained an enamel sign, which remained on the box until its closure on 5 October 1970. In 1948, Great Britain's railway assets were nationalised under the Transport Act 1947; it gave the assets to British Railways so that the railway would remain open. At that time, the line's passenger services were operated by steam railcar, but these were later replaced by diesel multiple units. BR ran the line from 1948 until its eventual closure. BR had announced as early as 1965 that the line would close under the Beeching plan. The first attempt at closure failed after major local opposition and the Minister of Transport's refusal to close a major route. But in 1969 the minister gave BR permission to close the line despite massive local opposition. The line from Firsby Junction to Grimsby was closed after the last passenger train departed on 5 October 1970. The line from Firsby Junction to Louth was quickly lifted, and the infrastructure left to deteriorate. The section from Louth to Grimsby was singled (the down line lifted), and was retained for an additional 10 years for grain traffic three times a week to the ABM building at Louth. In 1978 BR announced that grain traffic would cease, and that the line would be removed and abandoned. In 1978, a group known as the Grimsby-Louth Group was set up to fight the closure of the line. When the end became inevitable, the group was renamed the Grimsby-Louth Railway Preservation Society, with the aim of preserving the line for continued use. Despite their efforts, British Rail announced that the line would completely close on 20 December 1980. The Grimsby-Louth rail group did run several Santa specials over the line. The last one ran on 20 December 1980. BR closed the line and quickly removed the rails, sleepers and ballast, making it harder for preservationists to restore the line. Preservation In 1984 preservation efforts started rebuilding Ludborough Station to its former glory. The site had been virtually flattened by British Rail. All the buildings had been demolished, the railings and platform edges had been removed, as well as the track and ballast. The removal of the latter resulted in blocking the drains, with flooding of the site during rainstorms. On 28 September 1991, preservationists obtained a Light Railway Order to authorise the reinstatement of the East Lincolnshire Railway between Waltham and the former Keddington Road level crossing near Louth. On 30 August 2003, NER 0-4-0T LNER Class Y7 No. 68088 steamed on the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway. The section towards North Thoresby railway station was reopened in 2009, and on 26 August 2009, the first train between and ran for the first time in 47 years. Work has now begun on track re-laying at the south end of Ludborough station towards Utterby. Included in this work will be a new entrance to the engine shed coming in from the Louth direction. The new point work will be controlled by a 4-lever ground frame, which is released by Ludborough box and features in the new signalling system. The LWR launched an appeal in Summer 2012 to fund the purchase of track and ballast needed to extend the line. Operations Ludborough station has been restored to its original condition and is a working station museum, complete with an operational signal box. A 1 running line operates northwards to North Thoresby. Trains are operated by both steam and diesel locomotives. One of the line's diesel locomotives, no. D3167 (08102) has strong local connections. The 08 was the resident shunter at Lincoln Central for many years. Signalling on the LWR The signalling used on the LWR is very basic but still forms a vital part of the operations. There are two signal boxes in use: *Ludborough: built on the foundations of the original box, it is a close replica of what once stood there. Commissioned in 2004 by HMRI, the box was officially opened in 2005. It contains an 18 lever McKenzie and Holland lever frame which came from Hainton Street, Grimsby. It currently has four working levers, and a few more working levers are planned for the near future. Visitors are allowed in the box with the permission of the signalman. *North Thoresby: situated off the end of the platform. It has a seven lever Eastern Region ground frame, and all the levers are in use. Its primary function is to control the siding and the main line in the platform. Whilst North Thoresby has the conventional Upper quadrant signals, Ludborough has the more famous GNR somersault signals.  Future of the LWR  The initial goal of reopening the line from Louth to Grimsby is no longer feasible, as part of the section between Grimsby and New Waltham was designated by Humberside County Council for the construction of the A16 Peaks Parkway Road, which was completed in 1998. These roadworks have made any future extension of the LWR to impossible. However, the LWR aspires to reconstruct the entire surviving of track bed between a new site at Louth and Holton-le-Clay.

(stylized as KaBLaM!) is an American sketch comedy television series programming block that ran on Nickelodeon from 1996 to 2000. The series was created by Robert Mittenthal, Will McRobb, Chris Viscardi, Michael Pearlstein, Cote Zellers, and Albie Hecht. The show was developed as a fully animated showcase for alternative forms of animation that were more common in indie films and commercials. Each episode thus features a collection of short films in multiple innovative styles of animation, bridged by the characters Henry and June, who introduce the short animations and have adventures of their own in between. Although SNICK aired many Nicktoons not part of its block, KaBlam! was the only Nicktoon created for SNICK. The show became TV-Y in 1997 (when the American content ratings were put to use), until later that year when the rating was changed to TV-Y7. The show was a critical and commercial success.  Production  The segment creators include David Fain, Tim Hill, Steve Holman, Emily Hubley, Mark Marek, Mike Pearlstein, Mo Willems, and Cote Zellers. The theme song and all of the original background music on the show was provided by the Moon Ska Stompers, a band composed of King Django, Victor Rice, and members of The Toasters and The New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble. The bulk of the soundtrack was 30-second instrumental clips of songs from The Toasters' album D.L.T.B.G.Y.D., while the theme song itself is a shortened version of the Toasters song \\"2-Tone Army\\". Tracks from the Associated Production Music library were also utilized. KaBlam! was the first show to be spun off of All That. It was pitched to Nickelodeon in 1994 and aired two years later. The pilot episode, \\"Your Real Best Friend\\", was created in 1995 and finished in 1996. One of the shorts, Mo Willems's The Off-Beats was initially produced as stand-alone short films for Nickelodeon; but after it was nominated for a cable ACE award, more segments were produced for KaBlam! The show began production in 1996 and premiered October 11. The show ran for four seasons, however almost getting canceled by the twenty-ninth episode. The last episode was broadcast on January 22, 2000. Reruns continued to show on Nickelodeon until 2001. In 2002, Nicktoons was launched, and the channel began airing reruns of the program, though not all episodes were aired. During commercial breaks, various shorts from the show would play, not including any shorts involving Henry and June or music videos. In August 2005, Nicktoons changed its appearance and schedule, and canceled many shows in the process, including KaBlam!. After the show was canceled, the \\"KaBlam! Presents:\\" shorts would continue to be shown, until 2008 when the channel did away with all of their in-between shorts, for more commercial space. The program would only be seen one more time in June 2008 for Nicktoons Network's \\"100 Greatest Nicktoon Moments\\" marathon although it wasn't shown when Nick had a marathon of the first episodes of each Nicktoon on Thanksgiving Day 2007, despite having Henry and June on the cover of the now-defunct Nickelodeon Magazine; it has also been omitted from Nickelodeon's 1990s block for five years. The show would not rerun until October 8 and 9 2016 when The Splat would spotlight the show. The show would additionally not be included on a streaming service until VRV added KaBlam! on August 28, 2018. A French-dubbed version has been broadcast in France on television channel GameOne (see Télévision Par Satellite), and other versions of the show are on other Nickelodeon channels around Europe. It also was shown in the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2000. In Poland it aired from 1999 to 2001 on Fantastic. The show was aired in Estonia as well. The show played on YTV in Canada.  Episodes  =Season 1= The first season began with regular cartoons in their regular order. Sniz & Fondue, Action League Now!, Prometheus and Bob, and Life with Loopy. The Off-Beats was also another regular cartoon that occasionally filled in for \\"Life with Loopy\\" or Prometheus and Bob. Other cartoons such as Surprising Shorts, Angela Anaconda, and once, The Louie and Louie Show aired. This is the only season in which a Sniz & Fondue short is included in every episode. Henry and June frequently had random short plots when the screen was shown on them and barely had one main plot, unlike future episodes. They had one whole plot in Comics for Tomorrow Today and What the Astronauts Drink. The opening animation starts out with a hawk crashing into the camera while the camera pans through a forest, dives underwater and travels to Egypt where Egyptians dance and the Great Sphinx swipes at the camera. The camera then heads to outer space showing two kids in a ride, the planets, stars, asteroids, and flying saucers. After the United States Capitol is destroyed by two saucers, it then pans to Godzilla destroying a city. It then pans to an open street comic book store and lands on the KaBlam! comic book, featuring the Flesh, Stinky Diver, Sniz, Fondue, and Loopy on it. The book is then opened by Henry and June. After they dance, the episode starts. At the start of the theme, a voiceover of a man shouts \\"Wake up the masses!\\". As soon as he finishes, another man (Burt Pence) continues by saying, \\"Assume the crash position. Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a new kind of cartoon show. It's KaBlam! Where cartoons and comics collide. Now to take you inside and turn the pages, here are your hosts, Henry and June.\\" The ending theme for most of the first season is Toasters song Skaternity (performed by the 'Moon Ska Stompers'). =Season 2= After seven more episodes of The Off-Beats, and one last episode of Surprising Shorts, they were officially taken out of KaBlam! One-time shorts were brought in such as Randall Flan's Incredible Big Top, The Girl with Her Head Coming Off, and The Adventures of Patchhead which did return in season 3. The Brothers Tiki appeared twice in season 2. Henry and June are now drawn differently and their voices are deeper. The opening theme to the show is barely changed. When the camera pans on the KaBlam! comic book, it is clearly seen that the cover is different. In place of the original characters, Thundergirl, Stinky Diver, Prometheus, Bob, Loopy, Sniz, and Fondue are seen. Also, Henry and June dance the macarena and then arm-in-arm, whereas in season one; it was just a bunch of random dances. The ending theme to the show is dramatically changed. Instead of Skaternity, it is \\"Everything You Said Has Been a Lie\\" by The Toasters (also performed by the 'Moon Ska Stompers'). After this season, the rating for KaBlam! went up from TV-Y to TV-Y7 for the remainder of the show's run. =Season 3= This season featured the last four episodes of Sniz & Fondue. JetCat and Race Rabbit are introduced and become minor shorts that appeared from time to time. The Adventures of Patchhead makes its second and final appearance. A music video for a song by James Kochalka called \\"Hockey Monkey\\" also appears once. Henry and June are drawn a little differently and their voices are slightly deeper. The opening theme is shortened and Henry and June have their own main plots now. In the episode \\"You May Already Be a...KaBlammer!\\", Lou Rawls is featured and voiced by the actual provider. The opening theme had a number of changes. After the camera comes up out of the water, it goes directly to the White House scene. After the Godzilla scene, the camera pans toward a school rather than the comic book stand. As it enters the classroom, the camera scares off a bird that was perched on a window. The camera pans by a teacher and through a number of students. It stops as it hits a student reading a KaBlam! comic book. On the cover of the comic book, it shows a child who is ecstatic. Henry and June then open the comic book, dance, and the episode starts. The announcer's line as he introduces the show is slightly changed. Instead of saying \\"Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a new kind of cartoon show\\", he says \\"Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a cartoon cramaganza!\\" The ending theme is not changed. This was also intended to be the final season until Nickelodeon renewed the show. =Season 4= All the shorts (except Action League Now! and Angela Anaconda, which both spun off into their own shows) come to an end in the final season. Life with Loopy and Prometheus and Bob air their last seven episodes while JetCat and Race Rabbit air their last one and three episodes, respectively. Music videos by They Might Be Giants appear twice; they were Why Does the Sun Shine? and Doctor Worm. One-time cartoons still appear: Fuzzball, Garbage Boy, Emmett Freedy, Stewy the Dog Boy, The Little Freaks, and The Shizzagee. One-time shorts are included in nearly every episode, excluding \\"A Nut in Every Bite!\\", \\"The KaBlair! Witch Project\\", and \\"Now With More Flava'\\". In every episode, Henry and June have their own main plot. In the episode \\"Sasquatch-ercise\\", Richard Simmons is featured and in the episode \\"Now With More Flava'\\", John Stamos and Busta Rhymes are featured; however, the stars did not voice their characters. The opening and ending themes are unchanged. =Syndication and home media= After various reruns, KaBlam! was removed from Nickelodeon's broadcasting schedule in 2001, with the rest of season four and two seasons left unaired. In the same year, Action League Now! became a short-lived series, but consisting of replayed KaBlam! shorts and only two new shorts. Shortly after the cancellation, Henry and June were retired as the hosts of Nick's U-Pick block, only for it to return later with live-action hosts. KaBlam! later returned to airwaves when Nickelodeon's sister network Nicktoons was launched in 2002. Although the show had its reruns aired, many episodes were not aired on the network due to either copyright issues or Nickelodeon's standards and practices. The show continued to run on Nicktoons until 2005 when Nicktoons was revamped as Nicktoons Network. The final time it was shown was in the 2008 \\"100 Greatest Nicktoons Episodes\\" marathon, and has not been seen since. In 2010, Mark Marek, who created the Henry and June shorts, created the Warner Bros. Animation produced cartoon, MAD. Julia McIlvaine, who voiced June, has appeared in a few episodes. KaBlam! was the only Nicktoon from the 1990s not to air on The Splat or be released to DVD, due to licensing issues, until promos for The Splat's celebration of 25 Years of Nicktoons revealed that KaBlam! would be on the network for at least one weekend. The show returned for the first time in eight years on October 8–9, 2016 on The Splat and would air there again on August 19, 2017. On August 28, 2018, eight episodes from the first season of KaBlam! were made available to the streaming service VRV after years of not being included to any online streaming services (presumably due to similar licensing issues preventing DVD releases and normal reruns). Shorts = Regular shorts = Some of these shorts air more frequently and consistently than others.  Henry and June  The animated hosts of KaBlam! who turn the pages of a comic book (changes with each episode) to reveal the next cartoon or alternative animation, as well as being involved in subplots of their own between the shorts. These shorts were directed by Mark Marek. = Characters = * Henry is the energetic male co-host of KaBlam!. He tends to behave foolishly and believes that he looks good shirtless. He is best friends with June. However, they don't always see eye- to-eye, and June can seem more like a bully than a friend at times. He is more up-tight and practical than June (at times), and seems to be disaster-prone, especially around Mr. Foot, for reasons unknown. He once got sick of being the \\"butt monkey\\" and quit, opening his own restaurant. He later closed it and went back when he found June heartbroken. He's also been shown to be very girl-crazy, but with no girls returning the favor (except for June on many occasions). He takes his job as being the host of KaBlam! very seriously. One episode also revealed he had a crush on Thundergirl (of Action League Now!), but this is never mentioned again. In season one, he's shown to be much smarter than June, almost being like an older brother to her (though they're the same age), but by season two, it changed to the other way around. His feelings for June vary from him laughing when she gets hurt to being very sweet to her. He also has a tendency to get a bit emotional, usually about Action League Now!. His favorite comic book series is Galaxy of Death, and action/horror comic series that June likes too, apparently. One thing he's known for is to freak out in a small situation (like what's going to happen in a short). Some of his special talents are playing the guitar and dancing. He's a bit taller than June. He can also get easily embarrassed, especially around girls. His voice seems to be the most recognizable that it changed over time, the other being Larry's of Life with Loopy. One distinctive feature that Henry has that June doesn't have is his freckles. Henry is voiced by Noah Segan. * June is the show's more laid-back female co-host. She has a sarcastic personality and enthusiasm for her job. In the first season, she's portrayed as a tomboyish ditz. By season two she has become much smarter but kept her tomboyishness. Her appearance slightly changed from the first season to the rest of the show, as in season one she's taller, and her ponytail is a bit spikey at the end (her ponytail also used to rise up or droop down depending on her mood in some of the very early episodes, however, this was dropped). Starting season two, her height decreased slightly and her ponytail became slightly curvy. Her bangs were also messier in season one. She's also a bit clumsy (not as much as Henry, however). She's usually seen wearing her orange- red sweater (even if it is hot outside). She's usually seen wearing purple cleats. She also has a fiery temper and is prone to hurting others when angry including her friends. She also can be very bossy. She has a tendency to find Henry's dilemmas quite humorous, although on other occasions she is shown to care deeply for him. She rarely injured herself. She has also gone through the random switches from being a deadpan snarker to a sweet and caring little girl. She is also prone to anger as many people incorrectly call her a boy. In some of the very early episodes, she had a slight valley-girl dialect (this was dropped). One distinctive feature of June is her additional \\"baby fat\\". June is voiced by Julia McIlvaine. * Mr. B. Foot is a giant Sasquatch who works on the show. His hobbies include sleeping, injuring Henry, and unexpectedly stealing the spotlight. However, under the rage and bluster, he is not a terrible creature; he never injures June. In one episode, he is revealed to be an accomplished drummer. He once spoke in the episode, \\"A Little Dab'll Do Ya\\". * Mr. Fred Stockdale is the elderly network executive in charge of KaBlam!. He acts rather senile, and will do anything to get KaBlam! good ratings—including firing someone or getting Henry into many physical accidents. His granddaughter Dawn says he has not been the same since they canceled Charlie's Angels. * Henry's mom shows her love for her son in an exaggerated way. In \\"Cramming Cartoons Since 1627\\", her name is revealed to be Lois. * Mr. Jimmy McGee appeared twice as a co-host of June on KaBlam! He gets in fights with Henry's mom. Appears to be a parody of Ed McMahon. His catchphrase is \\"Ahooga!\\". Voiced by show writer Robert Mittenthal.  Sniz & Fondue  Began: Season 1 Ended: Season 3 A pair of ferret roommates who often get on each other's nerves. Sniz is the younger kid ferret that is very hyperactive, and quite a troublemaker of the two, while Fondue is the older teenage ferret, who is the nervous, yet intelligent one. There is also Snuppa and Bianca, Sniz and Fondue's roommates. From mid-1997 (around KaBlam's second season) until Sniz and Fondue ended production in late-1998 (around KaBlam!s third or fourth season). Due to its production company going to work on a TV adaption of Watership Down as well as creator Michael Pearlstein leaving the show out of frustration, Sniz & Fondue was taken off of the KaBlam! roster after season 3. The show was created by Michael Pearlstein. The pilot \\"Psyched for Snuppa\\" was produced in 1992 by Stretch Films and Jumbo Pictures, and was directed by John R. Dilworth, creator of Cartoon Network's Courage the Cowardly Dog. Unfortunately, John R. Dilworth, Jim Jinkins, and David Campbell were only involved in the pilot, but later all had no involvement with the rest of Sniz & Fondue when it became a part of KaBlam!. Reasons were that Doug creator Jim Jinkins and David Campbell have officially moved their jobs to Disney Enterprises when they purchased Jumbo Pictures, and John R. Dilworth would later work on other projects, such as creating Courage the Cowardly Dog for Cartoon Network in 1999.  Action League Now! Began: Season 1 Ended: Season 4 Filmed in \\"Chuckimation\\", in which the characters/props are moved by unseen hands or thrown from off-camera (interspersed with occasional stop motion animation). Action League Now! featured a group of superheroes, played by custom-made action figures, who fight crime in suburbia despite being total idiots. The four superheroes are The Flesh, Thundergirl, Stinky Diver, and Meltman. Considered to be the most successful KaBlam! short, it briefly became a spin-off series in 2001. Action League Now! is the only short to have a new episode with every showing of KaBlam! and it served as the centerpiece of KaBlam. All of the characters on the shorts were voiced by personalities from radio station WDVE in Pittsburgh. The show was created by Robert Mittenthal, Will McRobb, and Albie Hecht  Life with Loopy  Began: Season 1, ended: Season 4 The life of a preteen boy Larry and his strange experiences with his imaginative and adventurous younger sister Loopy. The characters were animated with stop-motion puppet bodies, but their heads were created with metal and their features were magnetic. The show was created by a British-born Stephen Holman, who previously created Joe Normal for MTV's Liquid Television, and later created Phantom Investigators on Kids' WB. = Characters = * Lupicia \\"Loopy\\" Cooper is an imaginative little girl with a knack for discovering surreal things, such as a world under the sofa. While she is often discouraged by Larry whenever she goes out to adventure, she does never let that stop her. Loopy is voiced by Danielle Judovits. * Larry Cooper is Loopy's intelligent brother. Much like Lassie, Larry knows every detail of Loopy's adventures and narrates all of them, although he is not almost there. * Mrs. Cooper is Loopy and Larry's Mom. She is more intelligent, but one episode reveals that she was a secret agent. * Mr. Cooper is Loopy and Larry's Dad. He is more of the \\"laid-back\\" kind of guy, but one episode reveals he loses his temper when he receives bills.  Prometheus and Bob  Began: Season 1, ended: Season 4 Also known as The Prometheus and Bob Tapes. A stop motion segment featuring the camera-recorded mission logs of Prometheus, an alien who comes to Earth attempting to teach a caveman, Bob, everyday things. From the use of fire to the act of ice skating, the result is usually a failure by the mischievous third cast member, who was a simple monkey. The show was created by Cote Zellers. The introduction, done in a mock government format, describes the events as having occurred \\"900,000 years ago\\". = Characters = * Prometheus is a gaunt purple alien of advanced intelligence who speaks with a hollow sounding voice. He attempts to educate Bob, a caveman, as an experiment recorded on his remote-controlled camera. Prometheus is often injured in slapstick ways due to Bob's low intelligence. * Bob is a babbling caveman. He once was completely covered in hair, but now has none because of a laser incident in the first clip. He also has a tendency to panic when frightened. * The Monkey is a mischievous monkey who usually interferes with Prometheus' attempts to educate Bob, intentionally or otherwise. However, he has, on occasion, attempted to assist him. * The Narrator recites the opening to the short, and the introduction to the short's \\"tape\\": \\"Tape [insert number here]\\", and finally, \\"End\\".  The Off-Beats  Began: Season 1, ended: Season 2 A series that focuses on a group of unpopular friends and their main rivals, a popular clique known as \\"The Populars.\\" It originally aired during Nick's commercial breaks as stand-alone shorts to promote the premiere of KaBlam!, and it was also released on a 1996 Rugrats video, \\"Tommy Troubles\\". The show was created by Mo Willems, who later created Sheep in the Big City for Cartoon Network. The show was taken off the KaBlam! roster after season 2 because Mo Willems wanted to move over to Cartoon Network. However, The Off-Beats officially ended as a whole with a half-hour Valentine's Day special premiering in 1999, which was the last episode of the Off-Beats produced, as Mo Willems finally left Nickelodeon in 1999, and moved to Cartoon Network to create Sheep in the Big City in 2000. = Other shorts = * Surprising Shorts – The only short segment not to have recurring characters, these shorts usually had nothing to do with any previous shorts included on the show. Examples of these shorts are the Lava! series (originally titled in France as Guano!) (which were cut out of international airings for copyright issues by Vivendi, as they own Canal+, which co-produced the shorts), Garbage Boy, Emmett Freedy, and Stewy the Dog Boy, which the idea later became Disney's Teacher's Pet. This segment was usually introduced by June pulling down Henry's pants, revealing his unflattering and garishly colored boxer shorts, hence the name. * Angela Anaconda – A cutout-photo animation that was later spun off into its own Canada-made series on the Fox Family Channel and was briefly rerun on Nickelodeon as well as Starz Kids and Family in the United States. This series is about a girl named Angela, who is a social outcast. She finds herself unpopular in school and always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Nanette, a faux-French girl who everyone loves and wants to be, always mocks Angela. During each episode, a poem-like story is narrated by Angela. She often gets her revenge on the antagonist of that particular episode, and more often imagines her revenge on the said antagonist in a highly exaggerated manner. Due to copyrights being held with Fox, the repeated KaBlam! shorts were banned airing on Nicktoons. Some people believe this is the reason why any season/series DVD can't become a reality. * JetCat – A segment about a girl who has an identity as a cat superhero and flies around and saves her city. She says she \\"flies like a jet and fights like a cat.\\" This is the only short that takes place outside of the comic book. It was featured as a comic in Nickelodeon Magazine for a short time. The music was composed by Rocko's Modern Life composer Pat Irwin. Created by Jay Stephens of Tutenstein fame. * Race Rabbit – A live-action show about a romantic rabbit racer with an English accent who competes in races but there is usually trouble along the way caused by the Boolies (Zit and Winston), who are his human enemies. Race Rabbit always wins the race, foiling the Boolies' plans along the way. The only KaBlam! short created in the United Kingdom. Created by Scott Fellows, who is also the creator of Johnny Test. * The Adventures of PatchHead – A live-action/computer-generated segment about a barefoot kid with a watermelon for a hat and has a Southern Accent, stopping cheaters from winning competitions. * The Brothers Tiki – A puppetry/stop- motion/live-action segment about two extraterrestrials resembling mini tiki statues (equivalent to lawn gnomes), who land on Earth in a ship bearing a striking resemblance to a barbecue grill. * Fuzzball – A non-recurring cartoon about a tomboy who tries to re-win her dad's trophy, which she broke. Created by Kevin Dougherty. * The Louie and Louie Show – A short that appears only once on the show. Two neglected pets (a hamster and a chameleon), both named Louie, try to get some attention from their owners, who are all too busy playing with the family dog. This short was animated by Gary Baseman and directed by Tom McGrath. An early version, produced by Curious Pictures, also aired on Nickelodeon once by itself before KaBlam! premiered. The only KaBlam! short to have a \\"Nickelodeon presents\\" logo at the beginning. Louie the chameleon is voiced by James Belushi, and Louie the hamster is voiced by Billy West. * Little Freaks – Another one-time cartoon. Three freaky superheroes try to stop a villain from controlling the world's fashion trends. When it aired on Nicktoons by itself, the \\"KaBlam! Presents\\" at the beginning was absent. * Anemia and Iodine – One-time short. A cartoon displaying the misadventures of a Goth girl cat and her skateboarding, hyperactive best friend. It was alternative comics artist Krystine Kryttre and was directed by Robert Scull, most noted for his earlier work on Rocko's Modern Life, and shares visual similarities to that show as a result. * The Shizzagee – One-off short about the only existing creature of its kind who resembles a coyote and lives with his owner named Brutus. It is the only computer-animated short to air on KaBlam!. * The Girl With Her Head Coming Off – one time short * Randall Flan's Incredible Big Top – one time short * Untalkative Bunny – a one time short that eventually got a series in the early 2000s. * Dave, Son of Hercules – a one-off short about a preteen boy who is the son of the Roman god Hercules and is embarrassed by him. There were also various They Might Be Giants music videos for the songs \\"Why Does the Sun Shine?\\" and \\"Doctor Worm\\". In addition, there was a music video of \\"Hockey Monkey\\", created by James Kochalka and performed by The Zambonis. These were a mixture of live-action by Jesse Gordon and different animation styles, all produced and directed at The Ink Tank.  Cancelled spin-off film  A live-action Prometheus and Bob film was announced in 1998 to be directed by Harald Zwart, produced by Amy Heckerling and Twink Caplan and written by Joe Stillman, but apparently fell through due to lack of interest. Shorts from KaBlam! have appeared at the beginning of theatrical releases. An episode of Action League Now! titled \\"Rock-A-Big Baby\\" was shown before the Nickelodeon film Good Burger. Angela Anaconda appeared before Digimon: The Movie. The Henry & June Show A television special called The Henry & June Show was produced and aired on Nickelodeon in 1999. The first segment, \\"A Show of Their Own\\" aired, featured Henry and June with a studio audience and musical guests. The next segment was \\"Be True to Your School\\", where Henry and June attend school, and try their best to tackle hard subjects like \\"How to Look Your Best\\". It was never again shown after it premiered. Blocks A number of blocks were hosted by Henry and June for various Nicktoons including: * Henry and June's Nicktoon Summer Jam – Aired in mid-1999. * 101% Whizbang! With Henry and June (AKA 101% Spooky Whizbang for Halloween 1999) – A block showing Nicktoons of a certain theme from September to October 1999. * Nicktoon World News with Henry and June – Aired in mid-2001 during SpongeBob's Nicktoon Summer Splash During the promos, Henry's hair looked slightly different in some shots, along with it being a different shade of green. June's sweatshirt was cherry-red instead of light red/dark orange, and the dots weren't visible. Also, their eyes were blue and green in every shot, instead of being black or blue (or green) and black.

He currently hosts the improvisation-based podcast Improv4humans on the Earwolf podcasting network. Early life Besser was born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, to parents Diane and Sandy Besser.\\"The Funny Ones\\" selections from the Diane and Sandy Besser Collection / Opening Reception Friday April 20th, 2012, Eggman & Walrus Art Emporium His father was Jewish, whereas his mother was Christian. Besser is an atheist. He is a quarter German and a quarter French from his mother's side. Besser's grandfather's cousin was Joe Besser of The Three Stooges. He was recruited to play soccer after starting on his high school team, but instead attended Amherst College with a major in American Studies. There, he started doing stand-up comedy and competed in a contest at UMass that was judged by Judd Apatow. After graduating, he briefly moved to Denver in an attempt to pursue stand-up, but quickly moved to Chicago. He worked various odd jobs, including stints as a substitute teacher, a host at Carnegie Deli and as a host at Dick's Last Resort. Career After seeing an improvisational comedy show at iO Theater featuring Dave Koechner, Tim Meadows and Chris Farley, Besser began taking classes there. His improv group Victim's Family (alongside Rick Roman, Adam McKay, Miles Stroth, and Ian Roberts), later renamed The Family (minus Roman, plus Neil Flynn, and Ali Farahnakian), was directed by Del Close, the first long-form group Del focused on. Besser is a founding member of Upright Citizens Brigade, which began as a sketch comedy group in Chicago in 1990. Original members included Ian Roberts, Ali Farahnakian, Adam McKay, Rick Roman, and Horatio Sanz. During that time, UCB were regular guests on stage at the New Variety hosted by the Chicago Improv comedy club. While working at the New Variety, Besser was cast and directed by New Variety founder and Artistic Director R. O’Donnell in the TV comedy/variety special Twisted, which aired on WFLD Fox 32 Chicago. Twisted also featured Besser in a series of improvised commercials directed by O’Donnell for McDonald's, Toyota, and Ameritech along with stand-up comic Michelle Garb. In 1996, the UCB relocated to New York City. Their sketch- comedy series Upright Citizens Brigade aired for three seasons on Comedy Central from 1998 to 2000. The cast consisted of Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh. It originally included a voice-over by Del Close. After its cancellation, Comedy Central released all three seasons on DVD. Besser and the UCB moved on to other projects and opened comedy theaters in New York City and Los Angeles. Besser went on to be the creator and co-star of the Redman & Method Man MTV hidden camera prank show Stung. In 2004, he created and starred in his second Comedy Central show, Crossballs, which mocked news debate shows by pitting fake experts (played by Besser and other comedians) against real people. Besser has appeared in films such as Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Martin & Orloff, Year One, Undead or Alive, Drillbit Taylor, and Junebug, in addition to a number of sitcoms including How I Met Your Mother, New Girl and alongside his wife Danielle Schneider in Community. In 2003, the UCB filmed their first full-length improvised movie, Wild Girls Gone. In early 2010 the film was screened at several indie theaters in the Los Angeles area and is now sold for digital download on iTunes and on DVD at the official UCB Theater website. The troupe had also performed their signature brand of longform improv (ASSSSCAT) in a special for the Bravo channel in 2005. In 2008, they released a DVD entitled ASSSSCAT!: Renegade Improv Comedy through Shout! Factory, which features an uncensored improv performance by the troupe and special guests. The DVD also includes deleted scenes and along with other bonus features. In 2008, Besser played the part of \\"Courtney Frenchip\\", the hippie roommate of David Cross in David's Situation, a pilot made for HBO written by Cross and Bob Odenkirk. The pilot was filmed live on May 9, 2008, but was not picked by HBO as a series. In 2013, he portrayed Edwin Stanton in the \\"Chicago\\" episode of Comedy Central's Drunk History. Between 2011 and 2014, he appeared on Parks and Recreation as the morning DJ Crazy Ira. Besser and the UCB continue to run two Los Angeles comedy theaters in Franklin Village, and East Hollywood. Besser and the UCB currently perform several times a week at the Los Angeles theater, in their show ASSSSCAT 3000 every Sunday night. Other work Besser makes frequent appearances on many podcasts on the Earwolf podcasting network, including Comedy Bang Bang, as well as hosting \\"The Earwolf Challenge\\", a reality- competition series where several podcasters compete against each other.

It was originally published in French as Le Cru et le Cuit.The English translation of the title Le Cru et le Cuit is not incorrect, but it is perhaps incomplete. \\"Cuit\\" in French does not necessarily mean \\"cooked\\", but is also used to denote \\"done\\" or \\"prepared\\", which is not necessarily obtained by cooking. In this case, Strauss' use of cuit implies what culture and society do to the raw and make it 'done' or 'cooked'. Although the book is part of a larger volume Lévi-Strauss writes that it may be appreciated on its own merits, he does not consider this first volume a beginning: \\"since it would have developed along similar lines if it had had a different starting point\\".Maquet, Jacques. Rev. of The Raw and the Cooked: Introduction to a Science of Mythology. Vol. 1, by Claude Lévi-Strauss. Technology and Culture 11.4 (1970): 613-15. In the introduction, Lévi-Strauss writes of his confidence that \\"certain categorical opposites drawn from everyday experience with the most basic sorts of things — e.g. 'raw' and 'cooked,' 'fresh' and 'rotten,' 'moist' and 'parched,' and others — can serve a people as conceptual tools for the formation of abstract notions and for combining these into propositions.\\" Beginning with a Bororo myth, Lévi-Strauss analyses 187 myths, reconstructing sociocultural formations using binary oppositions based on sensory qualities.

He was the father of Bartholomew Burghersh the younger. Life He was the second (or perhaps the third) son of Robert Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh, and succeeded to his father's title and estates on the death of his elder brother Stephen. He was the nephew on his mother's side and namesake of Bartholomew, lord Badlesmere, one of the most powerful of the barons. He married Elizabeth, one of the three co-heiresses of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun and his first wife Maud Mortimer (c.1289-18 September 1312), an alliance by which Burghersh increased his wealth and power. Lord Badlesmere was a bitter enemy of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. Burghersh took an active role (1316) in the unhappy contests of parties in Edward II’s reign as an adherent of his uncle, whom in 1317 he accompanied in an expedition to Scotland. In October 1321, when Leeds Castle, Kent—the gates of which had been shut against Queen Isabella by Lady Badlesmere – surrendered to Edward, who had with unwonted spirit raised a force of thirty thousand men to avenge the insult offered to his wife. Burghersh, who was one of the garrison, was taken prisoner and incarcerated in the Tower of London. This imprisonment was probably the means of saving him from the fate of his uncle after the disastrous battle of Boroughbridge. He was spared to aid in the overthrow of his unfortunate sovereign. On the landing of Isabella, on 24 September 1326, his brother Henry Burghersh, the bishop of Lincoln, hastened to join her, and with Orlton, bishop of Hereford, took the initiative in the measures which speedily led to Edward's deposition and murder. The important posts of constable of Dover Castle and warden of the Cinque Ports, which had been held by his father, were given to Burghersh, and he held both offices, with but slight intermission, to his death. In the unsettled relations between England and France, which lasted through the greater part of Edward IlI's reign, the responsibility devolving on the holder of these offices, which implied the command of the chief channel of communication between the two countries, was of the highest moment, and it evidences the confidence reposed in Burghersh that he should have held them almost continuously during so important an epoch. The commission, even originally in the name of Edward II, out really proceeding from the party conspiring only too successfully against him, was renewed by his son in the first year of his reign. The first royal missive to him in this capacity, contained in Rymer, is an order to have sixty does taken from the king's park of Braboume, and salted for the use of the parliament about to meet at Westminster. This is followed by an order to use his authority to put a stop to predatory incursions on the French coast. Burghersh evidently very speedily obtained the complete confidence of the young king, which he retained uninterruptedly to the end of his life. His services were rewarded by large grants of land and manorial privileges, escheated to the crown, or in some other way falling to the sovereign to dispose of. The King despatched him repeatedly on diplomatic errands. In 1329, he was sent to Philip of France to explain the reasons for the delay in the rendering of his homage, and in the same year as an ambassador to the pope, to plead for pecuniary aid from the revenues of the English church, a tenth of which was granted to the king for four years. Rymer contains a series of royal orders issued to him in his capacity of constable of Dover relating to prohibitions or licenses to cross the sea when the peace of the country was threatened, and to make arrangements for the passage of the king and other distinguished persons. He was entrusted with other offices calling for vigour of action and practical wisdom. In 1337, on the assumption by Edward of the title of king of France, he was made admiral of the fleet from the mouth of the Thames westward. He was also appointed Seneschal of Ponthieu, Constable of the Tower of London, and Lord Chamberlain of the Household, in which capacity his presence is often recorded at delivery the great seal. In one of Edward's grievous straits for money, he was entrusted with the pawning of the crown and other jewels. As Keeper of the king's forest to the south of the Trent in 1341 he was commissioned to provide timber for the construction of engines of war and or wooden stages for the defenders of castle walls. As a good and experienced soldier he was continually in attendance on the king in his Scotch and French wars, taking part in the Battle of Crécy, 26 August 1346. The confidence reposed in Burghersh as a diplomatic agent was equally great. He was frequently sent as may be seen in Rymer — often in company with Bishop William Bateman of Norwich — to treat with the pope at Avignon, with Philip of Valois with the counts of Brahant and Flanders, and other leading powers, on the traces and armistices so repeatedly made and broken, and to arrange the often promised but long deferred final peace between the two contending nations. As characteristic of the age, it is curious to find that under an excess of religious zeal, Burghersh, before the breaking out of the war with France when the return was comparatively quiet, had laid aside his arms and assumed the cross. Edward, unable to dispense with the services of so valuable a helper, when starting for Gascony in 1377, petitioned the pope to release him from his vow. Two years after Crecy we find him again taking part in the French wars, and despatched to Avignon to treat with the pope for a firm and lasting peace between the two countries. The next year (1349) he accompanied the earl of Lancaster to Gascony, to suppress the rebellion there. In 1355, when Edward was leaving England for a fresh invasion of France, Burghersh was appointed one of the guardians of the realm, but died at the beginning of August of that year. Tomb of Bartholomew Burghersh and sons in Lincoln Cathedral He was buried in the chantry of St. Catherine, which he had founded in Lincoln minster for the soul of his brother Henry, bishop of Lincoln, and their father, Robert Burghersh. Monuments to all three, with effigies of the two brothers, are still to be seen.  Family  He had the following children by his wife Elizabeth de Verdun, 2nd daughter of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun: * Henry de Burghersh (died November 1348), married Isabel St John, daughter of Hugh St John, 2nd Baron St John of Basing but left no issue * Bartholomew Burghersh the younger (died 1369), married Cecily de Weyland * Thomas de Burghersh * Joan de Burghersh, married John Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun * Margaret de Burghersh * Maud de Burghersh, married Sir John Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Rotherfield in Oxfordshire, son of John de Grey, 2nd Baron Grey de Rotherfield, by his first wife Katherine Fitzalan.

There has been some debate about whether Maurice's wife was the daughter of Bartholomew de Burghersh the elder or younger. This can be clarified as follows: The Annales Hiberniae record that in 1347, after having been with the King at the siege of Calais, which was surrendered on 4th June, Maurice Fitz Thomas, Earl of Kildare was knighted by the King, and married to the daughter of Sir Bartholomew Burghersh the elder and his wife Elizabeth de Verdun, one of the heiresses of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdon.'A Genealogical History of the Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages of the British Empire'. Sir Bernard Burke LL.D., Ulster King of Arms. London, Harrison, 59 Pall Mall, 1866. Page 548. His wife is widely noted as being called Elizabeth. It is very clear that her father was Bartholomew Burghersh the elder. The reason we can be so certain is that her brother Henry's Inquisition Post Mortem was recorded in 1349. It records that he was the son of Bartholomew de Burghersh and that his heir was his brother Bartholomew, son of Bartholomew de Burghersh, aged 26 years and more. If this younger Bartholomew was aged 26 or more in 1349, he cannot have had a daughter who married Maurice Fitzgerald in 1347.'Jacobi Grace, Kilkenniensis, Annales Hiberniae', ed. by Rev. Richard Butler MRIA, published in Dublin for The Irish Archaeological Society, 1842. Page 143: 1347.

Beginning her career as a Broadway dancer, Rita Rudner noticed the lack of female comedians in New York City and turned to stand-up comedy where she has flourished for over three decades. Her performance on a variety of HBO specials and numerous appearances on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, helped establish Rudner as one of the premier comics to emerge from the comedy boom of the 1980s. Early life Rudner was born in Miami, Florida, the daughter of Frances, a homemaker, and Abe Rudner, a lawyer. She began taking ballet lessons at age 4. She is Jewish. Her mother died of breast cancer when she was 13. After graduating from high school at 15, Rudner left Miami and headed to New York City to embark on a career as a dancer. Beginning with a small role in Promises, Promises (joining the production in 1970), she appeared in several Broadway shows, including the now-legendary original productions of Follies (1971) and Mack & Mabel (1974). She took over the role of Lily St. Regis in the long-running musical Annie circa 1979, and stayed with the company for over a year, leaving in 1981. Rudner did not turn to comedy until she was 25, after observing how few female comedians there were compared to the number of female dancers. She spent many hours researching her favorite comedians, including Woody Allen and Jack Benny. She enjoys Jewish humor, but reserves her Jewish jokes for Jewish audiences. Career After starting her standup career in the late 1970s, Rudner made her network television debut on Late Night with David Letterman in 1982. She appeared frequently on television shows both in the US and the UK (recording a six-part series on BBC2 in 1990 in the latter), and she appeared often on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. She has recorded several award-winning comedy specials, most notably Rita Rudner: Born to Be Mild and Rita Rudner: Married Without Children for HBO and Rita Rudner: Live From Las Vegas for PBS in 2008. Rudner and her husband wrote the screenplay of the 1992 film Peter's Friends, in which she also acted. Rudner also has a role as the character Bunny in her husband's 2011 film Thanks, which had its world premiere at the 2011 Palm Springs Film Festival. Rudner is the author of the books I Still Have It; I Just Can't Remember Where I Put It, Naked Beneath My Clothes and the novels Tickled Pink and Turning The Tables. She has written several screenplays and plays with her husband. In January 2016, she appeared in a new play titled Act 3... alongside Charles Shaughnessy at the Laguna Playhouse, directed by Martin Bergman. Since 2001, Rudner has performed almost exclusively in Las Vegas, selling almost two million tickets and becoming the longest-running solo comedy show in Las Vegas. She moved to a larger theater at The Venetian in January 2011. She also created and hosted the syndicated improvisational comedy show Ask Rita, which mimicked the format of a talk/advice show. For this she received a Gracie Allen Award from the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation (AWM). In May 2009 she performed for Senator Harry Reid and President Barack Obama at Caesars Palace alongside Bette Midler and Sheryl Crow. Personal life Rudner is married to Martin Bergman, a British producer. They have a daughter, Molly.

All ASCII ccTLD identifiers are two letters long, and all two-letter top-level domains are ccTLDs. In 2018, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) began implementing internationalized country code top-level domains, consisting of language- native characters when displayed in an end-user application. Creation and delegation of ccTLDs is described in RFC 1591, corresponding to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. While gTLDs have to obey international regulations, ccTLDs are subjected to requirements that are determined by each country’s domain name regulation corporation. With over 150 million domain name registrations today, ccTLDs make up 40% of the total domain name industry.\\"the Domain Name Industry Report\\" Country code extension applications began in 1985. The registered first extensions that year were .us (United States), .uk (United Kingdom), and .il (Israel). \\"ICANN ccTLD\\" There are 312 ccTLDs in active use totally. .cn, .tk, .de and .uk contain the highest number of domains. \\"ccTLD Stats\\" Types As of 2015, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains: *infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA) *generic top-level domains (gTLD) *restricted generic top-level domains (grTLD) *sponsored top-level domains (sTLD) *country code top-level domains (ccTLD) *test top-level domains (tTLD) Delegation and management IANA is responsible for determining an appropriate trustee for each ccTLD. Administration and control are then delegated to that trustee, which is responsible for the policies and operation of the domain. The current delegation can be determined from IANA's list of ccTLDs. Individual ccTLDs may have varying requirements and fees for registering subdomains. There may be a local-presence requirement (for instance, citizenship or other connection to the ccTLD), as, for example, the Canadian (ca) and German (de) domains, or registration may be open. History The first registered ccTLD was .no, which was registered in 1983. Later ccTLDs are registered were .us, .uk, and .il in 1985, then followed by .au, .de, .fi, .fr, .jp, .kr, .nl, and .se were also registered in 1986. Relation to ISO 3166-1 =Unused ISO 3166-1 codes= Almost all current ISO 3166-1 codes have been assigned and do exist in DNS. However, some of these are effectively unused. In particular, the ccTLDs for the Norwegian dependency Bouvet Island (\`bv\`) and the designation Svalbard and Jan Mayen (\`sj\`) do exist in DNS, but no subdomains have been assigned, and it is Norid policy to not assign any at present. Two French territories—\`bl\` (Saint Barthélemy) and \`mf\` (Saint Martin)— await local assignment by France's government. The code \`eh\`, although eligible as ccTLD for Western Sahara, has never been assigned and does not exist in DNS. Only one subdomain is still registered in \`gb\` (ISO 3166-1 for the United Kingdom), and no new registrations are being accepted for it. Sites in the United Kingdom generally use \`uk\` (see below). The former .um ccTLD for the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands was removed in April 2008. Under RFC 1591 rules, .um is eligible as a ccTLD on request by the relevant governmental agency and local Internet user community. =ASCII ccTLDs not in ISO 3166-1= Several ASCII ccTLDs are in use that are not ISO 3166-1 two-letter codes. Some of these codes were specified in older versions of the ISO list. * \`uk\` (United Kingdom): The ISO 3166-1 code for the United Kingdom is GB. However, the JANET network had already selected \`uk\` as a top-level identifier for its pre- existing Name Registration Scheme, and this was incorporated into the DNS root. \`gb\` was assigned with the intention of a transition, but this never occurred and the use of \`uk\` is now entrenched. * \`su\` This obsolete ISO 3166 code for the Soviet Union was assigned when the Soviet Union was still extant; moreover, new \`su\` registrations are accepted. * \`ac\` (Ascension Island): This code is a vestige of IANA's decision in 1996 to allow the use of codes reserved in the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 reserve list for use by the Universal Postal Union. The decision was later reversed, with Ascension Island now the sole outlier. (Three other ccTLDs, \`gg\` (Guernsey), \`im\` (Isle of Man) and \`je\` (Jersey) also fell under this category from 1996 until they received corresponding ISO 3166 codes in March 2006.) * \`eu\` (European Union): On September 25, 2000, ICANN decided to allow the use of any two-letter code in the ISO 3166-1 reserve list that is reserved for all purposes. Only EU currently meets this criterion. Following a decision by the EU's Council of Telecommunications Ministers in March 2002, progress was slow, but a registry (named EURid) was chosen by the European Commission, and criteria for allocation set: ICANN approved \`eu\` as a ccTLD, and it opened for registration on 7 December 2005 for the holders of prior rights. Since 7 April 2006, registration is open to all in the European Economic Area. =Historical ccTLDs= ccTLDs may be removed if that country ceases to exist. There are three ccTLDs that have been deleted after the corresponding 2-letter code was withdrawn from ISO 3166-1: \`cs\` (for Czechoslovakia), \`zr\` (for Zaire) and \`tp\` (for East Timor). There may be a significant delay between withdrawal from ISO 3166-1 and deletion from the DNS; for example, ZR ceased to be an ISO 3166-1 code in 1997, but the \`zr\` ccTLD was not deleted until 2001. Other ccTLDs corresponding to obsolete ISO 3166-1 codes have not yet been deleted. In some cases they may never be deleted due to the amount of disruption this would cause for a heavily used ccTLD. In particular, the Soviet Union's ccTLD \`su\` remains in use more than twenty years after SU was removed from ISO 3166-1. The historical country codes \`dd\` for the German Democratic Republic and \`yd\` for South Yemen were eligible for a ccTLD, but not allocated; see also \`de\` and \`ye\`. The temporary reassignment of country code \`cs\` (Serbia and Montenegro) until its split into \`rs\` and \`me\` (Serbia and Montenegro, respectively) led to some controversies about the stability of ISO 3166-1 country codes, resulting in a second edition of ISO 3166-1 in 2007 with a guarantee that retired codes will not be reassigned for at least 50 years, and the replacement of RFC 3066 by RFC 4646 for country codes used in language tags in 2006. The previous ISO 3166-1 code for Yugoslavia, YU, was removed by ISO on 2003-07-23, but the \`yu\` ccTLD remained in operation. Finally, after a two-year transition to Serbian \`rs\` and Montenegrin \`me\`, the .yu domain was phased out in March 2010. Australia was originally assigned the \`oz\` country code, which was later changed to \`au\` with the \`.oz\` domains moved to \`.oz.au\`. Internationalized ccTLDs An internationalized country code top- level domain (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end user application, such as a web browser, in its language-native script or alphabet, such as the Arabic alphabet, or a non- alphabetic writing system, such as Chinese characters (.中国). IDN ccTLDs are an application of the internationalized domain name (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions. ICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009, and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 languages. ICANN requires all potential international TLDs to use at least one letter that does not resemble a Latin letter, or have at least three letters, in an effort to avoid IDN homograph attacks.

The doab is named for the town of Raichur in the Raichur District. The Raichur Doab is considered to be very fertile because of the sediments carried by Krishna & Tungabhadra rivers. The doab includes Raichur district and Koppal district in Karnataka, and Gadwal district in Telangana. Some areas of Raichur doab also called as Nadigadda region became a part of Telangana during Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act in 2014.Those areas are Gadwal, Alampur and Maganoor. Gadwal is one of the 31 districts of Telangana State. Resources Hatti Gold Mines: Situated in Hatti of Lingasugur taluk, is currently the only working gold mine in India. Evidently, it is one of the oldest mines dating back to Pre Ashokan times. During late 19th century, the gold mines were rediscovered. Raichur Thermal Power Station at Deosugur, commissioned in 1986 was the first coal fired thermal electric power station to be established in the state. It accounts for 40% of electricity, generated in Karnataka. Agriculture Raichur Doab has the fertile tracts of deposits from Krishna river and its tributary Tungabhadra. Sindhanur and Gangavati along with Siruguppa produces largest amount of paddy in Karnataka Raichur district ranks first in Mosambi /Sweet Lime production in the state.http://www.karnatakaindustry.gov.in/index.php/raichur Geography The doab, named after Raichur is formed by Krishna river in the North and Tungabhadra river in the South. It lies within the Deccan Plateau region of Bayalu Seeme. History During ancient period, the region was part of Maurya Empire as its southern capital was Kanakagiri. An edict of emperor Ashoka discovered in the town of Maski, was an important discovery as it solved the mystery of the title 'devanampriya' which was found in many inscriptions scattered throughout the subcontinent. The Maski edict had the name of Ashoka written along 'devanampriya' (Beloved of the Gods). After Mauryan empire, the doab came under the control of Shatavahana dynasty which ruled over central and eastern Deccan. Later in the early medieval period, Chalukyas of Badami, Rashtrakutas and Kalyani Chalukyas ruled over the Raichur doab region. In the subsequent centuries, the region was ruled by Kakatiyas of Warangal and Hoysalas before being conquered and annexed by the Delhi Sultanate. As Bahmani Sultanate was established at Gulbarga in 1347 AD, the region of Raichur doab was fiercely contested and bloody battles were fought over the forts of Mudgal and Raichur between the Bahmanis and Vijayanagar empire. Forces of Vijayanagar empire under Krishnadevaraya won the decisive Battle of Raichur in 1520 CE against Sultanate of Bijapur, and pushed across the Krishna river. But these short-term gains were decisively reversed when a confederate alliance of Deccan Sultanates defeated the Vijayanagar empire at Battle of Talikota in 1565 CE. During late 17th century, the region came under the Mughal Empire and then passed into the rule of their successors under Nizam of Hyderabad. It remained under the Hyderabad State until 1948 when the princely state was annexed by the Indian Union. During reorganisation of states on linguistic basis in 1956, the eastern part of the doab, Gadwal was incorporated in the state of Andhra Pradesh (currently in Telangana ). The remaining part of the doab that formed Raichur district was incorporated in Mysore State (Renamed as Karnataka in 1973). In 1998, a new district of four taluks was formed with Koppal as administrative headquarter.

According to the orbital energy conservation equation (also referred to as vis-viva equation), it does not vary with time: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\epsilon &= \\\\epsilon_k + \\\\epsilon_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{v^2}{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r} = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{h^2} \\\\left(1 - e^2\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2a} \\\\end{align} where *v is the relative orbital speed; *r is the orbital distance between the bodies; *\\\\mu = {G}(m_1 + m_2) is the sum of the standard gravitational parameters of the bodies; *h is the specific relative angular momentum in the sense of relative angular momentum divided by the reduced mass; *e is the orbital eccentricity; *a is the semi- major axis. It is expressed in J/kg = m2⋅s−2 or MJ/kg = km2⋅s−2. For an elliptic orbit the specific orbital energy is the negative of the additional energy required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram to escape velocity (parabolic orbit). For a hyperbolic orbit, it is equal to the excess energy compared to that of a parabolic orbit. In this case the specific orbital energy is also referred to as characteristic energy. Equation forms for different orbits For an elliptic orbit, the specific orbital energy equation, when combined with conservation of specific angular momentum at one of the orbit's apsides, simplifies to: :\\\\epsilon = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2a} where *\\\\mu = G\\\\left(m_1 + m_2\\\\right) is the standard gravitational parameter; *a is semi- major axis of the orbit. Proof: :For an elliptic orbit with specific angular momentum h given by ::h^2 = \\\\mu p = \\\\mu a \\\\left(1 - e^2\\\\right) :we use the general form of the specific orbital energy equation, ::\\\\epsilon = \\\\frac{v^2}{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r} :with the relation that the relative velocity at periapsis is :: v_p^2 = {h^2 \\\\over r_p^2} = {h^2 \\\\over a^2(1 - e)^2} = {\\\\mu a \\\\left(1 - e^2\\\\right) \\\\over a^2(1 - e)^2} = {\\\\mu \\\\left(1 - e^2\\\\right) \\\\over a(1 - e)^2} :Thus our specific orbital energy equation becomes :: \\\\epsilon = {\\\\mu \\\\over a}{\\\\left[ { 1 - e^2 \\\\over 2(1 - e)^2} - {1 \\\\over 1 - e} \\\\right]} = {\\\\mu \\\\over a}{\\\\left[ {(1 - e)(1 + e) \\\\over 2(1 - e)^2} - {1 \\\\over 1 - e} \\\\right]} = {\\\\mu \\\\over a}{\\\\left[ { 1 + e \\\\over 2(1 - e)} - {2 \\\\over 2(1 - e)} \\\\right]} = {\\\\mu \\\\over a}{\\\\left[ { e - 1 \\\\over 2(1 - e)} \\\\right]} :and finally with the last simplification we obtain: ::\\\\epsilon = -{\\\\mu \\\\over 2a} For a parabolic orbit this equation simplifies to :\\\\epsilon = 0. For a hyperbolic trajectory this specific orbital energy is either given by :\\\\epsilon = {\\\\mu \\\\over 2a}. or the same as for an ellipse, depending on the convention for the sign of a. In this case the specific orbital energy is also referred to as characteristic energy (or C_3) and is equal to the excess specific energy compared to that for a parabolic orbit. It is related to the hyperbolic excess velocity v_\\\\infty (the orbital velocity at infinity) by :2\\\\epsilon = C_3 = v_\\\\infty^2. It is relevant for interplanetary missions. Thus, if orbital position vector (\\\\mathbf{r}) and orbital velocity vector (\\\\mathbf{v}) are known at one position, and \\\\mu is known, then the energy can be computed and from that, for any other position, the orbital speed. Rate of change For an elliptic orbit the rate of change of the specific orbital energy with respect to a change in the semi-major axis is :\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2a^2} where * \\\\mu={G}(m_1 + m_2) is the standard gravitational parameter; *a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is semi-major axis of the orbit. In the case of circular orbits, this rate is one half of the gravitation at the orbit. This corresponds to the fact that for such orbits the total energy is one half of the potential energy, because the kinetic energy is minus one half of the potential energy. Additional energy If the central body has radius R, then the additional specific energy of an elliptic orbit compared to being stationary at the surface is : \\\\ -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2a}+\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{R} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu(2a-R)}{2aR} *The quantity 2a-R is the height the ellipse extends above the surface, plus the periapsis distance (the distance the ellipse extends beyond the center of the Earth). For the Earth and a just little more than R the additional specific energy is (gR/2); which is the kinetic energy of the horizontal component of the velocity, i.e. \\\\frac{V^2}{2} = \\\\frac{gR}{2}, V=\\\\sqrt{gR}. Examples =ISS= The International Space Station has an orbital period of 91.74 minutes (5504s), hence the semi-major axis is 6,738km. The energy is −29.6MJ/kg: the potential energy is −59.2MJ/kg, and the kinetic energy 29.6MJ/kg. Compare with the potential energy at the surface, which is −62.6MJ/kg. The extra potential energy is 3.4MJ/kg, the total extra energy is 33.0MJ/kg. The average speed is 7.7km/s, the net delta-v to reach this orbit is 8.1km/s (the actual delta-v is typically 1.5–2.0km/s more for atmospheric drag and gravity drag). The increase per meter would be 4.4J/kg; this rate corresponds to one half of the local gravity of 8.8m/s2. For an altitude of 100km (radius is 6471km): The energy is −30.8MJ/kg: the potential energy is −61.6MJ/kg, and the kinetic energy 30.8MJ/kg. Compare with the potential energy at the surface, which is −62.6MJ/kg. The extra potential energy is 1.0MJ/kg, the total extra energy is 31.8MJ/kg. The increase per meter would be 4.8J/kg; this rate corresponds to one half of the local gravity of 9.5m/s2. The speed is 7.8km/s, the net delta-v to reach this orbit is 8.0km/s. Taking into account the rotation of the Earth, the delta-v is up to 0.46km/s less (starting at the equator and going east) or more (if going west). =Voyager 1= For Voyager 1, with respect to the Sun: *\\\\mu = GM = 132,712,440,018 km3⋅s−2 is the standard gravitational parameter of the Sun *r = 17 billion kilometers *v = 17.1 km/s Hence: : \\\\epsilon = \\\\epsilon_k + \\\\epsilon_p = \\\\frac{v^2}{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r} = 146 km2⋅s−2 − 8 km2⋅s−2 = 138 km2⋅s−2 Thus the hyperbolic excess velocity (the theoretical orbital velocity at infinity) is given by :v_\\\\infty = 16.6km/s However, Voyager 1 does not have enough velocity to leave the Milky Way. The computed speed applies far away from the Sun, but at such a position that the potential energy with respect to the Milky Way as a whole has changed negligibly, and only if there is no strong interaction with celestial bodies other than the Sun. Applying thrust Assume: *a is the acceleration due to thrust (the time-rate at which delta-v is spent) *g is the gravitational field strength *v is the velocity of the rocket Then the time-rate of change of the specific energy of the rocket is \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}: an amount \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{a}-\\\\mathbf{g}) for the kinetic energy and an amount \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{g} for the potential energy. The change of the specific energy of the rocket per unit change of delta-v is :\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v \\\\cdot a}}{|\\\\mathbf{a}|} which is |vtimes the cosine of the angle between v and a. Thus, when applying delta-v to increase specific orbital energy, this is done most efficiently if a is applied in the direction of v, and when |vis large. If the angle between v and g is obtuse, for example in a launch and in a transfer to a higher orbit, this means applying the delta-v as early as possible and at full capacity. See also gravity drag. When passing by a celestial body it means applying thrust when nearest to the body. When gradually making an elliptic orbit larger, it means applying thrust each time when near the periapsis. When applying delta-v to decrease specific orbital energy, this is done most efficiently if a is applied in the direction opposite to that of v, and again when |vis large. If the angle between v and g is acute, for example in a landing (on a celestial body without atmosphere) and in a transfer to a circular orbit around a celestial body when arriving from outside, this means applying the delta-v as late as possible. When passing by a planet it means applying thrust when nearest to the planet. When gradually making an elliptic orbit smaller, it means applying thrust each time when near the periapsis.

Power hitter is a term used in baseball for a skilled player that has a higher than average ability in terms of his batting, featuring a combination of dexterity and personal strength that likely leads to a high number of home-runs as well as doubles and triples. In terms of detailed analysis, looking at a player's ability as a power hitter often involves using statistics such as someone's 'slugging percentage' (a function that's calculated by evaluating someone's number of moments at bat in relation to the nature of their hits and strikes). 'Isolated Power' (ISO), a measure showing the number of extra bases earned per time at bat that's calculated by subtracting someone's batting average from his slugging percentage, is another statistic used. The concept generally is analogous to that of a power pitcher, a player who relies on the velocity of his pitches (perhaps at the expense of accuracy) and a high record of strikeout associated with them (statistics such as strikeouts per nine innings pitched are common measures). Famous power hitters in baseball history Barry Bonds, who set the record for the most home runs in a season in Major League Baseball history, is often cited as a power hitter. His career was later bogged down by issues regarding performance enhancing drugs. However, he managed a total of 762 home runs while also earning a comparatively high ISO compared to his rivals, with the publication Business Insider labeling him #3 in a list of the greatest power hitters of all time.

By the end of their production run, the Aspen and Volaré would be considered intermediate cars. The Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volaré were introduced during the fall of 1975 as 1976 models, and were collectively named Motor Trend's \\"Car of the Year\\" for 1976. They were the successors to the A-body -- Dodge Dart and Plymouth Valiant/Plymouth Duster, which concurrently were sold along with Aspen and Volaré during the early part of the 1976 model year until A-body models were discontinued. The idea of the new models was to make fuel-efficient cars more desirable by making them more luxurious than the Dart and the Valiant. Well-publicized quality problems hampered sales soon after their introduction, and Chrysler discontinued the model names after the 1980 model year.  Production history  1977 Plymouth Volaré sedan The vehicle was wind-tunnel tested to be aerodynamically sound in its fuel conservation potential as the complete aerodynamics development program included a wide range studies from drag reduction to crosswind stability, wind noise and ventilation performance. The effects of this testing resulted in softened front end contours, removal of drip troughs and helped shaped internal air flow ducting.Chrysler Corporation: 'Aspen Engineering. For release: Sunday, September 28, 1975' Body engineering in the Aspen was executed using computer technology; unit body engineering was conducted by use of clear plastic stress models that showed up stress points before any sheet metal was formed. Weight reduction to provide maximum fuel economy was achieved through use of thinner glass, lighter weight side door beams and HSLA brackets and reinforcements that were four times as strong as conventional mild steel. A reduced number of stampings resulted in better panel fits and fewer welds. The Aspen had improved visibility and compared with other Dodge compacts, the Aspen provided a total glass area increase of 25% on two-door models and 33% on sedans.Chrysler Corporation: 'Press release for use in 1976 North American International Auto Show sections' Wheel alignment adjustments such as caster and camber could be made by removing plates over the wheel housings. The new isolated transverse suspension system was a substantial departure from the longitudinal torsion bars Chrysler had introduced in 1957 and used on all models since that year, until the release of the F-bodies. The transverse (side-to-side) bars were not as geometrically favorable, but saved space and weight. In addition, the new front suspension system was touted as giving a \\"big car ride\\" as the suspension had a low, or softer, fore and aft compliance which allowed the wheel to move rearward instead of straight up and down when the tire encountered an object, dampening the blow and rolling with the condition of the road. The two parallel torsion bars and an anti-sway bar were mounted forward of the front wheels, integrated into a spring-strut front suspension. These components were attached to a K-shaped structural crossmember. The K-shaped crossmember was isolated from the unitized car body by four rubber mounts. This transverse torsion bar suspension was also incorporated into the M- and J-body cars. The conventional leaf spring rear suspension was also rubber-isolated, so there was no metal-to-metal path through which road noise or vibration can be transmitted to the body; even the steering column was isolated. The 1976 Dodge Aspen also served as a test vehicle for a gas turbine engine installation, in a project sponsored by the United States Department of Energy. Entering tests in August 1976, this engine was a new, smaller version of an earlier Chrysler development. There were hopes that such engines would be cleaner and more efficient than comparably powerful V8 engines, but the turbine engine proved a dead end in automotive applications. =Recalls= The Aspen (and several other Chrysler products, as well as those of many other manufacturers struggling to meet new emissions and fuel consumption standards) was noted for having problems with its carburetors which resulted in frequent stalling. In 1977, 1,300,000 Chrysler cars were recalled for these drivability problems, a number which includes some Darts and Valiants as well. The Aspen also had difficulty in starting, even after leaving the engine off for several minutes. This, and excessive rust, brake problems, defective steering columns and hood latches resulted in several recalls, making the Aspen/Volaré the most recalled car in history at the time. The Aspen, released before it was fully developed, gained a reputation for poor build quality which led to a decline in sales. The Motor Trend winners then received the Lemon of the Year award from the Center for Auto Safety, the consumer watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader. 1980 would be its final model year. = Marketing = R.

In print and media actor Rex Harrison was spokesman for the Aspen, whose advertising campaign was inspired by the \\"Ascot Gavotte\\" scene in Harrison's My Fair Lady. A patter song was spoken in rhythm, by Harrison, as \\"Unbelievable.\\" Singer Sergio Franchi was the spokesman for the Volaré and sang the pop song \\"Volare\\", with altered lyrics, in TV and radio commercials. The accent mark used in the car's name is not in the Italian word or the song title; Volaré commercials described it as an \\"accent on quality\\". \\"Volaré\\" in Spanish with the accent translates as \\"I will fly\\". = Aspen R/T = 1979 Dodge Aspen R/T coupé The Aspen R/T coupe was the \\"performance\\" trim level of the Aspen and came with E70x14 tires, rallye wheels, a grille blackout treatment, body striping, as well as 'R/T' decals and medallions. A V8 option, with a and of torque, was offered along with overdrive-4 transmission. This was unavailable in California because the engine, which averaged did not meet California fuel economy regulations. In a Motor Trend road test, a 360 R/T turned in a standing quarter mile at 17.4 seconds at a speed of . The R/T made a run in 13.8 seconds. Unlike the 225 Slant-Six and the 318 LA V8, the 360 LA V8 was never made available with the Overdrive-4 transmission, only the 727 three- speed automatic. The Plymouth version of the car was called the Volaré Road Runner. = Station wagons = Station wagons were available in both model lines, all featuring liftgates with fixed rear windows. These models had a cargo volume of and load capacity of , which was less than the intermediate and standard size Chrysler wagons. The liftgate opening was nearly wide and high. With the rear seat folded down, the cargo area was long at the belt line and wide between the wheel houses. Premium station wagons in either the Aspen SE or Volaré Premier series featured simulated woodgrain on its exterior side panels. On Aspen SEs, the woodgrain was framed in simulated blond (painted metal) wood-look trim. On the Premiers, the side panels were trimmed in stainless steel frames accented in matte black. Aside from the brand badging and grilles unique on each brand, this station wagon trim element remains one of the few visual clues that differentiated the Aspen from the Volaré. Side covers of the cargo area were made of one-piece injection molded polypropylene. Covered, lockable stowage compartments of capacity were provided in these panels; these compartments were standard on the Aspen SEs and optional on the low-line wagons. = 1976 = 1976 Dodge Aspen S/E coupe The replacement for the venerable Dart, the Aspen would share the same engines and three-box body style with its predecessor, but not much else. Available as a 4-door wagon, 4-door sedan or 2-door coupe, it came in three trim levels - base, Custom and SE (Special Edition). Coupes featured frameless door glass but a thick \\"B\\" pillar was used, replacing the popular hardtop body style of the Dart. The performance R/T package came only on the coupe and featured a V8 standard or an optional V8 with either a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor. The Slant Six was standard across the line, and was available in most states with a choice of a 1- or 2-barrel carburetor. Total production was 189,900 (Aspen) and 255,008 (Volaré). = 1977 = The Aspen's second year was mostly a carryover. A new T-top was added to the coupé's options. The R/T package added a \\"Super Pak\\" option. This consisted of front and rear spoilers, wheel opening flares and louvred rear windows. A new stripe kit was also added as well. An R/T equipped with this package became a \\"Super R/T\\". The Volaré was Canada's top selling car this year. Total production was 266,012 (Aspen) and 327,739 (Volaré). The 3 speed manual with column shifter was last available in 1977. = 1978 = 1978 Dodge Aspen coupe The three trim lines were consolidated into one for 1978. The Custom and Special Edition lines were still available, but were now reduced to option packages. The Aspen also received a new front fascia, similar to the Volaré, while the Volaré's grille was restyled with an eggcrate pattern. Sales were down over 30 percent for the 1978 cars. The 3 speed manual was all floor shifter after 1977. A \\"Duster\\" trim package was added. New performance packages included the Super Coupe and Kit Car. Both had the same performance exterior add-ons as the \\"Super Pak\\", now renamed the \\"Sport Pak\\", but came in different colors as well as different options. 2 Dodge Aspen Super Coupes The Super Coupe included GR60x15 Goodyear GT radial tires mounted on 15x8 wheels, a heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar, a matte black finish on the hood and came only in one color - Sable Tan Sunfire Metallic. Special three color (orange, yellow and red) stripes separated the body color from the matte black colors. Only 494 were built. The Kit Car, made in honor of NASCAR legend Richard Petty, was supposed to look as much like a race car as possible. The wheels had no hubcaps, the wheel opening flares had a bolted on look, and even the windshield had metal tie downs just like the race cars. Unlike a race car, the Kit Car came standard with an automatic transmission. A special addition was a decal kit with large door mountable \\"43\\" decals and 360 decals for the hood. These decals were shipped in the trunk either to be installed by the dealer or by the owner. It was available in one color - a special two-tone red. A total of 145 were built. 1978 Plymouth Volaré A new Sunrise package, similar to the Volaré Duster package, was also new for 1978. This was available only on the coupé, and consisted mainly of new stripes and louvred rear windows. Wider tail light lenses with amber turn signals replaced the Plymouth Valiant/Duster-styled lenses on both Aspen and Volaré coupés and sedans. Total production came to 166,419 (Aspen) and 217,795 (Volaré). = 1979 = The 1979 model year was a carryover with the only readily visible change being the replacement of the amber rear turn signals with red ones. The 1978 option packages continued into 1979, with the exception of the Super Coupe and Kit Car. A new speedometer, new colors, and a diagnostic connector for the engine were added. The station wagon was available as a \\"Sport Wagon\\" with special stripes, a front airdam, and wheel arch flares. Total production came to 121,354 (Aspen) and 178,819 (Volaré). = 1980 = 1980 Plymouth Volaré with the Duster trim package that included Duster badges, a white stripe along the body and cloth-and-vinyl plaid bucket seats For its last year of production, and at the insistence of Lee Iacocca, the Aspen and Volaré were restyled and gained a new front end (very similar to the Ford Fairmont) with a thin grille and rectangular headlamps, achieved by sharing the hood, fenders and front bumper with the Dodge Diplomat. Special Edition and Premier packages were available, while the Special Edition package was now only available on the sedan and coupe. The \\"Duster\\" trim package was also available for the 1980 model year. The R/T package was installed on 285 Aspens for this year. Total production came to 67,318 (Aspen) and 90,063 (Volaré), though a significant portion of the sales were for fleet (Police and taxi) use. The V8 was dropped this year, leaving the V8 as the top engine. Power from the 318 dropped from at 4,000 rpm to at 3,600 rpm in two barrel models. Four barrel versions increased from (non-California) at 4,000 rpm to at 4,000 rpm. The inline six-cylinder remained the base engine. The \\"Super Six\\" two barrel option was dropped, leaving the Holley 1945 single barrel set up as the sole choice. The \\"slant-six\\" produced at 3,600 rpm. The Dodge Aspen was replaced with the front-wheel drive Dodge Aries for the 1981 model year.  International markets  Between 1977 and 1979, the small Swiss specialty automaker Monteverdi built a modified version of this car, called the Sierra, intended to compete in Europe's luxury car market. The Dart name (rather than Aspen) was applied to Dodge-branded F-body cars in Mexico and Colombia, corresponding to the local Chrysler-branded F-body cars badged as Valiant Volaré. The Mexican F-body Volarés were not marketed as Plymouth, because that brand was dropped after 1969. The 1981 and 1982 Mexican market Dart coupes used the M body Diplomat coupe, but fitted with the 1980 Volare header panel. Chrysler de México also sold cheaper versions of the American K-cars -Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries- (in 1982–1987) and Plymouth Caravelle (1988) as Chrysler Volarés. The 1988 Chrysler Volaré E (an inexpensive version of the 1988 Plymouth Caravelle with a 1986–1988 Plymouth Reliant front end attached to it) served as Mexican Highway Patrol (\\"Policía Federal de Caminos\\" in Spanish) units from 1988 to 1990. They got a Chrysler Turbo II 2.2L engine and 3-speed automatic transmission (shifter on the dash, like U.S. patrol cars) and were known in Mexico as \\"Turbo-patrols\\". The Volaré also became known as the Volaré \\"Duster\\" in Canada.  After the F-body  The F-body cars were withdrawn from production after 1980 and replaced by the smaller front-wheel- drive K-cars -- 1981 Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant, 1982 Dodge 400/Chrysler LeBaron, and the M-body -- 1982 Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury four-door sedans, which were very similar in structure, size, and engineering to the F-body Aspen and Volaré. The Aspen model name was revived in 2007 for the Chrysler Aspen luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV).

It was built using the same design as the Plymouth Gran Fury in the U.S. market and the Plymouth Caravelle in Canada. It was also sold in Mexico between 1981 and 1982 as the Dodge Dart, and in Colombia as the Dodge Coronet. The Diplomat was initially offered in a coupe and a sedan. In 1978, station wagons were added as replacements for the discontinued full-sized C-body wagons. The Diplomat was offered with a straight-6 engine a well as optional and V8s. The Diplomat, along with its Plymouth Gran Fury/Caravelle twin, were popular police cars both in North America. The three-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission was most popular, but a manual transmission was available until 1981 only on six cylinder and 318 V8 models. Background The Diplomat name was originally used by Dodge on 2-door hardtop models from 1950 to 1954. It was also used on the export version of the DeSoto from 1946 through 1961. In 1975–77, the Diplomat name was also used on a trim package available on the Royal Monaco two-door hardtop. Starting with the 1977 model year, the Diplomat became a full model line, rather than as the name of a particular body style. First generation (1977) 1979 Dodge Diplomat sedan Introduced as a late 1977 model during spring 1977, the first generation Diplomats were a longer, fancier upmarket version of the F-body Aspen. The chassis and mechanical components are similar with doors and various other body panels interchangeable with the Aspens. Unique to the Diplomat were the front and rear header panels, bumpers, hood and trunk lid. Larger taillights extended into the rear hatch of the station wagon. The station wagons were shorter than the sedans and coupes, which had unique bodywork with a longer rear overhang. The station wagon, introduced for the 1978 model year, used the same rear sheetmetal as the Aspen/Volaré, albeit with its own wraparound taillights. 1979 Dodge Diplomat Salon Station Wagon The first year models were available in base and Medallion trim levels; the base engine was the 318 Lean Burn V8 developing and the Slant Six was a credit option. A vinyl roof was standard on sedans, while a simulated landau roof cover was an option on coupes. For 1978 the Slant Six with a four-speed manual transmission became the base drivetrain, and the station wagon was added. The wagon featured \\"teakwood\\"-grain body appliques (a delete option) and was only available in base trim. The sedans and coupes continued largely unchanged, but a low-cost \\"Diplomat S\\" was added. This model was offered for one year, and the 3,322 produced represented only about 5% of overall Diplomat production in 1978.Lee, pp. 312-313 The V8's output dropped by five horsepower, but on the other hand, a V8 became a new option. For the 1979 model year, the Diplomat received a minor facelift. The grille was now divided into three rows of eight rectangular openings with an internal crosshatch pattern and a broad band on top. The sedan and coupe taillights were also altered, now with a horizontal theme while divided down the middle. The lineup was rearranged, with the base model decontented and a Salon model (corresponding to last year's base version) fitting in the middle below the Medallion.Lee, pp. 315-316 The new base model did not receive the padded vinyl roof (sedans). Coupes had a new landau top design, with much smaller rear side windows. The station wagon came in Salon trim, without any actual changes in equipment. The Slant Six, meanwhile, was available with a single-barrel carburetor and . V8 outputs dropped by five horsepower, to respectively, but optional was a four-barrel 360 producing . This was the last year for the 360 engine in the Diplomat. Second generation (1980) The 1980 model year brought new exterior sheet metal for the Diplomat, although wagons were unchanged, from the doors back. While the previous coupes used the same 112.7 inch wheelbase as the other models, the 1980 coupe used the 108 inch wheelbase of the Aspen coupe (though the square body was very different). The front end was more evolutionary than revolutionary, but in order to share a hood with the newly restyled Chrysler LeBaron the grille was narrowed considerably, with an arguably unfortunate effect on appearance and sales. The roofline of the sedan was also made more square, marginally improving headroom, and conservative, Buick-like taillights appeared on all but the wagons. Manual transmissions were dropped. Following the demise of the Dodge St. Regis R-body in 1981, the Diplomat remained, becoming the largest sedan in the Dodge lineup, despite technically being a mid-size car. Dodge would not market another truly full-size car (at least based upon United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) passenger volume statistics) until the Monaco debuted as a 1990 model. By 1981, Chrysler was switching to smaller front-wheel drive designs. However, its older and larger rear-wheel drive Dodge Diplomat (as well as the Chrysler LeBaron and Fifth Avenue) continued to sell. Chrysler's then executive vice president for manufacturing, Steve Sharf, met with officials at American Motors (AMC) to use the extra capacity at an assembly plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin to build the cars. Chrysler's tooling was moved from St. Louis to Kenosha, and from 1987 until 1989 about 250,000 Chrysler and Dodge models were built by AMC at a lower cost than Chrysler could. This relationship evolved into Chrysler's purchase of AMC in 1987. 1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe In 1982, the coupe and station wagon were discontinued and Canada's Plymouth version of the Diplomat came south of the border. The Plymouth Caravelle was offered in the United States as the Plymouth Gran Fury. 1983 was the last year for the Slant Six, and afterwards, the only available engine was the 318-cid V8 with a two-barrel carburetor. A four-barrel 318 remained the optional engine choice for the police package. For 1984, the appearance of the upscale Special Edition or SE used the Fifth Avenue's front end with its parking lights located above the headlights, and a bright metal cross overlaid on the Chrysler grille's thin vertical bars. The SE had more exterior trim and an interior that placed the SE between the Diplomat Salon and the Chrysler Fifth Avenue. As the 1980s progressed, fewer private customers purchased the Diplomat, and the M-body was eventually dropped during the 1989 model year. Sales of cars equipped with the Police Package represented about half of the Diplomat production after the discontinuation of the coupe and station wagons.Lee, pp. 323-336, passim Late in the Diplomat's run, the car was subject to the federal \\"Gas Guzzler Tax\\" and required premium unleaded gasoline. Although sales were strong, Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca held a low opinion of the M-body line as a relic of the pre-K car era and declined to invest any money in them. Despite lower gas prices in the mid- to late-1980s and a 2.26:1 rear-end gear ratio, the Diplomat's carbureted engine and lack of an overdrive gear on its TorqueFlite automatic transmission resulted in poor fuel economy compared with its larger competitors from Ford and General Motors, as evidenced by comparing the EPA estimates for 1986 models: * Dodge Diplomat (5.2 L V8, 3-speed automatic): 16 city, 21 highway, 18 combined * Chevrolet Caprice (5.0 L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 17 city, 25 highway, 20 combined * Ford LTD Crown Victoria (5.0 L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 18 city, 26 highway, 21 combined {style=\\"float: right; border: 1px solid #BBB; margin: .46em 0 0 .2em;\\" |- style=\\"font-size: 86%;\\" valign=\\"top\\" |250px 1980 Station wagon |} However, Diplomats built from mid-1988 until the end of production were among the first Chrysler-built products to have a driver's side airbag as standard equipment, some two model years before the remainder of Chrysler's lineup and they were also among the only cars at the time to offer a tilt steering column with an airbag. Diplomats with airbags differed from earlier models in that they were also equipped with a padded, color-keyed knee blocker which extended out from beneath the instrument panel in front of the driver. Discontinuation When the Diplomat and similar Plymouth Gran Fury were discontinued, it marked the last rear-wheel drive non-truck model (aside from the Dodge Viper) sold by the corporation until the Plymouth Prowler was introduced in 1997. The Diplomat's other rear-wheel drive sibling, the Chrysler Fifth Avenue, also ended production, but the nameplate was continued on a front-wheel drive chassis. In the Dodge lineup, the Monaco became the top-of-the-line sedan until the introduction of the LH platform.

He is remembered chiefly for his lone vote against the condemnation of Mary, Queen of Scots, and for organising the ill-fated stag-hunt where his guest, the Archbishop of Canterbury, accidentally killed a man. Early life Zouche was the son of George la Zouche, 10th Baron Zouche, of the noble Breton-origin Zouche dynasty, and his wife Margaret, née Welby. He was a royal ward from 1570, under the care of William Cecil. In a letter to Cecil written in 1596, Zouche confessed that he spent his patrimony as a youth, having indulged in \\"little searching for knowledge\\".Cecil archive – the National Archives. 1596, 24 May. Marriage In or around 1578, Zouche married his cousin Eleanor Zouche, daughter of Sir John Zouche and Eleanor, née Whalley. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, but, shortly after Mary's birth in 1582, Zouche abandoned his wife and they lived apart until her death in 1611. Eleanor wrote to Lord Burghley, from her lodging in the Strand on 19 May 1593, following her father's death, still hoping to be reconciled with Zouche.'Original Letters of the Zouch family', The Gentleman's Magazine, Or Monthly Intelligencer, vol. 25 (London, 1828), pp. 303-4, printed from British Library Lansdown MSS. Sir John Holles wrote to Sir Edward Phillips describing her treatment; > \\"My Lord Souche (sic) put away this his lady twenty-nine years ago and > refusing her all allowance was by law sentenced there-unto, which he not > performing was excomunicate; from which he went beyond sea and returning was > ordered to pay her 50s the week, from which poor allowance with a small > addition from her friends hath this Baron's wife...ever since lived.

Within a year of Eleanor's death, Zouche married again, to Sarah Harington (1565-1629), daughter of Sir James Harington. Sarah Harrington had been twice widowed, having been the former wife of Francis Hastings, and of Sir George Kingsmill. There were no children of this marriage.Donald F. Harris, PhD.

Her portrait was painted by Isaac Oliver and by Cornelius Johnson.Portrait of Lady Edmondes, by Cornelius Johnson, NT Hatchlands, and Portrait of Lady Edmondes, Nelson-Atkins Museum, Kansas. The portraits by Johnson show her aged 63 wearing a large miniature case referring to Frederick V of the Palatinate with the greek letter \\"phi\\".

Career Portrait etching of Lord Zouche published 29 May 1777 Zouche matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge in Easter 1570, M.A. 1571; and was admitted to Gray's Inn, 1575, though he was not admitted to the bar. Zouche was appointed a Commissioner for the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Fotheringhay. Here he demonstrated courage and independence, in that he was the only Commissioner to offer any dissent against the judgement and subsequent sentence of death.Mary Queen of Scots by Antonia Fraser – Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1969 p. 563 In later years he served as Ambassador to Scotland, Lord President of the Council of Wales and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was a Privy Counsellor from 1603. Zouche showed a strong interest in the New World, and was a Commissioner of the Virginia Company from 1608. He was also interested in horticulture; his house in Hackney included a physic garden and he employed Matthias L'Obel as his gardener. The house in Hackney lay on the north side of Homerton High Street, probably on the site of the present Dean Close. The herbalist, John Gerard, visited Hackney and was given foreign seeds from Zouche's garden. Zouche ceased to be a Hackney resident before his death in 1625 and it is likely his house was sold in 1620, to Sir Julius Caesar, Master of the Rolls. In 1605, Zouche purchased the manor of Bramshill in Hampshire and almost immediately began to build the mansion that currently stands on the site. James I stayed at Bramshill in 1620 and the next year George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, went down to Bramshill to consecrate a chapel for Lord Zouche.Victorian County History – Hampshire 'Parishes: Eversley', A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 4 (1911), pp. 32–41 The visit had disastrous consequences for the Archbishop when he accepted Zouche's invitation to a stag-hunt, where Abbot unintentionally killed a gamekeeper who strayed into his line of fire. Although all the witnesses, including Zouche, agreed that the gamekeeper's death was a tragic accident, Abbot's reputation never recovered from the incident. He remains the only Archbishop of Canterbury ever to kill a man.Trevor-Roper, Hugh Archbishop Laud Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p. 58 Bramshill was used as the UK Police Staff College from 1960 to 2015.

The term came into use in the late 1990s, derived from the concepts of \\"white hat\\" and \\"black hat\\" hackers. When a white hat hacker discovers a vulnerability, they will exploit it only with permission and not divulge its existence until it has been fixed, whereas the black hat will illegally exploit it and/or tell others how to do so. The grey hat will neither illegally exploit it, nor tell others how to do so. A further difference among these types of hacker lies in their methods of discovering vulnerabilities. The white hat breaks into systems and networks at the request of their employer or with explicit permission for the purpose of determining how secure it is against hackers, whereas the black hat will break into any system or network in order to uncover sensitive information for personal gain. The grey hat generally has the skills and intent of the white hat but will break into any system or network without permission. According to one definition of a grey-hat hacker, when they discover a vulnerability, instead of telling the vendor how the exploit works, they may offer to repair it for a small fee. When one successfully gains illegal access to a system or network, they may suggest to the system administrator that one of their friends be hired to fix the problem; however, this practice has been declining due to the increasing willingness of businesses to prosecute. Another definition of Grey hat maintains that Grey hat hackers only arguably violate the law in an effort to research and improve security: legality being set according to the particular ramifications of any hacks they participate in. In the search engine optimization (SEO) community, grey hat hackers are those who manipulate web sites' search engine rankings using improper or unethical means but that are not considered search engine spam. History The phrase grey hat was first publicly used in the computer security context when DEF CON announced the first scheduled Black Hat Briefings in 1996, although it may have been used by smaller groups prior to this time. Moreover, at this conference a presentation was given in which Mudge, a key member of the hacking group L0pht, discussed their intent as grey hat hackers to provide Microsoft with vulnerability discoveries in order to protect the vast number of users of its operating system. Finally, Mike Nash, Director of Microsoft's server group, stated that grey hat hackers are much like technical people in the independent software industry in that \\"they are valuable in giving us feedback to make our products better\\". The phrase grey hat was used by the hacker group L0pht in a 1999 interview with The New York Times to describe their hacking activities. The phrase was used to describe hackers who support the ethical reporting of vulnerabilities directly to the software vendor in contrast to the full disclosure practices that were prevalent in the white hat community that vulnerabilities not be disclosed outside of their group. In 2002, however, the Anti-Sec community published use of the term to refer to people who work in the security industry by day, but engage in black hat activities by night.Digitalsec.net #Phrack High Council. 20 August 2002. \\"The greyhat-IS- whitehat List\\" The irony was that for black hats, this interpretation was seen as a derogatory term; whereas amongst white hats it was a term that lent a sense of popular notoriety. Following the rise and eventual decline of the full disclosure vs. anti-sec \\"golden era\\"—and the subsequent growth of an \\"ethical hacking\\" philosophy—the term grey hat began to take on all sorts of diverse meanings. The prosecution in the U.S. of Dmitry Sklyarov for activities which were legal in his home country changed the attitudes of many security researchers. As the Internet became used for more critical functions, and concerns about terrorism grew, the term \\"white hat\\" started referring to corporate security experts who did not support full disclosure. In 2008, the EFF defined grey hats as ethical security researchers who inadvertently or arguably violate the law in an effort to research and improve security. They advocate for computer offense laws that are clearer and more narrowly drawn.EFF.org Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). 20 August 2008. \\"A 'Grey Hat' Guide\\" Examples In April 2000, hackers known as \\"{}\\" and \\"Hardbeat\\" gained unauthorized access to Apache.org. They chose to alert Apache crew of the problems rather than try to damage the Apache.org servers. In June 2010, a group of computer experts known as Goatse Security exposed a flaw in AT&T; security which allowed the e-mail addresses of iPad users to be revealed.FBI Opens Probe of iPad Breach Wall Street Journal, Spencer Ante and Ben Worthen. 11 June 2010. The group revealed the security flaw to the media soon after notifying AT&T.; Since then, the FBI opened an investigation into the incident and raided the house of weev, the new group's most prominent member. In April 2011, a group of experts discovered that the Apple iPhone and 3G iPads were \\"logging where the user visits\\". Apple released a statement saying that the iPad and iPhone were only logging the towers that the phone could access. There have been numerous articles on the matter and it has been viewed as a minor security issue. This instance would be classified as \\"grey hat\\" because although the experts could have used this for malicious intent, the issue was nonetheless reported. In August 2013, Khalil Shreateh, an unemployed computer security researcher, hacked the Facebook page of Mark Zuckerberg in order to force action to correct a bug he discovered which allowed him to post to any user's page without their consent. He had tried repeatedly to inform Facebook of this bug only to be told by Facebook that the issue was not a bug. After this incident, Facebook corrected this vulnerability which could have been a powerful weapon in the hands of professional spammers. Shreateh was not compensated by Facebook's White Hat program as he violated their policies, thus making this a grey hat incident.

Under standard assumptions, a body moving under the influence of a force, directed to a central body, with a magnitude inversely proportional to the square of the distance (such as gravity), has an orbit that is a conic section (i.e. circular orbit, elliptic orbit, parabolic trajectory, hyperbolic trajectory, or radial trajectory) with the central body located at one of the two foci, or the focus (Kepler's first law). If the conic section intersects the central body, then the actual trajectory can only be the part above the surface, but for that part the orbit equation and many related formulas still apply, as long as it is a freefall (situation of weightlessness).  Central, inverse-square law force  Consider a two-body system consisting of a central body of mass M and a much smaller, orbiting body of mass **m** , and suppose the two bodies interact via a central, inverse-square law force (such as gravitation). In polar coordinates, the orbit equation can be written as :r = \\\\frac{\\\\ell^2}{m^2\\\\mu}\\\\frac{1}{1+e\\\\cos\\\\theta} where r is the separation distance between the two bodies and \\\\theta is the angle that \\\\mathbf{r} makes with the axis of periapsis (also called the true anomaly). The parameter \\\\ell is the angular momentum of the orbiting body about the central body, and is equal to mr^2\\\\dot{\\\\theta}.There is a related parameter, known as the specific relative angular momentum, h. It is related to \\\\ell by h = \\\\ell/m. The parameter \\\\mu is the constant for which \\\\mu/r^2 equals the acceleration of the smaller body (for gravitation, \\\\mu is the standard gravitational parameter, -GM). For a given orbit, the larger \\\\mu, the faster the orbiting body moves in it: twice as fast if the attraction is four times as strong. The parameter e is the eccentricity of the orbit, and is given by :e = \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{2E\\\\ell^2}{m^3\\\\mu^2}} where E is the energy of the orbit. The above relation between r and \\\\theta describes a conic section. The value of e controls what kind of conic section the orbit is. When e<1, the orbit is elliptic; when e=1, the orbit is parabolic; and when e>1, the orbit is hyperbolic. The minimum value of r in the equation is :r={{\\\\ell^2}\\\\over{m^2\\\\mu}}{{1}\\\\over{1+e}} while, if e<1, the maximum value is :r={{\\\\ell^2}\\\\over{m^2\\\\mu}}{{1}\\\\over{1-e}} If the maximum is less than the radius of the central body, then the conic section is an ellipse which is fully inside the central body and no part of it is a possible trajectory. If the maximum is more, but the minimum is less than the radius, part of the trajectory is possible: *if the energy is non-negative (parabolic or hyperbolic orbit): the motion is either away from the central body, or towards it. *if the energy is negative: the motion can be first away from the central body, up to :r={{\\\\ell^2}\\\\over{m^2\\\\mu}}{{1}\\\\over{1-e}} :after which the object falls back. If r becomes such that the orbiting body enters an atmosphere, then the standard assumptions no longer apply, as in atmospheric reentry. Low-energy trajectories If the central body is the Earth, and the energy is only slightly larger than the potential energy at the surface of the Earth, then the orbit is elliptic with eccentricity close to 1 and one end of the ellipse just beyond the center of the Earth, and the other end just above the surface. Only a small part of the ellipse is applicable. If the horizontal speed is v\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, then the periapsis distance is . The energy at the surface of the Earth corresponds to that of an elliptic orbit with a=R/2\\\\,\\\\\\\\! (with R\\\\,\\\\\\\\! the radius of the Earth), which can not actually exist because it is an ellipse fully below the surface. The energy increase with increase of a is at a rate 2g\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. The maximum height above the surface of the orbit is the length of the ellipse, minus R\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, minus the part \\"below\\" the center of the Earth, hence twice the increase of a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! minus the periapsis distance. At the top the potential energy is g times this height, and the kinetic energy is . This adds up to the energy increase just mentioned. The width of the ellipse is 19 minutes times v\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. The part of the ellipse above the surface can be approximated by a part of a parabola, which is obtained in a model where gravity is assumed constant. This should be distinguished from the parabolic orbit in the sense of astrodynamics, where the velocity is the escape velocity. See also trajectory. Categorization of orbits Consider orbits which are at one point horizontal, near the surface of the Earth. For increasing speeds at this point the orbits are subsequently: *part of an ellipse with vertical major axis, with the center of the Earth as the far focus (throwing a stone, sub-orbital spaceflight, ballistic missile) *a circle just above the surface of the Earth (Low Earth orbit) *an ellipse with vertical major axis, with the center of the Earth as the near focus *a parabola *a hyperbola Note that in the sequence above, h, \\\\epsilon and a increase monotonically, but e first decreases from 1 to 0, then increases from 0 to infinity. The reversal is when the center of the Earth changes from being the far focus to being the near focus (the other focus starts near the surface and passes the center of the Earth). We have :e=\\\\left \\\\frac{R}{a}-1\\\\right Extending this to orbits which are horizontal at another height, and orbits of which the extrapolation is horizontal below the surface of the Earth, we get a categorization of all orbits, except the radial trajectories, for which, by the way, the orbit equation can not be used. In this categorization ellipses are considered twice, so for ellipses with both sides above the surface one can restrict oneself to taking the side which is lower as the reference side, while for ellipses of which only one side is above the surface, taking that side.

A turbocharged variant of the Neon, the car was developed by DaimlerChrysler's in house PVO (Performance Vehicle Operations) tuner group. PVO was officially renamed SRT (Street and Racing Technology) in 2004. The \\"4\\" in the SRT-4's name denotes the number of cylinders of the engine. ACR (American Club Racing) and Commemorative Edition models were later introduced as well. History In 1998, Tom Gale, (then Executive Vice President of Chrysler Product Development and Design), attended the 1998 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) Show in Las Vegas. Gale noted a list of performance features he saw on the sport compact cars at the show, and wanted to integrate those features into Chrysler's compact production car, the Dodge Neon. Gale was the design chief of the original Dodge Viper concept vehicle, and recognized an opportunity to build a sport compact that would appeal to the younger auto generation who grew up on tuner cars, who may prefer a new car with the same performance appeal right off the showroom floor. A group of young Dodge and Chrysler talent was assembled to put together a vehicle to meet Gale's request, with all of the team members sharing first-hand knowledge and familiarity of the existing Dodge Neon. They created a concept car, the 2000 Neon SRT, in just 4 months, with a 2.0 L 16-valve four-cylinder topped with a 45-cubic-inch Eaton supercharger, which produced and of torque at the flywheel on of boost. (Sport Compact Car magazine tested the car in the Feb. 2001 issue and dynoed and torque at the wheels.) The group put more than 1000 miles on the test track with the vehicle in under two weeks. In November 1999, the car was shown at the SEMA show with a glowing response. The vehicle was then shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2000, center stage on a turntable.http://www.caranddriver.com/news/dodge-neon-srt-an-honorary-import- auto-shows The team continued to work on the car, to try to bring it to the level of production vehicle, creating a second car using more production- oriented parts in an effort to lower the costs necessary to justify production. They even parked the second car in Gale's parking spot in order to get it noticed. Regardless, in fall of 2000, the executive committee rejected the production car proposal. The team put together a list of reasons why the car was not approved, and worked through the list item by item to find solutions to every issue presented. After three more versions of the car, the company's Specialty Vehicle Engineering (SVE) team took over the project. The executive committee once again considered the vehicle in the spring of 2001, and this time gave the go ahead for the project. In January 2002, SVE became known as Performance Vehicle Operations (PVO). The PVO group was responsible for developing the concept car into a production car. A turbocharged 2.4 liter inline-4 gasoline engine (A853 engine) was used. This engine was nearly identical to the 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser (A855 engine), except the SRT-4 did not have the unique intake manifold required to fit the engine into the PT Cruiser engine bay. The car was then given a New Venture Gear T-850 five-speed manual transmission (based on the unit from the European turbodiesel minivans), equal-length half shafts, and a high capacity Sachs performance clutch. The suspension had stiffer springs, SRT-tuned Tokico struts (with travel reduced to provide clearance for the larger wheels), and larger front and rear sway bars were added. A unique steering gear, PT Cruiser steering knuckles, and an updated K member were also incorporated. Front brakes used 11.0 in (280 mm) vented disc brakes with extra thick rotors to prevent warping, and 10.6 in (270 mm) non-vented disc brakes in the rear, with single piston calipers (57mm front, 36mm rear). 17 x 6 inch cast aluminum wheels were used, with an offset of 43mm, along with 205/50/17 Michelin Pilot Sport performance tires. The wheels were designed with a unique spoke pattern to allow for improved airflow to the brakes, and were similar to that of the TSW VX1 wheels used on the original 2000 Neon SRT. Unique side skirts, rear fascia, and a large rear wing (spoiler) were used to upgrade the exterior look of the vehicle. The cooling ducts (front nostrils) were added to the pre- production car in late 2002 on the front fascia to help reduce temperatures in the engine bay of the vehicle. On the interior, the standard agate-colored front seats were modeled after the Dodge Viper SRT-10 seats, and featured enhanced lumbar and lateral side bolsters to stabilize occupants during performance driving. In 2004, base Neon side airbag seats were added as an option. A faux carbon fiber steering wheel and shift boot were used, along with a satin silver “cue ball” type shift knob and silver aluminum floor pedals. Unique gauge designs in the SRT-4 (which were exclusive to the SRT lineup) featured special silver faces with satin silver ring accents, and the SRT-4 logo on the facing. The same satin metal trim was also featured on the instrument panel center stack, climate control knobs and on the door handles. A silver (white in early 2003 models) Auto-Meter brand turbo boost/vacuum gauge was set to the right of the instrument cluster. Like all other Neon models, the SRT-4 had power front windows, and manual rear windows, a costs saving feature. Overall, the vehicle's entire powertrain (engine and transmission), suspension, braking system, exhaust, wheels, and tires were upgraded from that of the base model Neon, along with the interior upgrades. The production model was produced in Belvidere, Illinois, with 84% US content. In 2003, the Dodge Neon SRT-4 went on sale to the public. At the time, the car was the second fastest stock production vehicle in the Chrysler/Dodge lineup, second only to the Viper. In 2004, PVO would changed their name to Street & Racing Technology (SRT), Chrysler's high-performance automotive group. The 2004 model was updated with more power and torque, and included a torque- sensing Quaife limited-slip differential, larger fuel injectors, new engine management software, BF Goodrich g-Force T/A KDW-2 three season ultra-high- performance tires, and paint/trim changes. Dodge removed the “Neon” designation from the vehicle in 2004, marketing the car simply as the “SRT-4”. In 2005, an American Club Racer (ACR) package and limited edition numbered Commemorative version of the SRT-4 were also offered. Initially, Dodge expected to sell a conservative number of only 2,500 units per year. However, during the three year production run (2003 through 2005), more than 25,000 Neon SRT-4s were produced. With the discontinuation of the PL platform after model year 2005, the SRT-4 ceased production. In 2008 Dodge introduced the Caliber SRT-4 as a replacement.

The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11 mm head bolts (vs 10 mm), an oil drain back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged connecting rods with cracked caps and 9 mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version (PT Cruiser GT Turbo and SRT-4) included: larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of Inconel, improved cooling and larger oil drain back passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different. The SRT-4 intercooler was a front-mounted cast aluminum 8-row unit produced by Valeo, unique in its efficiency and computer designed end tanks for air flow. The turbocharger was a reverse rotation Mitsubishi TD04LR-15Gk with a turbine inlet. Tight packaging forced some creative thinking on the turbocharger. The TD04 compressor has a compressor bypass valve built right into the compressor housing. The exhaust manifold and turbine housing were cast in one piece by Mitsubishi from high-nickel Ni-Resist steel. The one- piece design improved flow, reduced size and reduced thermal mass for quicker cat light-off. The turbine discharge was also part of the manifold/turbine housing casting, and it looped back around and hit the manifold again on its way to the catalytic converter. Where they met, there was a wastegate valve; keeping the wastegate valve away from the turbine housing improved flow where it mattered most. Maximum boost in stock form was around . Piston velocities and valve-train components force a rev limit of 6240 rpm although MOPAR upped the ante with their Stage 2 and 3 kits which have a rev limit of 6500 rpm. The exhaust system for the vehicle consists of steel tubing, which is run first through the catalytic converter, then through two resonators. The exhaust then splits into two separate sections of piping, exiting through two stainless steel tips at the rear of the vehicle. The exhaust system is unique in that there is no muffler, instead relying on the turbocharger and resonators to reduce the exhaust volume. The end result is a very distinctive and audible exhaust note.http://www.superstreetonline.com/cars/new-car- reviews/012scc-2003-dodge-srt-4/ { !colspan=2|Specifications |- !align=left|Block height: |align=right- !align=left|Displacement: |align=right- !align=left|Stroke: |align=right- !align=left|Bore: |align=right- !align=left|Rod length: |align=right- !align=left|Main journal diameter: |align=right- !align=left|Deck clearance: |align=right- !align=left|Combustion chamber volume: |align=right- !align=left|Head gasket thickness: |align=right- !align=left|Compression ratio: |align=right|8.1:1 |} ACR model This factory competition version included: *Wider 16×7-inch (410×180 mm) BBS RX racing wheels with offset *Wider 225/45/16 BFG KDW2 tires *Lowered ride height (Front: from spring seat lowering, additional through smaller diameter tire; Rear: from spring seat lowering, additional through smaller diameter tire) *5 position adjustable performance Tokico Illumina dampers.

This model (along with the Commemorative Edition versions of the Viper SRT-10 and Ram SRT-10) was created to celebrate the SRT vehicles. This limited, numbered version included: *\\"Electric Blue\\" painted \\"Viper\\" stripes over the \\"Stone White\\" colored body. *Blue stitching on the floor mats, shift boots, seats, and steering wheel. *Stainless steel \\"SRT-4\\" door sill plates. *A total of 200 Commemorative Edition SRT-4's were built. *A \\"XXX/200\\" numbered metal plaque, inset just ahead of the cup holders. *A Commemorative Edition booklet (same booklet included with the Commemorative Vipers and Ram SRT-10's). *No performance extras were added on the Commemorative Edition. 2003 SRT-4 Extreme LightWeight In 2003, Dodge engineers built a special SRT-4 Extreme LightWeight for the 2003 SEMA show. It was designed to showcase the factory upgrade parts available for the SRT-4 from Mopar. The vehicle featured lightweight, carbon fiber body pieces (produced in-house), a polycarbonate rear window, and the front window glass removed for weight reduction. The interior was stripped completely, with only the stock dash remaining. A single Recaro racing seat, a harness, and a roll cage were installed for safety. The car featured the first stage 3R Mopar engine performance kit and stage 3R coilovers. Overall, the weight of the vehicle was reduced by to wet, and was dyno'd at 360 hp (270 kW) and 383 lb•ft (519 N•m) (at the wheels) by Sport Compact Car magazine. On drag slicks, it ran an 11.83-second pass at 123 mph (198 km/h) in 70 °F (21 °C) weather. This one-off SRT-4 was used for media events and testing of the Mopar development parts, and was destroyed as an asset reduction move in 2009.

Racing In 2003, Cory O'Brien and Erich Heuschele drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 8th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America. In SCCA ProRally racing, the SRT-4 (and more recently the ACR version) has dominated the Group 5 (2WD) class since 2003. In just its first year competing, the Dodge ended the stranglehold that the FWD DSMs and Volkswagens had on the class. With three competing the following year, the SRT-4 won every 2004 series race and end-of-season award. The SRT-4 has won every Group 5 and 2-Wheel-Drive class championship in US ProRally and Sno Drift since 2003, and its unprecedented dominance in 2004 helped Dodge earn its first US ProRally Manufacturers Championship in 28 years. In 2005, Jeff Lepper drove the SRT-4 to its first ever national road racing win in the NASA US Touring Car Championship at California Speedway in Fontana. In 2005, Dale Seeley, Kolin Aspergren, and Jamin Cummings drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 8th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America. In 2006, the Dodge SRT-4 officially became the world's fastest production 4-cylinder car, averaging at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in a car driven by Jorgen Moller. The vehicle was vehicle was tuned by Dave Harris and Phil Hurst for Racedeck Racing. Robb Holland and Dan Aweida's SPEED World Challenge SRT-4s Multiple SRT-4s were raced in the SCCA SPEED World Challenge – Touring Car Series, and in 2006 – their second year of competition – had become one of the more successful platforms in the series. Robb Holland, of 3R Racing, became the first Pro driver to put the SRT-4 on the podium with his 3rd-place finish at Road America in August 2006. This was Dodge's first podium and first manufacturer's points in World Challenge Touring Car competition. Holland would finish the season with 3 top 10 finishes and two top 5 qualifying efforts in the SRT-4. In 2007, Doug Wind, Devin Clancy, and Ken Brewer drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 5th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America. In 2007, George Biskup drove SRT-4 (02) Factory Blue/White/Black to many SCCA T-2 National wins as well as set Track Qualifying Record at Road America (2:33.922 beating John Buttermore's CTSV by 0.031 sec, that record held for a few years). Back in April 2005, Biskup won the first SCCA National race entered with the (02) SRT-4 at Gingerman Raceway in the snow, as the race was run under yellow and finishing positions were as qualified, SRT-4 was on the pole. In 2007, Curt Simmons won the U.S. Touring Car Championship in an SRT-4 and Dodge won the season manufacturers points championship by 29 points over Honda behind the strength of several SRT-4's. In 2007, Stan Wilson won the Speed World Challenge Touring Car Rookie Driver of the Year and the Sunoco Hard Charger of the Year awards driving the Sorted Performance Dodge SRT-4. This was Dodge's first title in Speed World Challenge Touring Car. In 2008, Curt Simmons attempts to defend his USTCC series championship, winning on June 29, 2008 at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, CA. In 2012, Russ Deane set a new world land speed record for four-cylinder production cars (SRT-4) of more than . He surpassed the previous record of 224 mph for a Class F/PS vehicle. Deane and his Hinckley Automotive race team were participating in Speed Week at the Bonneville Speedway.

The Flammarion engraving, Paris 1888 The term night sky, usually associated with astronomy from Earth, refers to the nighttime appearance of celestial objects like stars, planets, and the Moon, which are visible in a clear sky between sunset and sunrise, when the Sun is below the horizon. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. Aurorae light up the skies above the polar circles. Occasionally, a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun or simply high levels of solar wind may extend the phenomenon toward the Equator. The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, farmers have used the status of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops. Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities. The anciently developed belief of astrology is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The scientific study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of observational astronomy. The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient brightness. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Optical filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and amateur astronomers seek locations far from urban skyglow.  Brightness  The Milky Way is brighter in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North. (Photo taken at La Silla Observatory) The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky. The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°. After sunset the civil twilight sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes the astronomical twilight defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness. Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely airglow, indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial light pollution.  Visual presentation  Paranal Observatory nights. The concept of noctcaelador tackles the aesthetic perception of the night sky. Depending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light . In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for stereopsis to offer any depth cues. Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the rod cells without triggering the cone cells. If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, averted vision may be helpful. The stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not. Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking. The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field. Because stargazing is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark adaptation is important to achieve and maintain. It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern. A red flashlight (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation. (See Purkinje effect). Video of the night sky taken with DSLR cameras in Japan. = Constellations = There are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many sky maps to aid stargazers in identifying constellations and other celestial objects. Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky. Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky. Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome. Orion is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations. The Big Dipper (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to Polaris, the north star. The pole stars are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year). = Planets = Planets, named for the Greek word for \\"wanderer,\\" process through the star field a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet's year or orbital period around solar system. Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets' surface or atmosphere. Thus the relative sun-planet-earth positions determine the planet's brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet's surface. Venus is the most prominent planet, often called the \\"morning star\\" or \\"evening star\\" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only \\"star\\" visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. Because of its brightness, Venus can sometimes be seen after sunrise. Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are also visible to the naked eye in the night sky. = The Moon = Earth's Moon is a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye. It spans, depending on its exact location, 29-33 arcminutes - which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified. Over 29.53 days on average, the moon goes through a full cycle of lunar phases. People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon. Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day. Some of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise. The moon on the horizon benefits from the moon illusion which makes it appear larger. The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red. = Comets = Comets come to the night sky only rarely. Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun. A comet with visible tail is quite unusual - a great comet appears about once a decade. They tend to be visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail. = Clouds= Clouds obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloudcover have differing effects. A very thin cirrus cloud in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon. Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect, and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility). Thicker cloudcover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down. Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution. = Other objects = The Milky Way contains billions of stars, arranged in two strikingly different structures: halo and disc. On clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, the Milky Way, a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen. The Magellanic Clouds of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth- based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as dwarf galaxies. Zodiacal light is a glow that appears near the points where the sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with interplanetary dust. Shortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial satellites often look like stars—similar in brightness and size—but move relatively quickly. Those that fly in low Earth orbit cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including space debris, appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. Satellite flares can appear brighter than Venus, with notable examples including the International Space Station (ISS) and Iridium Satellites. Meteors (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a meteor shower, they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky. Aircraft are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their navigation lights blink.

New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court in which the Court articulated the fighting words doctrine, a limitation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech..  Background  On April 6, 1940, Walter Chaplinsky, a Jehovah's Witness, was using the public sidewalk as a pulpit in downtown Rochester, passing out pamphlets and calling organized religion a \\"racket.\\" After a large crowd had begun blocking the roads and generally causing a scene, a police officer removed Chaplinsky to take him to police headquarters. Upon seeing the town marshal (who had returned to the scene after warning Chaplinsky earlier to keep it down and avoid causing a commotion), Chaplinsky attacked the marshal verbally. He was then arrested. The complaint against Chaplinsky stated that he shouted: \\"You are a God-damned racketeer\\" and \\"a damned Fascist\\". Chaplinsky admitted that he said the words charged in the complaint, with the exception of \\"God\\". For this, he was charged and convicted under a New Hampshire statute forbidding intentionally offensive speech directed at others in a public place. Under New Hampshire's Offensive Conduct law (chap. 378, para. 2 of the NH. Public Laws) it is illegal for anyone to address \\"any offensive, derisive or annoying word to anyone who is lawfully in any street or public place ... or to call him by an offensive or derisive name.\\" Chaplinsky appealed the fine he was assessed, claiming that the law was \\"vague\\" and that it infringed upon his First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech. = Alternate views = Some modern legal historians have disputed the generally accepted version of events that led to Chaplinsky's arrest. Columbia Law School professor Vincent Blasi's article on the topic describes the events thus: while preaching, Chaplinsky was surrounded by men who mocked Jehovah's Witnesses' objections to saluting the flag. One man attempted to hit Chaplinsky in full view of the town marshal, who warned Chaplinsky that he was in danger but did not arrest his assailant. After the marshal left, another man produced a flagpole and attempted to impale Chaplinsky; while Chaplinsky was pinned against a car by the pole, other members of the crowd struck him. A police officer arrived and, rather than dispersing the crowd, took Chaplinsky into custody. En route to the station, the officer, as well as members of the crowd, insulted Chaplinsky and his religion. Chaplinsky responded by calling the town marshal, who had returned to assist the officer, a \\"damn fascist and a racketeer\\" and was arrested for the use of offensive language in public.  Opinion of the Court  The Court, in a unanimous decision, upheld the arrest. Writing the decision for the Court, Justice Frank Murphy advanced a \\"two-tier theory\\" of the First Amendment. Certain \\"well-defined and narrowly limited\\" categories of speech fall outside the bounds of constitutional protection. Thus, \\"the lewd and obscene, the profane, the slanderous,\\" and (in this case) insulting or \\"fighting\\" words neither contributed to the expression of ideas nor possessed any \\"social value\\" in the search for truth.See Sullivan, Harold J. (2005). Civil Rights and Liberties: Provocative Questions and Evolving Answers. 2nd ed. N.J.: Prentice Hall, 2005 at 24. Murphy wrote: > There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the > prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any > constitutional problem.

Subsequent case law  Subsequent cases, in the Supreme Court, lower federal courts, and state courts have reached diverse conclusions on what constitute fighting words that are outside the protection of the First Amendment. The cases have also varied on what contexts - such as the reaction of hearers (public officials, police officers, ordinary citizens) - make a difference for the limits on protected speech. A particularly provocative example occurred in Cohen v. California (1971) in which an individual was criminally charged for wearing, in a courthouse, a jacket on which was written \\"Fuck the Draft.\\" The Supreme Court held that the Chaplinsky doctrine did not control this case, and overturned the conviction. The Court's opinion, by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, declared, \\"For while the particular four- letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is nevertheless often true that one man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric.\\" A legal scholar, writing in 2003 over 60 years after the Chaplinsky decision, has noted that lower courts \\"have reached maddeningly inconsistent results\\" on what is and is not protected by the First Amendment in the area of fighting words.

The term is commonly associated with the frontier areas of the American West in the mid-19th century, where groups attacked cattle rustlers and gangs, and people at gold mining claims. As non-state organizations no functioning checks existed to protect against excessive force or safeguard \\"due process\\" from the committees. In the years prior to the Civil War, some committees worked to free slaves and transport them to freedom. In the West In the western United States, both before and after the Civil War, the primary purpose of these committees was to maintain law and order and administer summary justice where governmental law enforcement was inadequate. In the newly settled areas, vigilance committees provided security, and mediated land disputes. In ranching areas, they ruled on ranch boundaries, registered brands, and protected cattle and horses. In the mining districts, they protected claims, settled claim disputes, and attempted to protect miners and other residents. In California, some residents formed vigilance committees to take control from officials whom they considered to be corrupt. This took place during the trial of Charles Cora (Husband of Belle Cora) and James Casey in San Francisco during 1856.\\"Eyewitness: San Francisco Committee of Vigilance - 1856.\\" Accessed February 26, 2017. http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist6/woolley.html.  Disbandment  Vigilance committees were generally abandoned when the conditions favoring their creation ceased to exist. In the west, as governmental jurisdiction increased to the degree that courts could dispense justice, residents abandoned the committees.  Nature  Vigilance committees, by their nature, lacked an outside set of checks and balances, leaving them open for excesses and abuse. In the West, the speed of the vigilance committees and lack of safeguards sometimes led to the innocent being hanged or to their just disappearing. A few committees were taken over by fraudulent individuals seeking profit or political office.

The Committee ran volunteer patrols of women to discourage, observe, and report on what was perceived as \\"immoral\\" behaviour of the town's women. In November 1916, the Committee issued a report \\"on the Moral Condition of Oxford,\\" warning that the town's streets were \\"crowded with young girls, whose dress [and] behaviour show that they are deliberately laying themselves out to attract men.\\" Their reports included detailed accounts of casual or adulterous sexual liaisons in the town.

One page, Octavo, Shortland, August 1, [1547-1549], to John Monynge [Monyn]. Scarce letter signed during Edward VI's reign regarding orders from the Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, the Duke of Somerset, uncle and Regent for the boy King. The letter announces the dispatch of letters by which the Duke directs that 270 “mariners” [sailors] be engages for the royal service, within the liberties of the Cinque Ports, to be at Gillingham by the 12th of the month. To Cheyne, this number seems excessive, because he has never raised more than 50 or 60 at a time, and there were evidently not enough ment at Sturbourne available. Monyn is directed to raise 60 men at the very least. He says that John Anthony can give him the names of some mariners available in Thanet, and Cheyne thinks that some can be found at Dover. Letters signed by known persons during this era are scarce, and this letter concerning behind-the-scenes conscription of men for the Royal Service is a fine example.

It is owned by Tom Baine, Jacksonville, FL (twbaine@gmail.com) Sir Thomas Cheney (or Cheyne) KG (c. 1485 – 16 December 1558) of the Blackfriars, City of London and Shurland, Isle of Sheppey, Kent,https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/cheyne- sir-thomas-148287-1558 was an English administrator and diplomat, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in South-East England from 1536 until his death. Early life Thomas Cheney, born about 1485, was the son of William Cheney (d.1487) of Shurland Hall near Eastchurch, in the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, Constable of Queenborough Castle and Sheriff of Kent in 1477, by his second wife, Margaret Young. Thomas Cheney's father, William, was the eldest surviving of eight sons and a daughter, and at his death in 1487 his property in Kent was inherited by Francis Cheney (d.1512), his son and heir by his first marriage, but was in the possession of Francis Cheney's uncle, John Cheyne, Baron Cheyne until the latter's death without issue in 1499. Baron Cheyne's heir, his brother, Robert Cheney, died without issue in 1503, at which time Francis Cheney 'wrongfully took possession of their lands in Berkshire and Kent which should by an earlier settlement have passed to John, the son of a younger brother Roger'. Francis Cheney died without issue in January 1512, and Thomas Cheney succeeded to his father William's lands; however the other properties wrongfully acquired by Francis Cheney were awarded in 1515 to his cousin, John son of Roger Cheyne (d. 1499) of West Woodhay, Berkshire. Cheyne, Sir Thomas (1482/87-1558), of the Blackfriars, London and Shurland, Isle of Sheppey, Kent, History of Parliament Retrieved 18 August 2013. Career Cheney was appointed Sheriff of Kent in 1515, and was Justice of the Peace for Kent from 1526 until his death. He was a favourite of Henry VIII's mistress, Anne Boleyn, and she fought Cardinal Wolsey for his promotion in 1528 and 1529. However, it was not until 1535–40 that Cheney consolidated his authority as one of the most powerful men in the south-east of England. From Henry VIII's coming to the throne of England in 1509, Cheney served as Lord Warden, spanning the reigns of all five of the Tudor monarchs. Cheney was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and served three times as an ambassador to France, under the authority of Henry VIII and Charles V of France, between 1549 and 1553. He was Treasurer of the Household from early 1530, and he is recorded as being present at over half of the Privy Council meetings held between 1540 and 1543. He represented Kent as a knight of the shire in every parliament from 1539 to 1558 with the single exception of the election in 1555. \\"Cheyne was among those councillors entrusted with the government of the realm during Somerset's Scottish campaign of 1547.\\" \\"He was among those who sanctioned Gardiner's imprisonment in June 1548, and he was involved in the interrogation of Sir Thomas Seymour in 1549.\\" In 1550, he became a privy counsellor and owner of the Manor of Ospringe (in the parish of Faversham). Thomas Cheyne opposed the plan to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, and although he acquiesced with Northumberland's policy, he pledged his support for Mary I as soon as he felt it safe so to do. So fickle a courtier was he that the Marian Court privately distrusted his loyalty during the outbreak of a rebellion represented for Kent by his 'friend and neighbour' Sir Thomas Wyatt in the attack on London in 1554, but the very fact that he sent men against Northumberland indicates something of his position. Cheney was initially distrusted by Mary, as she confessed to the imperial(?) ambassador, his 'early show of support' proving shrewd as Cheney retained his position as 'Treasurer of the Household' whilst other household officers were replaced. As the Constable of Saltwood Castle (near Hythe), Queenborough Castle (in Sheppey), Rochester Castle and Dover Castle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Lord Lieutenant of Kent (1551–3), Thomas Cheney was much 'involved with musters and coastal defence'. Sir Thomas Cheyne was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports on 17 May 1536 and appears to have been deprived of the office soon after Edward VI's accession, but was granted it back to him the following April. Conspicuously in April 1545 Cheney suffered a bout of illness, and was temporarily replaced in his duties as the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports by Sir Thomas Seymour, Hertford's brother. For the next 4 months Cheney delegated his responsibilities in the Cinque Ports and Kent to Seymour. Cheney died 16 December 1558 at the Tower of London, and was buried on 3 January 1559 in St Katherine's chapel of Minster Abbey on the Isle of Sheppey. He was survived by his son, Henry, and three daughters, Anne, Frances and Katherine. His will and the elaborate proceedings at his funeral were entirely consistent with the orthodox Catholicism of the period, showing him to have been conservative. In his will dated 6 December 1558, Cheney mentioned various properties which together gave him an annual rent of over £950, and after his death it was estimated that he maintained between 200-300 servants and retainers.

From the 1965 to 1975 model years the name was on intermediate- sized models. A coronet is a small crown consisting of ornaments fixed on a metal ring. First generation (1949–1952) 1949 Dodge Coronet station wagon =1949= The Dodge Coronet was introduced with the division's first postwar body styles. Lower trim lines were the Wayfarer and Meadowbrook, with the Wayfarer being built on a shorter 115 inch wheelbase. The only engine for Dodge was a flat-head straight six cylinder engine with a single barrel Stromberg carburetor, producing (gross). The stock Dodge Coronet was a smooth running car, and the six-cylinder engine could power the car to + . A limited production model was a four-door, eight-passenger limousine, an extended version of the stock Dodge Coronet. One of the most notable features of the first-generation Coronet was a three-speed, fluid-driven transmission that was operated by a foot pedal on the floor. It required no shifter.

The 1950 models can be identified easily by the new grille design which featured 3 heavy horizontal bars. The upper and lower bars formed a stylish oblong shape. Within this oblong grille was a thick center bar with parking lights on each end and a large chrome plaque in the center bearing the Dodge crest. The 8-passenger sedan's length was 216.8 inches. =1951–1952= 1951 Dodge Coronet Club Coupe 1952 Dodge Coronet Club Coupe Dodge received yet another facelift in 1951 but this time the cars remained virtually unchanged for two model years. Busy manufacturing military vehicles for use in Korea, they chose not to dedicate valuable resources to completely redesign civilian vehicles. Still divided into Wayfarer, Meadowbrook and Coronet lines through 1952, by 1953 the Wayfarer line had been discontinued. The grille of the 1951 model was similar in shape to the 1950 grille, but with the elimination of the thick vertical center bar and the addition of six vents running horizontally between the top and center bars, a whole new look was achieved. The Coronet Diplomat was Dodge's first hardtop-convertible, featuring a pillarless steel roof styled after the contemporary Chrysler Newport. The speedometer was now circular, and the other four gauges were rectangles. For 1952 the Coronet had a painted lower grille louver. Second generation (1953–1954) =1953= 1953 Dodge Coronet Sierra 2-door wagon For 1953, the Coronet was totally redesigned. It gained an optional \\"Red Ram\\" Hemi Engine and set over 100 land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats.https://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/coronet.html The windshield finally became one-piece. Electric windshield wipers were standard, while the radio cost $83. =1954= The Dodge Royal line was added above the Coronet in 1954. Dodge was putting more luxury into all of its models which included the Meadowbrook, Coronet and new Royal lines. Still, styling changes for 1954 were modest. The chrome molding on the hood lip was wider than on the 1953 models and a large chrome upright in the center of the grille replaced the five vertical dividers used previously. It still came with full instrumentation. 1954 saw Chrysler's first fully automatic transmission, two-speed PowerFlite, offered as an extra-cost option on all Dodges. Third generation (1955–1956) :See also 1955 Dodge 1956 Dodge Coronet 4-door sedan 1956 Dodge Coronet coupe The 1955 Coronet dropped to the lower end of the Dodge vehicle lineup, with the Wayfarer and Meadowbrook names no longer used and the Custom Royal added above the Royal, Lancer, and La Femme. Bodies were restyled with help from newly hired Virgil Exner to be lower, wider, and longer than the lumpy prewar style, which in turn generated a healthy boost in sales over 1954. Power came from either a Chrysler Flathead engine straight-6, now producing Two V8 engines were offered: Polyspheric (poly or semi-hemi) heads producing and a (the \\"Hemi\\") Power windows were new.

A number of trim lines were available: *2- or 4-door station wagon — The Coronet wagon used the Suburban name and had the V8 or six *hardtop coupé — The V8 Coronet Lancer *2- or 4-door sedan — V8 or Six *2-door sedan — V8 or Six *4-door, eight-passenger limousine 1956 (:See also Plymouth Fury) was the last year of this body style before the change in 1957, the only differences offered in 1956 from the previous year were trim packages and the new Dodge D-500. The D-500 was the first Dodge factory high performance made in honor of the (D-500-1) \\"Super Stock\\" model with the only external clues being discreet crossed checkered flags and \\"500\\" lettering on its hood and lower rear deck it was also available for order from the dealer on Coronet models, including station wagons and two-door sedans. The standard D-500 trim included a V8 with hemispherical heads (unlike other Dodge V8s ( List of Chrysler engines) which used Polyspheric heads), a unique camshaft, valve lifters, pushrods, carburetor, ignition, and pistons. With a compression ratio of 9.25:1, four-barrel Carter WCFB carburetor, and dual-point distribution, peak horsepower was while torque was a solid . The D-500 also received an upgraded suspension with stiff front coil springs; heavy duty Oriflow shock absorbers, with the same valving specified for Dodge police cars, were mounted in the springs. Similar units were used in the rear. Overall height of the D-500 was lower than its standard Dodge counterpart. The D-500 came standard with 15x5.5 inch wheels with 7.60x15 inch tubeless tires. New for safety were safety door locks. The D-500-1 (the first 500 made required by NASCAR, was intended for NASCAR competition. The D-500-1 had an even stiffer suspension than the D-500. Under the hood, the engine received larger valves (about 18% larger), a full-race camshaft, and a double log intake manifold that used two four-barrel Carter WCFB carburetors and a shaved deck for 8.25:1 compression. This all added up to . It was the fastest car that year from the factory. Fourth generation (1957–1959) 1958 Dodge Coronet sedan 1959 Dodge Coronet 4-Door Sedan The 1957 model year debuted a new D-501, which replaced the D-500 from the year before as the top Coronet. The D-501 received Chrysler's proven Hemi V8, which were actually leftover engines from the 1956 Chrysler 300B production. Camshafts from the 1957 Chrysler engines were installed in the V8s. A pair of Carter four-barrel carburetors fed the 10.0:1 compression ratio to produce . Other changes included the addition of the Torsion-Aire Ride (torsion bar) front suspension and a heavy-duty suspension with heavy-duty shock absorbers and a heavy-duty leaf-sprung rear. A 3.73:1 rear axle was standard with the three-speed manual transmission, but automatic cars received a 3.18:1 rear axle. There were 13 optional rear axles available, ranging from 2.92:1 through 6.17:1. The D-501 received 7.60x15 tires on 15x8-inch wheels. Brakes were diameter drums. Only 101 D-501s were produced. A padded dash was optional. In the September 1957 issue of Popular Mechanics, owners of both the Coronet six-cylinder and eight- cylinder were surveyed. Many people (37.6% of I6 owners and 34.8% of V8 owners) complained that there were too many water leaks. When PM tested a V8 Coronet for water resistance, water got into the engine and pooled in \\"two spark plug wells\\" which had to be siphoned out before the engine could run with all cylinders again. However, many did like the exterior styling and the ride comfort. 0-60mph on 90 octane gasoline was 12.3 seconds. The 1958 and 1959 Coronet, Royal, and Custom Royal used a DeSoto Fireflite chassis but had less ornate trim. Power came from the \\"Getaway\\" L-head straight-6 or the \\"Red Ram\\" V8. In 1959 a Silver Challenger model was also offered on the Coronet line. This was a six-cylinder or V-8 model available only in silver paint and only on a two-door body. It came with many extra features at no cost, such as wall-to-wall deep pile carpeting, premium white wall tires and wheel covers, luxury fabrics and upgraded interior and electric windshield wipers. The overall length was increased to 217.4 inches. The Dodge Custom Royal was also assembled by Chrysler Australia from early 1958 to 1960. A Dodge Coronet was the only known example of the JATO Rocket Car legend. To publicize Dodge's 'total contact' front dual-leading shoe drum brakes a JATO unit was fitted to a 1958 Coronet and driven at speed across the El Mirage dry lake. A TV advertisement was broadcast during Dodge-sponsored Lawrence Welk Show., segment begins at 30:00 =1959 Dodge Silver Challenger= The first car that carried the Challenger name was introduced as the limited edition Dodge Silver Challenger Club Sedan, an addition to the 1959 full-sized Dodge Coronet (fourth generation) model line produced in Detroit, Michigan. The Silver Challenger came only in silver paint and exclusively on Chrysler's long two- door, on a wheelbase. It was available with either the \\"Getaway\\" L-head straight-six engine for $2,297, or the \\"Red Ram\\" V8 for $2,408. This car was marketed for the spring selling season to \\"new-car buyers who've been waiting to get the most for the least.\\" A column-shifted three-speed manual transmission was standard and an automatic was optional. The 1959 Silver Challenger was marketed with extra features at no extra cost. These included premium white wall tires, full wheel covers, electric windshield wipers, as well as an upgraded interior with silver metallic vinyl and black \\"Manchu\\" fabric upholstery, dual arm rests and sun visors, as well as deep pile wall- to-wall carpeting. Fifth generation (1965–1970) =1965–1967= The Coronet reappeared for the 1965 model year as the intermediate sized B-body using a 117-inch wheelbase, continuing what had been the Dodge Polara, which was once again full-size. For 1965, Dodge sold slightly over 209,000 units, making the Coronet the most popular model sold by Dodge that year. Trim levels initially were base Coronet including a Deluxe version, Coronet 440, and Coronet 500. The base Coronet and Deluxe were available as two-door sedans, four-door sedans, and station wagons. For 1965 only, Dodge also sold 101 units of a modified wheelbase version of the base Coronet two-door sedans and 440 hardtops specifically for NHRA drag racing. The model known as A990 came with a racing version of the Hemi engine. The car A990 was stripped of all features and included lightweight base bucket seats from Dodge's A100 truck/van line of vehicles. These altered wheelbase vehicles eventually became popularly known as \\"funny cars\\" due to their unique wheel spacing. The front and rear axles were moved forward significantly from the stock location, putting the front wheels directly behind the front fender, and the rear wheels almost under where the rear seat would normally go; this alteration transferred weight to the rear tires, increasing traction on launch. From the popular term \\"funny cars\\" was born an entire genre of racing vehicles, which exists to this day (albeit in much transformed form). Front seat belts and padded dash were standard. The middle of the Coronet line-up was the 440 and was available as a two-door hardtop, convertible, or station wagon. The 440 designation did not indicate engine displacement as commonly assumed (both then and now, which helped sales to an extent). The nomenclature was a carryover theme from the 1963–64 Polara series. The top of the Coronet line-up was the Coronet 500 and was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible in 1965. Slightly over 33,300 units were sold in 1965 and included as standard, a V8 engine (273 cubic inches), exterior trim and badging, bucket seats, padded dash, and chrome floor console. Coronets were manufactured at Chrysler's Los Angeles assembly plant and at Lynch Road assembly plant in Detroit and ST. Louis plant in Missouri. Engines offered for 1965 included the base 225 Slant-Six, 273, 318 (Polyhead), 361 (the last year for this big block engine was 1966), 383, and 426 in multiple HP choices ( the 383 came in a special version rated at 330 HP). Sales brochures list the 413 (its last year offered) as available, but no records exist of this engine, commonly used in Imperials, being installed in Coronets for 1965.Collectible Automobile, April 2010 A tachometer was optional. In 1966 a four-door Coronet 500 was added, called the Coronet 500 SE (Special Edition). It had special \\"SE\\" logos on the C-pillars and on the seatback. There would be no Coronet 500 wagon until 1968. Coronet received a redesign in 1966, and a facelift in 1967. Trim levels initially were base Coronet, Coronet 440, and Coronet 500. In 1966, the Coronet Deluxe was introduced, fitting between the base Coronet and the Coronet 440. The Coronet R/T was introduced in 1967. The Coronet R/T was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible. The standard engine was Chrysler's largest, the V8 producing 375 bhp and dubbed the Magnum. The only engine option was the 426-cid Hemi, now in its second year in \\"Street\\" trim and again rated at 425 bhp. It was a $908 option. Transmission choices were Mopar's excellent heavy- duty three-speed TorqueFlite automatic or a four-speed manual. When the 426ci Hemi was made available to the general public for the 1966 model year, it could be ordered in any Coronet model or trim level. No Hemi-powered Coronet wagons have been verified, but a few Coronet Deluxe four-door sedans are known to exist. A total of 136 Coronet 500 Street Hemis were built for 1966.Hot Rod, 7/90, p. 93. Beginning in 1967, Chrysler decided that the Hemi should be available only in their badged muscle cars: the Dodge Charger and Coronet R/T and the Plymouth Belvedere GTX. The top engine option for the rest of the Coronet line was supposed to be the 383-ci, 4-barrel V8. Despite this, some Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet Deluxe two-door sedans were produced. There is also one Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet 440 two-door hardtop known, and One Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet 500 two-door hardtop known, which is not among the 55 WO23 Super Stock cars produced for Dodge drag racers. =1968–1970= The Coronet and similar Plymouth Belvedere received complete redesigns in 1968, as did the Dodge Charger, which shared the B-body platform. There was a mild facelift in 1970. Trim levels initially included the base Coronet, Coronet Deluxe, Coronet 440, Coronet 500, and Coronet R/T. The Coronet Super Bee was introduced in early 1968 as a companion to the Plymouth Road Runner. In keeping with Dodge's position as a step above Plymouth, the Super Bee shared the Charger's Rallye instrument cluster and the Coronet 440's rear finish panel. As in 1967, the 440ci RB V8 was only available in the Coronet R/T in 1968. The 426ci Hemi V8 was supposed to be limited to the R/T and Super Bee, but two 1968 Coronet 440s are known to have been built with this engine. In mid-1969, the A12 package was introduced on the Super Bee. It included a version of the 440 with three 2bbl Holley carburetors on an aluminum intake manifold, a black fiberglass lift-off hood secured with metal pins, heavy-duty suspension, and 15-inch steel wheels with no hubcaps or wheel covers. The hood had an integrated forward-facing scoop which sealed to the air cleaner assembly and bore a decal on each side with the words \\"SIX PACK\\" in red letters, \\"Six Pack\\" being the name used for the 6-bbl induction setup when installed on a Dodge (Plymouth went with \\"440 6bbl\\" on the A12 Road Runners). The A12 Super Bee could be had with most Super Bee options, with the exception of air conditioning and tire- wheel packages. The A12 option was a 1969-only package, but the 440 6bbl returned in 1970 as an optional engine on both the Super Bee and the Coronet R/T. The base Coronet and Deluxe were available as 2-door coupes, 4-door sedans, or station wagons. The base Coronet was dropped in 1969, leaving the Deluxe as the lowest trim level through 1970. The Coronet 440 convertible was dropped for 1968, but a 2-door coupe was added along with the 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and station wagon. This would remain the lineup through 1970. Coronet 500 retained its 2-door hardtop, convertible and 4-door sedan through 1970. A Coronet 500 station wagon made its debut in 1968, continuing through 1970. Simulated woodgrain trim was standard on the Coronet 500 wagon. The Coronet R/T 2-door hardtop and convertible continued through 1970. The Super Bee was available as a 2-door coupe or 2-door hardtop. Chrysler did display a convertible with Super Bee stripes at car shows in 1968, but never offered it as a production model. Some enthusiasts have created \\"phantom\\" Super Bee convertibles by adding the appropriate trim and stripes to Coronet 500 convertibles. The Dodge Super Bee was a limited-production muscle car from 1968–1971. The original Super Bee was based on the Dodge Coronet, a 2-door model and was produced from 1968–1970. It was Dodge’s low-priced muscle car, the equivalent to Plymouth Road Runner, and was priced at $3,027. Available with the Hemi engine, this option increased the price by 33% thus 125 models were sold with this engine option. The Super Bee included a heavy-duty suspension, an optional Mopar A-833 four-speed manual transmission, with high- performance tires, and a stripe (with the bee logo) wrapped around the tail. The name \\"Super Bee\\" was derived from the \\"B\\" Body designation given Chrysler's mid-size cars which included the Coronet. A “six-pack” (three two- barrel carburetors) version of the 440 engine was added to the list mid-year. This engine was between the standard engine and the Hemi as a $463 option. The 1969 model year gave customers several engines to choose from, the base 383 hp (high performance), 440 six-pack, and the 426 Hemi V8. The 440 Magnum (4bbl) was not available as an option, it was reserved for the Coronet R/T. In 1970, the Super Bee was given a different front end look that consisted of a dual ovaled grill that was referred to as “bumble bee wings”. Despite the new looks, the engines, as well as the \\"ramcharger\\" hood (that carried over from 1969 model), sales plummeted for the 1970 model. In 1970, Dodge also produced four Super Bee convertibles; the whereabouts of the four cars are unknown.

It was offered as a sedan and wagon, the related and also restyled Dodge Charger covering the coupe market. Slight alterations of the front grille, headlights, and taillights followed in 1972. Sales of the Coronet were low from this point onwards, with around 80–90,000 produced each year through 1973 (compared with 196,242 as recently as 1968), due both to the fuel crisis and to a proliferation of Dodge and Plymouth models, and the growing effect of overlap with the other Chrysler Corporation brands. In addition to the usual changes to the grille, lights, and interior, Dodge introduced its \\"TorsionQuiet\\" system of additional silencers and rubber vibration insulators, providing a much smoother ride and a quieter interior. The front and rear fascias were redesigned, most notably the rear bumper, which met the 1974 DOT requirements. The sedan body style would be the basis of the later Coronets (and its twin, the Plymouth Fury) until the 1978 model year. 1972 Dodge Coronet (14382603851).jpg|1972 Dodge Coronet Custom sedan 73coronetcustom.jpg|1973 Dodge Coronet Custom sedan File:Mopar National img 0006 (35014322711).jpg|1974 Dodge Coronet Custom 4-Door Sedan Seventh generation (1975–1976) =1975= 1975 Dodge Coronet Crestwood wagon For 1975 the Coronet received a refreshed squarer-appearing body as well as a new front fascia with two round dual-beam headlights shared with its Plymouth Fury stablemate. After a four model year absence, a Dodge Coronet 2-door returned for 1975. =1976= 1976 was the final model year for the Dodge Coronet and its body style choices reduced to the four-door wagon and the four-door sedan. The former Dodge Coronet 2-door model was replaced by the Dodge Charger Sport 2-door model, which, was marketed for the 1976 model year. For the 1977 model year, the mid-size Dodge Coronet was renamed Monaco. Likewise, full-size Dodge Monaco was renamed the Dodge Royal Monaco for 1977. Eighth generation (1980s) Dodge Coronet was used as a name for the Colombian-market Dodge Diplomat. References ;Notes ;Bibliography  *  External links  * Quatro Rodas.

Kelsey enlisted in the New Model Army and fought on the side of Parliament during the English Civil War, displaying a zeal that led him to become a major-general in 1645. He became a lieutenant-colonel in Colonel Ingoldsby's regiment from 1646. After the war he was elected as Deputy-Governor of Oxford, and in 1651 he was further appointed a lieutenant of Dover Castle. As a member of the 'fifth Monarchist congregation' in London, led by John Simpson, during the early 1650s, he supported Oliver Cromwell in the establishment of the Protectorate and was elected MP for Sandwich in Kent for the First Protectorate Parliament, and was appointed the Major-General for Surrey and Kent during the Rule of the Major-Generals. Thomas Kelsey was returned for Dover during the Second Protectorate Parliament, when he supported John Desborough's move to establish the Major-Generals as a permanent form of government. After the collapse of the Protectorate in 1659, Thomas Kelsey supported John Lambert's attempts to resist the Restoration. Major-General Kelsey was deprived of his commands under the recalled Rump Parliament (Jan 1660), and was ordered to leave London. With the return of King Charles II in May 1660, Kelsey felt safer removing himself to the Netherlands, but with others including John Desborough was instructed to return to England in 1666. Thereafter little more is known of his life, except that it has been suggested he turned his skills to becoming a brewer, and that he died around 1680.

Rather than simply being versions of contemporary romance stories transported to a historical setting, Regency romances are a distinct genre with their own plot and stylistic conventions. These derive not so much from the 19th-century contemporary works of Jane Austen, but rather from Georgette Heyer, who wrote over two dozen novels set in the Regency starting in 1935 until her death in 1974, and from the fiction genre known as the novel of manners. In particular, the more traditional Regencies feature a great deal of intelligent, fast-paced dialogue between the protagonists and very little explicit sex or discussion of sex. Subgenres Many readers and writers of Regency romance make a distinction between \\"Traditional Regency Romance\\" and \\"Regency Historical\\". Many authors have started by writing Traditionals and subsequently written Historicals, including Mary Balogh, Jo Beverley, Loretta Chase, and Mary Jo Putney. =Traditional Regency romance= The distinction rests on the genre definition of Regency Romance: works in the tradition of Georgette Heyer, with an emphasis on the primary romance plot, are considered traditional. Traditional Regency Romance writers usually pay close attention to historical detail, as their readers are notorious for noting errors, and the writers often do extensive research so they can clearly understand and replicate the voice of the genre. After Heyer's novels became popular in the United States in the 1960s, many publishers began publishing other Regency-set books by new authors, including Clare Darcy and Elizabeth Mansfield. Signet, Dell, and Fawcett were among those publishing Traditional Regencies in paperback; the latter eventually began a special imprint, Fawcett Coventry, which published Regencies and romances from other historical periods. =Regency Historical romance= The Regency-set books written by authors such as Christina Dodd, Eloisa James, and Amanda Quick are generally considered to be Regency Historical works. Regency romances which may include more social realism, or, conversely, anachronistically modern characterization, might be classed by some as \\"Regency Historical\\", signifying that their general setting is in Regency England, but the plot, characterization, or prose style of the work extends beyond the genre formula of the Regency romances published by Heyer and her successors. Characters may behave according to modern values, rather than Regency values. The sensual Regency historical romance has been made popular in recent years by Mary Balogh, Jo Beverley, Loretta Chase, Lisa Kleypas, Stephanie Laurens, and Julia Quinn. These novels are much more explicit than the Traditional Regency works and include many more love scenes. Common elements Many Regency romance novels include the following: * References to the ton (le bon ton) * Depictions of social activities common during the social season such as carriage rides, morning calls, dinner parties, routs, plays, operas, assemblies, balls, etc. * References to, or descriptions of, athletic activities engaged in by fashionable young men of the period, including riding, driving, boxing, fencing, hunting, shooting, etc. * Differences of social class * Marriages of convenience: a marriage based on love was rarely an option for most women in the British Regency, as securing a steady and sufficient income was the first consideration for both the woman and her family. * False engagements * Cyprians (sex workers), demireps (women of ill repute), mistresses and other women employed by rakehells and men from the upper classes * Mistaken identity, deliberate or otherwise * Mystery or farce elements in the plot Popularity of the genre Like other fiction genres and subgenres, Regencies experience cyclic popularity swings. The readership waned during the 1990s with the rise of historical romances (and the switch of many Regency writers to the historical genre). In the early 2000s, both Regencies and other historical romances lost popularity in favor of contemporary settings. The market in the United States was hurt by changes in distributing and retailing romances. The last two major U.S. publishers to produce the shorter \\"traditional\\" Regencies regularly were Zebra and Signet. This ended in 2005, when Zebra stopped their traditional Regency line, and early 2006, when Signet ended its Regencies. There are some new \\"traditional\\" Regencies still published in the United States; some of the few publishers that still do so are Avalon Books, Five Star Books, and Cerridwen Press (Cotillion). Previously published Regencies are also available through the second-hand book market, via Belgrave House (which publishes out- of-print books), and as e-book reprints. The Regency subgenre changed somewhat during the 1990s and 2000s, when authors began incorporating more sex into their novels, under pressure from a changing reader base. While some long-time readers balked, publishers viewed the inclusion of sex scenes as a means of keeping the subgenre afloat. The goal was to appeal to a new generation of readers while still delivering the witty and clever plotlines loyal readers love. Regency romance authors such as Sandra Heath, Anita Mills, and Mary Balogh were the first to write about sexual relationships between the hero and heroine (or more rarely, between the hero and his mistress). Not all Regency romance novels are frothy period pieces. Such authors as Balogh, Carla Kelly, Sheila Bishop, and Mary Jo Putney all depict the underbelly of Regency society, exploring a variety of social ills in their novels. Some authors feature seriously troubled heroes and heroines, who suffer from post-battle trauma, alcoholism, depression, and the like.Laurie Gold. \\"At the Back Fence\\" Issue 205, 1 August 2005.

The land was purchased by Manchester Corporation in 1900 and laid out with walks, lawns and flower beds. Known as Whitworth Gardens, it was planned to complement the Municipal College of Technology's Sackville Street Building. It is regularly used for events, such as Village People and Manchester Pride, and it is used as the meeting point each morning for Free Manchester Walking Tours.  Turing memorial  Alan Turing memorial statue The park contains the Alan Turing memorial statue, which depicts the \\"father of modern computing\\" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. The park was chosen because, \\"It's got the university science buildings ... on one side and its got all the gay bars on the other side, where apparently he spent most of his evenings\\". see The statue was unveiled on 23 June, Turing's birthday, in 2001. It was conceived by Richard Humphry, a barrister from Stockport, who set up the Alan Turing Memorial Fund in order to raise the necessary funds. Humphry had come up with the idea of a statue after seeing Hugh Whitemore's play Breaking the Code starring the actor Sir Derek Jacobi, and Jacobi became the patron of the fund. Glyn Hughes, an industrial sculptor from Adlington near Westhoughton, was commissioned to sculpt the statue. The Fund eventually raised around £15,000, which was far short of the £50,000 needed to have the statue cast in Britain. No major computer company donated to the fund, which was, according to the sculptor, because Turing was not American. The statue was cast in China. Turing memorial statue plaque Turing is shown holding an apple—a symbol classically used to represent forbidden love, as well as being the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the object that inspired Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation, and the means of Turing's own death. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912-1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it would appear if encoded by an Enigma machine: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'. A plinth at the statue's feet says 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a Bertrand Russell quotation saying 'Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.' The sculptor buried his old Amstrad computer, which was an early popular home computer, under the plinth, as a tribute to \\"the godfather of all modern computers\\". see .  Beacon of Hope  The park also contains the Beacon of Hope, the UK's only permanent memorial for people living with HIV or AIDS and lives lost to it. The sculpture, a decorated steel column designed by Warren Chapman and Jess Boyn- Daniel, was erected in the year 2000. On World AIDS Day a candlelight vigil generally takes place at the Beacon. For several years the vigil, the traditional closing event of the Manchester Pride LBGT celebration weekend, had been held at the city's Castlefield Arena, but because of the siting of the beacon, it was decided that the vigil should be held in the gardens. Following a highly successful event in 2002, organised by the Village Business Association, George House Trust took control of the vigil for Europride in 2003, in collaboration with Manchester City Council and local HIV/AIDS groups such as Body Positive North West, the Lesbian and Gay Foundation and the Black Health Agency.

The western Alps (in France) are inhabited by a similar species, Lanza's alpine salamander (Salamandra lanzai), in only one small area. No differences in length are seen between the sexes () and the sex ratio is 1:1. Their life expectancy is at least 10 years. Unlike other salamanders, whose larvae are developed in water, the alpine salamander is a fully terrestrial species. Capture-recapture methods suggest that the species is very stationary; was the maximum observed distance travelled by one individual during the summer season. About 120 individuals per hectare were counted in most suitable areas with >2000 individuals/ha also observed, suggesting that this rather cryptic species is quite abundant.Bonato, Fracasso.

Description  Total length up to 144 mm for males, up to 151 mm for females. Slightly elongated head, with two large kidney-shaped paratoid glands. The body has 11-13 costal grooves on either side. The tail is square in cross-section. One double row of poison glands runs down the center of the back. One single row of poison glands runs along either side of the body onto the tail. Usually black or brown-black, but the subspecies Salamandra atra aurorae has a bright coloration on the head, back, and dorsal side of the extremities. This coloration can consist of continuous patches or be spotted or blotched. It can vary in color from whitish or yellow to greenish or gray. Males have a slightly more pronounced cloaca than females. Subspecies *S. a. atra is a fully melanistic (black) subspecies from central, eastern and Dinaric Alps. *S. a. aurorae, the golden alpine salamander, has golden or yellow spots on its back and lives in a small area in the Venetian Prealps near Asiago. *S. a. pasubiensis, with less yellow spots than S. a. aurorae, lives in a different part of the Venetian Prealps. *S. a. prenjensis lives on Prenj Mountain, part of the Dinaric Alps in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The validity of this subspecies is yet to be confirmed.Bonato & Steinfartz. Evolution of the melanistic color in the Alpine salamander Salamandra atra as revealed by a new subspecies from the Venetian prealps. Italian Journal of Zoology 2001, 72, 253-260. Genetic analysis suggests that the Corsican fire salamander (Salamandra corsica) is the closest related species, and the black-yellow coloration is an ancestral feature of alpine salamanders. Proposed colonization from south (Prealps) to Alps was carried out by the fully melanistic (derived feature) S. a. atra after the last retreat of the ice sheets. S. a. aurorae (Golden alpine salamander) Reproduction Mating occurs on land, the male clasping the female at the fore legs, and the fertilization is internal. S. atra is a viviparous amphibian, giving birth to two live young, or rarely three or four. They may measure as long as at birth, with the female measuring only . The uterine eggs are large and numerous, but, as a rule, only one fully develops in each uterus, the embryo being nourished on the yolk of the other eggs, which more or less dissolve to form a large mass of nutrient matter. The embryo passes through three stages: #still enclosed within the egg and living on its own yolk #free, within the vitelline mass, which is directly swallowed by the mouth #with no more vitelline mass, the embryo is possessed of long external gills, which serve as an exchange of nutritive fluid through the maternal uterus, these gills functioning in the same way as the chorionic villi of the mammalian egg Generally, at altitudes of 650-1,000 m above sea level, a pregnancy lasts two years, and at altitudes of 1,400-1,700 m, the pregnancy lasts around three years (1,140 days).

She co-founded Paredon Records with Irwin Silber. \\"Bessie Smith in stereo,\\" wrote jazz critic Leonard Feather in the late 1950s. Time wrote of Dane: \\"The voice is pure, rich ... rare as a 20 carat diamond\\" and quoted Louis Armstrong's exclamation upon hearing her at the Pasadena jazz festival: \\"Did you get that chick? She's a gasser!\\" On the occasion of her 85th birthday, The Boston Globe music critic James Reed called her \\"one of the true unsung heroes of American music.\\" Early life Barbara Dane's parents arrived in Detroit from Arkansas in the 1920s. Out of high school, Dane began to sing regularly at demonstrations for racial equality and economic justice. While still in her teens, she sat in with bands around town and won the interest of local music promoters. She got an offer to tour with Alvino Rey's band, but she turned it down in favor of singing at factory gates and in union halls. Career as singer To Ebony, she seemed \\"startlingly blonde, especially when that powerful dusky alto voice begins to moan of trouble, two-timing men and freedom ... with stubborn determination, enthusiasm and a basic love for the underdog, [she is] making a name for herself ... aided and abetted by some of the oldest names in jazz who helped give birth to the blues.\\" The seven-page article was filled with photos of Dane working with Memphis Slim, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Clara Ward, Mama Yancey, Little Brother Montgomery and others. By 1959, Louis Armstrong had asked Time magazine readers: \\"Did you get that chick? She's a gasser!\\" and invited her to appear with him on national television. She appeared with Armstrong on the Timex All-Star Jazz Show hosted by Jackie Gleason on January 7, 1959. She toured the East Coast with Jack Teagarden, appeared in Chicago with Art Hodes, Roosevelt Sykes, Little Brother Montgomery, Memphis Slim, Otis Spann, Willie Dixon and others, played New York with Wilbur De Paris and his band, and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson as a solo guest artist. Other national TV work included The Steve Allen Show, Bobby Troup's Stars of Jazz, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. In 1961, the singer opened her own club, Sugar Hill: Home of the Blues, on San Francisco's Broadway in the North Beach district, with the idea of creating a venue for the blues in a tourist district where a wider audience could hear it. There Dane performed regularly with her two most constant musical companions: Kenny \\"Good News\\" Whitson on piano and cornet and Wellman Braud, former Ellington bassist.Lee Hildebrand, liner notes \\"Brownie McGee, Live at the Sugar Hill\\" In her speech to the GI Movement of the Vietnam War Era (whose text can be found in the booklet that's included in Paredon Records' FTA! Songs of the GI Resistance vinyl album of 1970), Barbara Dane said, \\"I was too stubborn to hire one of the greed-head managers, probably because I'm a woman who likes to speak for herself. I always made my own deals and contracts, and after figuring out the economics of it, I was free to choose when and where I worked, able to spend lots more time with my three children and doing political work, and even brought home more money in the end, by not going for the 'bigtime.' I did make some really nice records, because I was able to choose and work with wonderfully gifted musicians.\\" Political activism She continued to weave in appearances as a solo performer on the coffeehouse circuit with her folk-style guitar. She opposed building a Pacific Gas and Electric nuclear plant at the seismically precarious Bodega Bay. In organizing the resistance to that siting proposal, she recorded an album on the Fantasy label with Wally Rose, Bob Helm, Bob Mielke, and Lu Watters. It included the title track, \\"Blues over Bodega\\", and another tune, San Andreas Fault. Blues Over Bodega. AllMusic, Retrieved December 23, 2018.She also stepped up her work in the movements for peace and justice as the struggle for civil rights spread and the Vietnam war escalated. She sang at peace demonstrations in Washington, D.C. and throughout the U.S. and toured anti-war GI coffeehouses all over the world. In 1966, Barbara Dane became the first U.S. musician to tour post-revolutionary Cuba. In 1970, Dane founded Paredon Records with husband Irwin Silber, a label specializing in international protest music. She produced nearly 50 albums, including three of her own, over a 12-year period. The label was later incorporated into Smithsonian-Folkways, a label of the Smithsonian Institution, and is available through its catalog. In 1978, Dane appeared with Pete Seeger at a rally in New York for striking coal miners. \\"The world needs more people like Barbara, someone who is willing to follow her conscience. She is, if the term must be used, a hero\\", Bob Dylan wrote in an open letter to Broadside magazine in 1964. Blues singer and role model When she was in her late 70s, Philip Elwood, jazz critic of the San Francisco Examiner, said of her: \\"Dane is back and beautiful...she has an immense voice, remarkably well-tuned...capable of exquisite presentations regardless of the material. As a gut-level blues singer she is without compare.\\" Blues writer Lee Hildebrand calls her \\"perhaps the finest living interpreter of the classic blues of the 1920s.\\" In a 2010 profile on Barbara produced by Steven Short of KALW in San Francisco, Bonnie Raitt said \\"she’s always been a role model and a hero of mine – musically and politically. I mean, the arc of her life so informs mine that – she’s – I really can’t think of anyone I admire [more], the way that she’s lived her life.\\" The interview is archived on KALW's website.

She is a four-time Olympic Champion and three-time Overall World Champion for 1995–1997. She was a dominant force in International Short Track Speed Skating during the mid-1990s. Chun took part in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, at the age of 15, but failed to win much attention. In 1994, however, Chun won two gold medals at the Lillehammer Winter Olympic Games. She won the women's 1000 m final, defeating the reigning World Champion Nathalie Lambert and former World Champion Kim So-hee, and was part of the team that won the 3000 m relay in a world record time along with Kim. Between 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics, Chun won the Overall World Championship three times in a row, in 1995, 1996 and 1997 (becoming the second person to have won three consecutive Overall World Championships). She shared the 1997 title though with Yang Yang (A), her most significant career rival. She also won the Overall World Cup title for 1997–1998 season. In 1998, at the Nagano Winter Olympics, Chun successfully defended both of her Olympic titles, by defeating China's Yang Yang (A) and Yang Yang (S) in the 1000 m final after trailing for most of the race. Yang Yang (A) crossed the line together with Chun in what was ruled and reviewed as a photo finish, but was then disqualified for cross tracking Chun at the very end as Chun tried to pass on the inside (although the photo finish seemed to show Chun having defeated her for the gold regardless). She led the relay team to another Olympic victory with world record time, completing the first \\"double-double\\" in Olympic short track history. She also added a 5th Olympic medal, a surprising bronze in the 500 metres, her weakest event and which she had never won a World Championship medal in. She was advanced to the bronze after winning the B final, due to a major fall in the A final leading to the disqualification of Isabelle Charest, and the refusal to finish of Wang Chunlu. She became the first quadruple Olympic Champion in Short Track Speed Skating and the first one from Korea. One month later at the 1998 World Championships, her final major international meet, Chun won 4 medals including her 3rd title at 3000 metres, but was still narrowly denied a 4th consecutive Overall World Championship by Yang Yang (A) (the 2nd of Yang Yang (A)'s own 6 consecutive titles, after having tied Chun for the 97 title). The key event to the final overall result was the 1000 metres, where just as in Nagano Chun and Yang Yang (A) crossed in a virtual dead heat over the distance, but this time with Yang emerging the victor and getting the crucial 1st place points to the overall title with it. This provided the final chapter to the intense rivalry of the 2 all-time greats, as Chun would retire immediately after the meet. In 2002, Chun was elected to the Athletes' Committee of the International Olympic Committee.

Background  In 164 BCE, Judah Maccabee crushed the numerically superior Greeks under Lysias at the Battle of Beth Zur and restored the temple in Jerusalem. However, Seleucid forces still controlled the Acra, a strong fortress within the city that faced the Temple Mount and served as a symbol to remind the Jews that their land was still occupied. Taking advantage of bitter rivalry between Lysias and the recently deceased emperor's regent, Philip, Judah laid siege to the fortress in 162 BCE. However, Lysias did the unexpected and left Antioch and his dispute with Philip and took the field against the Maccabean army. With an army of about 50,000 infantry and thirty war elephants, along with cavalry and chariots, Lysias approached Jerusalem from the south and besieged Beth-zur, eighteen miles from the city. Judah lifted his own siege on The Acra, and led his army south to Beth-Zechariah. The Jewish force of about 20,000 positioned itself on the high ground across the road to Jerusalem -- directly in the path of the Syrian-Seleucid army. Description As told in , after capturing Beth-Zur, Lysias' force marched on Beth-Zechariah, with war elephants and light infantry at the helm of the main attack and heavy cavalry anchoring the flanks on high ground. In the centre rear marched the shock troops—the heavy infantry—in phalanx formation. Judah did not defer to his usual guerrilla tactics because he felt that his past success with them was cause for the Syrians to expect a non-traditional defence. He therefore used traditional field tactics and fought the Syrians in their own fashion. The result was a defeat for the Jews. The war elephants unnerved Judah's troops. As the Jews began to break for the rear, Maccabee's younger brother, Eleazar Horan, attempted to show his fellow men that the elephants were vulnerable. tells how, charging into the mouth of the Syrian assault, he spotted a large elephant bearing the royal seal. Eleazar cast himself under the animal and thrust his sword into its soft belly. The elephant died immediately and fell onto Eleazar, killing him. This show of bravery was not enough to rally the Jewish forces, which collapsed under the heavy pressure of the Greek phalanx. Lysias marched north to Jerusalem and laid siege to the rebel forces there. However, before he could restore total Seleucid control of the city, he was called back to Antioch to engage his enemy, Philip, for control of the empire. Before he left, he agreed to a compromise allowing the Jews to follow their customs and to worship as they pleased. Eleazar's heroism was commemorated in a Hanukkah coin issued by the Bank of Israel in 1961. The town of Elazar was named after the Maccabean, since it is on the road to Beit Zur (near present-day Karmei Tzur and the Arab town of Halhul). The small Arab hamlet of Hirbeit Zakariya (sitting on an ancient Byzantine site), and the large single oak tree of Alon Shvut, are the location of ancient Zakariya.

In the beginning of the history of Food Network, How to Boil Water was the trademark show of the network. As Emeril's personal popularity grew, he eventually moved on to his own show, Essence of Emeril. How to Boil Water continued with the tandem chef Cathy Lowe. With this duo, the show followed the formula of a chef teaching somebody with no experience. After Lowe, Frédéric Van Coppernolle along with comedian Lynne Koplitz, then later Jack Hourigan, were the show's hosts. The show's format followed a formula similar to when Emeril hosted.

If the ticket wins, the running mate becomes the Vice President of the United States and first in line to the presidency. Etymology A blend word of the words \\"veep\\" and \\"sweepstakes\\", the neologism has been found in print as far back as 1952. Selection process Once the Republican Party and the Democratic Party choose their presumptive presidential nominees for the election, the candidates themselves choose their running mates. Running mates are heavily vetted before being announced in the weeks prior to the party national convention. The selection of a running mate is given considerable attention because the individual chosen can be seen to broaden the ticket's appeal by complementing and balancing its strengths, ideologically, geographically, and with respect to credentials on either foreign or domestic policy. Occasionally, the running mate is chosen from the pool of candidates who also ran in the primary, as was the case in 1960 with John F. Kennedy choosing Lyndon B. Johnson, 1980 with Ronald Reagan choosing George H. W. Bush, 2004 with John Kerry picking John Edwards, 2008 with Barack Obama picking Joe Biden, and in 2020 with Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris. Historical examples In 1960, when Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts won his party's presidential nomination, he chose Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas in an effort to win that state's critical electoral votes and enhance his appeal in the South. In 2000, Texas Governor George W. Bush attempted to counter a perception of his inexperience by choosing Dick Cheney, a former White House Chief of Staff, House Representative, Secretary of Defense and CEO of Halliburton.

He was a landowner and industrialist. Early life and education Born in Edinburgh, McLaren was the son of the politician Duncan McLaren and Priscilla Bright. Priscilla was McLaren's third wife, and was the daughter of Jacob Bright and the sister of the Liberal statesman John Bright and temperance activist Margaret Bright Lucas. His full siblings included the Liberal MP Walter McLaren and the philanthropist Helen Priscilla McLaren, wife of Italian dietitian Andrea Rabagliati. Among McLaren's half-siblings were the judge John McLaren from his father's first marriage and the doctor Agnes McLaren from his father's second marriage. McLaren was educated at Grove House School and studied then at the University of Heidelberg as well as the University of Bonn. He finally graduated from the University of Edinburgh first class honours with a Master of Arts. Political career Charles McLaren c.1895 Bodnant House - owned by the family McLaren began his career in journalism, but turned to the law and in 1874, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn as a barrister. In 1880, he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Stafford; he served that constituency until 1886. In 1892, he returned to the Commons as MP for Bosworth, which he represented until 1910. McLaren's political career advanced during his second term, and in 1897 he was appointed a Queen's Counsel. It was announced that he would receive a baronetcy in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 for the (subsequently postponed) coronation of King Edward VII, and on 24 July 1902 he was created a Baronet, of Bodnant, in the County of Denbigh. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1908, and held the office of Justice of the Peace in Middlesex, Flint, Denbighshire, and Surrey. In 1911, a year after he had left the Commons (his son replaced him), he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom with the title Baron Aberconway, of Bodnant, in the County of Denbigh. McLaren was decorated with the 3rd class of the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure and received the Serbian Order of the Cross of Takovo. He was awarded a Commander of the Greek Order of the Redeemer. Career in industry His father-in-law, a noted industrialist, died in 1895, and McLaren became increasingly involved in the management of the companies inherited from him. He would become chairman of the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company and the British Iron Trade Association. McLaren chaired also the London-based Metropolitan Railway Company and the shipbuilding firm John Brown & Company.Dod (1915), p. 39 Family On 6 March 1877, McLaren married Laura, the daughter of the chemist Henry Davis Pochin and suffragist Agnes Heap, in Westminster; the couple had four children. He and his wife were neighbours and friends of James McNeill Whistler, owning several of his works. Laura died in 1933 and McLaren survived her until the following year. On his death in 1934, in Belgrave Square in London, the barony and baronetcy passed to his eldest son, Henry. His second son Francis sat also in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, however was killed during the First World War in his father's lifetime. The older daughter Florence was a socialite as well as activist and married the journalist Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet.

Added to the town in 1747, East Freetown was originally an outpost settlement of Tiverton, Rhode Island, then a part of Massachusetts. It rests on the shore of Long Pond. History East Freetown was made a part of Freetown as a result of the Pocasset Purchase of 1747. It remained less economically developed and industrialized than its sister village, Assonet well into the 20th century. The village was the birthplace of Massachusetts Governor Marcus Morton. =Historic District= East Freetown Grange #307 The East Freetown Historic District has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999. It contains many buildings, sites, and features of local historical significance. The district is located roughly along Howland, Gurney, Washburn County Roads. Geography East Freetown is located in Southeastern Massachusetts. It is bounded by Dartmouth, Fall River, New Bedford, Lakeville, Assonet, Rochester, Acushnet, and Long Pond. It has a hilly terrain, with many outcroppings of bedrock. Maple, elm, oak, pine, and birch trees are common throughout. Numerous streams and brooks flow through the village, including Fall Brook. Many peninsulas exist around Long Pond, laying site for summer resorts such as Heaven's Heights and Hemlock Point. A small portion of the village comprises a part of the Freetown-Fall River State Forest. Churches Several churches have been built in East Freetown. =St. John Neumann Church= St. John Neumann Church is a Roman Catholic parish covering the village of East Freetown. On the grounds of the church are Cathedral Camp and Our Lady of the Lake camp, both of which combined to form the co-ed Cathedral Camp. The camp has an extensive outdoor program, including swimming and boating on Long Pond. =East Freetown Congregational-Christian Church= The East Freetown Congregational-Christian Church is a gathering of people who emphasize music, prayer, and Bible-based preaching as part of their worship life together. The congregation is bound by a covenant and is considered \\"non-credal\\". That means there is no declared statement which is used as a filter of membership. The congregation has not been part of any other denomination or structure since its gathering in 1831. From its inception in the New England Christian Connexion movement of the 18th-19th century, the congregation has maintained five tenets of that movement: 1. the Lordship of Jesus Christ as the sole head of the church; 2. the use of no other name than \\"Christian\\"; 3. the canonical Scriptures as the only rule of faith and practice; 4. individual duty of the interpretation of the Scriptures; 5. Christian character as a test of fellowship.\\"The Shaping of American Congregationalism 1620-1957\\" by John Von Rohr The church took on the additional title \\"Congregational\\" in 1931 as a recognition of the historical roots of its polity, and as part of an emerging spirit of communion among Reformed tradition American churches. ed Schools From the early 19th century until 1950, Freetown was serviced by several neighborhood grammar schools, several of which existed in East Freetown. *Furnace School *Mason's Corner School =Today= From 1950 forward, students have attended the Freetown Elementary School, first for grades 1-8, later K-6, and currently PreK-3. Students also attend George R. Austin Intermediate School (4-5), and Freetown-Lakeville Middle School (6-8). For secondary education, students have three options: Apponequet Regional High School serves students with an academic focus for grades 9-12. Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School in Rochester accepts students from Assonet when there are openings, and provides a voc-tech atmosphere.

A used good may also simply mean it is no longer in the same condition as it was transferred to the current owner. When the term used means that an item has expended its purpose (such as a used diaper), it is typically called garbage instead. Used goods may be transferred informally between friends and family for free as hand-me- downs. They may be sold for a fraction of their original price at garage sales, in bazaar-style fundraisers, in privately-owned consignment shops, or through online auctions. Some things are typically sold in specialized shops, such as a car dealership that specializes in the sale of used vehicles or a used bookstore that sells used books. In other cases, such as a charity shop, a wide variety of used goods might be handled by the same establishment. High- value used luxury goods, such as antique furniture, jewelry, watches, and artwork, might be sold through a generic auction house such as Sotheby's, more specialized niches or privately-owned auction marketplaces. Governments require some used goods to be sold through regulated markets, as in the case of items that have safety and legal issues, such as used firearms or cars. For such items, government licensing bodies require certification and registration of the sale to prevent the sale of stolen, unregistered, or unsafe goods. For some high-value used goods, such as cars and motorcycles, governments regulate sales of used goods to ensure that the government gets its sales tax revenue from the sale. Benefits Secondhand goods can benefit the purchaser as the price paid is lower than that of the same items bought new. If the reduction in price more than compensates for the possibly shorter remaining lifetime, lack of warranty, and so on, there is a net benefit. Selling unwanted goods secondhand instead of discarding them obviously benefits the seller. Recycling goods through the secondhand market reduces use of resources in manufacturing new goods and diminishes waste which must be disposed of, both of which are significant environmental benefits. However, manufacturers who profit from sales of new goods lose corresponding sales. Scientific research shows that buying used goods reduces carbon footprint and CO2 emissions significantly compared to the complete product life cycle, because of less production, raw material sourcing and logistics. Often the relative carbon footprint of production, raw material sourcing and the supply chain is unknown. A scientific methodology has been made to analyze how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used goods like secondhand hardware versus new hardware. Quality secondhand goods can be more durable than equivalent new goods. Risks Secondhand goods may have faults which are not apparent even if examined; purchasing sight unseen, for example, from an Internet auction site, has further unknowns. Goods may cause problems beyond their value; for example, furniture may have not easily seen bedbugs, which may cause an infestation that is difficult and expensive to eradicate. Faulty electrical and mechanical goods can be hazardous and dangerous. This is especially a big issue if sold to countries that do not have recycling facilities for these devices, which has led to an issue with electronic waste. Types of transfers Many items that are considered obsolete and worthless in developed countries, such as decade-old hand tools and clothes, are useful and valuable in impoverished communities in the country or in developing countries. Underdeveloped countries like Zambia are extremely welcoming to donated secondhand clothing. At a time when the country's economy was in severe decline, the used goods provided jobs by keeping \\"many others busy with repairs and alterations\\". It has created a type of spin-off economy at a time when many Zambians were out of work. The used garments and materials that were donated to the country also allowed for the production of \\"a wide range of fabrics\\" whose imports had been previously restricted. The trade is essentially executed by women who operate their small business based on local associations and networks. Not only does this provide self-employment, but it also increases household income and enhances the economy. But while many countries would be welcoming of secondhand goods, it is also true that there are countries in need who refuse donated items. Countries like Poland, the Philippines, and Pakistan have been known to reject secondhand items for \\"fear of venereal disease and risk to personal hygiene\\". Similar to these countries, India also refuses the import of secondhand clothing but will accept the import of wool fibers, including mutilated hosiery which is a term meaning \\"woollen garments shredded by machine in the West prior to export\\". Through the production of shoddy (recycled wool), most of which is produced in Northern India today, unused clothing can be recycled into fibers that are spun into yarn for reuse in \\"new\\" used goods. United States taxpayers can deduct donations of used goods to charitable organizations. Both Goodwill Industries and the Salvation Army websites have lists of items with their estimated range of values. Another way that people transfer used goods is by giving them to friends or relatives. When a person gives an item of some value that they have used to someone else, such as a used car or a winter coat, it is sometimes referred to as a \\"hand-me-down\\". Online auction sites have become a way to sell used goods Used items can often be found for sale in thrift stores and pawnshops, auctions, garage sales, and in more recent times online auctions. Some stores sell both new and used goods (e.g. car dealerships), while others only sell new goods but may take used items in exchange for credit toward the purchase of newer goods. For example, some musical instrument stores and high-end audio stores only sell new gear, but they will accept good quality used items as trade-ins towards the purchase of new items; after the store purchases the used items, they then sell them using online auctions or other services. When an item is no longer of use to a person they may sell or pawn it, especially when they are in need of money. Items can also be sold (or taken away free of cost) as scrap (e.g. a broken-down old car will be towed away for free for its scrap metal value). Owners may sell the good themselves or to a dealer who then sells it on for a profit. They may also choose to give it away to another person this is often referred to as freecycling. However, because the process takes some effort on part of the owner they may simply keep possession of it or dump it at a landfill instead of going to the trouble of selling it. It has been common to buy secondhand or used good on markets or bazaars for a long time. When the web became popular, it became common with websites such as eBay and Yahoo! Classifieds. Purchases environmental motivations The strategy of buying used items is employed by some to save money, as they are typically worth less than the equivalent new items. Purchasing used items for reuse prevents them from becoming waste and saves the costly production of equivalent new goods. Motivations for purchase include conserving natural resources and protecting the environment, and may form part of a simple living plan. Types =Cars= Used cars like this 1980s-era Toyota Corolla are very inexpensive, but a buyer runs the risk of getting stuck with a lemon Used cars are especially notable for depreciating in value much faster than many other items. Used cars may have been bought or leased by their previous user, and may be purchased directly from the previous owner or through a dealer. George Akerlof published a paper entitled \\"The Market for Lemons\\", examining the effects of information asymmetry on the used car market. Used cars may require more maintenance or have fewer features than later equivalent models. = Books = Used books are often re-sold through a used bookstore. They may also be given away, perhaps as part of a program such as the Little Free Library's programs. Used bookstores may also sell secondhand music recordings or videos. = Used clothing = In developed countries, unwanted used clothing is often donated to charities that sort and sell it. Some of these distribute some of the clothing to people on low incomes for free or at a very low price. Others sell all of the collected clothing in bulk to a commercial used clothing redistributor and then use the raised funds to finance their activities. In the U.S., almost 5 billion pounds of clothing is donated to charity shops each year. Only about 10% of it can be re-sold by the charity shops. About a third of the donated clothing is bought, usually in bulk and at a heavy discount, by commercial dealers and fabric recyclers, who export it to other countries. Some of the used clothes are also smuggled into Mexico. Used clothing unsuitable for sale in an affluent market may still find a buyer or end-user in another market, such as a student market or a less affluent region of a developing country. In developing countries, such as Zambia, secondhand clothing is sorted, recycled, and sometimes redistributed to other nations. Some of the scraps are kept and used to create unique fashions that enable the locals to construct identity. Not only does the trade represent a great source of employment for women as well as men, but it also supports other facets of the economy: the merchants buy timber and other materials for their stands, metal hangers to display clothing, and food and drinks for customers. Carriers also find work as they transport the garments from factories to various locations. The secondhand clothing trade is central to the lives of many citizens dwelling in such countries. A dress agent will often deal with a buyer and seller directly, taking unwanted clothes that still have value, and reselling them in a shop. Importation of used clothing is sometimes opposed by the textile industry in developing countries. They are concerned that fewer people will buy the new clothes that they make when it is cheaper to buy imported used clothing. Nearly all the clothes made in Mexico are intended for export, and the Mexican textile industry opposes the importation of used clothes. = Other items = The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, argues that secondhand purchasing of furniture is the \\"greenest\\" way of furnishing a home. Vintage guitars also became increasingly desired objects among musicians and collectors during the nineties and afterward.

Besides buttons, the company manufactured parts for telephones and advertising novelties.Listing of companies in the Scranton area, from the Scranton Board of Trade Journal, April 1906 By 1915, the company was pressing 3 million buttons per day. Since many of the buttons were made out of shellac, the company had the ability to work with this material and in the 1920s it branched out from making buttons into pressing phonograph records out of the same material. It offered full-service record production to any retailer that desired its own label. In 1924, it bought Emerson Records and in July 1929 it merged with Regal Records, Cameo Records, Banner Records and the US branch of Pathé Records to form the American Record Corporation. From 1929-on, Scranton pressed Brunswick, Melotone, Perfect, Banner, Regal, Domino, Conqueror, Vocalion and other ARC labels.

It is usually used in aerobic or anaerobic exercise. The definition of 'long' varies according to the type of exertion – minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can reduce the ability to exert endurance strength unless an individual also undertakes resistance training to counteract this effect. When a person is able to accomplish or withstand a higher amount of effort than their original capabilities their endurance is increasing which to many personnel indicates progress. In looking to improve one's endurance they may slowly increase the amount of repetitions or time spent, if higher repetitions are taken rapidly muscle strength improves while less endurance is gained. Increasing endurance has been proven to release endorphins resulting in a positive mind. The act of gaining endurance through physical activity has been shown to decrease anxiety, depression, and stress, or any chronic disease in total. Although a greater endurance can assist the cardiovascular system it does not imply that any cardiovascular disease can be guaranteed to improve. \\"The major metabolic consequences of the adaptations of muscle to endurance exercise are a slower utilization of muscle glycogen and blood glucose, a greater reliance on fat oxidation, and less lactate production during exercise of a given intensity.\\" The term stamina is sometimes used synonymously and interchangeably with endurance. In military settings, endurance is considered the ability of a force to sustain high levels of combat potential relative to its opponent over the duration of a campaign.Headquarter, Department of the Army (1994). Leader’s Manual for Combat Stress Control, FM 22-51, Washington DC. Endurance may also refer to an ability to keep going through a tough situation involving hardship, stress, etc. (see patience) = Training = Different types of endurance performance can be trained in specified ways. Adaptation of exercise plans should follow individual goals. Calculating the Intensity of exercise the individual capabilies should be considered. Effective training starts within half the individual performance capability. Performance capability is expressed by maximum heart rate. Best results can be achieved within 55 up to 65% of maximum heart rate. Aerob, anaerob and further thresholds are not to be mentioned within extensive endurance exercises. In general surveillance of training intensity is achieved through measuring the heart rate. See also *Exercise  References  External links * .

A member of the True Whig political party, which dominated the political governance of the country for decades, Barclay served as the 18th President of the country from 1930 until 1944. Under his leadership, Liberia was an ally of the United States during World War II.  Early life  Edwin Barclay's paternal grandparents moved from Barbados to Liberia with their children in 1865. They were among a minority of immigrants from the Caribbean but shared with the Americo-Liberians a culture with an English base, considerable mixed-race ancestry, and a shared history. Edwin's father, Ernest Barclay, and uncle, Arthur Barclay, became important politicians in Liberia. In 1901, at the age of 19, Edwin wrote a Liberian patriotic song, \\"The Lone Star Forever.\\" Barclay and his wife Euphemia had three children.

Children: *Mary Barclay Dumbar, Siata Isabel Barclay, Earnest Barclay Career Edwin Barclay, a member of the True Whig Party which ruled at that time, served as foreign minister and secretary of state of Liberia in the government of Charles D.B. King from 1920 until 1930. He became President of Liberia in 1930 when President King and Vice President Allen Yancy resigned because of a scandal. He was elected in his own right for the first time in 1931. Presidency (1930-44) Barclay was selected to complete King's term as president. One of his first official decisions was to repeal the famous Port of Entry Law of 1864 that had restricted the economic activities of foreigners in the country. Subsequently, in the early 1930s concession agreements were signed between the Liberian Government and Dutch, Danish, German and Polish investors.Fred P. M. van der Kraaij, The Open Door Policy of Liberia. An Economic history of Modern Liberia (Bremen, 1983), Chapter 2, The origins of the Closed Door Policies and Open Door Policies 1847-1947, pp. 12-46. Barclay is credited with helping the country survive some of Liberia's greatest threats to its sovereignty in that country's history. These included threats by the League of Nations led by Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States to recolonize the country unless reforms were made, aggressive actions by France and a coup attempt by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company which owned much of Liberia's land. =Renegotiation of loan payments= In 1926, the Liberian government had granted a major rubber concession to the Firestone Tire and Rubber company and undertook to borrow $5 million from a Firestone subsidiary. The Great Depression of the 1930s brought Liberia to the verge of bankruptcy. As the global economy collapsed, so too did prices of all commodities, including those for rubber. By 1932, rubber prices had fallen to a low of 3¢ a pound. Although the trees planted by the Firestone Company in 1926 and 1927 were reaching tapping age, the market price of rubber would cover only a small fraction of the cost of tapping, processing and transportation to market. Firestone did not bother to harvest and produce the rubber. Without this revenue, government revenues fell steadily to a low of $321,000 in 1933. By 1931, it became apparent to the Liberian administration that the revenue shortfall made continued loan repayments impossible. The government asked the lending bank and Firestone for forbearance on the loan payments but to no avail. Harvey Firestone attempted to persuade the United States government to employ \\"gunboat diplomacy\\" to compel compliance with the loan agreement. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt refused to interfere in Liberian internal affairs, writing in a memorandum to the State Department that, \\"At all times we should remember that (Harvey) Firestone went to Liberia at his own financial risk, and it is not the business of the State Department to pull his financial chestnut out of the fire except as a friend of the Liberian people.\\" In 1932, the Liberian Legislature passed the Moratorium Act suspending payment of the Firestone loan until terms could be negotiated that were more in line with Liberia's ability to pay. The US suspended diplomatic relations but did not take further action. When Barclay appealed to the League of Nations for help, the Council of the League of Nations established a commission of inquiry. The report of the commission recommended providing financial aid to Liberia with certain conditions that reflected concerns that the government of Liberia would not be able to pay a renegotiated loan without some level of monitoring. Some European powers in the League of Nations had advocated mandate status for Liberia, a move which would have abrogated the independence of the republic. Barclay and other members of his cabinet objected to the proposed conditions on the grounds that they would infringe upon the sovereignty of Liberia. For example, one of the conditions would have required that the League's delegates be placed in key positions within the Liberian government. After Barclay implemented some of the measures that had been proposed by the League of Nations, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt restored diplomatic relations with Liberia in 1934. After three years of negotiation, an agreement was reached along lines suggested by the League. Two key League officials were placed in positions to advise the government, but with limitations set forth by the Liberian government. With this assistance program in place, Liberia was able to resume making loan payments. =World War II= Poster from U.S. Office of War Information. Domestic Operations Branch. News Bureau, 1943 In 1937 President Barclay, under pressure from the United States, withdrew the concession agreement with the German investors, who were accused of sympathies with the Nazi regime in their home country. Until January 3, 1944, Barclay was Liberian President, to be succeeded by William Tubman. Strategic importance of Liberia After the fall of Malaysia and Singapore to the Japanese during World War II, Liberia became very strategically important as its rubber plantation was the only source of natural latex rubber available to the Allies, apart from plantations in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Among many other uses, natural rubber was needed to build tires for war planes, military jeeps, aircraft guns, and sensitive radar equipment. As a result of the simultaneous sharp increase in demand and drastic reduction in supply, prices soared for natural rubber in the United States and measures were taken to reduce demand. Writing in his memoirs, former U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull wrote, \\"With Japan's occupation of the Rubber producing areas in the Far East, Liberia became of greatly increased importance to us as one of the few remaining available sources of natural rubber.\\"Hull, Cordell. The Memoirs of Cordell Hull (Volume II, p. 1186). President Barclay assured the Americans that Liberia would supply all the natural rubber that the United States and its allies needed for the war effort. Defense Pact with the United States (1942) Barclay visiting the United States at Fort Belvoir In 1942 Liberia signed a Defense Pact with the United States. This commenced a period of strategic development, including the construction of roads, airports and other infrastructure projects. Robertsfield Airport was built with runways long enough for B-47 Stratojet bombers to land for refueling, giving Liberia the longest runway in Africa to this day. Provision of war supplies to the North African theater The provision of war supplies to the North African theater was difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. German U-boats had taken complete control of the North Atlantic Ocean routes, making shipping in the North Atlantic Ocean hazardous to American warships and merchant vessels. In order to transport American soldiers and war supplies to North Africa, the United States needed to open up a South American-Liberian air corridor. Because of its proximity to South America, Liberia became the first major West African bridgehead for the South Atlantic air ferry route. For this reason, the Liberian Government also granted to the United States use of its territory to store war supplies and to construct military bases in Montserrado County and Grand Cape Mount County at Fisherman's Lake. United States military supplies were collected in Florida, transported through South America to Brazil, then flown from Brazil to the military depot at Roberts Field. There 5,000 United States African-American troops stored and maintained the inventory. From Roberts Field, the war supplies were flown to their final destinations in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. Franklin Roosevelt's visit to Liberia (1943) President Edwin Barclay (right) and President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, 1943 Liberia's strategic importance to the Allied war effort was evidenced by the fact that, in January 1943, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt traveled to Liberia after participating in the Casablanca Conference in order to secure Liberia's support. Roosevelt's objectives were to negotiate the establishment of U.S. military bases in Liberia, secure Liberia's commitment to continue supplying the U.S. with natural rubber, urge the Liberian government to expel German citizens and persuade it to abandon its neutrality and declare war on the Axis powers. In May 1943, Edwin Barclay visited the United States. He was the first black man to be officially introduced from the rostrum of the United States Congress as a guest of honor. Retirement Barclay retired in 1944 and was replaced by William Tubman. He ran against Tubman in the 1955 presidential election, but received only about 1100 votes. He died a few months later.

These shares may not be permanently deleted but may be disabled. Administrative shares cannot be accessed by users without administrative privileges. Share names Administrative shares are a collection of automatically shared resources including the following: * Disk volumes: Every disk volume on the system is shared as an administrative share. The name of these shares consists of the drive letters of shared volume plus a dollar sign ($). For example, a system that has volumes \`C\`, \`D\` and \`E\` has three administrative shares named C$, D$ or E$. (NetBIOS is not case sensitive.) * OS folder: The folder in which Windows is installed is shared as \`admin$\` * Fax cache: The folder in which faxed pages and cover pages are cached is shared as \`fax$\` * IPC shares: This area, which is used for inter-process communication via named pipes and is not part of the file system, is shared as \`ipc$\` * Printers folder: This virtual folder, which contains object that represent installed printers is shared as \`print$\` * Domain controller shares: Windows Server family of operating system creates two domain controller-specific shares called \`sysvol\` and \`netlogon\` which do not have dollar signs ($) appended to their names. Characteristics Administrative shares have the following characteristics: # Hidden: The \\"$\\" appended to the end of the share name means that it is a hidden share. Windows will not list such shares among those it defines in typical queries by remote clients to obtain the list of shares. One needs to know the name of an administrative share in order to access it. Not every hidden share is an administrative share; in other words, ordinary hidden shares may be created at user's discretion. # Automatically created: Administrative shares are created by Windows, not a network administrator. If deleted, they will be automatically recreated. Administrative shares are not created by Windows XP Home Edition. Management The administrative shares can be deleted just as any other network share, only to be recreated automatically at the next reboot. It is, however, possible to disable administrative shares. Disabling administrative shares is not without caveats. Previous Versions for local files, a feature of Windows Vista and Windows 7, requires administrative shares to operate. Restrictions Windows XP implements \\"simple file sharing\\" (also known as \\"ForceGuest\\"), a feature that can be enabled on computers that are not part of a Windows domain. When enabled, it authenticates all incoming access requests to network shares as \\"Guest\\", a user account with very limited access rights in Windows. This effectively disables access to administrative shares. By default, Windows Vista and later use User Account Control (UAC) to enforce security. One of UAC's features denies administrative rights to a user who accesses network shares on the local computer over a network, unless the accessing user is registered on a Windows domain or using the built in Administrator account. If not in a Windows domain it is possible to allow administrative share access to all accounts with administrative permissions by adding the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy value to the registry.

Oracle ADF 12c (12.2.1.4.0): New Features Visual and declarative The JDeveloper code editor offers a rich set of coding features including visual and non-visual utilities that provide different views of the code. The software provides dialogs that guide the use of Java EE components. For example, JDeveloper provides a visual WYSIWYG editor for HTML, JSP, JSF, and Swing. The visual editor allows developers to modify the layout and properties of components visually: the tool re-generates the code. Any changes in the code will be immediately reflected in the visual view. JDeveloper provides a similar feature for generating JSF and Struts page flows. Declarative features enable programmers to generate EJBs or POJOs based on tables in relational databases. JDeveloper automates the creation of Java EE artifacts. For example, with a click on a visual artifact one can turn a Java class into a web service. JDeveloper generates the associated WSDL (Web Services Descriptive Language) document and related JAX-RPC components. License JDeveloper is free proprietary software for development and deployment. Oracle ADF has a runtime license when deployed outside of an Oracle Application Server.

The series was created by Cori Stern, while Sci-Fi veteran David Winning directed the pilot and seven episodes of the series. Synopsis The series is set at a high school located on a cruise ship (equivalent to the real Semester at Sea program), allowing the episodes to be set in different exotic locations, although the series was, in fact, filmed entirely in Burnaby, British Columbia. Like most series of its kind, it featured events such as dating, finances, and friendship, although as a daytime series, it tended to steer away from the \\"tougher\\" situations (pregnancy, sexuality, etc.) outlined in other primetime teen dramas at the time.  Cast and characters  The cast consisted primarily of eight high school kids, with a few additional actors portraying adult characters. *Alex Pineda - Played by Kyle Alisharan. *Ashley Dupree - Played by Terri Conn. *Sean Stanley Hanlon - Played by Ryan Gosling. *Cassidy Cartwright - Played by Wendi Kenya. *Jimmy Mortimor Farrell - Played by Tyler Labine. *Max Ballard - Played by Scott Vickaryous. *Denise Williams - Played by Persia White. *Tamira Goldstein - Played by Rachel Wilson. *Ana Mitchell - The kids' teacher. Played by Anne Openshaw. *Captain Ballard - The captain of the ship, school principal and Max's father. Played by Andrew Airlie. *Tony Gifford - The student activities counselor. Played by Richard Ian Cox. *Nigel Mumford - The cook. Played by Bernard Cuffling.

On the surface he is a pompous, sometimes foppish, aristocrat (he claims to live in a manor, own many slaves and a Steinway piano), cruelly using and exploiting those around him (specifically his slave, Lucky and, to a lesser extent, Estragon). He wears similar clothes to Vladimir and Estragon (i.e. a bowler and suit), but they are not in the dire condition theirs are.  Godot's antagonist  While by no means a villain in a conventional sense of the word, Pozzo is sometimes considered (nominally) the \\"antagonist\\" of Waiting for Godot. Although he is not technically in opposition to the so- called heroes of the play (Vladimir and Estragon) he does bring chaos into their sheltered world. Upon his first entrance, he immediately goes about attempting to exert authority on the hapless \\"Didi\\" and \\"Gogo\\" by shouting at them, ordering them about, and generally making a nuisance of himself. Along the way he mercilessly abuses Lucky (physically and mentally) into performing menial and sometimes pointless tasks. However, despite his authoritative presence, he has the tendency of falling to pieces at the (literal) drop of a hat. At certain points in the first act (and for most of the second act; see below) he has minor nervous breakdowns when things don't go his way (e.g. when he misplaces things, when Vladimir and Estragon don't understand him/berate him, etc.). Pozzo should not be seen, however, as merely a mindless, weak oppressor. He has a developed intellectual side: he philosophises intelligently and optimistically.  On his blindness  Pozzo goes through a rather radical transformation between the first and second acts: he goes blind. When he makes his second (final) entrance, he almost immediately falls over and cannot get up. He remains this way for the rest of his scene, helplessly moaning and bemoaning his fate and condition. This change supposedly only occurs in the past day. Some critics interpret this as representing his failure to see the suffering in others, and thus has brought suffering upon himself.  Pozzo and Estragon  Pozzo is often compared to Estragon (just as Lucky is compared to Vladimir) as being the impulsive, right-brained part of his character duo. The idea is that Pozzo and Lucky are simply an extreme form of the relationship between Vladimir and Estragon (the hapless impulsive, and the intellect who protects him), and thus extreme forms of those very characters. He, like Estragon, has an awful memory, and since he cannot rely on Lucky for memory (as Estragon can on Vladimir), he is even more in the dark (e.g. he cannot even remember one day before). Vladimir claims that he and Estragon know him, but this is naturally not corroborated by Estragon, and the nature of their former relationship remains unknown. He occasionally comes up with poetic metaphors for the current situation, again, just as Estragon does.

The name Kara is taken from the Hebrew Bible - Jeremiah 35:17 - and it means \\"to invite\\". Demon Diary was originally published by Sigongsa and has been licensed in North America by Tokyopop. In Scandinavia, it was published by Mangismo between 2005-2006. A number of writers have worked with Kara on the production of Demon Diary. The story for volume 1 was written by Lee Jeehyung. Lee stopped writing, because he had to prepare for the upcoming high school exams. The stories for volumes 2 through 7 were written by Lee Yun-hee. Story Demon Diary is a light story about Raenef, a newly appointed Demon Lord, and Eclipse, his instructor, who is both a powerful demon and a veteran of a human-versus-demon war. Because of his actions during the Hangma War (which are not elaborated upon), he became known for his cruelty and incredible power. However, when attempting to teach Raenef, Eclipse's 'anger' is often played for laughs. Characters Raenef V : A sweet, somewhat naive boy who is the complete opposite of a proper Demon Lord. Though he drives Eclipse to endless distraction, he warms the stoic demon's heart quite quickly. Despite his happy-go-lucky personality (even as a thief), he harbors a dark past, which includes joining the thieves' guild in order to survive because he was an orphan. At first, he is quite an idiot but somewhat cute. However, as the series progresses, he becomes weary of his own sweetness and another side of his personality is revealed. The \\"other Raenef\\" is a particularly cruel Demon Lord with high intelligence and a strong grasp of magic. In the end, the two personalities are blended. Raenef IV said he is his child. Eclipse : A powerful and ancient high ranking demon whose occupation consists of serving those of the Raenef name. It is revealed that his services are highly sought after by many demon lords. He is charged with finding the newest Lord Raenef (Raenef V) and educating him. Though the newest demon lord never ceases to annoy and exasperate him, he comes to care very deeply for the innocent boy. He and Raenef IV are implied to have had a relatively close relationship, which becomes a point of conflict later in the series. Erutis : A young Swordsmaster and former mercenary who originally came to kill the \\"fearsome demon lord,\\" only to find Raenef. Not believing that such a naive, innocent boy could be an evil demon lord, she tried to leave, only to be attacked by a somewhat miffed Raenef. Though she easily beats him in a fight, when she tried to kill him, her sword broke, leaving her with no weapon. Thinking quickly, she managed to trick Raenef into thinking that she would work as a henchman for him. Her intentions were to slip away once he fell asleep. Unfortunately, she ran into Eclipse, who trapped her in a bubble shield and later coerces her into really becoming a servant. Her ambiguous gender becomes a running joke throughout the series (in a character omake, she is seen kicking the artist and writer for deliberately making her seem so boyish). Despite her role as comic relief for most of the series, she is quite skilled as a warrior, with an enchanted blade (which unfortunately broke when Raenef defended himself), replaced with a handmade wooden sword that she is able to use almost as well because of her abilities as a Swordsmaster. To her dismay, her fearsome temper only attracts the attentions of the eccentric Demon Lord Krayon, who insists on following her around and quite inadvertently gets her a position as the head of her own mercenary group. Chris : He is a hot-headed, over-zealous High-Priest-in-training. Chris accidentally summons Raenef with a summoning circle, almost causing another war. Because of his infraction, the High Priest sends Chris to Raenef's palace to learn some humility. With his delusions of grandeur, Chris acts as another source of comic relief. However, like most of the characters, he has a tragic past. As a child, he watched as his mother was killed and his entire village was destroyed by demons, leaving him in a catatonic state. The High Priest of Rased saved him in time, only to be visited by the God of Light, Rased, who had chosen to protect the boy, declaring that Chris was \\"someone very precious\\" to him. Though it is yet to be seen how important Chris is to the demon and human world, it is only due to Chris's clerical magic that an evil Raenef is able to be stalled and weakened long enough to be stabilized. Meruhesae : She is one of the main Demon Elders. She is a seductive and elegant female demon also known for her abilities as a seer. She directs Eclipse to the location of Raenef V and is one of the few characters able to unsettle the normally stoic demon. Flirtatious and somewhat vain, she has a serious side, revealed in her particular relationship with the previous Raenef. She particularly likes to annoy Eclipse, who has a curious dislike of her, asking for \\"payment\\" for her services. In the case of information on Raenef V, she asks for a kiss--however, she simply kisses Eclipse on the forehead. She states her reasoning as not wanting to bring on the wrath of Eclipse's fans by going for more. Krayon : He is one of the five elders. He is a very eccentric and flamboyant demon who nevertheless is not to be underestimated (As shown in the last volume when he burns down a town after a family there \\"wronged\\" Euritis). He is the Demon Lord of Dreams, therefore he is able to throw Raenef, Erutis, and Chris into a dream world when he comes to the castle to buy Eclipse's services from Raenef. During the ensuing battle with the trio, he comes to be particularly attracted to Erutis, who blanches at his declarations of love. He goes as far as to ask Raenef IV to protect her if any upheavals were to happen in the demon world and ceaselessly follows her around. He took care of Raenef IV and tutored him at one point (when both were much younger), and seems to be somewhat wary of the other Demon Lord. Raenef IV : He is the previous Demon Lord Raenef. A powerful Demon Lord, he specialized in incantations, written spells that increase the user's power tremendously when memorized or written correctly. Much of him is shrouded in mystery, particularly the circumstances of his death. Though he is portrayed as eccentric and even a little mischievous (particularly by a very irritated Krayon, who had to \\"tutor\\" the younger demon lord in years past), he is ruthless and somewhat self-serving. Though he has been dead for some time, his spirit still appears, though the older demons Meruhesae and Krayon don't seem to be particularly ruffled by his apparition. It is revealed that Raenef IV caused his own death to avoid a powerful curse, called \\"the Destruction of the Name,\\" placed on him during the war. He had a particularly close relationship with Eclipse, which could echo the latter's growing bond with Raenef V. Leeche : A young girl from a noble human family who runs off to find adventure and/or kill the Demon Lord. She drugs the actual Demon Lord's bride - a young human maiden sent off to marry the Demon Lord in order to please him - and takes her place. She meshes quite well with Chris, although they fight a lot, they agree on one thing: they must kill the Demon Lord. However, as Leeche got to know Raenef better, she found out that he isn't at all like the Demon Lord she expected. Her father comes with the actual Demon Lord's bride and brings her home, along with the bride after Raenef - by the way of Eclipse - refuses the bride. Before she leaves, she confesses her love for Raenef with a kiss on his lips (Eclipse and Leeche's father are shocked and pull them apart quickly). She said that Raenef should wait ten years and that she wouldn't forgive him if he finds another girl and marries her.

They face the dual tasks of piecing together their past lives and battling a group of Delta State denizens called Rifters, who seek to control the human mind. The main characters are Claire (Ilona Elkin), Martin (Dusan Dukic), Luna (Lizz Alexander), and Philip (Nicholas Wright). The series debuted September 11, 2004 on Teletoon, the Canadian cartoon television network. It is the first animated television series to be entirely rotoscoped, taking over 27 months to complete. Delta State is a French/Canadian co- production with designs, story boards etc., done by Alphanim in Paris. Shooting and recording were performed by Nelvana Canada. The project was conceived by Douglas Gayeton, who also directed the original pilot and wrote the bible for the show. The show has won the Special Award for a TV program at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, and the Frames 2004 for best Asian Production. The series aired in France on France 2 and Canal+. Synopsis Four people each become aware that they possess superhuman abilities of the mind, and are charged by their friend and mentor Professor Brodie with saving the world from Rifter forces. Brodie trains them to battle Rifters in the Delta State, a reference to the brain wave pattern achieved during deep sleep. The main characters, Professor Brodie, and the Rifters are able to enter and exit this state of consciousness at will. As in dreams, rules of physics or logic do not necessarily apply; yet, as in lucid dreaming, a measure of control over the situation can be achieved while in this state. Characters *Luna Palacios: Red hair in ponytail, 22 years old and of Mexican descent. She has the power of precognition. She is the only one among the group who doesn't have control over her power; her visions of the future appear to her either randomly or shortly before the actual event. Luna is described to be shy and reserved. However, it is implied that her personality drastically changed after she lost her memories and she was much more open and social in her past life. Luna works in a pub where all the characters gather regularly during the series. Before she lost her memories, she was a bank teller at the Bank of Mexico. There was a robbery at the bank and the getaway car hit and killed Carlita, Luna's little sister. There is often tension between her and Martin due, apparently, to their previous relationship. She is also the one Phillip prefers to confide in with his more sensitive and personal issues. *Philip Graff: Shaggy black hair, 20 years old, a perpetually unemployed slacker. He has the power of psychometry, the ability to see the past experiences of selected objects. His mother abandoned him on a bus when he was a baby and he grew up in an orphanage. She's seen in robes being chased by others in matching robes, suggesting a possible cult membership of some kind, and that Philip's birth went against this group's beliefs. He has an aversion to lockers, likely because he spent much of third grade being stuffed into them. It's later revealed that of the four he was the first one found, and that he's the \\"most special\\" in the grand scheme of things. *Claire Donally: Blue hair in buns, 21 years old. She has the power of remote viewing. Now Martin's girlfriend. Her best friend is Luna. Claire's previous boyfriend was David, who was murdered by a friend named Thomas, because Thomas wanted the full share of the treasure he and David had found while scuba diving. She's shown to be the least capable of dealing with the new life/Rifter situation they're in. *Martin Gold: Spiked white hair, 21 years old, and the de facto leader of the group. He has the power of telepathy (mind reading). Presently the boyfriend of Claire, though he was Luna's in his past life. He was a baseball catcher before a couple of thugs, hired by his own father (for not also pursuing the family practice), broke his arm, ending his career. =Rifters= *Sven Ragnar: Arguably the most powerful rifter. Commonly assumed to be the \\"brother\\" of Maria and heads the acquisition of human minds by rifters. He seeks to kill Brodie, and bears a grudge against Martin. He's able to change his appearance, he doesn't hesitate to kill people, and is able to kill other rifters, in both the Delta State and in reality. His goal and motivation appears to be world domination. *Maria Ragnar: Though one of the \\"bad guys\\", she has deep feelings for Philip and has put herself in danger for him on more than one occasion. She is a powerful rifter in her own right, including the ability to change her appearance in reality, but harbors a healthy fear of Sven's power. *Professor Robert Brodie: The group's guardian and mentor. He was involved in a government project to stop the rifters, but left because he did not want the Delta State to be used for military purposes. It is revealed that he, himself, is a rifter at the end of \\"The Orb.\\" He's shown to be slightly more powerful than Sven, being the only one able to at least hold him at bay. *Karla Schneider: The rifter featured in \\"First Contact\\" who displeased Sven and was disintegrated for her transgression. *Professor Stork: A rifter who was expelled by Luna and Philip in \\"A Case Study.\\" *Dr. Ludwig Von Hayek: A mad scientist rifter who worked at Icharus, perfecting cold fusion as an unlimited power source for rifters. Von Hayek was destroyed by Martin, Philip, Luna, and Claire in \\"Fusion.\\" *Louisa Forterre: The girl Philip has fallen for. Philip expels a rifter from her at the end of \\"The Girlfriend.\\" *Aldous Brant: A human possessed by a rifter 15 years before the beginning of the series. He has Enzio's Rachnosis, a neural degenerative disease, and has less than a year to live. The rifter in Aldous Brant took advantage of a situation to jump into Raymond Woodly, leaving Aldous dying in a coma. *Raymond Woodly: Aldous Brant's best friend and campaign manager. Woodly became possessed when a rifter jumped into him from Brant. The Rifter was NOT expelled at the end of \\"Vote Rifter.\\" *Dr. Van Heusen: A rifter destroyed by Philip, Luna, and Claire in \\"Cabin Fever.\\" =Other= *Dan: Luna's boyfriend. He also works with Martin at \\"Soundz\\", a music store. He is shown to be a fairly skilled computer hacker. Luna explains her situation truthfully to him, which he simply believes without hesitation or further question. *Chantal Thomas: A TV psychic. Brodie described her as \\"sensitive to the vibrations of the membrane of our reality\\". She was found and killed by Sven in \\"The Reading.\\" *Jack Staffer: A friend of Philip's. They met when they both worked at Icharus, in \\"Fusion.\\" Quotes \\"Four young amnesiacs hold the fate of humankind in their hands. Their mission is to protect you from the \\"Rifters\\" who want to control the human mind. They may appear to be harmless and self-absorbed but they have astonishing, paranormal powers and an invincible motivation: To retrieve the secrets to their past lives, hidden deep in the parallel dimension of the Delta State.\\" — Professor R. Brodie, opening credits Release The series was released to DVD soon after its broadcast began, with three-episode volumes being released intermediately. \\"First Contact\\" (episodes 1 – 3) was released on May 16, 2006, followed by \\"The Reading\\" (episodes 4 – 6) on October 10, 2006. The first season, containing all thirteen of its episodes, was made available in a two-disc box set on February 13, 2007. The first season was later re-released by Kaboom Entertainment on October 6, 2009. In the late summer/early fall of 2010, the complete series became available for download from the iTunes Store. The Comic The comic was created by Douglas Gayeton, with artwork by Matt Rockman, in 1996 while both worked at a New York interactive company called Sunshine Digital. Before the project ever hit the bookshelves it was bought by Alphanim, who hired Gayeton to develop the comic as an animated series. He shot the pilot with live actors in Los Angeles on a shoestring budget and took a flash-based vector animation approach to completing the project, all this years before the making of \\"Waking Life\\". After writing the original show bible and directing the pilot for the series Gayeton moved on to other projects, though he remains a fan of the work. To this date the comic has yet to be sold in stores as it is owned by Alphanim. Soundtrack The music for the show was composed by French DJ and producer Kid Loco. Only two tracks from the original soundtrack have been released. The first one is the Delta State theme song, which is an extended version of the main theme. It is available to buy from the iTunes store. The second track is called \\"Another Snake\\" and has been released on a compilation CD called \\"Ethnic Odyssey — Natural Born Travellers\\" in 2007. Other songs from the show have not been officially released.

Atkins and J. de Paula, Atkins' Physical Chemistry, 8th edition (W.H.Freeman 2006), p. 451–2 These two forms are often referred to as spin isomers. Parahydrogen is in a lower energy state than is orthohydrogen. At room temperature and thermal equilibrium, thermal excitation causes hydrogen to consist of approximately 75% orthohydrogen and 25% parahydrogen. When hydrogen is liquified at low temperature, there is a slow spontaneous transition to a predominantly para ratio, with the released energy having implications for storage. Essentially pure parahydrogen form can be obtained at very low temperatures, but it is not possible to obtain a sample containing more than 75% orthohydrogen by heating. A mixture or 50:50 mixture of ortho- and parahydrogen can be made in the laboratory by passing it over an iron(III) oxide catalyst at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) or by storing hydrogen at 77 K for 2–3 hours in the presence of activated charcoal. In the absence of a catalyst, gas phase parahydrogen takes days to relax to normal hydrogen at room temperature while it takes hours to do so in organic solvents.  Nuclear spin states of H2  Each hydrogen molecule (H2) consists of two hydrogen atoms linked by a covalent bond. If we neglect the small proportion of deuterium and tritium which may be present, each hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron. Each proton has an associated magnetic moment, which is associated with the proton's spin of ½. In the H2 molecule, the spins of the two hydrogen nuclei (protons) couple to form a triplet state known as orthohydrogen, and a singlet state known as parahydrogen. The triplet orthohydrogen state has total nuclear spin I = 1 so that the component along a defined axis can have the three values MI = 1, 0, or −1. The corresponding nuclear spin wavefunctions are \\\\left|\\\\uparrow \\\\uparrow \\\\right\\\\rangle, \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(\\\\left|\\\\uparrow \\\\downarrow \\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left|\\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow \\\\right\\\\rangle) and \\\\left|\\\\downarrow \\\\downarrow \\\\right\\\\rangle. This uses standard bra–ket notation; the symbol ↑ represents the spin-up wavefunction and the symbol ↓ the spin-down wavefunction, so ↑↓ means that the first nucleus is up and the second down. Each orthohydrogen energy level then has a (nuclear) spin degeneracy of three, meaning that it corresponds to three states of the same energy (in the absence of a magnetic field). The singlet parahydrogen state has nuclear spin quantum numbers I = 0 and MI = 0, with wavefunction \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(\\\\left|\\\\uparrow \\\\downarrow \\\\right\\\\rangle - \\\\left|\\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow \\\\right\\\\rangle). Since there is only one possibility, each parahydrogen level has a spin degeneracy of one and is said to be non-degenerate.  Allowed rotational energy levels  Since protons have spin ½, they are fermions and the permutational antisymmetry of the total H2 wavefunction imposes restrictions on the possible rotational states the two forms of H2. Orthohydrogen, with symmetric nuclear spin functions, can only have rotational wavefunctions that are antisymmetric with respect to permutation of the two protons, corresponding to odd values of the rotational quantum number J; conversely, parahydrogen with an antisymmetric nuclear spin function, can only have rotational wavefunctions that are symmetric with respect to permutation of the two protons, corresponding to even J. The para form whose lowest level is J = 0 is more stable by 1.06 kJ/mol than the ortho form whose lowest level is J = 1. The ratio between numbers of ortho and para molecules is about 3:1 at standard temperature where many rotational energy levels are populated, favoring the ortho form as a result of thermal energy. However at low temperatures only the J = 0 level is appreciably populated, so that the para form dominates at low temperatures (approx. 99.8% at 20 K).Rock, Peter A., Chemical thermodynamics; principles and applications (Macmillan 1969) Table p.478 shows (No/Np)H2 = 0.002 at 20 K The heat of vaporization is only 0.904 kJ/mol. As a result, ortho liquid hydrogen equilibrating to the para form releases enough energy to cause significant loss by boiling.  Thermal properties  Applying the rigid rotor approximation, the energies and degeneracies of the rotational states are given by:F. T. Wall (1974). Chemical Thermodynamics, 3rd Edition. W. H. Freeman and Company : E_J = \\\\frac{J(J + 1)\\\\hbar^2}{2I};\\\\quad g_J = 2J + 1. The rotational partition function is conventionally written as: : Z_\\\\text{rot} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{J=0}^\\\\infty{g_J e^{-E_J/k_\\\\text{B} T\\\\;}}. However, as long as the two spin isomers are not in equilibrium, it is more useful to write separate partition functions for each: : \\\\begin{align} Z_{\\\\text{para}} &= \\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\text{even }J}{(2J + 1)e^{{-J(J + 1)\\\\hbar^2}/{2Ik_\\\\text{B} T}\\\\;}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ Z_{\\\\text{ortho}} &= 3\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\text{odd }J}{(2J + 1)e^{{-J(J + 1)\\\\hbar^2}/{2Ik_\\\\text{B} T}\\\\;}} \\\\end{align} The factor of 3 in the partition function for orthohydrogen accounts for the spin degeneracy associated with the +1 spin state; when equilibrium between the spin isomers is possible, then a general partition function incorporating this degeneracy difference can be written as: : Z_\\\\text{equil} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{J=0}^\\\\infty{\\\\left(2 - (-1)^{J}\\\\right)(2J + 1)e^{{-J(J + 1)\\\\hbar^2}/{2Ik_\\\\text{B} T}\\\\;}} The molar rotational energies and heat capacities are derived for any of these cases from: : \\\\begin{align} U_\\\\text{rot} &= RT^2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ln Z_\\\\text{rot}}{\\\\partial T} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{v,\\\\text{ rot}} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial U_\\\\text{rot}}{\\\\partial T} \\\\end{align} Plots shown here are molar rotational energies and heat capacities for ortho- and parahydrogen, and the \\"normal\\" ortho/para (3:1) and equilibrium mixtures: Molar rotational energies Molar heat capacities; only rotational and spin contribution is shown. Total value is 1.5R higher due to translational degrees of freedom (rotational degrees were included in the rigid rotor approximation itself). Because of the antisymmetry-imposed restriction on possible rotational states, orthohydrogen has residual rotational energy at low temperature wherein nearly all the molecules are in the J = 1 state (molecules in the symmetric spin-triplet state cannot fall into the lowest, symmetric rotational state) and possesses nuclear-spin entropy due to the triplet state's threefold degeneracy. The residual energy is significant because the rotational energy levels are relatively widely spaced in H2; the gap between the first two levels when expressed in temperature units is twice the characteristic rotational temperature for H2: : \\\\frac{E_{J=1} - E_{J=0}}{k_\\\\text{B}} = 2\\\\theta_\\\\text{rot} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{k_\\\\text{B}I} \\\\approx 174.98\\\\text{ K}. This is the T = 0 intercept seen in the molar energy of orthohydrogen. Since \\"normal\\" room-temperature hydrogen is a 3:1 ortho:para mixture, its molar residual rotational energy at low temperature is (3/4) × 2Rθrot ≈ 1091 J/mol, which is somewhat larger than the enthalpy of vaporization of normal hydrogen, 904 J/mol at the boiling point, Tb ≈ 20.369 K. Notably, the boiling points of parahydrogen and normal (3:1) hydrogen are nearly equal; for parahydrogen ∆Hvap ≈ 898 J/mol at Tb ≈ 20.277 K, and it follows that nearly all the residual rotational energy of orthohydrogen is retained in the liquid state. However, orthohydrogen is thermodynamically unstable at low temperatures and spontaneously converts into parahydrogen. This process lacks any natural de- excitation radiation mode, so it is slow in the absence of a catalyst which can facilitate interconversion of the singlet and triplet spin states. At room temperature, hydrogen contains 75% orthohydrogen, a proportion which the liquefaction process preserves if carried out in the absence of a catalyst like ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds to accelerate the conversion of the liquid hydrogen into parahydrogen. Alternatively, additional refrigeration equipment can be used to slowly absorb the heat that the orthohydrogen fraction will (more slowly) release as it spontaneously converts into parahydrogen. If orthohydrogen is not removed from rapidly liquified hydrogen, without a catalyst, the heat released during its decay can boil off as much as 50% of the original liquid.  History  The unusual heat capacity of hydrogen was discovered in 1912 by Arnold Eucken.A. Eucken, “Die Molekularwärme des Wasserstoffs bei tiefen Temperaturen.” Königlich Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Berlin). Sitzungsberichte (1912): S. 141–151 The two forms of molecular hydrogen were first proposed by Werner Heisenberg and Friedrich Hund in 1927. Taking into account this theoretical framework, pure parahydrogen was first synthesized by Paul Harteck and Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer in 1929.Michael Polanyi and His Generation: Origins of the Social Construction of Science Mary Jo Nye, University of Chicago Press (2011) p.119 When Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 Nobel prize in physics for the creation of quantum mechanics, this discovery of the \\"allotropic forms of hydrogen\\" was singled out as its most noteworthy application.Werner Heisenberg – Facts Nobelprize.org Modern isolation of pure parahydrogen has since been achieved using rapid in-vacuum deposition of millimeters thick solid parahydrogen (p–H2) samples which are notable for their excellent optical qualities.https://web.archive.org/web/20120831182954/http://www.stormingmedia.us/72/7208/A720893.html  Use in NMR  When an excess of parahydrogen is used during hydrogenation reactions (instead of the normal mixture of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen of 3:1), the resultant product exhibits hyperpolarized signals in proton NMR spectra, an effect termed PHIP (Parahydrogen Induced Polarisation) or, equivalently, PASADENA (Parahydrogen And Synthesis Allow Dramatically Enhanced Nuclear Alignment; named for first recognition of the effect by Bowers and Weitekamp of Caltech), a phenomenon that has been used to study the mechanism of hydrogenation reactions. Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a technique to hyperpolarize samples without chemically modifying them. Compared to orthohydrogen or organic molecules, a much greater fraction of the hydrogen nuclei in parahydrogen align with an applied magnetic field. In SABRE, a metal center reversibly binds to both the test molecule and a parahydrogen molecule facilitating the target molecule to pick up the polarization of the parahydrogen. This technique can be improved and utilized for a wide range of organic molecules by using an intermediate \\"relay\\" molecule like ammonia. The ammonia efficiently binds to the metal center and picks up the polarization from the parahydrogen. The ammonia then transfers it other molecules that don't bind as well to the metal catalyst. This enhanced NMR signal allows the rapid analysis of very small amounts of material. Deuterium Diatomic deuterium (D2) has nuclear spin isomers like diatomic hydrogen, but with different populations of the two forms because the deuterium nucleus (deuteron) is a boson with nuclear spin equal to one. There are six possible nuclear spin wave functions which are ortho or symmetric to exchange of the two nuclei, and three which are para or antisymmetric. Ortho states correspond to even rotational levels with symmetric rotational functions so that the total wavefunction is symmetric as required for the exchange of two bosons, and para states correspond to odd rotational levels. The ground state (J = 0) populated at low temperature is ortho, and at standard temperature the ortho:para ratio is 2:1.  Other substances with spin isomers  Other molecules and functional groups containing two hydrogen atoms, such as water and methylene, also have ortho- and para- forms (e.g. orthowater and parawater), but this is of little significance for their thermal properties. Their ortho-para ratios differ from that of dihydrogen. Molecular oxygen () also exists in three lower-energy triplet states and one singlet state, as ground-state paramagnetic triplet oxygen and energized highly reactive diamagnetic singlet oxygen. These states arise from the spins of their unpaired electrons, not their protons or nuclei.

Haddock achieved national fame when, between the ages of 88 and 90, starting on January 1, 1999, and culminating on February 29, 2000, she walked over across the continental United States to advocate for campaign finance reform. In 2004, she ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic challenger to incumbent Republican Judd Gregg for the U.S. Senate. Haddock's walk across the country followed a southern route and took more than a year to complete, starting on January 1, 1999, in southern California and ending in Washington, D.C., on February 29, 2000. Haddock requested a name change of her middle name to \\"Granny D\\", the name by which she had long been known. On August 19, 2004, Haddock's request was officially granted by Judge John Maher during a hearing at the Cheshire County probate court. Personal life Ethel Doris Rollins was born in Laconia, New Hampshire. She attended Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts, for three years before marrying James Haddock. Emerson students were not allowed to marry at that time, so she was expelled. She was, however, later awarded an honorary degree in 2000. After marrying, she started a family; she had a daughter, Betty and a son, James Jr.. She worked during the Great Depression and was employed for twenty years as an executive secretary in the offices of the BeeBee Shoe factory in Manchester, New Hampshire. Haddock and her husband retired to Dublin, New Hampshire, in 1972. Her husband later developed Alzheimer's disease, dying after a ten-year struggle with the illness. At about the same time, Haddock's best friend died. During her 1999 walk across the nation, the hat that Haddock was seen in was one that belonged originally to her best friend. Haddock had eight grandchildren: Heidi, Gillian, David Bradley, William, Alice, Joseph, Lawrence, and Raphael. She also had 16 great-grandchildren: Kyle, David, Jennie, Kendall, Peyton, Matthew, Richard, Grace, Justin, William, James, Beatrix, Tucker, Mathilda, Parker, and Clay. Haddock celebrated her 100th birthday on January 24, 2010, and died six weeks later on March 9, 2010, at her son's home in Dublin, New Hampshire, following a bout with respiratory illness. She was a life-long member of the United Methodist Church. Activist career In 1960, Haddock began her political activism when she and her husband successfully campaigned against planned hydrogen bomb nuclear testing in Alaska that threatened an Inuit fishing village at Point Hope. The couple retired to Dublin, New Hampshire, in 1972, and there, she served on the Planning Board and was active in the community. =Campaign finance reform advocate= Doris \\"Granny D\\" Haddock speaking at a podium outside the U.S. Capitol after her walk from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. After the first efforts of Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold to regulate campaign finances through eliminating soft money failed in 1995, Granny D became increasingly interested in campaign finance reform and spearheaded a petition movement. On January 1, 1999, at the age of 88, Granny D left the Rose Bowl Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, in an attempt to walk across the United States to raise awareness of and attract support for campaign finance reform. Granny D walked roughly ten miles each day for 14 months, traversing California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, making many speeches along the way. The trek attracted a great deal of attention in the mass media. When Granny D arrived in Washington, D.C., she was 90 years old (having begun the journey at 88 and having two birthdays en route), had traveled more than 3,200 miles, and was greeted in the capital by a crowd of 2,200 people. Several dozen members of Congress walked the final miles with her during the final day's walk from Arlington National Cemetery to the Capitol on the National Mall. In the 2000 presidential election, Haddock endorsed Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. =Arrest at the Capitol= On April 21, 2000, 90 year old Granny D, with 31 other Americans, was arrested for reading the Declaration of Independence in the Capitol and charged with the offense of Demonstrating in the Capitol Building. It was said to be a peaceable assembly, but the demonstrators were arrested by Capitol Police. She entered a plea of guilty, then made a statement to the court reiterating \\"campaign finance reform\\" as the purpose of their demonstration. The judge sentenced Granny D and her companions to time served and a $10 administrative fee. Post-election Granny D wrote three books, all co-authored with Dennis Burke. In 2005, she gave the commencement speech at Hampshire College. She was awarded an honorary degree by Franklin Pierce College on October 21, 2002. Granny D became the Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in New Hampshire during the 2004 election when the leading Democratic primary candidate left the race unexpectedly (days before the filing deadline), because of a campaign-finance scandal. Haddock was, at 94, one of the oldest major-party candidates to ever run for the U.S. Senate. True to her \\"clean elections\\" ideals, Haddock funded her late-entry campaign by accepting only modest private-citizen donations. She captured approximately 34 percent of the vote (221,549), losing to incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Judd Gregg, as he sought his third term. Gregg won about 66 percent (434,847) of the ballot. In 2007 HBO released a documentary, Run Granny Run, directed by Marlo Poras, about Granny D's 2004 Senate campaign. In 2009, she founded Coalition for Open Democracy. Granny D continued to be active in politics to the end of her life, and celebrated her 98th, 99th and 100th birthdays by lobbying for campaign finance reform at the New Hampshire State House.

The Royal Air Force officially credited Brown with shooting down Manfred von Richthofen, the \\"Red Baron\\", although it is now considered all but certain by historians, doctors, and ballistics experts that Richthofen was actually killed by a machine gunner firing from the ground.Franks & Bennett (1997) Early years Brown was born to upper-middle-class parents in Carleton Place, west of Ottawa. His family home still exists, located at 38 Mill Street, just down from the Town Hall. Another source, the Carleton Place and Beckwith Heritage Museum, refers to the family home as being on Judson Street, and says that this was his birthplace.Carleton Place and Beckwith Heritage Museum, \\"Captain A. Roy Brown – A Reluctant Hero.\\" http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/community- stories_histoires-de-chez-nous/capt-a-roy-brown-reluctant-hero_heros-malgre- lui/story/the-brown-family/ That house also still exists.Photo circa 1990 here: http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/community-stories_histoires-de-chez- nous/capt-a-roy-brown-reluctant-hero_heros-malgre-lui/gallery/judson-street- house/ Google Earth streetview shows street address as 146. He was the middle of five children. He had two older sisters, Margaret and Bessie, and two younger brothers, Horace and Howard. His father had started business as a miller, but branched out into electrical generation when the first power grids were being set up around the start of the 20th century. His father eventually owned a power company in the town. Though Brown did well in high school, he transferred to a business school to study accounting to eventually take over the family business. Following this course, he wanted to continue to university to study business administration, but he needed his high school matriculation, which he technically did not have. He took a course at the Victoria High School in Edmonton from 1913 to 1915 to get his high-school diploma. There he befriended Wilfrid R. \\"Wop\\" May. Flight training Brown enlisted in 1915 as an Officer Cadet at the Army Officers' Training. As a prerequisite to joining the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), Brown received flight training at the Wright Flying School near Dayton, Ohio, from September to November 1915. He was awarded Aero Club of America Pilot's Certificate No. 361 on 13 November, and was confirmed as a flight sub-lieutenant in the RNAS on the 15th. Wartime service Brown set sail for England on 22 November 1915 and underwent further training at Chingford. On 2 May 1916, Brown crashed his Avro 504 emerging apparently unscathed, though next morning he experienced severe back pain as he had broken a vertebra. He spent two months in hospital and in September 1916 was posted to Eastchurch Gunnery School. In January 1917, he was sent to Cranwell to complete advanced training. In March 1917, Brown was posted to No. 9 Naval Squadron, flying coastal patrols off the Belgian coast in Sopwith Pups. In April, \\"B\\" Flight, which included Brown, was attached to the Army's Royal Flying Corps to assist during the Battle of Arras. Brown fell ill at this time and missed \\"Bloody April\\", a period when British casualties were very high. In June 1917, Brown was posted to No. 11 Naval Squadron, and in July he was briefly posted to No. 4 Naval Squadron before returning to No. 11 Naval Squadron later that month. On 17 July, he achieved his first \\"kill\\", an Albatros D.III, while flying a Pup, and gathered another three unconfirmed kills. No. 11 was disbanded in mid-August 1917, and Brown returned to No. 9, equipped with the Sopwith Camel. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 October, and on 6 October, Brown was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). His citation read: Soon after, Brown was made a flight commander, a role in which he excelled. No. 9 was posted to the Somme area in early 1918, and was forced to retreat during the German spring offensive between 20 and 29 March. The tempo of operations increased, with the entire squadron typically flying two missions a day. Colonel Raymond Collishaw noted on an April visit that Brown looked exhausted: he had lost , his hair was prematurely turning grey, and his eyes were bloodshot and sunken. Also eating contaminated rabbit had left him severely sickened with gastritis. Against Collishaw's suggestions, Brown refused to quit flying, and shot down another two aircraft on 11 and 12 April. On 1 April 1918, the RFC and RNAS were merged into the Royal Air Force. Brown's No. 9 Squadron RNAS became No. 209 Squadron RAF. Fighting the Red Baron Wop May. Manfred von Richthofen. 209 Squadron emblem. motto: An eagle volant recursant descendant in pale, wings overture On the morning of 21 April 1918, No. 209 was on patrol when they became engaged in combat with fighters of Jagdstaffel 11, led by Manfred von Richthofen, the \\"Red Baron\\". A newcomer to No. 209, Brown's school friend, Lieutenant Wilfrid \\"Wop\\" May, had been instructed to stay clear of any fight and watch. May noticed an enemy pilot doing the same thing. That pilot was the Red Baron's cousin, Lt. Wolfram von Richthofen, who had been given the same instructions as May. May attacked Wolfram and soon found himself in the main fight, firing at several fleeting targets until his guns jammed. May dived out of the fight, and Manfred von Richthofen gave chase down to ground level. Brown saw May in trouble and dived steeply in an attempt to rescue his friend. His attack was necessarily of fairly short duration, as he was obliged to climb steeply to avoid crashing into the ground, losing sight for the moment of both Richthofen and May. What happened next remains controversial to this day, but it seems highly probable that Richthofen turned to avoid Brown's attack, and then, instead of climbing out of reach of ground fire and prudently heading for home, remained at low altitude and resumed his pursuit of May, who was still zig-zagging, as he had not noticed that Richthofen had been momentarily distracted. It would have been physically impossible for Richthofen to have done this had he already received the wound from which he died. May and Richthofen's route now took them at low level over the heavily defended Allied front line. Franks and Bennett have suggested that Richthofen had become lost, as the winds that day were blowing the \\"wrong way\\", towards the west, and the fight had drifted over to the Allied side. The front was also in a highly fluid state at the time, in contrast to the more common static trench lines earlier in the Great War, and landmarks can be confusing in very low level flight. Australian machine gunners on the ground fired at Richthofen, who eventually crashed near the Australian trenches. Brown's initial combat report was that the fight with Richthofen was \\"indecisive\\" – this was altered by his commanding officer to \\"decisive\\". Modern historical consensus suggests that Australian anti-aircraft gunner Sergeant Cedric Popkin is the person most likely to have been responsible for the shot that actually downed the Baron. Brown was officially credited with the kill by the RAF, shortly after receiving a Bar to his DSC, at least partly in recognition of this feat. The citation read: Later years Nine days after the combat with von Richthofen, Brown was admitted to hospital with influenza and nervous exhaustion. In June, he was posted to No. 2 School of Air Fighting as an instructor. He was involved in a bad air crash on 15 July, and spent five months in hospital. Brown left the RAF in 1919 and returned to Canada where he took up work as an accountant at a small town grocery store. He also founded a small airline in 1928, General Airways Limited and worked for a while as editor of Canadian Aviation. When the Second World War broke out, he attempted to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force, but was refused. He instead entered politics, losing an election for the Ontario legislature in 1943. He later purchased a farm near Stouffville, Ontario. Brown was inducted into the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame in 2015. Brown died on 9 March 1944, of a heart attack, in Stouffville, Ontario shortly after posing for a photograph with a current Canadian flying ace, George Beurling. He was 50 years old. He is buried, with his wife, Edythe, in the Toronto Necropolis. Memorials, tributes and relics Some time in 1918, Brown acquired the seat of the Fokker triplane in which Richthofen made his final flight; in 1920 he donated his souvenir to the Royal Canadian Military Institute. A memorial plaque titled \\"Captain A. Roy Brown, D.S.C. 1893–1944\\", was erected at the Carleton Place Public Library by the Ontario Heritage Foundation, in memory of Brown. In November 2012, the town of Carleton Place further paid tribute to Brown with a prominent mural on the town's main street. A museum dedicated to Brown was also opened in Carleton Place. In 2015, Brown was posthumously inducted into Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame. In 2016, a new headstone was erected for Brown. The stone was unveiled by his niece, Carol Nicholson and Nadine Carter.http://www.yorkregion.com/community-story/6748559-ureport-remembering- captain-arthur-roy-brown/ Brown in film and fiction Although Roy Brown has left a much smaller mark in popular culture than Manfred von Richthofen's, his legacy is remembered sporadically. Brown was portrayed by Don Stroud in the 1971 film Von Richthofen and Brown. He is depicted as a cynical, cocky, ruthless rebel without a cause who doesn't believe in honour. He bullies his way to leadership and has his squadron hunt in packs with a plane as bait. This movies depicts Brown being responsible for Richthofen's death. In the 2008 film The Red Baron, he was played by Joseph Fiennes. Brown is depicted as being shot down by Richthofen in 1916 and subsequently escaping from a German Prisoner of War camp. Later, Brown and Richthofen are forced to ditch their aircraft in no man's land, where they share a friendly drink.

Written and directed by David Fury, it is the 100th episode of the series, and originally broadcast on February 4, 2004 on the WB network. In \\"You're Welcome,\\" former series regular Charisma Carpenter returns as a guest star, when the character of Cordelia Chase miraculously awakens from her coma. It is her duty to put Angel, who has recently been feeling ineffective at fighting the powers of darkness, back on the right path. Meanwhile, Angel's old enemy Lindsey McDonald has resurfaced and is plotting revenge. This episode features the death and final onscreen appearance of Cordelia. The episode was written to reinforce the show's earlier themes, and examine the evolution of the characters in the show's one hundred episodes. The original plan was for Sarah Michelle Gellar to return as Buffy Summers, but when she could not appear due to the death of her aunt and work obligations, it instead focused on rounding off the character of Cordelia. The episode proved generally popular with critics, who praised Charisma Carpenter's final performance as Cordelia and the sense of resolution for the character. Plot In a hospital room, Cordelia jolts out of her coma after experiencing a vision of the symbols painted on Eve's apartment door and tattooed on Lindsey's (Christian Kane) chest. Angel elaborates on his decision to resign from his position of CEO of Wolfram & Hart's L.A. office, saying instead of ridding the world of evil, they are now negotiating with, or for, evil. As Gunn argues that quitting may incur dire consequences, he is interrupted by a phone call from the hospital, with the news that Cordelia has awoken from her coma. Angel and Wesley arrive at Cordelia's hospital room and see a woman's body lying in bed, partially covered by drapes (head not visible), who they assume is Cordelia. When Angel calls out her name, Cordelia suddenly appears from the opposite side of the room saying, \\"Yep, that chick's in rough shape. You'd think they'd give Miss One-Foot-in-the-Grave her own room.\\" She then closes the drapes. Back at Wolfram & Hart, Cordelia asks after Connor, which surprises Angel, who thought he was the only one to remember his son. Cordy later reveals the vision that woke her from the coma showed Angel in grave danger. Eve enters, despite being banned, saying Angel has no control over the liaison for the Senior Partners. Meanwhile, Spike complains to Lindsey (who is impersonating Doyle) that the deranged slayer Lindsey/Doyle sent him after ended up chopping off his hands. Lindsey/Doyle reveals he also had one of his hands cut off. Angel finds Cordelia watching an Angel Investigations commercial Doyle (Glenn Quinn) recorded more than four years earlier, shortly before his death and she notes Doyle gave his life to guarantee that Angel kept fighting. She subtly quotes Doyle's final words about the fight against evil: \\"I get that now.\\" Cordelia accuses Angel of letting Wolfram & Hart seduce him with glamor and power, but Angel says he took the job only so his son Connor could have a happy, stable life. Later, Cordelia apologizes to Wesley (Alexis Denisof) for killing Lilah while under Jasmine's control. She finds the strange symbols from her vision in a book, and Wesley recognizes them as runes to protect and conceal, effective against modern surveillance. In the basement of W&H;, Lindsey (invisible to the guards monitoring the video screens) passes into a restricted area. He uses a crystal as a key, allowing an underground tank to rise. Spike bites Cordelia until Angel fights him off. Spike explains he was tasting whether she was evil, as his source claimed. Angel questions the source, and Spike says it was \\"Doyle\\", the tattooed man who gets visions from the Powers That Be. Angel confronts Eve, suggesting she is working with the Doyle impersonator who has been manipulating Spike. Harmony says, being \\"technically evil\\", she doesn't mind torturing Eve, after which Eve quickly confesses Lindsey is activating a fail-safe left by the Senior Partners specifically designed to destroy Angel. When Spike unwittingly mentions \\"Doyle\\" had a hand chopped off, Angel deduces that \\"Doyle\\" is in fact former W&H; crony Lindsey McDonald. Wesley says he and Fred will perform a spell to counter-act Lindsey's tattoos, while the others attempt to disable the fail-safe. In the rooms below, Angel battles Lindsey, who is wreathed in protective strength from his tattooed runes. Cordelia throws Angel a katana; while Angel and Lindsey sword-fight she removes the crystal from the control panel, causing the fail-safe to descend into the floor. Wesley and Fred perform a spell that causes Lindsey's tattoos to float off of his body, leaving him unprotected from detection by the Senior Partners. Lindsey is sucked upwards into a portal. Upstairs, Angel is left alone with Cordelia, who confesses that the Powers That Be owed her one. Angel says he doesn't understand and she said she got what she wanted. Cordelia tells Angel that she is now on a different path and must leave. She heads out the door but then runs back to Angel, and they kiss passionately. This was their first real kiss, though they did kiss while under a mystical influence in the third season \\"Waiting in the Wings.\\" A ringing telephone interrupts, and as Angel picks up the receiver after Cordelia sadly tells him he needs to, Cordelia says, \\"Oh, and you're welcome.\\" The voice on the phone says that Cordelia has died. Angel's office is suddenly empty; Cordelia has vanished. Angel realizes Cordelia never awoke from her coma. He hangs up the telephone and says, \\"Thank you.\\" Production The fight scene between Lindsey and Angel in the underground chamber, which took three days to film, was written by Steven S. DeKnight. Christian Kane, who went through two-and-a-half months of sword training for his role in Secondhand Lions, approached the writers to see if they could work his new skills into the episode; Kane ended up performing his own stunts for the sword fight sequence, including wire work. He also did his own stunts for the scene when Lindsey moves through the lasers in the tunnel, which were not CGI, but actual lasers. During the fight scene between Eve and Harmony, Sarah Thompson says Mercedes McNab slapped her accidentally. \\"She was... so worried she'd hurt me but it actually worked well for the take because I reacted by really screaming,\\" Thompson says. David Boreanaz had just had knee surgery prior to filming, so writer David Fury did his best to keep Angel sitting down as much as possible.Fury, David, \\"You're Welcome\\" (Commentary with David Fury), Angel: Season Five on DVD, Twentieth Century Fox, 2004. Fury used tight camera angles during Spike's apartment scene with Lindsey to disguise the fact that the same set was used earlier for the opening teaser. \\"Everything is a bit contained; the reason is if I turn around, this is where they found the dead nuns,\\" Fury explains. =Writing= Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the \\"mission statement\\" of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to - through Cordelia, who was \\"there at the beginning\\" - ask of Angel, \\"Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how do you feel about that?\\" The return to the show's \\"original concerns\\" is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel \\"You forgot who you are,\\" bringing back the show's link to the city. This episode, written as a stand-alone as per the network's request, also sets up a critical plot-thread for the season arc that \\"will begin to reveal itself toward the end of the season,\\" Whedon says. The character of Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode, focusing on the rivalry between Angel and Spike and their feelings for Buffy, but Sarah Michelle Gellar was unavailable. Writer/director David Fury explains that since \\"we couldn't get Sarah,\\" the episode was instead written for Cordelia Chase. He adds, \\"This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic.\\"Jozic, Mike, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Post Mortem Week 6; David Fury\\" Meanwhile... (September, 2004). In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because \\"the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon,\\" says Fury. Christian Kane was genuinely upset when an addition by Joss Whedon in the script called for Angel to refer to Lindsey as a \\"tiny Texan.\\" Although born in Texas, Kane identifies as a \\"Sooner\\" and \\"I'm stronger than David, bigger than David, I'm just shorter.\\" Kane says Joss \\"likes to take shots at me. He's like, 'I can't build this character up too much without cutting his nuts just a little bit.'\\" Cast Carpenter says she was satisfied with the way her character left the show, as she feels Cordelia's story has been fully resolved. Creator Joss Whedon agreed, saying, \\"In seven years, we'd sort of run through our course of [the] character and didn't want to start just doing hollow riffs on what we'd done.\\" Since Whedon suspected this season would be the last, Carpenter says, \\"we didn't want to just leave Cordelia in a coma..this would be a very big story left untold.\\" Carpenter says the 100th episode was a momentous time to have her character die, calling it \\"bittersweet...a love letter to Cordelia\\" and the story \\"one of the sweetest they'd ever told.\\" David Fury agrees: \\"It's a beautiful farewell to Charisma for the series\\" and it gives \\"Charisma a send off that was respectful to her and Cordelia Chase. I was very proud to have my name on it.\\" Actor Christian Kane says he had a difficult time calling himself 'Doyle' because he felt on some level he was masquerading as deceased Glenn Quinn. \\"It was a very awkward situation for me and David because we were close to Glenn,\\" says Kane. \\"I didn't know how the fans were going to react to it.\\" Kane says the memory of Quinn upset Boreanaz: \\"I could see it in his eyes... it’s got to be a tough deal for him.\\" However, Kane thinks that \\"Joss is brilliant because he used that. How do you turn me and David against each other? You really can’t because we’re such close friends. So to use that for Angel and Lindsey, I think has a little bit of brilliance to it. It’s kind of sick...but it did the job.\\" David Fury adds, \\"I think [the fans] appreciated it from the standpoint that we were honoring him. That Doyle's not a forgotten piece of this world.\\" Reception This episode was rated as one of the series' top five episodes in a poll done by Angel Magazine. TV Guide praised Charisma Carpenter's \\"blithe comic delivery\\"; the BBC noted that Carpenter's return elevated the script from \\"merely great to something close to awesome,\\" but griped because the show's tight budget left Lindsey's activation of the fail-safe an \\"unfulfilled promise.\\" Reaction to the death of long-time character Cordelia was generally positive. After being disgusted by Cordelia's fourth season arc, which she claims \\"destroyed Cordy's character and viewer trust\\", author Jennifer Crusie applauds this episode. \\"The writers play fair,\\" she says, \\"foreshadowing the Gotcha to come\\" - Cordelia is in a private room, yet hastily draws the curtains around a bed-ridden roommate, and remarks to Angel that she understands why Doyle used his \\"last breath to make sure [Angel] kept fighting.\\" Rather than undercutting the emotional impact of the story, the twist of Cordelia's tragic ending reinforces and honors her character. \\"She is...our Cordy again,\\" Crusie says. Cordelia exits the series \\"needed, loved, and wanted\\"; her final words are \\"You're welcome,\\" Janine R. Harrison argues, because \\"she knows her worth.\\" References External links  Angel (season 5) episodes 2004 American television episodes ","title":"You're Welcome (Angel)"},{"id":"997746","text":"An Otter is an aquatic or marine carnivorous mammal.

Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity (Edinburgh: University Press, 1991), p. 81. Tradition states that ‘Ezana succeeded his father Ella Amida (Ousanas) while still a child and his mother, Sofya served as regent. He conquered the Kingdom of Kush around the year 350 AD. Reign ‘Ezana was the first monarch of the Kingdom of Aksum to embrace Christianity, and the first after Za Haqala (possibly Zoskales) to be mentioned by contemporary historians, a situation that lead S. C. Munro-Hay to comment that he was \\"the most famous of the Aksumite kings before Kaleb.\\"Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 77 His childhood tutor, the Syrian Christian Frumentius, became head of the Ethiopian Church. A surviving letter from the Arian Roman emperor Constantius II is addressed to ‘Ezana and his brother Saizana and requests that Frumentius be sent to Alexandria to be examined for doctrinal errors and be replaced by Theophilos the Indian; Munro-Hay assumes that ‘Ezana either refused or ignored this request.Munro-Hay, Aksum, pp. 78ff ‘Ezana also launched several military campaigns, which he recorded in his inscriptions. A pair of inscriptions on a stela in Ge'ez found at Meroë is thought of as evidence of a campaign in the fourth century, either during ‘Ezana's reign, or by a predecessor like Ousanas. While some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Aksumites destroyed the kingdom of Meroë, others note that archeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Meroë around 300.Munro-Hay, Aksum, pp. 79, 224. Moreover, some view the stela as military aid from Aksum to Meroë to quell the revolt and rebellion by the Nuba. However, conclusive evidence and proof to which view is correct is not currently available. On some of the Aksumite coins minted during ‘Ezana's reign appears the motto in Greek TOYTOAPECHTHXWPA – \\"May this please the people\\". Munro-Hay comments that this motto is \\"a rather attractive peculiarity of Aksumite coinage, giving a feeling of royal concern and responsibility towards the people's wishes and contentment\\".Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 192. A number of coins minted bearing his name were found in the late 1990s at archeological sites in India, indicating trade contacts in that country.Details in Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 31 n.18. A remarkable feature of the coins is a shift from a pagan motif with disc and crescent to a design with a cross. ‘Ezana is also credited for erecting several stelae and obelisks. Ezana is unknown in the King Lists even though the coins bear this name. According to tradition, Emperors Abreha and Asbeha ruled Ethiopia when Christianity was introduced.

It passes over the Anacostia River via the Ethel Kennedy Bridge into the neighborhood of Benning. It continues southeast across East Capitol Street into the southeast quadrant, crossing Southern Avenue and the D.C.-Maryland boundary into Maryland, ending at an intersection with Marlboro Pike (a former alignment of Maryland Route 4).

In 1920, the Army Corps of Engineers used material dredged from the Anacostia to build Kingman Island and Kingman Lake, which Benning Road crossed over top of. Previously it had crossed the mudflats along the Anacostia on a causeway. In 1929, a concrete culvert was installed under Benning Road to create a connection between the two sections of Kingman Lake. At the time, 92% of the city's electricity passed under the road and the WB&A; railroad ran along it. The bridge created by the culvert was replaced in 2000 In 1955, the department of transportation built two ramps connecting Benning Road to DC-295. In 1988, the ramp from 295 to Benning road was rehabilitated. A 1956 photo of the original Benning Road Viaduct, built in 1919. Benning Road was long bisected by railroad lines owned by the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad and the B&O; Railroad. In 1917 work began on the Benning Road Viaduct and Bridge that would carry the road over the tracks. That work was completed in 1919. In 1937, the road was widened and a 2nd viaduct built next to the 1919 one. The old one became the eastbound bridge and the new one the westbound bridge. The westbound bridge was replaced in 1959 and the eastbound bridge in 1961, because the existing bridges could no longer carry the necessary weight. The westbound bridge had its entire deck removed and replaced in 1982 and the eastbound bridge deck was replaced in 1988. In 2007, the District Council voted to rename the Benning Road Viaduct and Bridge (by then called the \\"Benning Road Bridge\\") over the railroad tracks between 34th Street, N. E., and Minnesota Avenue, N. E. the Lorraine H. Whitlock Memorial Bridge. In 2008, the Benning Road Bridge over the Anacostia was renamed the Ethel Kennedy Bridge after the widow of the late Robert F. Kennedy, for whom a nearby stadium was named. In a May 20, 2014 ceremony, the bridge was officially renamed the Ethel Kennedy Bridge to honor her for her devotion to many social and environmental causes during her later years, especially in the neighborhoods along and near the Anacostia River. In 2009, work commenced on a $38 million improvement project for the road which included adding streetcar tracks. The DC Streetcar line was anticipated to open in 2014, but it did not actually open until February 27, 2016.

The entire length of SR 620 is also known as Braddock Road (except for a small section in Centreville called Spindle Court). SR 620 also has a short concurrency with SR 659 / Union Mill Road in Centreville. In Centreville and Eastern Loudoun County, SR 620 is a major commuter route, as it empties onto SR 28 (Sully Rd.), which in turn has a nearby interchange with Interstate 66. SR 620 also has major junctions with SR 123, Fairfax County Parkway, and Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway). It has a very large number of residential neighborhoods lining the road, so most of the remainder is also a major commuter artery. The length and positioning of the highway attract motorists that are traveling from one part of Fairfax County to another.  Route description  =East and Central Fairfax County= SR 620 begins in Fairfax County at Columbia Pike (SR 244) near Lake Barcroft and runs southward, crossing the Little River Turnpike. It then intersects the Capital Beltway, Interstate 495. SR 620, heading westward at this point, then passes north of Burke and intersects SR 123 near George Mason University. It remains well south of Fairfax City and meets the freeway portion of Fairfax County Parkway. It then intersects SR 645 (Clifton Road) in Clifton, and next meets Union Mill Road. At this point, the road becomes New Braddock Road and SR 7783. New Braddock Road continues to SR 28. =In Centreville= While New Braddock Road continues straight, SR 620 itself is concurrent with SR 659 / Union Mill Road for one block. A new segment of Braddock Road (which shortly matches the old alignment of Braddock Road) starts here and heads west into Centreville. However, SR 620 quickly turns off onto a side-street, Spindle Court, and unceremoniously dead-ends behind Mountain View Alternative High School, creating another gap. The road that was SR 620 continues ahead as Old Braddock Road, SR 7759. Old Braddock Road continues ahead to Old Centreville Road (SR 898). That road connects to the beginning of the third segment of Braddock Road, which is located at a four-way intersection with US 29. This third segment was originally connected with what is now Spindle Court, but when a shopping center was built, a dead end on Braddock Road was created, and was renamed Spindle Ct. This segment only lasts for 0.32 mile, before turning into Pickwick Road (SR 1021). =Western Fairfax County= Braddock Road picks up again on the other side of I-66, at an intersection with SR 28. This fourth segment of SR 620 continues to the northwest, through several residential areas. It intersects with SR 609 (Pleasant Valley Road) and enters Loudoun County. =Loudoun County= Keeping the SR 620 designation, Braddock Road forms the southern border of South Riding where it intersects with and is the southern terminus of Loudoun County Parkway, SR 606. It then intersects with SR 659 (Gum Spring Road). It ends at the roundabout with SR 705 (Lightridge Farm Rd.) in Stone Ridge. Braddock Road, now designated SR 705, continues northwest to US 15 near Gilberts Corner. North Springfield Among the cities, towns and other landmarks traversed by SR 620 are: *the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology lies near the intersection with Little River Turnpike *Annandale *an intersection with the Capital Beltway *Burke *George Mason University *Centreville *Sully Station *South Riding Future construction Many residents oppose the possible new construction of a shopping center at the southwestern corner of the intersection of SR 620 and SR 659 (Gum Springs Road), directly behind the Virginia Manor neighborhood, due to concerns of increased traffic. Loudoun County supervisors will vote on a proposal in September 2019 for a different shopping center, located at the southeastern corner of the intersection. This proposal would include a new intersection being constructed for an entrance off SR 620 to the shopping center. Fairfax County is currently considering changes to SR 620 between Guinea Road and I-495. These include the improvement of pedestrian walkways and reconfiguration of certain intersections to decrease congestion in the area. https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/transportation/sites/transportation/files/assets/documents/pdf/transportation%20projects,%20studies%20and%20plans/braddock%20road%20multimodal%20study/braddock_road_final_project_announcement_final_8-21.pdf The county's Department of Transportation has ruled out adding travel lanes to SR 620 or constructing a new park-and-ride and transit center due to the high costs. https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/transportation/sites/transportation/files/assets/documents/pdf/transportation%20projects,%20studies%20and%20plans/braddock%20road%20multimodal%20study/braddock%20road%20mm%20study%20report_2018-05-09.pdf History Historically, SR 620 was known as Braddock Road. The road has historical significance in the American Civil War, and portions of the road were established prior to British colonization of northern Virginia. Although the original Braddock Road was unified throughout its length, many portions of the original road have been transected, relocated or disjointed since the original path was defined (especially since the modern paved road system was constructed). =Establishment, including pre-colonization era= Braddock Road was originally composed of paths established by the Native American inhabitants of Northern Virginia. Later, British colonialists and Virginian governments developed and improved the paths into what became known as \\"Braddock's Road.\\" =Colonial and revolutionary era= Price's Common, a market that operated during the colonial administration and was the site of the drafting of the Virginia Declaration of Rights signed by George Mason (and after which the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution was modeled), was located by the intersection of Braddock Road and Backlick Road. Braddock Rd is so named as it was believed to be the route of the English General Edward Braddock's force during the French and Indian War. At the outset of the Braddock Expedition, the force was split into two groups. Braddock led the first group across the Potomac near Rock Creek and up to Frederick and Sir Peter Halkett led a second group through Northern Virginia. Halkett's group marched past the Old Fairfax County courthouse (today Tysons Corner) and up to Coleman's Ordinary (today Northern Herndon, Virginia). It is unlikely that today's Braddock Road was the actual route taken by Halkett's group. Rather, they roughly followed the route of present-day Leesburg Pike (Route 7). =Civil War= During the American Civil War, both Union and Confederate troops traversed Braddock Road during various battles in Fairfax County and other parts of Northern Virginia. One of Mosby's Raiders, Robert Spindle, was a native of Centreville. Later, the part of SR 620 that was formed when Braddock Road was cut at US 29 was named after him, Spindle Court.Centreville and Virginia Run History p. 5 Retrieved November 11, 2009 =Modern era= With the advent of the modern road system, Braddock Road changed. In the 1930s after the Virginia Secondary Road system was createdGetting Roads Accepted into the Secondary System of State Highways Retrieved June 17, 2009 Braddock Road in Fairfax and Loudoun Counties was given the designation SR 620. In the 1960s I-66 was built coming through Centreville. At this point the section of SR 620 between SR28 south of I-66 and a point north of the new I-66 was deleted, and a new SR 620 entrance was created intersecting with SR 28 north of I-66. When SR 28 was widened from a 4-lane highway to a 6-lane one SR 620 was changed again. SR 620 south of I-66 no longer intersected with SR 28; SR 620 ended where Willoughby Newton Drive is now. In the 1980s a shopping center was built at the corner of U.S. 29 and Old Centreville Road. At that time the non-SR 620 section of Braddock Road was constructed linking SR 620 to Old Centreville Road. The intersection between SR 620 and U.S. 29 was cut, and this small portion of SR 620 was renamed Spindle Court. The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors undertook an effort in 1989 to give the county's roads names that were determined to be more historically accurate. The plan proposed to rename the county's portion of Braddock Road to Colchester Road, but this single change was removed immediately before adoption. Loudoun County Board of Supervisors: In the 1990s New Braddock Road was constructed linking Union Mill Road to SR 28. This is when SR 620 was cut, so that, on the east side of Union Mill Road, the road is Braddock Road, and on the west side it is New Braddock Road. Braddock Road heading west now intersects with Union Mill Road one block to the north. The final change came in 2009. A barrier was erected on SR 28 that forced all traffic coming from SR 620 from the west to turn south on SR 28. Fairfax County considered changing the intersection between SR 123 and SR 620 to a full interchange. The designs considered are diamond, a modified diamond interchange, an SPUI, and a tight SPUI.123 / Braddock Rd. Interchange Presentation March 4, 2009 Retrieved November 29, 2009 Ultimately, one left turn lane in each direction of SR 123 was added at the intersection, the left turn lane on eastbound SR 620 was extended, and new traffic signals were installed. https://relations.gmu.edu/Route-123-and-Braddock-Road- Presentation.pdf Major intersections References 620 Fairfax and Loudoun State Route 620 State Route 620 State Route 620 State Route 620 ","title":"Virginia State Route 620 (Fairfax and Loudoun Counties)"},{"id":"997774","text":"Branch Avenue may refer to: *Branch Avenue (WMATA station) *A name for part of Maryland Route 5, and its continuation into Washington, DC ","title":"Branch Avenue"},{"id":"997777","text":"Capitol Heights may refer to some locations in the United States: *Capitol Heights, Maryland, a town adjacent to Washington, DC **Capitol Heights (Washington Metro), a transit station *Capitol Heights (Harrisburg), a neighborhood in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania ","title":"Capitol Heights"},{"id":"997782","text":"Pindamonhangaba is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, located in the Paraíba valley, between the two most active production and consumption regions in the country, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Six years later, on May 17, 1649, the area was formalized as a land grant and donated to the captain. It seems there is no information about what occurred between that date and August 12, 1672, so 13 years later, a chapel was built in honor of São José by brothers Antônio Bicudo Leme and Braz Esteves Leme. The brothers Leme have acquired of the Countess of Vimieiro (Condesa de Vimieiro), the lands north of the town of Taubaté. There is no news of how the allotment had passed from the hands of Captain Prado Martins to the Countess of Vimieiro. Given the uncertainties of history, two recent mayors of the city solved the problem by fiat: Caio Gomes Mayor officiated at the date of August 12, 1672 (Leme brothers) as the founding date of the city and later, Mayor João Bosco Nogueira decreed magna that date the county was founded was the date of emancipation, July 10, 1705. = Territorial evolution = On April 16, 1858, it lost part of the territory that was located in the Serra da Mantiqueira, turning a new municipality São Bento do Sapucaí. Later it was fragmented into two new municipalities, Campos do Jordão and Santo Antônio do Pinhal. On November 30, 1944, it lost part of the territory to Aparecida, on his border, for the creation of the Roseira district, which two decades later became a city.

SE, April 2018 Congress Heights is a residential neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C., in the United States. The irregularly shaped neighborhood is bounded by the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus, Lebaum Street SE, 4th Street SE, and Newcomb Street SE on the northeast; Shepard Parkway and South Capitol Street on the west; Atlantic Street SE and 1st Street SE (as far as Chesapeake Street SE) on the south; Oxon Run Parkway on the southeast; and Wheeler Street SE and Alabama Avenue SE on the east. Commercial development is heavy along Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Malcolm X Avenue. History of the neighborhood =Pre-development years= alt= Prior to its development, the area known as Congress Heights was forest and farmland. The bay between Poplar Point and Giesborough Point was open water, and would not be filled in and reclaimed for use until the 1880s. The area was served primarily by the Navy Yard Bridge (now known as the 11th Street Bridges), constructed in 1820. The first residential development east of the river was Uniontown (now the neighborhood of Anacostia), begun in 1854. The following year, the federal government constructed the Government Hospital for the Insane (later known as St. Elizabeths Hospital). To serve the hospital, Asylum Avenue (now Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue) was constructed from the Navy Yard Bridge to the new hospital and then, running on the east side of a line of hills, down to the District-Maryland line. Additional construction in the area occurred during the American Civil War (1861 to 1865). The United States Department of War constructed the George Washington Young cavalry magazine on of land on Giesborough Point. Two forts, Fort Carroll (near the present intersection of South Capitol Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue) and Fort Greble (near the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Blue Plains Drive SW), were constructed on the bluffs that began just west and adjacent to Asylum Road. After the war, the Barry Farm housing development for freed slaves opened in 1867 on the north side of the St. Elizabeths campus and was rapidly occupied. Aslyum Avenue was named Nichols Avenue in 1879 in honor of St. Elizabeths Hospital superintendent Charles Henry Nichols. Asylum Avenue/Nichols Avenue was the only major southward road through the area until the development of Congress Heights itself. The only other major street was a military road (now known as Alabama Avenue SE) which ran in an east- northeasterly direction toward other Civil War forts. =Founding of Congress Heights= Congress Heights advertisement – May 17th, 1902 (Washington Times) Congress Heights itself was founded in 1890. Colonel Arthur E. Randle, a successful newspaper publisher, decided to found a settlement east of the river which he called Congress Heights. The Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge (which was replaced by the John Philip Sousa Bridge) began construction in November 1887, and by June 1890 was nearing completion. Randle understood that this new bridge would bring rapid development east of the Anacostia River, and he intended to take advantage of it. The development was immediately successful. To ensure that his investment continued to pay off, Randle invested heavily in the Belt Railway, a local streetcar company founded in March 1875. On March 2, 1895, Randle founded the Capital Railway Company to construct streetcar lines over the Navy Yard Bridge and down Nichols Avenue to Congress Heights. The Belt Railway was purchased on June 24, 1898, by the Anacostia and Potomac River Railway Company. This made Randle a majority owner of the Anacostia and Potomac River Railway. Randle sold his interest in the Capital Railway in 1899, and used this fortune to buy a large section of land known as \\"East Washington Highlands\\" at the foot of the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. This became the development of Randle Highlands, and the success of that development allowed him to create \\"North Randle Highlands\\" (now the neighborhoods of Dupont Park, Penn Branch, and the lower portion of Greenway) In October 1906, The Washington Post called Randle's developments \\"among the largest real estate enterprises ever successfully carried through in the District.\\" The rapid development of Congress Heights and the areas adjacent to the streetcar line on Nichols Avenue led the government of the District of Columbia to extend South Capitol Street into the area east of the Anacostia River. The topography of the area largely dictated the route. Beginning near St. Elizabeths Hospital, a line of bluffs extended roughly southward until it reached what is now Chesapeake Street SW. (Fort Greble sat atop the southernmost of these cliffs.) To the west of these bluffs were broad, flat lowlands which provided pleasant views of the Potomac River and the city of Alexandria, Virginia. In 1893, the city surveyed South Capitol along the western side of these bluffs, laying out a broad, grand avenue. Once the bluffs ended, the route followed existing local roads and curved eastward to connect with Livingston Road (now the Indian Head Highway) at the District- Maryland line. But because of the lack of development south of Congress Heights, South Capitol Street was only constructed to its intersection with Nichols Avenue. =20th-century development= From the 1930s until the 1950s, Congress Heights was an almost all-white working-class neighborhood. Many of these white working-class people were rural Southerners and Appalachians who had migrated from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Many of them worked at the Navy Yard or at nearby Bolling Air Force Base. Congress Heights was the location of the last working farm within the District of Columbia. George Lindner had been growing vegetables on his farm for over 50 years and it had been in the family since the Civil War. The farm shut down in 1939. Prior to World War II the D.C. National Guard was housed at Camp Simms. The facility included firing ranges up to 1,000 yards. It was on Alabama Avenue at the intersection of Stanton Road and Barry Farm Housing Project. During WW II it had gun emplacements (Anti-Aircraft) to defend Washington from air attack. After World War II, the U.S. Army built a military reserve facility, in the central part of Congress Heights. Many early residents worked at the U.S. Naval Gun Factory, which stopped production about 1960, or at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. Congress Heights experienced great urban neglect after World War II. However, in the 21st century, Congress Heights has received a great deal of attention from the city and urban developers. Nineteen development projects worth a total of $455 million are underway or completed in Congress Heights as of November 2006. Among these are a redevelopment of St. Elizabeths West Campus for federal use; a request for proposals from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for the area around the Congress Heights Metro station; and a planned redevelopment of Camp Simms as a mixed-use project, including a new Giant Grocery Store, enhancement to an existing shopping center, and 75 new residential units. The ARC cultural arts center, and the Tennis and Learning Center, are nearby on Mississippi Avenue. The neighborhood is served by the Congress Heights station on the Green Line of the Washington Metro. Most residents live in garden apartments, but there are also older single-family bungalows. Frank W. Ballou High School (which was just rebuilt) and Hart Middle School serve the neighborhood. Destination Congress Heights (Congress Heights Main Street) was chartered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation Main Street program in January 2016. Destination Congress Heights is a program created by Congress Heights Community Training & Development Corporation a nonprofit, 501(c)3, led by a combination of community development professionals and local volunteers. The main street program is based on the National Trust for Historic Preservation nationally proven model The Main Street Four Point Approach which includes in emphasis in the areas of: organization of commercial revitalization efforts, promotion of neighborhood businesses and business districts, design and economic revitalization. The approach includes an underlying historic preservation ethic and provides local organizations with a mechanism to manage their neighborhood commercial districts and a structure to implement commercial revitalization activities that will achieve the stakeholders goals for the commercial district.

Definitions of the area also varied at first. Early news reports believed the eastern apex of Federal Triangle extended as far east and south as the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial in front of the United States Capitol. But almost all reports referred to Pennsylvania Avenue NW and 15th Street NW as the Triangle's northern and western boundaries. Genesis and design =Plan= Senator James McMillan, who led the commission which wrote the \\"McMillan Plan\\" for guiding the development of Washington, D.C. The Federal Triangle area in 1923, looking east with Pennsylvania Avenue in the left, the District Building in the foreground and the Post Office building and Center Market in the background The Senate Park Commission (also known as the \\"McMillan Commission\\") was formed by the United States Congress in 1900 to reconcile competing visions for the development of Washington, D.C. and especially the National Mall and nearby areas.Peterson, Jon A. The Birth of City Planning in the United States, 1840–1917. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. The Commission's plan for development, the McMillan Plan, proposed the razing of all residences and other buildings on Lafayette Square and building tall, Neoclassical government office buildings with facades of white marble around the park to house executive branch offices.Luria, Sarah. Capital Speculations: Writing and Building Washington. Durham, N.H.: University of New Hampshire Press, 2006.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 2003. . the rapid expansion in the size and number of executive branch agencies in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s made the McMillan Plan's development of Lafayette Square impractical.Bednar, Michael J. L'Enfant's Legacy: Public Open Spaces in Washington. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. Congressional and local support for the redevelopment of Lafayette Square waned significantly. Over the next few years, the President and Congress established several new agencies to supervise the approval, design, and construction of new buildings in the District of Columbia: The Commission of Fine Arts in 1910 (to approve the design of new structures), the Public Buildings Commission in 1916 (to make recommendations regarding the housing of federal agencies and offices), and the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission in 1924 (to oversee planning for the District).Cannadine, David. Mellon: An American Life. Reprint ed. New York: Random House, Inc., 2008. In the mid-1910s, Congress appropriated and the government spent $7 million to acquire land on Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 14th and 15th Streets NW and several blocks south. No demolition or construction took place during that period, and the government merely collected rent from the tenants in the area. In 1924, the Public Buildings Commission recommended that a new series of federal office buildings be built near the White House.Gutheim, Frederick Albert and Lee, Antoinette Josephine. Worthy of the Nation: Washington, DC, From L'Enfant to the National Capital Planning Commission. 2d ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. The plan called for a complex of buildings to be built at Murder Bay—a muddy, flood-prone, malaria-ridden, poverty-stricken region lacking in paved roads, sewer system, and running water and almost exclusively home to numerous brothels and an extensive criminal underclass.Evelyn, Douglas E.; Dickson, Paul; Ackerman, S.J.

However, appropriations were to be made annually, leaving control of the project firmly in Congressional hands. Congress appropriated $50 million ($10 million a year for five years) for construction of these projects in 1927, with half the funds to be spent solely on Federal Triangle.Whitaker, Charles B. \\"Building for the Glory of Washington.\\" New York Times.

On June 5, 1926, the Treasury Department, which had been given authority over the implementation of the building program, announced the Federal Triangle projects (among others) which would move forward and their anticipated cost:\\"Plan 4 Federal Buildings.\\" New York Times. July 8, 1926.\\"$33,725,000 in New Federal Buildings Provided For City.\\" Washington Post. June 6, 1926. :*A National Archives building, with total cost of land and construction to be $6.9 million ($1 million appropriated in fiscal 1927).Just days earlier, the Commission of Fine Arts and Public Building Commission pegged the cost of the proposed Archives building at $2 million. See: \\"Archives Building to Cost $2,000,000 Decide Upon Here.\\" Washington Post. May 29, 1926. :*A new Internal Revenue Bureau building, with total cost of land and construction to be $7.95 million ($1.7 million appropriated in fiscal 1927). :*A new Department of Commerce building, with total cost of construction to be $10 million ($600,000 appropriated in fiscal 1927). Treasury officials said the Archives building was their top priority, followed by the Internal Revenue building, two Department of Agriculture projects, and the Commerce building last. At that time, no provision was made to construct a new building for the Department of Justice and no sites were named for construction of the three announced buildings. Preliminary plans for the Commerce building were presented to the Commission on Fine Arts and Public Building Commission in mid-June.\\"Commerce Building Plans Are Outlined to Fine Arts Body.\\" Washington Post. June 18, 1926. On July 7, the Treasury Department and Commission of Fine Arts announced sites and sizes for the three previously announced structures. The Department of Commerce building would contain 1 million square feet (93,000 square metres) of office space and be sited on the south side of B Street NW (now Constitution Avenue NW) on the National Mall.\\"4 Sites Selected for U.S. Buildings in Local Program.\\" Washington Post. July 8, 1926. The Internal Revenue building would contain 650,000 square feet (60,450 square metres) of office space and take up two whole city blocks between 10th and 12th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW (cutting off 11th Street NW). The National Archives would contain 2.3 million square feet (213,900 square metres) of office space, and take up one city block between 12th and 13th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW (cutting off the last block of Ohio Avenue NW).Treasury officials had tentatively announced this site for the Archives building on June 1, 1926. The July 7 announcement appears to have made this selection final. See: \\"Prospective Archives Location Is Reported.\\" Washington Post. June 2, 1926. The government owned three of the four plots needed for the Internal Revenue site, but none of the land beneath the proposed Archives building. Purchasing both sites, officials estimated, would cost $700,000 each. Treasury officials also proposed at this time adding a Justice building on Pennsylvania Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets NW, and a Labor building (facing 15th Street) between 14th and 15th Streets NW and D Street NW and Ohio Avenue NW. Preliminary plans for these buildings were expected to be presented in three months. Center Market in the 1920s. The purchase of land delayed the construction program considerably over the next several years. Center Market, designed by architect Adolf Cluss and built in 1872, was the largest of the District of Columbia's markets, serving tens of thousands of people a day at a time when general stores and greengrocers were uncommon in the city. It was also a hub for transportation in the District of Columbia, as the city's trolley lines converged there. At the time it was built, it was the largest food market in the United States—with space for more than a thousand vendors, the city's first cold-storage vaults, its own ice storage facility, and its own artesian well. Center Market, however, occupied two blocks between 7th and 9th Streets NW on the north side of B Street NW. As early as August 1926, planners recognized that relocating Center Market and purchasing land from owners eagerly seeking inflated prices from the federal government would delay the Federal Triangle project significantly.\\"U.S. Building Program Here Is Being Delayed.\\" Washington Post. August 18, 1926. Early negotiations with private landowners in the area collapsed early on when owners demanded exorbitant prices for their properties, and the city and federal government began condemnation proceedings in late August 1926 against owners on B Street NW between 10th and 13th Streets.\\"U.S. Building Sites Adjacent to Mall to Be Condemned.\\" Washington Post.

Another major effort had to be made to condemn and remove railroad tracks from Federal Triangle, which had converged on the Center Market site. Although the Treasury Department had ordered the tracks lifted by April 1, 1931, this effort did not begin in earnest until early 1931.\\"Writ to Be Asked to Balk Removal of Tracks By U.S.\\" Washington Post.

January 12, 1932. Delay occurred in obtaining the Post Office land as well. Several parcels of land were not condemned until July 1, 1931\\"Mall Area Titles Acquired By U.S.\\" Washington Post. July 1, 1931.—a single day before demolition on adjacent parcels of land began. The land for the Apex Building site was finally obtained through condemnation in July 1931.\\"Avenue Block Price Is Set At $877,824.\\" Washington Post. July 18, 1931.

After these deliberations, the Public Buildings Commission announced on November 17, 1926, that several new buildings would be added and new sites for proposed buildings announced, including:\\"Pennsylvania Avenue Land Purchase Will Be Asked.\\" Washington Post. November 18, 1926. :*A new Department of Justice building, to be located between Pennsylvania Avenue NW and D Street NW, and 14th and 15th Streets NW. :*A new \\"General Supply\\" building, to be located between 14th and 13th Streets NW between D and C Streets NW. :*A new Independent Offices building, to be located between 12th and 13th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW (cutting off the last block of Ohio Avenue NW; this was the original proposed site of the National Archives in June 1926). :*A new Department of Labor building, to be located between 13th and 14th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW. :*A new General Accounting Office building, to be located between 9th and 10th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW. :*Moving the Department of Commerce site from the National Mall to between 14th and 15th Streets NW between C and B Streets NW. :*Moving the National Archives site northward to between 12th and 13th Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW and C Streets NW (cutting off D Street NW). :*Retaining the previously announced site of the Internal Revenue building. The Public Buildings Commission also announced it would build an 1,800-car parking lot next to the Department of Commerce building, and would proceed with construction of the Commerce and Archives first (as they were the top priority). Three months later, the estimates for construction of the Commerce building was increased to $16 million from $10 million and for the Internal Revenue building to $10.5 million from $2.5 million.\\"$2,275,000 Is Asked For Building Work In City Next Year.\\" Washington Post.

Work on all buildings was postponed in May 1927. On May 6, an ad hoc committee composed of Olmsted; Medary; Charles Moore, chair of the Commission on Fine Arts; and Louis E. Simon, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury, recommended relocating the Justice building from 15th Street NW to a lot further east so that traffic congestion at 15th and Pennsylvania might be alleviated.\\"Planners Suggest Justice building Location Change.\\" Washington Post. May 7, 1927.

However, disagreements among the three planning bodies proved so fundamental that a new Board of Architectural Consultants was created on May 19, 1927, to advise the groups on the development of Federal Triangle.\\"Architects Chosen to Advise on Plans for Mall Triangle.\\" Washington Post. May 20, 1927. The Board consisted of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury (Louis E. Simon) and six private architects, including Louis Ayres, Edward H. Bennett, Arthur Brown, Jr., William Adams Delano, Milton Bennett Medary, and John Russell Pope. The Board of Architectural Consultants first met on May 23, at which time it considered a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures.\\"Architects Considering Public Buildings Plan.\\" Washington Post. May 24, 1927. As the Board of Architectural Consultants began its deliberations, the Commission on Fine Arts approved a plan to locate the Justice building on the north side of B Street NW between 7th and 9th Streets NW (where Center Market stood).\\"Justice Structure Is Planned On Site of Center Market.\\" Washington Post. May 29, 1927. About two weeks later, the Public Buildings Commission approved the single structure plan.\\"Federal Building In 2 Groups, Third Mall Plan Reveals.\\" Washington Post. June 17, 1927. This plan envisioned a central plaza (defined by 13th, 14th, B, and D Streets NW) surrounded by a traffic circle, with the buildings lining the exterior of the traffic circle. Few streets would be closed; rather, arches would connect each building to its neighbors (with only 12th Street NW remaining unbridged). The final design of Federal Triangle began to come together in June 1927. The Board of Architectural Consultants approved the construction of the Commerce and Internal Revenue structures as stand-alone buildings on the sites last proposed in late June.\\"Federal Building Plans Announced By Treasury.\\" Washington Post. June 21, 1927. In July, the Board proposed eight buildings, sited as follows:\\"Triangle Sites Studied By Architectural Board.\\" Washington Post. July 12, 1927. :*Archives (surrounded by Interstate Commerce on the north, east, and south) :*Commerce (west side of 15th Street NW between B and D Streets NW) :*General Accounting (13th, 14th, B, and C Streets NW) :*Independent Offices (6th, 7th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW) :*Internal Revenue (B, 10th, 12th, and C Streets NW) :*Interstate Commerce (9th, 10th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW) :*Justice (7th, 9th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW) :*Labor (B, 13th, 14th, and C Streets NW) The Board did not address the future of the District Building, Old Post Office Pavilion, or Southern Railway Building, but had tentatively agreed to continue with the \\"Louvre plan\\" of a ring of buildings joined by arches. The first design contract for any of the buildings in Federal Triangle was statutorily required by Congress in 1926 as part of the Public Buildings Act. A new headquarters for the Department of Commerce had been proposed in 1912 and a contract for the design work awarded to the architectural firm of York and Sawyer. Although this building was never built, Congress honored the contract and named the firm again as the Commerce building's designer. By March 1927, government officials had already decided that the Commerce building should be 1,000 feet (305 metres) long—making it the then-largest building in the District of Columbia.\\"Plans Capitol Buildings.\\" New York Times. September 29, 1927. The May 1927 work moratorium, however, put these plans on hold. In September 1927, the design of the Internal Revenue building was handed over to Louis Simon at the Treasury Department, and the Commission of Fine Arts met to discuss proposed plans for both the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings.\\"Plans to Be Considered For Commerce Edifice.\\" Washington Post. September 28, 1927. At the same time, the Commission received bids on demolition of existing structures in the Triangle.\\"The Commerce Building.\\" Washington Post. September 18, 1927. After review by the Board of Architectural Consultants, the Public Buildings Commission gave final design approval on November 1, 1927, to the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings.\\"Final Indorsement Given Plans of Two Federal Buildings.\\" Washington Post. November 2, 1927. The previous sizes of both buildings was reaffirmed, as was the \\"Louvre plan\\" for a unified ring of buildings surrounding a traffic circle and plaza.

November 25, 1927. Secretary Mellon imposed a requirement that all the buildings be built in the Neoclassical architectural style.\\"Mellon Indorses Building Program of Classic Style.\\" Washington Post.

By mid-December 1927, the design of the Archives building had been approved, and the Board of Architectural Consultants was meeting again to study once more the general layout of the Federal Triangle.\\"Architects to Study Plans for Triangle.\\" Washington Post. December 14, 1927. =1928= By March 1928, newspapers had reported that the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings would be constructed first, followed by the Archives, then Justice, and then a newly added Post Office building. Plans continued for the demolition of the District Building and Southern Railway headquarters (although the latter would be the last to be razed, as it would be used as temporary office space for displaced federal workers). Although the Commerce building plans (a -long building with of office space, the largest office building in the world) had stabilized by March 1928,\\"Hoover Hails Our National Projects.\\" New York Times. June 11, 1929. some designers suggested that both 15th and 14th Streets NW be submerged in tunnels beneath the structure. About the same time, the Internal Revenue building's square footage was reduced by almost a quarter to 500,000 square feet (46,500 square metres). In July, Congress appropriated $210,000 for design work for the Independent Offices, Interstate Commerce, Justice, and Labor buildings, and Secretary Mellon altered the work schedule yet again to focus on these structures.\\"Mellon to Start Plans for 4 More Federal Buildings.\\" Washington Post. July 11, 1928. The Board of Architectural Consultants met to consider ways in which the construction program might be sped up, and devised plans to have four approved buildings (Commerce, Internal Revenue, Justice and Labor) completed by 1932.\\"Federal Building Program Expected to Be Speeded Up.\\" Washington Post. July 16, 1928; \\"Five Mall Buildings To Be Ready by 1932.\\" Washington Post. July 24, 1928. By October 1928, the Board of Architectural Consultants had agreed with prior decisions that no office building should be constructed on the National Mall, and that this space should be reserved for museums. Plans for the eastern apex of Federal Triangle, however, were complicated by an ongoing effort to create a George Washington Memorial. A George Washington Memorial Association was organized in 1898 to establish in the District of Columbia a university bearing Washington's name.\\"George Washington Memorial Association, Records, 1890–1922.\\" Record Unit 7471. Finding Aids to Personal Papers and Special Collections in the Smithsonian Institution Archives. Smithsonian Institution.

February 23, 1905.

December 6, 1927. In 1929, even as the Federal Triangle project was moving forward, the George Washington Memorial Association was conducting fund-raising for the construction of the building at the proposed National Archives site.\\"New Washington Memorial Appeal.\\" New York Times. February 17, 1929. Press reports, however, indicated that the building had already been displaced from the Apex building site. The fund-raising effort eventually failed, and the foundation and stairs were razed in 1937 to make way for the National Gallery of Art. =1929–31= Architectural models of the proposed Federal Triangle development were unveiled in late April 1929.\\"Beautified Capital Shown By Models.\\" New York Times. April 28, 1929. Design work on the Independent Offices, Justice, and Labor buildings also began at that time. After these models were unveiled, however, the Board once more made changes to the Federal Triangle construction plan to reflect the March and April changes made by Hoover and Mellon. Now only seven large structures were planned, and assigned to the following Board members for design:The Independent Offices building was now called the Apex Building, the Labor and ICC buildings were now joined by a Departmental Auditorium, and the General Accounting building had been replaced by the Post Office building. The cost of the Departmental Auditorium was estimated at $2 million. See: \\"Hoover Urges Funds For Six New Buildings.\\" Washington Post. April 23, 1930. :*Apex Building (formerly the Independent Offices building, and now assigned to house the United States Coast Guard) - Bennett :*Commerce Department building - Ayers (of the firm York and Sawyer) :*Internal Revenue Service building - Simon :*Justice Department building - Medary :*Labor Department/Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) building, and Departmental Auditorium - Brown :*National Archives building - Pope :*Post Office Department building - Delano Map of the city of Washington, D.C., published in 1851 but still extant as of 1926, showing the area around Federal Triangle as originally planned and built according to the L'Enfant Plan. Two major changes to the complex came in early 1930. The Board and other planning groups had long agreed to site the Justice Department building on the block bounded by 7th, 9th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. But this plan changed in March 1930. Architect John Russell Pope made a proposal to have the Justice and Archives switch sites so that the Justice building would have more space. Although the change would entail major design alterations in both buildings, Secretary Mellon favored the idea. The Commission on Fine Arts approved the plan, and Mellon met with the Board of Architectural Consultants in late March 1930 to discuss the idea.\\"Mellon to Discuss Changing of Sites.\\" Washington Post. March 28, 1930. Although this initial meeting left the issue unresolved,\\"Site of New Justice Building Undecided.\\" Washington Post. March 29, 1930. the Board later agreed to Mellon's wishes in April and the two buildings switched plots.\\"Hoover Urges Funds For Six New Buildings.\\" Washington Post. April 23, 1930. At the end of April, President Hoover asked Congress to appropriate $10.3 million (the most yet) to build a new Post Office Department building between 12th and 13th Streets NW, from Pennsylvania Avenue NW south to C Street NW. Parking and traffic issues proved immensely vexing for the planners of Federal Triangle. The original L'Enfant Plan setting out the streets of Washington, D.C., still existed in the Federal Triangle area. Both C Street NW and D Street NW still ran from 15th Street NW to 15th Street NE. Ohio Avenue NW ran in a northwest–southeast line from the intersection of D and 15th Streets NW to the intersection of B and 12th Streets NW (soon to be renamed as Constitution Avenue NW and 12th Street NW). Louisiana Avenue NW still ran in a southwest–northeast direction from 10th and B Streets NW to 7th and D Streets NW (along what is currently the diagonal portion Indiana Avenue NW). The McMillan Plan was developed before the widespread use of the automobile, and now the Board of Architectural Consultants had to decide how to accommodate the \\"horseless carriage\\" while also making Federal Triangle pedestrian- friendly. The Board began studying traffic issues in late 1927. A major study of parking needs and solutions was conducted in 1931, and traffic and parking patterns assessed again after the Department of Commerce building opened in early 1932.\\"Study of Triangle Parking Needs Near.\\" Washington Post. December 30, 1931. To achieve some of the traffic and parking goals, the east–west streets and diagonal avenues were eliminated, leaving only the north–south streets through the area, and 12th and 9th Streets NW were submerged in tunnels beneath the National Mall.\\"State Names For Streets Slated Today.\\" Washington Post. January 30, 1936. In the first major change to the Board's \\"final\\" plans, the Grand Plaza was abandoned in favor of a parking lot. The Board considered a number of other solutions to the need to accommodate the more than 7,500 cars expected to arrive every day (including an underground bus terminal and underground parking garage under the Grand Plaza), but in the end only approved a small number of underground parking spaces beneath the Apex Building.\\"Underground Terminal Suggested for Buses.\\" Washington Post. October 13, 1927; \\"Groups Study Car Parking In Triangle.\\" Washington Post. October 24, 1936. =Design influences= The Palais du Louvre in Paris, France, an inspiration for the Federal Triangle complex. The design of Federal Triangle was significantly influenced by the Louvre-Tuileries Palace complex in France and the concentration of government buildings in Whitehall in the United Kingdom. But planning for the complex was also deeply influenced by the City Beautiful movement and the idea of creating a civic center to achieve efficiency in administration as well as reinforce the public's perception of government as authoritative and permanent. For the architectural style of the buildings, the Board relied heavily on the McMillan Plan's recommendation of the Neoclassical style. Both the Board and Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon rejected the Modern style then heavily in vogue. Rather than a mass of tall, imposing buildings, two unifying open spaces (intended for ceremonial use, and under discussion by the Board at least by March 1928) would be utilized. The first would be a Circular Plaza (inspired by the Place Vendôme) bisected by 12th Street NW, and which would require the demolition of the Old Post Office Pavilion. The second would be a rectangular Grand Plaza on the east side of 14th Street NW between the proposed Department of Commerce building (west side of 14th Street NW) and the proposed Post Office Department building (east side of 13th Street NW). The construction of the Grand Plaza would have required the demolition of the District Building. The Board received significant input from the Commission of Fine Arts (which strongly advocated implementation of the McMillan Plan), National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, and the Washington Board of Trade. One guiding principle for the project was that office space for at least 25,000 federal workers must be included. Another was that, although the buildings would be modern steel frame structures, they would each be the same height and faced with limestone. The National Capital Parks and Planning Commission had the least influence over the overall design of the project, primarily because it had only recently been formed. Although the Board unveiled its proposed design for the project in 1929, the design still lacked a unifying architectural look. Subsequently, John Russell Pope was asked in September 1929 to bring a more uniform style to the buildings. Nonetheless, within this more uniform approach, a variety of styles could be used, and were: Italian Renaissance for the Department of Commerce building, Corinthian for the National Archives building, and Ionic for the Post Office Department. Meanwhile, the Board worked with sculptors, painters, and others to design more than 100 statues, fountains, bronze doors, murals, plaques, and panels (both interior and exterior) throughout the complex. Modern architectural styles were not completely ignored in the design effort, however; most of the doors and grillwork throughout the Federal Triangle complex were Art Deco in style. Construction of original seven buildings =Beginning: Hoover administration= Looking southeast at the Old Post Office Pavilion (far left), Southern Railway Building (middle), and District Building on Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., in 1932 Aerial photo taken in 1934 showing the western portion of the Federal Triangle The Treasury Department signed a contract for razing of existing buildings at the Internal Revenue site in October 1926. The size of the Commerce building was set at long in March 1927, and survey work at the site began on March 31, 1927 (even though final plans for the project were still unclear). Work on all buildings was postponed in May 1927. Work began again in September 1927 when demolition work on the Commerce and Internal Revenue sites began again. Excavation of both sites began on November 21, 1927.\\"Work on New Federal Buildings Starts Soon.\\" Washington Post. November 18, 1927; \\"Contractors Start Excavating On Site of Revenue Office.\\" Washington Post. November 22, 1927. Additional demolition contracts were awarded for both sites in April 1928,\\"Contract to Wreck Buildings Awarded.\\" Washington Post. April 20, 1928. and foundation work for the Internal Revenue building began in June 1928.\\"Digging of Revenue Cellar Is Begun.\\" Washington Post. June 19, 1928. Due to the soft nature of the ground, 8,000 pilings were driven into the earth to support the foundation.\\"New Revenue Edifice Startles Imagination In Its Appointments.\\" Washington Post.

March 9, 1929; \\"First Steel Work Set For Revenue Building.\\" Washington Post. March 22, 1929. The cornerstone of the first building to be constructed, the Internal Revenue building, was laid by Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon on May 25, 1929. While digging its foundation, workers uncovered a dock which was at least 100 years old.Tiber Creek had once run along B Street NW (now Constitution Avenue NW), and the dock had once extended into Tiber Creek. In 1815, Tiber Creek was straightened and connected to and became part of the Washington City Canal. The canal fell into disuse by the 1850s. Tiber Creek was enclosed by a masonry tunnel beginning in 1878 and the tunnel connected to the city's sewer system so that the creek's natural flow would help flush sewage into the Potomac River. Much of the area immediately south and west of the B Street NW and the Washington Monument was, at the time, part of the Potomac River. After a disastrous flood in 1881, the United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged a deep channel in the Potomac and used the material to fill in the Potomac (creating the current banks of the river) and raise much of the land near the White House and along Pennsylvania Avenue NW by nearly six feet (two metres). One or more of these actions buried the Tiber Creek dock. See: Tindall, William. Standard History of the City of Washington From a Study of the Original Sources. Knoxville, Tenn.: H.W.

Indiana Limestone was used for the facing, and Tennessee marble for the columns. The sites of all the Triangle buildings had been established in their revised positions by May 1929, with two exceptions: The positions of the Justice and Archives buildings remained as originally planned (with Justice in the east), and the apex space remained unallotted. President (and former Commerce Secretary) Herbert Hoover laid the cornerstone of the Commerce building on June 10, 1929, using the same trowel President George Washington had used to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol.\\"Ready Soon to Occupy Commerce Building.\\" New York Times. December 26, 1931.\\"Hoover and Notables Aid Dedication of Structure for Big Project.\\" Washington Post. June 11, 1929. The construction contract for the Commerce building (set at $13.567 million) had been signed in March,\\"$13,567,000 Low Bid For Commerce Building.\\" Washington Post. March 31, 1929. and the contract for its limestone facade—according to at least one newspaper account, the largest stone contract in world history—was awarded in April.\\"Stone Contract Is Given For Commerce Building.\\" Washington Post. April 14, 1929. By then, the cost of the Commerce building had risen to $17.5 million. Due to the formerly marshy condition of the soil and several submerged streams nearby, more than 18,000 pilings had to be set to construct the Commerce building. Water pressure from the submerged Tiber Creek made it too difficult to drive the piles,Barrows, George H. \\"Department of Commerce Home Baffles Writers Trying to Visualize Structure.\\" Washington Post. December 31, 1931. so a deep-sea diver descended into the underground Tiber Creek and drilled a hole 20 feet (6.1 metres) deep into the earth. A hose was inserted into the hole, and water pumped from the earth until the water table dropped and the driving of the piles could be accomplished. The October 1929 stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression led newly elected President Herbert Hoover to increase spending on existing public works as a means of stimulating the economy. No funds had been authorized yet for the Archives, Independent Offices, Justice, or Labor buildings, and Hoover secured an additional $2.5 million a year for 10 years from Congress for this purpose.\\"Hoover Enlarges Capital Project.\\" New York Times.

May 17, 1930. But a major design change and funding choices were made in 1930. Pope convinced the Commission on Fine Arts to switch the positions of the Department of Justice and National Archives, giving the Justice building more space. Congress also amended the Public Buildings Act to permit private (not just federally employed) architects to bid on design contracts, and agreed to fund the construction of the Justice, Labor/ICC, National Archives, and Post Office buildings.For a time, the design of the Archives and Post Office buildings included the diversion of cool water from Tiber Creek to cool the buildings. See: \\"River Use to Cool Building Weighed.\\" Washington Post. July 29, 1931; \\"Home of Federal Records Will Bring Dignity to Seventh St.\\" Washington Post. December 22, 1933. 1931 saw much of the Federal Triangle project near completion. In March 1931, Congress appropriated $3 million to begin construction of the Apex Building, the last structure to be funded. Demolition began on the site the following November.\\"Pennsylvania Ave. Razing Is Continued.\\" Washington Post. November 6, 1931.

It was finished a year ahead of schedule, and contained more than 672,000 square feet (62.5 square metres) of office space (3.4 percent more than originally planned). But work had yet to begin on the Justice, Labor, or Post Office buildings. Work on the ICC building finally began in April 1931 when the two blocks for the site began to be razed, and 13th Street NW was permanently blocked off at that time.\\"Work On New I.C.C.

The Department of Commerce building opened on January 4, 1932.\\"Hoover Inspects Commerce Building.\\" New York Times. January 3, 1932. The finished building had 1,605,066 square feet (148,271.1 square metres) of office space (more than 60 percent larger than originally planned), and its foundation was more than three feet thick in places in order to withstand the hydraulic pressure put on it by the submerged Tiber Creek. Water from the Tiber was utilized as an air conditioning system, to cool the building. July saw the construction contract for the $7.67 million Justice Department building signed.\\"Justice Building Contract Awarded.\\" Washington Post. July 1, 1932. Although some funds for Federal Triangle projects had not been appropriated yet, work still went ahead using funds from other projects which were behind schedule.\\"U.S. Construction Work in Capital Is To Be Pushed Ahead.\\" Washington Post. July 3, 1932. On September 26, 1932, the 143rd anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Postal Service, President Hoover laid the cornerstone of the Post Office Department building (although the foundation had already been laid, and the steel superstructure of the building was already three stories high).\\"Capital Post Office Named for Franklin.\\" New York Times.

Congress had appropriated $10.3 million for the new structure, which was designed to accommodate more than 3,000 workers. Its eight stories would be laid on a granite foundation and the sides clad in limestone. On December 1, 1932, the contract for construction of the limestone National Archives building (whose estimated construction cost was $5.284 million) was awarded to the George A. Fuller Company (which had constructed the New York Times Building and the Flatiron Building).\\"Fuller Gets $5,284,000 Contract.\\" New York Times. December 2, 1932.

Workers who were Freemasons assisted the President in laying the cornerstones. Hoover personally oversaw the dedication of the cornerstone at the Labor end of the building. His words were broadcast over loudspeaker to the workers at the ICC end of the structure, who placed the ICC cornerstone simultaneously at the President's instruction (becoming the first time in Washington history that a single person dedicated two cornerstones at the same time). William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, attended the laying of the cornerstone for the Labor building. Once more, Hoover used the trowel used by Washington to lay the cornerstone of the Capitol.

Five months later, a small fire at the Post Office construction site was extinguished by a security guard before it could do any damage.\\"Fire Extinguished At New U.S. Office.\\" Washington Post. July 19, 1933. Late in 1933, the northern addition to the Internal Revenue building (the land had been condemned in December 1930) began to rise. =Completion: Roosevelt administration= Only one building remained to be constructed under the new administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. By December 1933, the President was preparing his proposal to Congress for full funding of the Apex Building construction project.\\"Government Building.\\" Washington Post. December 12, 1933. But the Apex Building itself almost was not built, as Pope and others argued that it tended to hide the planned National Archives building.\\"Protests on Apex Building Probed.\\" Washington Post.

Still others thought the site should be used for the proposed Jefferson Memorial.\\"Boylan Asks A Memorial On Apex Site.\\" Washington Post. December 24, 1933. Through Roosevelt's personal intervention, the building was saved—but nearly all its external ornamentation was stripped, and plans for a terraced fountain nearby eliminated (although a small fountain was built in what eventually became known as Patrick Henry Park).\\"Apex Building Views Sought Of Roosevelt.\\" Washington Post. December 17, 1933. Construction of the building was re-approved on January 18, 1934.\\"Apex Building Fits Scheme, Says Planners.\\" Washington Post. January 19, 1934. The building's final cost was estimated at just over $12 million.\\"Capitol Triangle At Last Completed.\\" Associated Press. August 4, 1935. Construction of the Apex Building in 1937 In 1934, one building began construction and another finished. The Apex Building site began to be cleared in April. The Post Office building was occupied on May 6,\\"Postoffice Staff Finally Starts Moving Into New Structure.\\" Washington Post. May 7, 1934. and Postmaster General James Farley dedicated the Post Office Department building on June 11, 1934.\\"Farley to Talk At Postal Rites.\\" Washington Post.

Its final cost was $10.83 million, about half a million dollars over budget. Construction in the rest of the Triangle, however, seemed stalled. Although some structures had been razed on the site, no appropriation had been made for the Apex Building. The government had also cleared land northeast of the Internal Revenue building (as planners considered adding yet another building to the Triangle), but Congress was increasingly opposed to demolishing either the Old Post Office or the District Building. City officials considered selling the District Building to the federal government as a means of raising cash to build a new city hall, but federal officials balked at the idea.\\"Plan to Sell City Building Is Revived.\\" Washington Post. January 18, 1934; \\"D.C. Building Again Offered For Sale to U.S.\\" Washington Post. November 29, 1936.

Chief Justice Hughes, all the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings, and a large number of foreign ambassadors also attended the dedication. The $11 million structure had more than 550,000 square feet (51,200 square meters) of office space. By November 1934, the addition to the Internal Revenue building was nearing completion, and government officials were contemplating the razing of the District Building, Old Post Office Pavilion, and Southern Railway Building. The Labor/ICC and Archives buildings were opened in 1935. Numerous strikes (see below) had delayed the opening of the building for almost a year. In April 1934, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins asked for additional (if minor) design changes.\\"Miss Perkins Asks Change in Labor Building.\\" Washington Post. April 16, 1934. Pressing needs for office space meant that a portion of the ICC building was occupied before the structure was finished.\\"U.S. Triangle Buildings To Be Up Within Year.\\" Washington Post. November 7, 1934. Minor alterations were made to the Labor building (such as creating a private rather than shared bathroom for the female Secretary) in January 1935.\\"Miss Perkins Won't Share Bath So New Labor Building Waits.\\" Washington Post. January 18, 1935. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins dedicated the two buildings at a ceremony in the Departmental Auditorium on February 26, 1935, attended by AFL President William Green.\\"Capital Dedicates New Labor Edifice.\\" New York Times. February 26, 1935.\\"New Building Dedicated Here To U.S. Labor.\\" Washington Post. February 26, 1935. The Labor building's final cost was $4.5 million and the ICC portion of the structure cost $4.45 million. The two buildings were connected by the 2,000-seat Departmental Auditorium (renamed the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in 1987).The ICC was not the only agency to take up space in the building. Due to the proliferation of New Deal government agencies and the lack of office space in the city, the ICC was forced to share office space for several years with the Federal Radio Commission, the Subsistence Homesteads Division of the Department of the Interior, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Soil Erosion Service of the Department of the Interior. See: \\"I.C.C. to Share Its Building.\\" Washington Post. May 26, 1934. Meanwhile, construction forged ahead on the Archives building. Already considered too small to hold all the materials in its possession, a proposal had been made to add another story to the building.\\"Archives Building Addition Dropped.\\" Washington Post. March 26, 1935. This proposal was rejected in March 1935. The National Archives building was occupied in November 1935, but had no formal dedication. Although the Archives structure had been one of the top priorities of almost all planners, it was one of the last buildings to be opened. Archives staff began moving into the building in November 1935, and the exhibition rotunda was opened to the public in November 1936.\\"Murals Portraying Nation's Birth Shown.\\" New York Times. November 15, 1936; \\"Novel Safeguards Given to Archives.\\" New York Times. September 4, 1938; National Records and Archives Administration. \\"History of the National Archives Building.\\" Archives.gov. No date. Accessed 2009-11-25. Records were not transferred in large numbers to the building until April 1937.\\"Records Go to New Archives.\\" New York Times. April 18, 1937. The Apex Building was the last to be constructed and dedicated. A major impetus for the building's construction came in June 1935, when the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) headquarters at C Street NW and 21st Street NW was razed to make way for the Federal Reserve Board Building.\\"Commission Asks Aid on New Home.\\" Washington Post. June 15, 1935. The FTC petitioned the Commission on Fine Arts to permit it to occupy the Apex Building. Testing for the foundation began in September 1936, and was completed shortly thereafter.\\"Borers Test Site of Apex Building.\\" Washington Post. September 3, 1936. With design work long completed and President Roosevelt expressing his wish that the structure be built, a $3.1 million contract for the building was signed on December 29, 1936.\\"$3,105,000 Contract Let For Building in District.\\" Washington Post. December 30, 1936. Using the George Washington trowel, President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for the building on July 12, 1937.\\"The Day in Washington.\\" New York Times. July 13, 1937.\\"FTC Building Dedication Rite Set for Today.\\" Washington Post. July 12, 1937. The building's $3.665 million cost was paid for out of Public Works Administration funds, and officials estimated it would be ready for occupation by January 1, 1938. Demolition of the old foundation for the unbuilt Washington Memorial occurred in July 1937, and much of the Apex Building's steel superstructure was rising by then as well.Sadler, Christine. \\"Workmen Speed Foundation for $10,000,000 U.S. Art Gallery on Constitution Avenue.\\" Washington Post. July 18, 1937. The great depth of the building's foundation meant that the crane operator lifting the steel beams into place was out of sight in the basement, and a series of telephone links from observers on the street relayed instructions to him.Ford, Elizabeth. \\"Huge Crane Is Operated by Engineer Hidden From Sight.\\" Washington Post. September 6, 1937. By December 1937, the building was two months ahead of schedule.\\"Federal Triangle Apex Building To Be Finished 60 Days Early.\\" Washington Post. December 14, 1937. One of the most important aspects of the new building was the group of massive sculptures to be installed on either side of the structure. A jury of four nationally known sculptors (Paul Manship, Adolph Alexander Weinman, Lee Lawrie, and William E. Parsons) selected the artist in January 1938.\\"Sculptor, on WPA Relief Rolls, Wins $45,600 Federal Contract.\\" Washington Post.

The winner was Michael Lantz, an award-winning instructor in sculpting then employed by the Works Progress Administration.\\"PA Teacher Wins Sculpture Award.\\" New York Times. January 27, 1938. The Apex Building had no dedication. The Commission and staff moved into the 125,000 square foot (11,625 square metres) building on April 21, 1938.Bailey, Judith and Hamill, James. \\"Note on the Federal Trade Commission Building.\\" 90th Anniversary Symposium.

Artwork, exterior details, landscaping, and other finishing touches on the construction of Federal Triangle occupied the period from 1938 to 1947. Landscaping issues of the Grand Plaza and Circular Plaza were considered in January 1934. To protect the Federal Triangle from flooding by the Potomac River (as had happened in 1871), the north and west grounds of the Washington Monument were raised in the summer of 1938 by about six feet (two metres) in order to form a dike against any future floodwaters.\\"Dike Will Protect Federal Triangle.\\" Washington Post. January 16, 1938. The final art installation in the complex was the Oscar Straus Memorial Fountain, designs for which were first considered in December 1933. Plans for the memorial were brought before President Roosevelt for his approval the same month. Discussion continued into 1934. The Federal Triangle project was considered complete with the installation of the Straus Memorial in 1947. But the Great Plaza was never built. Instead, the area was turned into a parking lot.\\"Great Plaza Again Asked For Square.\\" Washington Post. October 7, 1955. Federal Triangle and the Bonus Army In June 1932, thousands of homeless World War I veterans, their families, and their supporters occupied the recently condemned assemblage of buildings at the Federal Triangle site as part of the Bonus March on the capital to win better veterans' benefits.The main Bonus Army camp was actually across the 11th Street Bridges in the Anacostia neighborhood of D.C., more than three miles away.Dickson, Paul and Allen, Thomas B. The Bonus Army: An American Epic. New York: Walker and Company, 2004. On July 28, 1932, President Hoover ordered General Douglas MacArthur to remove the \\"Bonus Army\\" from the site. At 4:45 p.m., MacArthur led 1,200 infantry, 1,200 cavalry, and six battle tanks (commanded by Major George S. Patton) to Federal Triangle to remove the Bonus Army. More than 20,000 civil service workers (leaving their offices for the day) watched as the U.S. Army attacked its own veterans. Patton personally led a cavalry charge (with sabers drawn) into the mass of homeless people, and several hundred rounds of vomit gas were launched at the marchers. A Bonus marcher was killed on the site of the Apex Building.\\"Fine Arts Chairman Asks Eyesore Elimination on Lower Mall.\\" Washington Post. April 25, 1934. The Federal Triangle site was cleared and these members of the Bonus Army marched to Anacostia—where, at 10:14 p.m., MacArthur led a second attack on the 43,000 protesters and burned their camp to the ground. Labor issues during 1930s construction Looking southeast down Pennsylvania Avenue NW from the tower at the Old Post Office Pavilion. The red rooftops of Federal Triangle are (foreground to rearground) the Internal Revenue Building Addition, Dept. of Justice, and the National Archives (square-topped building). The rotunda belongs to the National Gallery of Art building. The U.S. Capitol is in the distance. Labor-management troubles occurred throughout construction of the initial seven buildings in the Federal Triangle complex in the 1920s and 1930s. Much of Washington, D.C.'s, construction workforce was unionized many years before the project began. All the building contractors employed by the federal government signed three-year contracts with the major labor unions representing their workers in September 1929, in the hope that this would eliminate any disruptions during the building program.\\"Labor Pacts Ends Building Worries.\\" Washington Post. September 17, 1929. But this hope proved false. The first problem occurred in July 1930, when the lathers union struck to win a $2 per day (16.7 percent) pay increase, halting work for a short period of time on the Archives, Interstate Commerce, Justice, Labor, and Post Office sites.\\"Strike of Lathers May Be Adjusted At Meeting Today.\\" Washington Post. July 10, 1930. A second strike occurred in late summer 1931 over a new federal wage law. The Davis-Bacon Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Hoover on March 3, 1931. On August 4, 1931, painters working on the Internal Revenue building struck, arguing that out-of- town workers were being imported into the city to work on the building and being paid $5-to-$7 a day rather than the prevailing local wage rate of $11 a day.\\"Painters Protest Wages On Job At Revenue Building.\\" Washington Post. August 4, 1931. Both the Treasury and Labor Departments stepped in to arbitrate the strike.\\"Painters' Pay Row Settlement Near.\\" Washington Post. August 6, 1931. The dispute was settled a few days later when the Labor Department found that the contractor had paid the correct wages, and that no workers were being paid overtime.\\"Meeting to Settle Painter Wage Fight.\\" Washington Post. August 7, 1931; \\"Federal Builders Painters' Wages Defended in Reply.\\" Washington Post. August 8, 1931.During the Great Depression, the federal government and labor unions discouraged businesses from asking existing employees to work overtime. With unemployment skyrocketing, businesses instead were encouraged to hire temporary workers, so that more people might work and thus feed and shelter themselves (as well as stay off public assistance rolls). See: Schlesinger, Arthur M. The Age of Roosevelt: The Crisis of the Old Order, 1919–1933. Paperback ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1957. The construction project's labor troubles worsened in 1933. With the Depression deepening, contractors were pressing for a 27.3 percent wage cut with their unions, particularly the carpenters' union. On January 6, 1933, a fire swept through the upper floors of the unfinished ICC building.\\"Flames Damage New I.C.C. Building.\\" Washington Post. January 7, 1933. The fire was ruled arson and a \\"disgruntled carpenter\\" was suspected.\\"Sabotage Scheme Seen in I.C.C. Fire.\\" Washington Post. January 8, 1933. Two weeks later, the operating engineers and steamfitters unions engaged in a jurisdictional strike against one another, stopping work at the Post Office construction site, but the AFL intervened and arbitrated a solution to the dispute.\\"Postoffice Strike Laid Before A.F.L. For Early Decision.\\" Washington Post. January 21, 1933. The earlier wage dispute, however, had not been resolved, and by February a general strike among all unionized workers at the Federal Triangle complex seemed likely.\\"General Strike Looms In May Pay Slash Row.\\" Washington Post. February 5, 1933; \\"Mall Wage Cutting Struggle to Reach Decision This Week.\\" Washington Post. February 6, 1933; \\"Walkout on 7 Triangle Jobs Is Threatened.\\" Washington Post. February 7, 1933. Employers said they would fire all unionized workers if a strike occurred and replace them with strikebreakers.\\"Labor Marks Time As Crisis Nears In Mall Wage Battle.\\" Washington Post. February 8, 1933. The two sides agreed to let the Treasury Department arbitrate their dispute,\\"Labor Disputants Look to Treasury in Mall Impasse.\\" Washington Post. February 10, 1933. and on February 13 the government ruled in favor of the unions—averting a job action.\\"Mall Workers Win Ruling On $11 Daily Wage.\\" Washington Post. February 14, 1933. The employers went to court, and in April 1933 the carpenters agreed to the 27.3 percent wage cut.\\"Carpenters Accept Wage Scale of $8.\\" Washington Post. April 15, 1933. The second major wage dispute of 1933 broke out in May. On May 26, more than 500 members of the plasterers' union struck to prevent a $2 (14.3 percent) pay cut, halting all work on the seven active Federal Triangle constructions sites.\\"Fight On Plasterer Wages Halts Work On 7 U.S. Buildings.\\" Washington Post. May 27, 1933. The employers and the American Institute of Architects both argued that the higher wage would inhibit economic recovery in the construction industry.\\"Builders Protest Plasterers' Wage.\\" Washington Post. May 30, 1933; \\"Architects Rap $14 Plaster Pay.\\" Washington Post. June 8, 1933; \\"Plasterers $14 Pay Delays Normalcy Architects Assert.\\" Washington Post. June 10, 1933. To prove their point, the employers locked out the workers; the strike collapsed, and plasterers went back to work on July 22.Pay did not actually drop to $12 a day until September 8, 1933. See: \\"Plasterers Back At Work Tomorrow.\\" Washington Post. July 23, 1933. August 1933 saw the eruption of a series of labor-management disputes and inter-union squabbles that put construction of the Federal Triangle complex on hold for several months. The first event was when the Journeyman Stonecutters Association of North America walked out on a jurisdictional strike against the iron workers' union on August 21, idling 225 men working on the Post Office building.\\"Walkout on U.S. Building Costs $500 Each Day.\\" Washington Post. September 1, 1933. The dispute was over which union would ride with crane operators to coordinate the movement of loads with workers on the ground. The strike lasted at least until September 7, with both sides seeking a decision from the American Federation of Labor.\\"Strikers Wait For Employers To End Dispute.\\" Washington Post.September 7, 1933. Then on September 1, 75 carpenters walked off the job in a jurisdictional dispute with the iron worker's union.\\"U.S. Building Strike Takes Serious Turn.\\" Washington Post. September 12, 1933. This dispute, which occurred at the Labor/ICC building, was over which workers would be permitted to install decorative enclosures around radiators. With work on the Labor/ICC buildings already two months behind schedule due to the earlier labor disputes, the employers threatened to stop all work if the carpenters' union struck and throw another 1,000 men out of work.\\"Strike Is Likely To Halt Public Building Work.\\" Washington Post. September 13, 1933. The employers shut down on September 15.\\"1,000 Workers Will Be Idle In Union Row.\\" Washington Post. September 15, 1933; \\"Lay-Off Halts Work on Two U.S. Buildings.\\" Washington Post. September 16, 1933. Twenty security guards were stationed at the Labor/ICC building to prevent vandalism.\\"U.S. Building Labor Dispute In Deadlock.\\" Washington Post. September 17, 1933. On September 18, a third jurisdictional strike occurred when the boilermakers' union walked off the job at the Federal Triangle central heating plant to protest the use of iron workers in the erection of smokestacks for the facility.\\"Heating Plant Work Is Halted By New Strike.\\" Washington Post. September 19, 1933. Construction of the smokestacks continued, but construction of the boilers was halted. A fourth jurisdictional strike erupted on September 20, when 80 members of the bricklayers' union walked off the job at the heating plant to protest the use of laborers to caulk windows, stone, and roof tiles.\\"U.S. Projects Face Walkout Of Bricklayers.\\" Washington Post. September 21, 1933. Although the bricklayers remained on the job for the moment, government officials feared that sympathy strikes would occur, stopping work at all seven construction sites.\\"Union Rejects U.S. Building Job Arbitration.\\" Washington Post. September 23, 1933.\\"U.S. Officials Fearing Spread Of Labor Row.\\" Washington Post. September 24, 1933. The carpenters rejected a call for the government to arbitrate the strike, and the employers asked for Senator Robert F. Wagner (a proponent of organized labor) to help settle the disputes.\\"Stewart Asks Wagner's Help In Labor Row.\\" Washington Post. September 26, 1933. On September 26, the AFL ruled that the smokestack work properly belonged to the iron workers, and ordered the boilermakers back to work.\\"Heating Plant Boilermakers Ordered Back.\\" Washington Post. September 27, 1933. But the carpenters' union initiated a new protest, arguing that the installation of pulley linings in elevators belonged to them and not to the elevator constructors' union. And the Washington Building and Construction Trades Council threatened to call a general strike of all construction workers if the bricklayers were not pulled off the job installing boiler insulation and the asbestos workers' union allowed to do the job instead. Senator Wagner also said on Sept. 28 that he believed a resolution to the carpenters/iron workers dispute (which had led to the layoff of 1,000 workers at the Labor/ICC building) could be reached. But the boilermakers did not return to work, leaving 450 workers laid off.\\"Boilermakers Silent in Move To Halt Strike.\\" Washington Post. September 28, 1933. Meanwhile, government officials said that the caulking, insulation, and pulley work disputes would be resolved soon, and would not in any case cause further disruptions at construction sites. Another major work disruption threatened the Federal Triangle complex when the iron workers' union demanded that contractors initiate two four-hour shifts per day rather than one eight- hour shift per day in order to spread work among more men.\\"Four-Hour Day Demand Halts U.S. Building.\\" Washington Post. October 4, 1933. When contractors balked, the union struck at the Post Office and Justice building sites. That strike lasted two days before about half of the employers capitulated.\\"Strike Perils I.C.C.-Labor Elevator Work.\\" Washington Post. October 7, 1933. But it continued for the remaining employers at the Justice and Post Office buildings.\\"Work Stopped By Contractor In Labor Row.\\" Washington Post. October 11, 1933. Finally, on October 11, 1933, frustrated and angry Labor Department officials said that unless the jurisdictional disputes were ended quickly, the government would seek authorization from Congress in January to force the unions back to work and resolve the disputes itself.\\"Plan to Break U.S. Buildings Strikes Told.\\" Washington Post. October 12, 1933. The threat worked: On October 13, all parties to all jurisdictional disputes agreed to return to work while continuing to seek resolution to their problems via other channels.\\"1,000 Abandon Strike in U.S. Building Row.\\" Washington Post. October 14, 1933; \\"500 Men Back On Federal Job In Labor Clash One Iron Workers' Group Resumes Work on I.C.C. Structure.\\" Washington Post. October 17, 1933. Federal officials excoriated the carpenters' union for holding up a $40,000-a-week payroll for four weeks over an $800 job. Eleven days later, the iron workers' union agreed to return to the eight-hour shift.\\"Builders Win 4-Hour Day Labor Battle.\\" Washington Post. October 25, 1933. The labor peace was short-lived. Four unions refused to do work on the Post Office conveyor belt system in mid-November,\\"Labor Dispute Still Delaying Post office Job.\\" Washington Post. December 7, 1933. and the dispute over elevators spread to the Labor/ICC building in February 1934 (delaying the building's opening indefinitely).\\"Labor Fight Delays Work On Buildings.\\" Washington Post. February 1, 1934. On February 14, 1934, 225 carpenters engaged in a jurisdictional strike against the cement finishers' union at the Labor/ICC building over the installation of tile flooring.\\"U.S. Building Faces Delay As 225 Quit.\\" Washington Post. February 15, 1934. The dispute was elevated to AFL President William Green,\\"Labor-I.C.C. Building Row Up to Green.\\" Washington Post. March 2, 1934.

But just three weeks later, the plasterers' union led a jurisdictional strike against the stonecutters' union at the Labor/ICC building because the stonecutters were installing acoustical marble columns.\\"Jurisdictional Strikes.\\" Washington Post. April 16, 1934; \\"Building Strike Continues Here.\\" Washington Post. April 21, 1934. Contractors, angry at the repeated inter-union squabbles, announced they would no longer employ reduced-hour shifts or give pay raises.\\"Pay Raises Are Banned By Builders.\\" Washington Post. May 19, 1934. The carpenters' union called for a general strike of all unions at the Labor/ICC building on May 25,\\"General Strike On Labor-I.C.C. Building Called.\\" Washington Post. May 26, 1934. a strike which spread to the city's ice cream plants.\\"D.C. Ice Cream Strike Ended; Began May 15.\\" Washington Post. June 6, 1934. That secondary strike ended June 4. But the general construction strike began to spread to other federal projects throughout the city, leading to an increasing number of calls for the strike to be settled by arbitration.\\"Building Strike May Be Settled By Arbitration.\\" Washington Post. June 11, 1934. As the work stoppage spread, the carpenters' union's contract with the construction companies expired on May 30.\\"Carpenters End Strike, Accept $10 a Day Wage, Return to Jobs Today.\\" Washington Post. June 20, 1934. The employers declared on June 12 that they would no longer adhere to any closed shop agreements with the carpenters, and instead would impose the open shop and employ any carpenter (union or non-union) in order to finish the work on existing construction projects.\\"All Builders Defy Unions, Go Open Shop.\\" Washington Post. June 13, 1934. The construction unions declared they would pull every worker off every job if non-union construction laborers were hired, and the D.C Metropolitan Police Department made preparations to patrol streets and job sites to prevent any violence from erupting. Non-union workers were hired, and the carpenters' union struck all job sites throughout the city amidst fears that the carpenters might strike all federal construction projects nationwide.\\"D.C. Strike Peace Fails, 3 Hurt in First Clash of Open Shop Warfare.\\" Washington Post. June 14, 1934. Three union members were injured on June 13 as picketers clashed with security guards hired by the employers. But the strike did not spread to the other unions, and the Washington Building and Construction Trades Council and D.C. Commissioner George E. Allen attempted to mediate an end to the strike.\\"Trades Council Urges Arbiters For D.C. Strike.\\" Washington Post. June 15, 1934. The carpenters rejected the arbitration attempt,\\"Carpenters Spurn Strike Arbitration.\\" Washington Post. June 16, 1934. and bands of roving picketers moving among construction sites led to traffic tie-ups, frightened citizens, and rumors of violence.Gross, Gerald G. \\"Carpenters Keep City in Turmoil.\\" Washington Post. June 17, 1934. The \\"open shop strike\\" ended on June 20, 1934, when the carpenters agreed to a new contract providing for a five-day, 40-hour work week and $1.25 an hour in pay. But no agreement was made regarding the open shop. The plasterers' union ended their strike in June 1934, and went to local district court to resolve the jurisdictional dispute.\\"Union Dispute Aired in Court.\\" Washington Post. June 21, 1934. The final labor dispute to affect the Federal Triangle complex construction was a jurisdictional strike over the installation of library shelving at the National Archives building in November 1935.\\"Strike Over Book Stacks Halts Archives Building Work Again.\\" Washington Post. November 26, 1935. Federal Triangle's first half-century The continuing existence of the District Building, Old Post Office Pavilion, and Southern Railway building as well as parking issues became points of contention during Federal Triangle's first 50 years. District of Columbia officials said in 1958 that they were willing to have the District Building torn down and Federal Triangle \\"finished\\" (if the city was properly compensated), but a lack of federal funds defeated the move.Eisen, Jack. \\"Delay for Federal Triangle Foreseen in Lack of Funds.\\" Washington Post. May 8, 1958. In 1995, the D.C. and federal governments signed an agreement in which the federal government would construct a new top floor and renovate the building (at a cost of $47 million) in return for a 20-year lease on 130,000 square feet (12,090 square metres) of space in the structure.Schneider, Howard. \\"Proposal to Renovate District Building Is Outlined.\\" Washington Post.

In the late 1980s, plans were laid to double the size of the Old Post Office Pavilion's retail space to 75,000 square feet (6,975 square metres) in order to attract more shoppers to the building.Hilzenrath, David S. \\"Old Post Office Passes First Test for Expansion.\\" Washington Post.

Lanham, Md.: AltaMira Press, 2008. the retail space expansion was financed and completed in 1992.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"Facets of an Unpolished Jewel.\\" Washington Post. March 7, 1992. Despite the federal government's intention to demolish the Southern Railway Building and construct a federal office building on the site to complete the Federal Triangle complex, the building stood until 1971. It was demolished in that year, and turned into a parking lot. As many critics had anticipated during Federal Triangle's construction in the 1930s, parking issues grew much worse due to the development's existence.\\"Federal Triangle Blamed for Traffic Snarl.\\" Washington Post.March 23, 1941. In the late 1950s, a proposal was made to build a commuter and long-distance bus terminal at Federal Triangle as well as a large office building on the space of the parking lot, but the $60 million it would take to build the terminal was never provided.\\"Top Decision Expected On Midtown Terminal.\\" Washington Post. May 20, 1959. The parking issue became so vexing that the Eisenhower administration ordered its own parking study in 1959.Eisen, Jack. \\"White House Orders Parking Space Study.\\" Washington Post. May 31, 1959. There were several attempts to remove the parking lot in the interior of Federal Triangle and build the long- planned Great Plaza. The first such move came in 1955, when the Commission of Fine Arts asked the federal government to build the plaza, but nothing came of the proposal. A second effort was made in 1972, with the goal of building the Great Plaza in time for the national bicentennial in 1976, but the required $36.7 million in federal funds were not forthcoming.Green, Stephen. \\"Funds Denied For Building Grand Plaza.\\" Washington Post. June 20, 1972. The parking lot was leased to a private company in 1979.\\"Court Backs U.S. in Suit Over Parking Lot.\\" Washington Post. July 25, 1979. Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain with the West Building of the National Gallery of Art in background (2008) The Federal Triangle Metro station was opened at Federal Triangle on July 1, 1977. Several other outstanding issues regarding Federal Triangle's development were also raised, and occasionally resolved, in the next half- century. The closure and elimination of Ohio and Louisiana Avenues NW led each state's representatives to seek to rename other streets in the District of Columbia after those states. Ohio Drive NW came into existence in 1949, after Congress passed legislation authorizing the name change of the drive along the Tidal Basin.\\"Ohio's Name Goes on D.C. Street Today.\\" Washington Post. August 12, 1949. Another issue remaining from Federal Triangle's development regarded the condemnation of railway tracks in the area. The Mount Vernon, Alexandria and Washington Railway argued that it had not been properly compensated for the loss of its tracks in the area, and in 1943 sought federal relief.\\"Bill Would Enable Railway to Sue For Loss-Recovery.\\" Washington Post. February 20, 1943. Some improvements were made to Federal Triangle, however. In 1952, the Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain was dedicated within the eastern tip of the Triangle. A new cooling plant was built in 1960.\\"Big Cooler Approved For Federal Triangle.\\" Washington Post. January 8, 1960. Beginning in 1970, all the buildings were floodlit at night in order to reduce the level of crime in the area.Hodge, Paul. \\"9 Buildings to Get Bright New Lights.\\" Washington Post.

April 21, 1984. After the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 (which killed 168 people), security at Federal Triangle was tightened measurably and many of the pedestrian areas and buildings restricted to federal employees or those with official business.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"Square Deal for Federal Triangle.\\" Washington Post. May 24, 1998. A major renovation for the Labor, ICC, and Post Office buildings was conducted in 1998. Ronald Reagan Building construction =Context= Even as parking and traffic issues continued to cause controversy at Federal Triangle in the 1960s and 1970s, efforts were under way to remove the parking lot and \\"finish\\" Federal Triangle by building a large office building on the site. The first effort came in 1972, when the Nixon administration proposed building a $126 million office building on the lot in time for the national bicentennial in 1976.Eisen, Jack. \\"76 Finish Sought for 'Triangle'.\\" Washington Post. January 25, 1972. But this proposal was never seriously contemplated or funded. One outcome of the Nixon proposal, however, was \\"the Weese Plan.\\" The Nixon administration commissioned the architecture planning firm of Harry Weese & Associates to come up with a master plan for the continued development of Federal Triangle. The Master Plan (which became known as \\"the Weese Plan\\") did not only propose a massive new federal office building on the parking lots of the Triangle. It also proposed a new series of pedestrian paths throughout the complex, titled \\"Federal Walk.\\" Federal Walk would not only be a network of sidewalks designed to showcase the architecture of Federal Triangle; it also included destinations such as spots for tourists to wait for tours of the interiors of each building, outdoor art, places for rest and contemplation, and even cafes and restaurants. Federal Walk was gradually implemented in piecemeal fashion over the next 15 years, although it still remained incomplete as of 1997. GSA held a competition in 1982 to select a design for a 10-story office building to replace the parking lot, but planning bodies refused to approve the plan.Miller, Tim. \\"GSA to Begin Selection Of Triangle Designers.\\" Washington Post. February 20, 1982; Eisen, Jack. \\"Office Building on Great Plaza Denied.\\" Washington Post. April 23, 1982. Plans for construction of an office building on the Federal Triangle parking lot site found support in 1986. The Federal City Council,Federal City Council Web site. a private civic organization which had been promoting the construction of a $200 million international trade center in the District of Columbia, advocated construction of its proposed building at Federal Triangle.Mintz, John. \\"New Sites Eyed In District for Trade Center.\\" Washington Post. May 23, 1986. Reagan administration officials favored the plan, and in October 1986 the proposal received the backing of the General Services Administration.Havemann, Judith. \\"Trade Center Draws Support.\\" Washington Post. October 30, 1986. The idea received support from Democrats in Congress as well, especially from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former Kennedy administration aide who had long championed completion of the Federal Triangle.Havemann, Judith. \\"JFK Planted Seeds After Inaugural.\\" Washington Post. August 8, 1987. There was some opposition to the idea from planning officials and others, who were dismayed at the loss of parking in the downtown area and who feared that the trade center's proposed 1,300 to 2,600 underground parking slots would not be built due to poor soil conditions.\\"It May Be Ugly, But at Least It's a Parking Lot.\\" Washington Post. August 16, 1987. A bill was passed (almost unanimously) by Congress on August 7, 1987, to provide $362 million for the construction of an \\"International Cultural and Trade Center\\" on the parking lot at Federal Triangle.Havemann, Judith. \\"Completion of Federal Triangle Voted.\\" Washington Post. August 8, 1987. The plan was to provide office space for both the Justice and State departments. The legislation also provided that although the U.S. government would finance the building, a private developer would construct it. The federal government would lease space from the private developer for 30 years, after which ownership of the building would revert to the government.Crenshaw, Albert B. \\"Funding Plan Is Unusual For Government Building.\\" Washington Post. January 17, 1990. The bill also required the building to be financially self-supporting within two years of its completion. The rental prices throughout the lease's term would remain stable. It was only the fifth time the government had signed a \\"lease-to-own\\" agreement. With 1.4 million square feet (130,200 square metres) of office space and 500,000 square feet (46,500 square metres) of space for trade center activities, the planned trade center would be larger than any other federally owned building except for The Pentagon. The bill also required that the trade center be \\"designed in harmony with historical and government buildings in the vicinity, ... reflect the symbolic importance and historic character of Pennsylvania Avenue and the Nation's Capital, and ... represent the dignity and stability of the Federal Government.\\"McPherson, Harry. \\"A Winner On the Avenue.\\" Washington Post. August 21, 1987. A nine-member panel was established to approve any plans, and included the Secretaries of State, Agriculture, and Commerce; the Mayor of the District of Columbia; and five members of the public.\\"Five Named to Panel On Cultural Center.\\" Washington Post. April 7, 1988. The building was expected to be completed in 1992. President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Triangle Development Act into law on August 22, 1987.\\"President Signs Federal Triangle Expansion Act.\\" Washington Post. August 23, 1987. =Design and construction= The 14th Street NW facade of the Ronald Reagan Building in 2006. Preliminary design specifications required that the final building be no taller than the existing Federal Triangle structures, be constructed of similar materials, emphasize pedestrian traffic, and have a \\"sympathetic\\" architectural style.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"Energizing the Great Plaza.\\" Washington Post. April 18, 1987. An architectural model by the firms of Notter Finegold & Alexander, Mariani & Associates, and Bryant & Bryant depicted a building with a long, uninterrupted facade along 14th Street NW and two colonnaded hemicycles on the east side (matching the Post Office Department building's hemicycle). The preliminary design specs were criticized for not more clearly specifying the architectural style, for bringing another 10,000 new workers to Federal Triangle each day, and for reducing the required number of parking spaces by 30 percent to just 1,300.Hilzenrath, David S. \\"Huge Office Plan Draws Criticism.\\" Washington Post. April 16, 1988. The five public members of the design committee were named on April 6, 1988, and were former Senator Charles H. Percy, chair; Harry McPherson, president of the Federal City Council; Donald A. Brown, chair of the Federal City Council's International Center Task Force; Michael R. Garder, a member of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation; and Judah C. Sommer, a local attorney. Groundbreaking on the now-$350 million building was scheduled for 1989, and completion in 1993. Disagreements broke out in mid-1988 over which federal agencies should take up residence in the structure, and whether they should be trade- or foreign-policy related.Hilzenrath, David S. \\"Plan to Move Justice Dept. Is Attacked.\\" Washington Post. June 25, 1988; Hilzenrath, David S. \\"Federal Tenants Compete for Complex.\\" Washington Post. December 3, 1988. Seven designs were submitted in June 1989, each incorporating a base-middle-crown structure and enclosed in traditional materials (limestone facade, vertical glass windows, terra-cotta roof tiles).Forgey, Benjamin. \\"Competing to Complete the Triangle.\\" Washington Post. June 10, 1989. Each design incorporated a new home for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (a Smithsonian Institution entity), an outdoor memorial to President Woodrow Wilson, and exhibition and retail space. Construction began in mid-1989. Contractors estimated the cost of the building at between $550 million and $800 million, far higher than the anticipated $350 million original price tag.Hilzenrath, David S. \\"Bidding for a Federal Triangle Bonanza.\\" Washington Post. June 10, 1989. The design committee picked the $738.3 million design submitted by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners in October 1989.Wheeler, Linda. \\"Federal Triangle Developer Picked.\\" Washington Post. October 19, 1989. A consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr. was chosen to build and operate the building and lease it to the government. One of the firms which had lost this contract subsequently challenged the bidding process.\\"Development Company Challenges Award of Federal Triangle Contract.\\" Washington Post. March 3, 1990. =Cancellation, completion, and opening= Significant cost increases led to the project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year.Hilzenrath, David S. \\"Ballooning Costs Delay Federal Triangle Project.\\" Washington Post. July 20, 1990. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from the cost of the building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million.Hilzenrath, David S. \\"$656 Million Building Set for Federal Triangle.\\" Washington Post. September 22, 1990. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces.Camp, Margaret. \\"Parking Push Comes To Shove.\\" Washington Post. January 10, 1991. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design.Lewis, Nancy. \\"Developer Quits Federal Triangle Trade Center Panel.\\" Washington Post. January 1, 1992. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges.Jenkins, Jr., Kent. \\"Norton Names 'Villains' In D.C. Trade Center Fight.\\" Washington Post. January 3, 1992; Pyatt, Jr., Rudoph A. \\"In Dubious Battle for a Boondoggle.\\" Washington Post. January 13, 1992. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency.\\"A Harder Look at the ICTC.\\" Washington Post. January 20, 1992; \\"Boondoggle on 'America's Main Street'.\\" Washington Post. January 24, 1992. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions.Spolar, Christine. \\"White House Scraps D.C. Trade Center.\\" Washington Post. January 26, 1992. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process.Pyatt, Jr., Rudloph A. \\"Flawed Selection Process Taints Downtown Federal Complex.\\" Washington Post. January 30, 1992. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.Grimsley, Kirstin Downey. \\"Federal Triangle's Points of Contention.\\" Washington Post. December 5, 1993. The decision to cancel the building was reversed on December 2, 1993, by the Clinton administration.Hamilton, Martha M. and Grimsley, Kirstin Downey. \\"International Trade Center Plan Revived.\\" Washington Post. December 3, 1993. Although the building was originally designed to be a major tourist destination and provide a boost to economic development in the downtown area, the building was repurposed to be a simple office building. Rather than a mix of federal and private renters, federal agencies were now scheduled to occupy 80 percent of the office space.Duggan, Paul. \\"Progress on a Massive Scale.\\" Washington Post. September 17, 1995. By January 1995, the structure was two years behind schedule.Haggerty, Maryann. \\"Hard Floors and Soft Numbers at Federal Triangle Construction.\\" Washington Post. January 9, 1995. By September 1995, a tentative occupancy date of December 1996 had been set. The building was named for former President Ronald Reagan in October 1995.\\"Federal Building May Be Named In Reagan's Honor.\\" Washington Post. October 13, 1995. There were still occasional design glitches. For example, the GSA approved two major sculptures for the Woodrow Wilson Plaza in 1994, abruptly ordered a halt to work on the sculptures in June 1996, and then ordered work to proceed again in July 1996.Trescott, Jacqueline. \\"Federal Agency Halts Art Project.\\" Washington Post. June 22, 1996; Trescott, Jacqueline. \\"Sculptors Put Back to Work.\\" Washington Post. July 30, 1996. Construction slipped further, and by January 1997 occupancy was scheduled for the following summer.Haggery, Maryann. \\"At Federal Triangle, a Pretty Facade on an Unfinished Work.\\" Washington Post. January 21, 1997. Construction continued to fall behind schedule, with completion not expected until summer 1998.Behr, Peter and Lelen, Kenneth. \\"Reagan Building Nears Its Debut.\\" Washington Post. June 5, 1997. Nonetheless, federal officials planned to move more than 480 Environmental Protection Agency employees into the building in July 1997.Barr, Stephen. \\"Grand Tour of Reagan Building Reinforces Facility's Grand Scale.\\" Washington Post. June 6, 1997. By this time, security concerns had led to several additional design changes (including a reduction in the number of parking spaces to just 1,900), and the cost of the structure had risen to $738 million. The Ronald Reagan Building opened on May 5, 1998. President Bill Clinton and former First Lady Nancy Reagan dedicated the building.Montgomery, David and Wheeler, Linda. \\"A Soaring Reagan Tribute.\\" Washington Post. May 6, 1998. Three large pieces of artwork were included in the building. The first, by sculptor and D.C. native Stephen Robin, is a gigantic rose with stem and a lily, both made out of cast aluminum and lying on stone pedestals.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"The Capstone of the Federal Triangle.\\" Washington Post. April 25, 1998. The second, by African American D.C. native Martin Puryear, is a Minimalist tower of brown welded metal titled \\"Bearing Witness\\" which stands in Woodrow Wilson Plaza. The third, located inside the building's atrium, is a multi-story neon installation by Keith Sonnier titled \\"Route Zenith.\\" The structure's final cost was $818 million. Critical assessment \\"Federal Triangle was the most important government construction project of the 1930s in Washington.\\"Goode, \\"Introduction: The Creation of Monumental Washington in the 1930s,\\" in Washington by Night: Vintage Photographs From the 30s, 1998, p. 13. It was the largest construction project in the United States in the 1930s; only the construction of Rockefeller Center in New York City came close. It \\"remains one of the most important design and construction projects\\" in American history.Goode, \\"Introduction: The Creation of Monumental Washington in the 1930s,\\" in Washington by Night: Vintage Photographs From the 30s, 1998, p. 14. The original seven buildings won critical praise for their beauty from the news media when they first opened. The Washington Post said the Internal Revenue building was \\"a credit to any city\\" and declared the \\"marble work to be among the most beautiful in the United States.\\" At its dedication, the New York Times called the Department of Justice building \\"one of the most beautiful public buildings in the world\\". But praise was most heavily lavished on the Commerce building. It was not only the largest office building in the world, but the \\"greatest of office buildings\\" and one which represented the aspirations of the nation.McDonnell, J. Bernard. \\"Department of Commerce Home Greatest of Office Buildings.\\" Washington Post. December 31, 1931. It had \\"dignity without severity\\", one report said, and was \\"a magnificent architectural end\\".\\"Commerce Home Marked By Dignity.\\" Washington Post. December 31, 1931. It had the \\"world's most extensive and impressive applications of bronze\\", \\"embellished with a wealth of detail, delicately modeled, carefully tooled, finely chased and exactingly finished.\\"\\"Beautiful Bronze Work Ornaments in Structure.\\" Washington Post. December 31, 1931. Even the interior decorating scheme was highly noted for its \\"fine architectural effect\\".\\"Colorful Painting Is Used in Building.\\" Washington Post. December 31, 1931. But younger architects in the 1930s criticized the style and size of the buildings at Federal Triangle for being \\"elitist, pretentious, and anachronistic\\".Cannadine, Mellon: An American Life, 2008, p. 399. Architecture critic William Harlan Hale strongly criticized the Neoclassical style for being unimaginative and anti-democratic: \\"New Deal indeed! What was there new, or modern, or imaginative, or efficient, or economical in trying to give modern Washington the character of Imperial Rome? What was there either aesthetic or intelligent in cloaking the offices of a modern democracy as the temple of a classic tyrant, the gallery of a Renaissance prince, or the palace of a French monarch? ...we have learned quite a lot about the principles of modern architecture, just as we have learned a lot about some other things; and today, after so short a time, it looks pretty much like a relic out of the dim past.\\"Hale, William Harlan. \\"The New Deal in Limestone.\\" Washington Post. November 26, 1933. By the 1940s, some critics said the buildings were too reminiscent of Nazi and Soviet architecture. Initial assessments of the Ronald Reagan Building's design were overwhelmingly positive. Washington Post critic Benjamin Forgey highly praised the Pei Cobb Freed design when it was first made public. Forgey found the final building even more praiseworthy, finding it full of \\"character and extraordinary potential,\\" \\"brilliant,\\" \\"vital,\\" \\"welcoming,\\" \\"clever\\" and \\"dynamic.\\" Forgey particularly praised the bold stroke of the building's diagonal structure (which extends from the rotunda at the north end of Woodrow Wilson Plaza to the juncture of 13th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW) and the conical atrium on the building's east side. Federal employees working in the building gave it \\"rave reviews\\" and at its dedication was one of the most sought-after places to work in the city. But six months later, another Washington Post reporter declared the Ronald Reagan building \\"much too large,\\" \\"confusing\\" to get around in, \\"awkwardly configured,\\" and with \\"dismal views\\".Lewis, Roger K. \\"Report Card on Area's Architecture: Only MCI Center Gets the Top Grade.\\" Washington Post. January 2, 1999. The facade, the critic felt, was \\"relentlessly austere\\" and represented \\"a lost opportunity to lighten the Federal Triangle's imperial, ponderous architectural spirit.\\" Current buildings Aerial view of Federal Triangle (2002) Federal Triangle facing east (2007) Federal Triangle facing west (between 1986 and 1990) As of 2009, the Federal Triangle development contained two existing buildings and eight buildings built specifically for the development.

Though its borders are not clearly defined, Friendship Heights consists roughly of the neighborhoods and commercial areas around Wisconsin Avenue north of Fessenden Street NW and Tenleytown to Somerset Terrace and Willard Avenue in Maryland, and from River Road in the west to Reno Road and 41st Street in the east. Within Maryland west of Wisconsin Avenue is the Village of Friendship Heights, technically a special taxation district. The portion in the District of Columbia lies in Ward 3, represented by ANCs 3E03 and 3E04. It is often considered to be part of Chevy Chase, D.C.; The most substantial commercial aspects are the shopping plazas near the intersection of Wisconsin and Western Avenues. Found here are many department stores, as well as numerous boutiques, day spas, a multiplex cinema and other services which cater to the residents as well as visitors to the area. The area also features a variety of moderate and discount chains. The neighborhood also supports a number of offices, including the corporate headquarters of insurance giant GEICO (originally Government Employees Insurance Company) and the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain, and a concentration of broadcast media including the studios of WMAL-FM, WSBN, and WTTG (Fox 5). As a result, heavy traffic is not uncommon. The Friendship Heights Station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro system serves the area, and the station is also a major connecting depot for area bus services. Streetcar service, which once connected the neighborhood to Georgetown, was abandoned in 1960. Since the late 1990s, development has accelerated in the neighborhood, notably the construction of Chase Tower on Willard Avenue, a new Chevy Chase Center replacing the older 1980s-era complex of the same name, and new condominiums on the site of the former Washington Women's Clinic.

Shopping districts and streets in the United States ","title":"Friendship Heights"},{"id":"997808","text":"Judiciary Square is a neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C., the vast majority of which is occupied by various federal and municipal courthouses and office buildings. Judiciary Square is located roughly between Pennsylvania Avenue to the south, H Street to the north, 6th Street to the west, and the Interstate 395 access tunnel to the east. The center of the neighborhood is an actual plaza named Judiciary Square. The square itself is bounded by 4th Street to east, 5th Street to the west, D Street to the south, and F Street to the north. The neighborhood is served by the Judiciary Square station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro. Judiciary Square is also home to Georgetown University Law Center, located on New Jersey Avenue NW. History 19th century houses on the corner of 5th and D Streets NW During the first half of the 19th century, Judiciary Square had a heavily residential population. Its proximity to the courthouses attracted lawyers, judges, and clerks to the neighborhood, while its location between the White House and the United States Capitol made it ideal for government employees. Among its most prominent residents were Senator Thomas Hart Benton, Vice President John C. Calhoun, and Daniel Webster. As of 2006, however, nearly all of the rowhouses in the area were gone, with the remaining houses mostly centered on the intersection of 5th and D Streets. Around the turn of the 20th century, the eastern side of Judiciary Square became an enclave of Italian immigrants in Washington; the equivalent of a Little Italy, although it was never called that. The Italian neighborhood rested on the eastern edge of the square proper, stretching eastward to about 2nd Street NW. The heart of the community was Holy Rosary Church, a chapel built at 3rd and F Streets NW. The neighborhood grew throughout the 20th century, with a particular surge of Italian immigrants in the 1950s and 60s. However, the construction of Interstate 395 through the city in the 1970s razed about half of the neighborhood and forced its remaining residents to move away from the heavy commuter traffic. Today, the former Italian enclave is dominated by Federal office buildings and law offices. The Holy Rosary Church remains standing and continues to draw a heavily Italian congregation along with its \\"Casa Italiana\\" cultural center next door.

Center Leg Freeway development The District government finalized a deal in 2010 with the Louis Dreyfus Group to construct a mixed-use development in the airspace over the Center Leg Freeway (Interstate 395). The $425 million office, residential, and retail project at the east end of the Judiciary Square neighborhood will also restore the area's original L'Enfant Plan street grid by reconnecting F and G Streets over the freeway. The project awaited final regulatory approval for several years and was underway in 2016. References Ethnic enclaves in Washington, D.C. Neighborhoods in Northwest (Washington, D.C.)

According to a Maori legend, the strait was created by Kewa the obedient whale when traditional Maori ancestor Kiwa summoned the whale to create a waterway. Three large bays, Te Waewae Bay, Oreti Beach and Toetoes Bay, sweep along the strait's northern coast, which also hosts Bluff township and harbour. Across the strait lie the Solander Islands, Stewart Island, Dog Island and Ruapuke Island. The strait is about 130 km long (from Ruapuke Island to Little Solander Island), and it widens (from 14 km at Ruapuke Island to 50 km at Te Waewae Bay) and deepens (from 20 to 120 m) from east to west. The strait lies within the continental shelf area of New Zealand, and was probably dry land during the Pleistocene epoch. Margaret Cameron-Ash claims that James Cook sighted Foveaux Strait during his circumnavigation of the South Island in March 1770, but hid his discovery for reasons of military and colonial policy..

Mawer, however, argues that it is more likely that Cook simply made an error, as his focus was on finding the southern extent of New Zealand, and conditions were unfavourable for more closely exploring the possible strait. The strait was first charted by Owen Folger Smith, a New Yorker who had been in Sydney Harbour with Eber Bunker from whom he probably learned of the eastern seal fishery. Smith charted the strait in the whaleboat of the sealing brig Union (out of New York) in 1804 and on his 1806 chart it was called Smith's Straits. This chart was given to Governor Philip Gidley King, who did not make it public. This seems a strange action on behalf of King, who was duty bound to communicate all hydrographic discoveries to the Admiralty.Howard, Basil. and Stewart Island Centennial Committee.

Foveaux Strait is home to the Bluff oyster fishery, the oysters are harvested by a fleet of dredging boats - mostly operating from Bluff Harbour in the South Island - between March and August each year. Oystering began on Stewart Island during the 1860s, and gradually moved into the strait with the discovery of larger oyster beds there in 1879. The strait is a rough and often treacherous stretch of water. In 2006, six muttonbirders died when their trawler sank while returning to Bluff. From the years 1998 to 2012 there were a total of 23 fatalities in the Strait. John van Leeuwen swam it on 7 February 1963, in a time of 13 hours 40 minutes.

Immediately below the plaza and the buildings is the \\"La Promenade\\" shopping mall.\\"The L'Enfant complex ... includes three private office buildings and one government-owned building ...\\" See: Spinner, Jackie. \\"Rooftop Residences at Hechinger Site.\\" Washington Post.

The plaza is located south of Independence Avenue SW between 12th and 9th Streets SW (9th Street actually runs underneath the centers of the buildings on the easternmost side of the plaza). It was built perpendicular to L'Enfant Promenade, a north-south running street and pedestrian esplanade part of which is directly above 10th Street SW. The plaza is named for Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant,L'Enfant was born Pierre L'Enfant, but anglicized his name to Peter. Both names were used in the United States when referring to him. See: Sandiford, 2008, p. 5. the architect and planner who first designed a street layout for the capital city (see L'Enfant Plan). It was dedicated in 1968 after completion of the north and south buildings. Planning Looking over the Southwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., in July 1939 at the U.S. Capitol building. L'Enfant Plaza was part of the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project, one of the earliest urban renewal projects in the U.S., and the first such in D.C.Banks and Banks, 2004, p. 41. The rapid expansion of the population of Washington, D.C., during World War II led to the extensive construction of suburban office buildings and housing tracts.Redevelopment of Southwest D.C. had originally been proposed in 1942 by Arthur Goodwillie, an executive with the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, an agency of the federal government which provided short-term loans to individuals in danger of losing their homes. The \\"Goodwillie Plan\\" recommended renovating a nine-block area near the U.S. Capitol building for use as wartime housing. It also proposed building new high-rise apartment stories on some open lots in the area. See: Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 260-261. But with federal agencies (which were the area's largest employers) restricted to the city center, a movement began after the war to redevelop Washington's older, more dilapidated, single-family-dwelling neighborhoods to provide high- density, modern housing for workers.Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 258. In 1946, the United States Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital.Committee on the District of Columbia, 1978, p. 112. Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped, and how. The RLA was not funded, however, until passage of the Housing Act of 1949.Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 260. A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings, overcrowding, and threats to public health (such as lack of running indoor water, sewage systems, electricity, central heating, and indoor toilets).Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 266-267. Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods, but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding.Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 267-271; Banks and Banks, 2004, p. 42. Demolition faced almost all structures in Southwest Washington and was to have begun in 1950, but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid-1950s. Most of the dwellings in Southwest D.C. were Victorian row houses.Goode, 1979, p. 149-150. Poor and middle-class African American and immigrant Central and Eastern European families living in the area were forced out of their homes by use of eminent domain, receiving only a fraction of the value of their homes in compensation. In 1954, Southwest D.C. had about 3,900 buildings housing 4,500 families.Albrook, Robert. \\"D.C. to Get First Urban Renewal Funds For Developing Project 'C' in Southwest.\\" Washington Post. October 10, 1954. About 60 percent of the residents were African American, and the remainder Caucasian. Only 20 percent of the residents owned their own home, and 72 percent of the buildings were rated as substandard. The area which became L'Enfant Plaza was primarily Victorian townhouses, although a shuttered slaughterhouse also stood in the area.Von Eckardt, Wolf. \\"In All Its Dead-End Glory.\\" Washington Post. May 5, 1973. =New plan= The RLA was the first to propose a major plaza along 10th Street NW. It commissioned architects Robert Justement and Chloethiel Woodard Smith to devise a master site plan for Southwest D.C. The Justement-Smith plan, released in 1952, called for wholesale clearance of the area.Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 268. Notably, the Justement-Smith plan also proposed building an esplanade above 10th Street SW (to allow it to pass over the railroad tracks and the then- under construction Southwest-Southeast Freeway) which would connect with Maine Avenue SW. The RLA later said it had studied putting the mall anywhere from 5th Street to 12th Street, but that 10th Street was the only economical location.Albrook, Robert C. \\"NCPC Has New Road Plan for Southwest.\\" Washington Post. February 5, 1955. Parks would border the esplanade east and west, with a goal of providing an unobstructed view of the Smithsonian Institution headquarters and the National Mall. In November 1952, the NCPC released a report largely supporting the Justement-Smith plan (although emphasizing the construction of low-rise townhouses rather than a \\"forest\\" of high-rise apartment buildings).Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 269-271. The NCPC report also approved of the plan to build an esplanade above 10th Street SW, although it noted that there were significant geographical obstacles to the plan. In 1953, the RLA asked developers to submit plans based on the NCPC's November 1952 compromise report.Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 271. =Naming= William Zeckendorf in 1952. \\"L'Enfant Plaza\\" was the name proposed by New York City developer William Zeckendorf in February 1954 as the title for a cultural center within a development that would almost completely encompass all of Southwest D.C. (an area designated as \\"Project C\\").Zagoria, Sam. \\"Zeckendorf 'Ideal City' Is Described to Officials.\\" Washington Post. February 17, 1954. As originally laid out, a traffic circle would be built on Independence Avenue SW in front of the Smithsonian Castle. A wide, grass-lined pedestrian mall replaced 10th Street SW. A concert hall, convention center, and opera house would line the pedestrian mall, which would be built over the railroad tracks and Southeast Freeway and connect with the Potomac River waterfront. The plan called for all existing buildings in the 20-acre area to be razed. Zeckendorf and the RLA signed a \\"memorandum of understanding\\" locking in most of the major aspects of Zeckendorf's plan to allow further site study and architectural design to move forward.\\"Realty Firm, District Sign SW Plan Pact.\\" Washington Post. March 16, 1954. By October of that year, Zeckendorf had agreed to add government office buildings to the planned pedestrian mall.Albrook, Robert C. \\"Zeckendorf to Start Detailed Slum Plans.\\" Washington Post. October 14, 1954. The developer said he had already spent $450,000 on studies, and planned to spend another $500,000 in developing a detailed plan. In December, Zeckendorf asked the NCPC and RLA to formally approve his plan for a 10th Street SW mall, and proposed that the federal government build a \\"12th Street Bridge\\" over the Potomac River to help reduce traffic flows along his mall—which now incorporated a roadway.Albrook, Robert C. \\"Zeckendorf Backs 'South Mall' Demand With 3 Plans Solving Traffic Problems.\\" Washington Post. December 22, 1954. In February 1955, however, the NCPC proposed moving the planned \\"cultural mall\\" to 9th Street SW and retaining 10th Street as a major thoroughfare for traffic coming off the 14th Street Bridge. John Remon, chair of the RLA and NCPC vice chair, strongly criticized the plan (which also proposed relocating the railroad tracks) as far too costly. D.C. officials then proposed turning 12th Street into a southbound one-way, 9th Street into a northbound one-way, and building a new 14th Street Bridge span to accommodate the traffic flows.Albrook, Robert C. \\"Road-Bridge Proposal Based On South Mall Sent Planners.\\" Washington Post. March 24, 1955. In a compromise, Zeckendorf agreed to revisit his plans to see if one or more of the proposed road plans could be accommodated under his proposed site redesign plan. The road and bridge dispute threatened to cause the failure of the entire redevelopment effort. But in April 1955, D.C. highway officials proposed a compromise: They agreed to \\"eventually\\" construct a major new bridge at Roaches RunThe NCPC had long advocated connecting M Street SW to a new bridge which would cross the Washington Channel and East Potomac Park and land on the Virginia side of the Potomac River near Roaches Run. The bridge would join the George Washington Memorial Parkway near the Crystal City neighborhood in Arlington, eliminating the 14th Street Bridge bottleneck. District of Columbia officials had refused to endorse the plan for years, not wishing to turn M Street into a (second) freeway which cut across the southwestern quadrant of the city. in exchange for NCPC approval of the existing preliminary plans offered by Zeckendorf.Albrook, Robert C. \\"D.C. Offers Roaches Run Bridge Plan.\\" Washington Post. April 7, 1955. Additionally, National Park Service (NPS_ officials agreed to allow a portion of Independence Avenue SW (between the Lincoln Memorial and the Tidal Basin) and Ohio Drive SW to be used for a portion of the proposed Inner Loop Freeway—both long-sought objectives of the NCPC.Albrook, Robert C. \\"Park Aides to Propose Route Today.\\" Washington Post. August 3, 1955.

April 9, 1955.\\"Land Agency Hires Expert For Studies.\\" Washington Post. September 30, 1955. =1955 cultural mall= The proposal for a \\"cultural mall\\" along 10th Street SW became complicated again in mid-1955. On July 1, President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law legislation creating a District of Columbia Auditorium Commission, whose charge was to formulate plans \\"for the design, location, financing, and construction in the District of Columbia of a civic auditorium, including an Inaugural Hall of Presidents and a music, fine arts, and mass communications center\\".\\"Auditorium Commission.\\" Washington Post. July 19, 1955. Southwest Washington, and especially Zeckendorf's proposed \\"cultural mall,\\" became one of the top sites studied by the Auditorium Commission for its planned multi-use performance center. The RLA began looking at the cost- effectiveness of turning the 10th Street site over to the Auditorium Commission for its (rather than private) use in September 1955. A month later, an RLA consultant recommended a \\"World Center\\" for L'Enfant Plaza that would include 4,000-seat opera house, 2,000-seat theatrical stage, large and small concert halls, exhibit areas, meeting rooms, television studios, reception and formal dining halls, and cultural library.Albrook, Robert C. \\"'World Center' for S.W. Visioned.\\" Washington Post. October 25, 1955. After another year of study, however, this plan had been scaled back to just three buildings (a combined auditorium-exhibit hall, combined opera-concert hall, and a theater).Barthelmes, Wes. \\"3 Units Proposed for Civic Center.\\" Washington Post. October 23, 1956. But D.C. Auditorium Commission officials now proposed two sites for the cultural center: L'Enfant Plaza and the Foggy Bottom neighborhood (an area of factories, breweries, gas works, and decrepit housing then also undergoing study for redevelopment). Cultural center location The Auditorium Commission's willingness to consider Foggy Bottom for the cultural center ignited a lengthy battle over the center's location. In November, the Auditorium Commission voted in favor of the Foggy Bottom site.Barthelmes, Wes. \\"SW Auditorium Site Favored.\\" Washington Post. November 4, 1956. But the Federal City Council, a private group of corporations and business leaders,Woodlee, Yolanda and Clark, Ashlee. \\"Hear the Latest About the Federal City Council?\\" Washington Post. August 9, 2007 ; Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 266. voted for L'Enfant Plaza. D.C. and RLA officials also favored L'Enfant Plaza. But the west leg of the proposed Inner Loop (a six-lane, high- speed freeway in downtown D.C. which formed an ellipse centered on the White House) cut through the Foggy Bottom site, and the planned highway would have to be moved west to accommodate it. In late October 1956, the NCPC agreed to consider moving the freeway\\"Auditorium Site Blocked By Planners.\\" Washington Post. November 9, 1956. and the Auditorium Commission agreed to study a number of new sites as well.Lindsay, John. \\"Auditorium Site to Get More Study.\\" Washington Post. November 27, 1956. As the January 31, 1957, deadline for the Auditorium Commission's report neared, the Commission proposed three sites for a cultural center: Foggy Bottom (its nominal preference), L'Enfant Plaza, and a site a block east of L'Enfant Plaza (the current site of the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building and Constitution Center, a private office building).Barthlemes, Wes. \\"3 Auditorium Sites Mapped for Congress.\\" Washington Post. January 18, 1957. The proposal to Congress included a 10,000-seat convention hall, music hall-auditorium, theater, and tourist center. The cost was pegged at $36 million ($282.1 million in 2011 dollars).Barthelmes, Wes. \\"Congress May Have to Untangle Cultural Center Site Dispute.\\" Washington Post. February 1, 1957. The RLA pressed for the L'Enfant Plaza site, although it agreed that perhaps the single proposed cultural center might be broken up into several structures.Barthlemes, Wes. \\"RLA to Ask SW. Site for Auditorium.\\" Washington Post. February 6, 1957. A fourth site in Southwest D.C. (bounded by 7th Street, 9th Street, Maine Avenue and G Street) was proposed in February 1957.Barthlemes, Wes. \\"Riverside Site in S.W. Weighed for Auditorium.\\" Washington Post. February 9, 1957. The Auditorium Commission also said it would be acceptable to move the cultural center slightly west in Foggy Bottom, so that it sat on the banks of the Potomac River rather than a few blocks inland. Three months later, in April 1957, House and Senate subcommittees overseeing the District of Columbia voted to approve the Foggy Bottom site as well.\\"Foggy Bottom Predicted Final Site Of $36-Million National Auditorium.\\" Washington Post. April 16, 1957. The Senate followed suit in May,\\"Senate Approves Purchase of Land In Foggy Bottom for Cultural Center.\\" Washington Post.

Eight months later, with the Auditorium Commission defunct, a number of civic leaders and members of Congress proposed that the cultural center be built on a site on the National Mall south of the National Gallery of Art (where the National Air and Space Museum is now).Carper, Elsie. \\"Culture Center Sites Discussed.\\" Washington Post. April 23, 1958. This proposal proved so unwelcome that Congress shifted again and chose the Foggy Bottom site for the cultural center.Carper, Elsie. \\"Factions Agree On Center for Foggy Bottom.\\" Washington Post.

September 3, 1958. =Plans move forward= With the cultural center set for Foggy Bottom, plans began moving ahead again on L'Enfant Plaza. In November 1958, the RLA and Zeckendorff began negotiating over the price of land and the composition of the buildings to be built at L'Enfant Plaza.\\"RLA, Developer Reach Accord on Southwest Plaza Planning.\\" Washington Post. November 19, 1958. In December 1959, Zeckendorf won approval to build a 1,000-room hotel and five privately owned office buildings on L'Enfant Plaza.Eisen, Jack. \\"Hotel and 5 Office Buildings Approved for New Southwest.\\" Washington Post. December 9, 1959. The Redevelopment Land Agency also approved the condemnation and razing of 14 city blocks for construction of the plaza, hotel, and office buildings.The agency's statutory authority to exercise eminent domain was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, in 1954. Construction was scheduled to begin on January 1, 1961, but was delayed due to unresolved design issues with L'Enfant Promenade, the short time-frame to prepare detailed construction plans, and because Congress had not granted air rights above 9th Street SW to the developers. Delays For four years, construction of L'Enfant Plaza and the hotel were delayed. Zeckendorf agreed to build the promenade, plaza, and all surrounding buildings as a single project in April 1961 and pay $20 per for the land. These pledges led the Redevelopment Land Agency to award the 14-block area to Zeckendorf in October 1961 for $7 million. I.M. Pei, the architect who designed the master plan and overall look of L'Enfant Promenade and Plaza (2006). Zeckendorf had assigned I.M. Pei, at the time a staff architect in his firm of Webb & Knapp, to provide the overall design of the plaza, promenade, and park (including building siting).Williams, 2005, p. 120; Moeller and Weeks, 2006, p. 59. In 1955 Pei had started his own firm, which worked primarily on Zeckendorf's projects, and Pei's associate Araldo Cossutta became the lead architect for the North Building (955 L'Enfant Plaza SW) and the South Building (950 L'Enfant Plaza SW). But by 1962 the scale of the project had been revised; the hotel building was unaffected, but the number of office buildings had shrunk from eight to three. Zeckendorf added an underground shopping mall of shops and restaurants to the project in November 1962, and construction on the promenade and plaza was slated to begin in April 1963. But Zeckendorf's vast real estate empire began to suffer severe financial difficulties in 1964, and indeed the company went bankrupt in 1965.Reich, 1997, p. 143-144. With Zeckendorf unable to make good on his construction pledges, the Redevelopment Land Agency forced him to withdraw and sell his interest in L'Enfant Plaza in November 1964. Construction =Construction starts= The buyer of Zeckendorf's property and leases was the L'Enfant Plaza Corp. (also known as L'Enfant Properties, Inc.). L'Enfant Plaza Corp. was a syndicate led by former United States Air Force Lieutenant General Elwood R. Quesada, and included Chase Manhattan Bank president David Rockefeller, D.C. businessman David A. Garrett, investment banker André Meyer, and the real estate investment firm of Gerry Brothers & Co. Quesada said that if the Redevelopment Land Agency approved the sale, his company would begin immediate construction of the promenade, the parking garage beneath it, and the plaza using the Pei firm's 10-year-old plans.Meyer, Eugene L. \\"L'Enfant Dies At Sundown.\\" Washington Post.

Meanwhile, over-optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages had delayed the construction of L'Enfant Plaza's North and South buildings (which were the first structures to be built by L'Enfant Plaza Corp.) by six months.

June 9, 1968.Kousoulas and Kousoulas, 1994, p. 208. This structure was never built for cost reasons. The Overlook, which Daniel Urban Kiley designed, contains a low granite wall surrounding a commemorative fountain and minimally landscaped lawns leading down to F and 9th Streets SW. On June 19, 1970, the Redevelopment Land Agency transferred the Overlook to the National Park Service (NPS) for use as a park.\\" On June 30, 1970, the District of Columbia City Council passed by unanimous vote a resolution petitioning the NPS to rename the Tenth Street Overlook as Banneker Park. On November 24, 1971, the NPS responded to the City Council's petition by hosting a dedication ceremony that renamed the Overlook to \\"Benjamin Banneker Park\\", even though the area has no specific connection to Benjamin Banneker himself. The park was the first public space in Washington to be dedicated to an African American and is often included in Black History tours. Structures =Washington Metro and Virginia Railway Express= L'Enfant Plaza Metro station, one of the largest and busiest in the Metro system (2009). The Washington Metro's L'Enfant Plaza station opened on July 1, 1977.\\"Metro's Sewest Stations: Where They Are, What's Nearby.\\" Washington Post. June 24, 1977.Lynton, Stephen J. \\"New Collection System Heads List of Snafus On the Opening Day.\\" Washington Post. July 2, 1977. The initial entrances were in the courtyard of 400 7th Street SW and at 7th Street SW at Maryland Avenue SW. The entrance inside L'Enfant Plaza, which connects with the \\"La Promenade\\" underground shopping mall, opened in October 1977. In June 1992, Virginia Railway Express opened its new $1.1 million L'Enfant Station on Virginia Avenue. L'Enfant Plaza also has a 1,622-space parking garage underneath the plaza's northern section, the second largest in the city. =Street grid= L'Enfant Promenade descends on either side of Banneker Overlook to form Banneker Circle SW. G Street SW runs southeast from the circle to 9th Street SW, although when Washington Nationals baseball games are held at Nationals Park a traffic restriction is put into place restricting traffic to residents. A pedestrian walkway and bridge leads northwest from the park to I-395, which crosses the Washington Channel just west of the park and eventually leads to East Potomac Park. Late 20th century =Movie theater= L'Enfant Plaza originally housed an 822-seat motion picture theater, which suffered financial trouble, until it closed permanently in the 1980s. The space is now used by the NTSB as a conference center. =Purchase by Eastern Realty= In 1981, Eastern Realty Investment Corp., the real estate investment arm of the Electric Supply Pension Scheme, a pension plan based in the United Kingdom, purchased L'Enfant Plaza itself, La Promenade, the North Building, the South Building, and the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel building. =Fire= A serious fire consumed the top four floors of the U.S. Postal Service headquarters on October 15, 1984. More than 200 firefighters needed two hours to put out the fire, one of the largest in D.C. history. It caused an estimated $100 million in damages and injured 25 firefighters. (District of Columbia law required sprinklers in very few buildings.) =Property taxes= U.S. Postal Service headquarters on the west side of L'Enfant Promenade, which experienced one of D.C.'s largest fires in 1984. Property tax issues dogged L'Enfant Plaza in the late 1980s. In 1981, L'Enfant Plaza and its constituent buildings and shopping mall was the city's most expensive property, valued at $78 million. In 1985, the assessor's office in the District of Columbia Department of Finance and Revenue valued the hotel at $83.7 million. Eastern Realty challenged the valuation, and the D.C. property tax Board of Equalization and Review reduced the assessment to $65.1 million. Eastern Realty still felt the valuation was too high, and asked a D.C. Superior Court to lower the structure's value to just $44.5 million. The court declined to overturn the equalization board's ruling. In 1986, the tax valuation was set at $98.5 million, but after an appeal and the assessment dropped to $62.1 million. The 1987 assessment was $93.2 million, but when the equalization board refused to reduce the assessment Eastern Realty sued. A private appraiser hired by the owners valued the hotel at $54.6 million in 1986 and $63.4 million in 1987, while the city appraiser claimed $83 million in 1986 and $85 million in 1987 (unusually large discrepancies). The differences meant that Eastern Realty owed either $2.3 million or $3.3 million for 1986/1987. In July 1990, the court reduced the 1985 assessment to $44.5 million, the 1986 assessment to $54.6 million, and the 1987 assessment to $63.4 million.[L'Enfant Plaza Properties, Inc. v. District of Columbia, Tax No. 4075-88, Tax No. 4260-89, Tax No. 4475-90, Tax No. 4820-91, (D.C. Super. Ct., January 27, 1993, Doyle, J.)] Another round of tax battles ensued over the next three years. The city assessed the hotel at $93.2 million in 1988, $97.4 million in 1989, $102.2 million in 1990, and $103.9 million in 1991. A second D.C. Superior Court reduced the assessments to $63.4 million for 1988, $71.1 million for 1989, $61.7 million for 1990, and $63.9 million for 1991. Similar tax battles occurred over much the same period regarding the North Building, with similar results. Looking north at Banneker Park and Overlook, L'Enfant Promenade, the James V. Forrestal Building and the Smithsonian Castle in 1990. In the midst of its tax battles, Eastern Realty spent $35 million in 1988 to renovate the office buildings and hotel at L'Enfant Plaza. The upgrades included adding sprinkler systems and smoke detectors through all the structures, upgrading the elevators, and improving the electrical system. The electrical system upgrade caused a major problem for the owners, however. In February 1992, contractors working on the electrical system caused a short beneath the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel that injured two workers, and forced the hotel and about a third of the mall's businesses to close until power was restored (which occurred more than two weeks later). In early 1996, Eastern Realty sold the South Building to VIB Management Fund, a Dutch real estate investment company, for $52 million. In September 1996, a second Dutch real estate investment firm, Sarakreek Holding N.V. (itself a subsidiary of the Tiger/Westbrook Real Estate Fund of New York City), purchased the plaza, North Building, hotel, and shopping mall for $185 million. That year, sports team owner Abe Pollin briefly considered building an arena (now known as the Capital One Arena) at L'Enfant Plaza, but built it in Chinatown instead. =Redevelopment= In 1998, the Urban Land Institute recommended redeveloping L'Enfant Promenade to create a more tourist-friendly environment as well as creating a link with the southwest waterfront. Although this concept garnered little attention at the time, it proved to be the genesis of a major plan that emerged around 2010 to radically change the nature and look of L'Enfant Plaza. A year later, Sarakreek Holdings replaced the Pei-designed fountain with a glass pyramid skylight over the center section of La Promenade. 21st century In 2001, Sarakreek Holdings sought to sell its L'Enfant Plaza holdings. The same year, VIB Management Fund sold the South Building to Heyman Properties (a local D.C. real estate investment company) for $55 million. On November 3, 2003, JBG Smith, a local real estate investment and development firm, purchased L'Enfant Plaza, the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, and the North and South office buildings from Sarakreek Holding for $200 million. Under the terms of various agreements and contracts of sale, the cost of upkeep for L'Enfant Plaza's automobile access ramps, landscaping, maintenance, stairwells, three-level parking garage, and the roadway around the plaza itself (but not L'Enfant Promenade) are paid 18.22% by Heyman Properties and 81.78% by JBG. JBG hired architect César Pelli and the architectural firm of Hickok Warner Cole to draft a 10-year, $200–$300 million master site plan that would renovate all three existing buildings, bring improve street-level retail opportunities, and add one or more residential buildings (similar to the \\"Banneker Village Center\\" plan proposed by the city). In May 2004, the National Children's Museum proposed building its new museum in the center of L'Enfant Plaza. But when the pace of redevelopment of L'Enfant Plaza slowed, the Children's Museum decided in November 2004 that it would build elsewhere. =Banneker Park demolition plans= Various proposals to redevelop or eliminate Banneker Park in the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s also threatened to radically change the nature of L'Enfant Promenade. By the early 1990s, the park had suffered from lack of maintenance, deterioration of some of its features, and the fountain had stopped running. In 1996, the nonprofit Washington Interdependence Council won permission from the NPS, which managed the park at the time, to raise $3 million in funds to build a life-size statue of Banneker for the park and to make other improvements (such as bas relief sculptures depicting Banneker's achievements on the limestone circle surrounding the overlook). In 1997, the NPS partially restored the park (including restoring signage, getting the fountain running again, and adding a small interpretive exhibit), and D.C. and federal officials sponsored a rededication ceremony there. The following year, the 105th United States Congress enacted legislation that authorized the Washington Interdependence Council to establish at the Council's expense a memorial on federal land in the District that would commemorate Banneker's accomplishments.Public Law 101-355 (November 6, 1998) Title V, Section 512 (112 Stat. 3266)] By 1999, however, the proposed memorial had become a $17 million project that would contain a visitors' center near Independence Avenue at the north end of the Promenade, a clock atop a tall pedestal at the midpoint of the Promenade, a statue of Banneker in the park's circle at the south end of the Promenade and a skyway over I-395 that would connect the park to the waterfront. After considering the proposal, the National Capital Memorial Commission rejected the placement of the statue in the park and decided to consult with the District of Columbia government about placing a Banneker memorial at the midpoint of the Promenade. The legislative authority relative to locating the Memorial on federal land in the District lapsed in 2005. This did not preclude the location of the memorial on lands such as the road right-of-way in L'Enfant Promenade that are under the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia. Skyway idea The skyway idea, however, captured the interest of city planners and became part of a plan to build a baseball stadium at the southern end of L'Enfant Promenade. The Council of the District of Columbia approved a plan in March 2002 to redevelop the southwest waterfront which included construction of a tour bus parking garage beneath Banneker Park and stairs down from Banneker Park to Maine Avenue SW. The skyway/stairs concept soon became caught up in other plans for Banneker Park. In 2004, the city proposed razing Banneker Park and building a new baseball stadium on the site. The proposal called for covering over a portion of I-395, and creating a skyway or stairs to link the stadium with the waterfront. The city's proposal also would have implemented the Urban Land Institute's 1998 proposal and created \\"Banneker Village Center,\\" a project which would redevelop L'Enfant Promenade and line it with retail businesses, high-rise residences, and tourist attractions. However, when the stadium threatened to complicate planning for the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation, city officials withdrew their support so that the waterfront development could proceed. Even though the Banneker site had drawn the most interest from Major League Baseball, the cost of using the Banneker Park site also cost the proposal support. The stadium, named Nationals Park, was later constructed in 2007 in Southeast, Washington, D.C. Endangerment In 2004, the D.C. Preservation League listed Benjamin Banneker Park as one of the most endangered places in the District because of proposals to redevelop the park's area. The League stated that the park, \\"Designed by renowned landscape architect Dan Kiley ... is culturally significant as the first public space in Washington named for an African American and is usually included in Black History tours\\". In February 2005, Benjamin Banneker Park was considered as a site for the Smithsonian Institution's new National Museum of African American History and Culture. However, in January 2006, the Smithsonian chose a site on an empty block of Madison Drive NW between 14th and 15th Streets NW (west of the National Museum of American History). In 2006, the District government and the Federal Highway Administration issued an environmental assessment for \\"improvements\\" to the promenade and park that described some of these redevelopment proposals. In 2011, a proposal surfaced that would erect a structure housing a \\"National Museum of the American People\\" at or near the site of the park. =Southwest Ecodistrict= Redevelopment of L'Enfant Plaza into a high-density, environmentally friendly, sustainable-living extension of the National Mall began in 2006. The NCPC, which develops long-term plans for the capital city, has termed this redevelopment the \\"Southwest Ecodistrict.\\" JBG began the redevelopment of L'Enfant Plaza in 2006 when it secured a $242 million mortgage loan for its renovation projects. That same year, the NCPC and District officials held joint hearings to identify needs and solicit ideas for L'Enfant Plaza and Promenade. Maintenance of the area had become a major issue, as bricks in the esplanade were broken and much of the landscaping was in poor condition. The hearings identified an immediate need to plant trees along the esplanade, build bike lanes, and install public seating. But the hearings also gave new life to the Urban Land Institute's 1998 redevelopment ideas, and formally adopted them as a tentative design plan for L'Enfant Promenade. 2009 The \\"La Promenade\\" shopping mall beneath L'Enfant Plaza, pictured in 2009 before its renovation. In 2009, the NCPC convened a \\"10th Street Task Force\\" that would more radically redesign L'Enfant Promenade. The task force (which was charged with looking at L'Enfant Plaza, Banneker Park, the Maryland Avenue SW corridor, and nearby federal office buildings as a whole) proposed creating an \\"eco-district\\" which would be energy neutral, accommodate multimodal transportation, add residential housing, and create street-level retail aimed at tourists and residents equally. The goal was to produce a formal redevelopment plan by early 2011. The same year, the commission looking into the feasibility of establishing a National Museum of the American Latino tentatively considered Banneker Park as the site of a potential museum, but the site did not make the commission's short list of preferred locations. In November 2009, JBG began renovating the eastern portion of La Promenade, and planned to renovate the western section in 2010 and 2011. The $40 million effort, designed by the SmithGroup architectural firm, added large windows overlooking the grassy terrace of the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building to the east and moves most of the fast-food operations into the eastern portion of the mall. The retail shopping area will be expanded to . The plaza glass pyramid (installed in the late 1990s) would be removed, and a greatly expanded atrium and pedestrian entry way installed over the center portion of the mall. The plan is to situate restaurants under this enlarged glass atrium, to provide diners with a more pleasant experience. JBG also said it would renovate the North Building and the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, and proposed renovating the South Building (with its owner's consent) to fit the new look of the plaza. Boundaries of the Southwest Ecodistrict, with various key buildings and structures marked. Also in 2009, the NCPC released its Monumental Core Framework Plan, a comprehensive plan for creating places and spaces around the National Mall to increase the availability of space for new museums and memorials while adding residences and retail features that would make the city a more attractive place to live and work. The plan was adopted by the United States Commission of Fine Arts on March 19, 2009, and approved by the NCPC on April 2, 2009.\\"Monumental Core Framework Plan.\\" National Capital Planning Commission. No date. Retrieved February 27, 2011. The Monumental Core Framework Plan proposed adding a new visitor's center and memorial at Banneker Park, an intermodal transportation hub beneath Banneker Park, demolition of the Forrestal Building and its annex, and construction of apartment and office buildings along L'Enfant Promenade with retail and dining space at the street level to accommodate tourists and residents alike. The framework plan also proposed covering over I-395 between Banneker Park and L'Enfant Plaza, covering over the CSX railway tracks (which currently cut L'Enfant Plaza off from the Forrestal complex of buildings), re- establishing Maryland Avenue SW between 12th and 7th Streets SW (it currently does not exist there, due to the presence of the railroad tracks), and restoring the view of the U.S. Capitol building along Maryland Avenue SW. However, in September 2009, JBG proposed a much more extensive redevelopment of L'Enfant Plaza. The firm's plans included construction of two 12-story office buildings in the center of the plaza, an extended-stay hotel above 9th Street SW (north of the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel) and either an office building or a residential building over 9th Street SW (south of the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel). (One source claimed this would be an apartment building.) Heyman Properties, owner of the South Building, sued shortly thereafter to stop all renovations and the proposed buildings, saying the construction projects would harm the value of its property. Nonetheless, JBG started renovating the eastern part of La Promenade in late 2009, planned to renovate the western section and install the enlarged atrium beginning in late 2010. JBG presented its master plan to the NCPC in early 2010. In November 2010, JBG released an artist's conception of its proposed plaza building, a two-tower, Gehry-like structure with wavy glass walls. 2011 \\"La Promenade\\" shopping mall undergoing renovation in February 2011. In August 2011, Heyman Properties put the South Building up for sale. Three months later, JBG began the second phase of its La Promenade renovation. The $27 million, 20-month project covered of space. JBG also announced in late 2011 that it planned a radical redevelopment of L'Enfant Plaza. First, the company said it had hired SmithGroup JJR to design a three- story glass atrium to replace the low glass pyramid in the center of the plaza. The atrium would have an elevator and stairs to permit pedestrian access from the plaza. Second, a 234-room Homewood Suites by Hilton would be constructed on the outdoor eating plaza at the corner of 9th Street SW and D Street SW. Also designed by SmithGroup, the proposed design hotel featured ground-level retail and access to the Metro as well as glass curtain walls to alleviate the blocky look of the existing nearby structures. Ground-breaking on the hotel was expected in mid-2012. Third, the company proposed a office building for the small space bordered by 9th Street SW, Frontage Road SW, the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, and the HUD building. Designed by ZGF Architects LLP, the proposed office building featured a flat façade with windows set in deep, angled, grid-like frames similar to the existing L'Enfant Plaza buildings. A fourth proposed element was a new U-shaped, office building to surround the new atrium. This design replaced the curving, cone-like structure previously proposed in 2010. Designed by Richard Rogers, the Modernist glass building would front on 10th Street SW. JBG said it hoped to include the Heyman Properties' South Building in its plans, but Heyman continued to press its 2010 lawsuit against JBG. Bringing the suit one step closer to resolution, a local court ordered both sides into mediation in February 2012. 2012 In May 2012, a session at a national convention of the American Institute of Architects held in Washington examined the history of area's planning and the concepts and design strategies for the Southwest Ecodistrict. The session noted that the plans for the Ecodistrict were consistent with President Barack Obama's 2009 Executive Order 13514 entitled \\"Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance\\". 2013 The NCPC released the draft Southwest Ecodistrict Plan on July 12, 2012. After holding a public meeting on July 19, 2012, and a 60-day public comment period, the NCPC accepted the Plan on January 10, 2013.(1) (2) The accepted Plan recommended the redesign of Benjamin Banneker Park and adjacent areas to accommodate one or more new memorials, museums and/or landscaping. The proposed construction at L'Enfant Plaza by JBG did not begin in mid-2012 as scheduled. In August, the company said it was offering investors an equity stake in its existing buildings. JBG also said that the U-shaped office building would now be , and the hotel would have 370 rooms. The Plaza's glass pyramid was demolished in May 2013 when construction began. 2014 Atrium of the redeveloped shopping center, looking up towards the Plaza. Seen in July, 2014, before a number of businesses were opened. The redevelopment added numerous eateries to La Promenade, as well as other businesses such as a Dress Barn (2015). Redevelopment of the shopping center added a number of LED columns as decoration, among other things. This was the first area of the center to reopen after renovation (2015). In September 2014, the NCPC accepted an addendum to the SW Ecodistrict Plan. Among other things, the addendum stated: \\"A modern, terraced landscape at Banneker Park is envisioned to enhance the park and to provide a gateway to the National Mall.\\" 2017–2018 In April 2017, the NCPC approved plans for a staircase and ramp that would connect Benjamin Banneker Park with Washington's Southwest Waterfront and that would add lighting and trees to the area. The NCPC and the NPS intended the project to be an interim improvement that could be in place for ten years while the area awaited redevelopment.(1) (2) (3) (4) Funding for the $4 million project included money that Hoffman-Madison Waterfront provided, as well as a $2 million grant from the District of Columbia's Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development. Construction began on the project in September 2017 and was completed during the spring of 2018.(1) (2) In 2017, the South Building was foreclosed on after failing to repay a $95 million mortgage from 2007. It was sold in 2018 to Normandy Real Estate Partners in a foreclosure auction for $39.5 million. Citizens Bank provided a $68 million loan on the property in December 2018. 2019- Saw the opening of the relocated SPY museum within the Promenade area of the complex. Architectural assessment L'Enfant Plaza was considered a masterpiece when it opened in 1968. Washington Post architectural critic Wolf von Eckardt called it \\"a triumph of good architecture over bad planning.\\" He believed it would be D.C.'s version of Rockefeller Center or the Place Ville-Marie, and predicted people would throng the plaza—which he felt would be the \\"city's major urban attraction.\\" Von Eckardt piled praise on the plaza itself, calling it \\"exceptionally attractive\\" and \\"modern America's most beautiful 'outdoor salon'\\". He also lauded the \\"marvelous\\" cruciform-and-globe light fixtures and the huge \\"dramatic\\" fountain. Architects Chloethiel Woodard Smith and Louis Justement felt the esplanade and plaza were an \\"essential ... appropriate entrance to the Southwest.\\" Five years later, in 1973, von Eckardt continued to sing the plaza's praises despite its shortcomings. Although he recognized that the plaza was largely devoid of foot traffic most of the time, he considered it a \\"superb work of urban design\\" on par with the great plazas and squares built in Paris under Napoleon III or Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Looking north along L'Enfant Promenade to the Forrestal Building, which visually cuts the promenade and plaza off from the National Mall (2011). Such high praise did not last. Even von Eckardt felt the Forrestal building was an \\"esthetic disaster\\" (sic) and \\"silly\\"—\\"like an elephant tottering on the legs of a giraffe.\\" He heartily disliked the design of the plaza itself (\\"all the charm of an empty freeway\\") Banneker Park, with its minimalist fountain, came in for similar criticism. He declared that the city's decision to cancel the skywalk to Maine Avenue SW ruined the southern end of the Promenade: \\"It ends with a whimper.\\" Two years after L'Enfant Plaza opened, Washington Post architecture critic Eugene L. Meyer called it a \\"ghost town\\", and said it was \\"not living up to its advance billing.\\" Araldo Cossutta, who designed the North and South Buildings for I. M. Pei & Associates, declared it a \\"product of outmoded city planning\\". The complex's reputation did not improve over the next 30 years. In 2003, Washington Post architectural critic Benjamin Forgey was just as critical:Forgey, Benjamin. \\"The D.C. Pei List: Losses and Gains.\\" Washington Post. October 5, 2003. > The Pei solution was elegant on paper but, as we know, it did not work very > well in practice. The plaza today is lusterless and very nearly lifeless, > and the 10th Street connector, renamed the L'Enfant Promenade, seems just > another pretentious, failed dream. ... Much of the fault clearly rests with > the plan itself. Life is sucked out of the plaza by an extensive, > wrongheaded underground retail mall. The wide, ceremonial roadway is simply > too much for too little, like a symphonic fanfare introducing a high school > band recital. And there's little reward for taking the road—it leads only to > a dreary auto turnaround overlooking the (equally dreary) redeveloped > Southwest waterfront. He also noted that Pei himself fiercely fought construction of the Forrestal Building, knowing that it would severely compromise the Promenade's view of the National Mall. Art critic Hank Burchard called L'Enfant Plaza a \\"pitiful and pitiless 'plaza' that dishonors the name of L'Enfant\\" in 1992. The complex's popularity with citizens hadn't improved, either. Another Washington Post reporter noted in 2005 that L'Enfant Plaza \\"shuts down\\" at night and on weekends, creating an effect described as a \\"Valley of the Tombs\\". In 2010, an article in the Washington City Paper said L'Enfant Plaza \\"could easily contend for the honor of being modern urban design's grandest mistake.\\" It called the complex an \\"unmitigated urban planning disaster\\", and strongly criticized the Forrestal Building for isolating the promenade from the rest of the city.

It is served by the McPherson Square station of the Washington Metro. History The park-like area is named after James B. McPherson, a major general who fought in the Union Army during the American Civil War before he was killed at the Battle of Atlanta. The Society of the Army of the Tennessee presented an equestrian statue of McPherson, which was erected at McPherson Square and dedicated on October 18, 1876. The sculpture represents McPherson surveying a battlefield. It was made by Louis Rebisso out of a captured cannon and rests on a granite pedestal. Located in the central downtown commercial and business district, the square is frequented by area workers and street vendors, and restaurant-goers and the homeless at night. Owing to its proximity to the White House, it is also the site of political rallies and falls on the path of various protest marches. Adjacent buildings include the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Lafayette Building housing the Export-Import Bank, the 15th Street financial district, and numerous hotels. The 2004 headquarters for Senator John Kerry's campaign for President was located in a building on McPherson Square. On October 1, 2011, Occupy D.C. encamped in McPherson Square.

It is located at and bounded approximately by Rock Creek Park to the east, Wisconsin and Idaho Avenues to the west, Klingle and Woodley Roads to the south, and Rodman and Tilden Streets to the north. Its main commercial corridor lies along Connecticut Avenue NW, where the eponymous Cleveland Park station of the Washington Metro's Red Line can be found; another commercial corridor lies along Wisconsin Avenue. The neighborhood is known for its many late 19th century homes and the historic Art Deco Uptown Theater. It is also home to the William L. Slayton House and the Park and Shop, built in 1930 and one of the earliest strip malls.Willman, John B., \\"Washington's Original Shopping Center Sold\\", The Washington Post & Times- Herald, Wednesday 30 January 1963, Volume 86, Number 56, page B-7. It is named after Grover Cleveland, who owned property in the area. History The first American settler was General Uriah Forrest, an aide-de-camp of George Washington who built an estate called Rosedale (now at 3501 Newark Street) in 1793, when he began serving as a Congressman from Maryland. Later, it housed Youth For Understanding, an international student exchange organization. In 2002, the Rosedale grounds were placed in a public conservancy, and the farmhouse, said to be the oldest house in Washington, returned to residential use. Other estates followed. Gardiner Greene Hubbard, first president of the National Geographic Society, built the colonial Georgian revival Twin Oaks on 50 acres (200,000 m²) in 1888. It was used as a summer home by the Hubbard family, including Alexander Graham Bell and is today home of the diplomatic mission of the Republic of China on Taiwan. Tregaron, present-day home of the Washington International School, is a Georgian house built in 1912. The neighborhood acquired its name after 1886, when President Grover Cleveland purchased a stone farmhouse opposite Rosedale and remodeled it into a Queen Anne style summer estate called Oak View or Oak Hill (by other accounts, Red Top). When Cleveland lost his bid for re-election in 1888, the property was sold. The Oak View subdivision was platted in 1890. The Cleveland Heights subdivision was platted around the same time, and the Cleveland Park subdivision soon thereafter.Map of the District of Columbia, Showing public reservations and possessions, etc., McMillan Commission Map D-289, 1901. Red Top in the meantime was inhabited by Washington architect Robert I. Fleming and later by his widow, and eventually demolished in 1927 to be replaced on the same site by the neo-Georgian mansion that still stands at 3536 Newark Street NW. Early large-scale development was spurred by the neighborhood's upland topography, which provided a breezy relief from the hot, fetid air in the lowlands that were then the built-up area of Washington, D.C. Most of the houses built during this period show their intended use as summer houses in the era before air conditioning, having such architectural features as wide porches, large windows, and long, overhanging eaves. While the first subdivisions were made in response to the extension of the Georgetown and Tennallytown electric streetcar line along Wisconsin Avenue, the success of the neighborhood was the result of the Rock Creek Railway, built on Connecticut Avenue in 1892. Once Cleveland Park was connected to downtown Washington, the neighborhood's second phase of development, as a \\"streetcar suburb\\", began. The Cleveland Park Company oversaw construction on numerous plots starting in 1894. Most houses were designed by individual architects and builders, including Waddy B. Wood and Paul J. Pelz, resulting in an eclectic mix of the popular architectural styles of the time, notably the Queen Anne style (including the Shingle style), Georgian Revival, and the Mission Revival. In later years, simpler schools of design such as the Prairie style and Tudor Revival came to dominate. Yenching Palace (now a Walgreens), historic restaurant where American and Soviet negotiators met in 1962 to find a resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Development proceeded in fits and starts, punctuated by such events as the bankruptcy of the Cleveland Park Company in 1905 and the Great Depression in the 1930s. As a result, houses of very different sizes, natures, and styles can often be seen next to one another. In the later 20th century, Winthrop Faulkner and I. M. Pei designed houses in the neighborhood as well. Civic Groups The Cleveland Park Citizens Association (CPCA) was established in 1911 by residents of the Cleveland Park area. The Association was incorporated in 1964 as the \\"Connecticut Avenue Citizens Association.\\" The name was changed in 1966 to the current name, Cleveland Park Citizens Association. Over the years, it has raised money for the construction of the local library branch, the Cleveland Park Neighborhood Library. It is a member of the Federation of Citizens Associations of the District of Columbia. The Cleveland Park Historical Society, founded 1985, strives to document and preserve the history and architecture of the neighborhood, and especially the historic district, which was designated in 1987. The Society sponsors an annual house tour in the neighborhood. The Cleveland Park Club was founded in 1922 to \\"promote social intercourse, recreation and sports, literature and the arts, and for mutual improvement\\" of the neighborhood in the days before television and widespread broadcasting and movies. The next year, the Club purchased a 1900 house to use as its base. Events included such entertainment as plays, songfests, and dances. With the construction of a swimming pool, the Club became more centered on recreational swimming, although other activities, including annual potluck suppers on Memorial Day and Labor Day, a day camp, and other occasional social and educational events continue. Education District of Columbia Public Schools operates public schools. Zoned schools include: * Elementary schools: Phoebe Hearst Elementary and John Eaton Elementary School * Alice Deal Middle School and Hardy Middle School * Woodrow Wilson High School The Washington International School operates an upper-school campus (located on the Tregaron Estate) in the neighborhood, located off of Macomb Street between Connecticut Avenue and 34th Street. The National Child Research Center operates a nursery school in the neighborhood; National Cathedral School, St. Albans School, Beauvoir School, and Sidwell Friends School are located at the edge of the customary boundary of Cleveland Park. The District of Columbia Public Library system operates the Cleveland Park Neighborhood Library, which was completely rebuilt between 2016 and 2018. The library building reopened June 16, 2018.

The structure has served as mainly local government offices since it was built, and today the building is 60 percent occupied by the city and 40 percent occupied by the County. The building is jointly owned by the city and county and managed by the Municipal Building Commission. The Commission consists of the chair of the County Board, the mayor of the City of Minneapolis, a member of the County Board and a member of the Minneapolis City Council. The County Board chair serves as the president of the Commission and the mayor serves as the vice president. The building bears a striking resemblance to the city hall buildings in Cincinnati and Toronto. The City Hall and Courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Architecture Stereoscopic photograph of the old City Hall at Nicollet Avenue and Hennepin Avenue by William H. Jacoby The building replaced an earlier City Hall that existed from 1873 until 1912 near the old intersection between Hennepin Avenue and Nicollet Avenue. That structure eventually was razed to make way for Gateway Park, which continues to occupy part of the old City Hall site. The building also replaced an earlier courthouse and also the earlier Hennepin County Jail, which was located where U.S. Bank Stadium currently stands. Before the construction of the original City Hall in 1873, city government officials worked out of rented space in the Pence Opera House building, located at Hennepin Avenue and 2nd Street. Minneapolis City Hall, Franklin Bidwell Long and 250x The building, located at 350 South Fifth Street, is an example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture. The design is based upon Henry Hobson Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Washington School, the first schoolhouse in Minneapolis west of the Mississippi River, was demolished to make way for the new building. Groundbreaking took place in 1889, and the cornerstone was laid (a story off the ground) in 1891. Construction did not officially end until 1906, although the structural exterior was essentially complete by the end of 1895. The county began moving in to its side (4th Ave.) in November 1895, while the city (3rd Ave.) side was not occupied until December 1902. Cost was about $3,554,000, which works out to 28¢ per cubic foot ($10/m³).City Hall with current copper roofWhen constructed, the building claimed to have the world's largest four-faced chiming clock. At 24 feet, 6 inches (just under 7 1/2 meters), the faces are 18 inches (45.7 cm) wider than those of the Great Clock in London (which houses the famous hour bell Big Ben). The tower housing the clock reaches 345 feet (105 m) in height, and was the tallest structure in the city until the 1920s when the Foshay Tower was built. A 15-bell chime in the tower is played regularly, with noontime concerts provided to the public on holidays and on Fridays and certain Sundays during the warm months. The chime was originally 10 bells, and it was first played on March 10, 1896. The building is built of rose granite quarried in Ortonville, with many stones greater than 20 tonnes in weight. The granite was originally only going to be used for the foundation of the building, with brick used for the upper portion. However, the public appreciated the appearance of the foundation so much that they lobbied for the entire building to be made of granite. This may be a reason for the significant cost overruns — it was originally expected to cost only $1.15 million. Unlike most buildings in downtown Minneapolis, there aren't any \\"skyways\\" connecting the city hall to the rest of the city. Since exterior alterations are not allowed for buildings on the National Register of Historic Places, tunnels were constructed instead. Public pedestrian tunnels connect the building to the Hennepin County Government Center under 5th Street, and to the U.S. Courthouse under 4th Street. There are also restricted tunnels for use by the sheriff connecting under 4th Avenue to the Hennepin County Jail and to the Government Center. The METRO Blue and Green light rail lines have a stop on the south side of the building: the Government Plaza station.  Interior  City council chambers around 1900Inside, on the 4th Street side, there is a large five-story rotunda including a large sculpture, \\"Father of Waters,\\" by American sculptor Larkin Goldsmith Mead who lived in Florence, Italy at the time. According to legend, rubbing his big toe brings good luck. It was placed inside the building in 1906. Originally, the building had a red terracotta roof, but it began leaking so a copper roof was installed. At 180,000 pounds (81.6 t), it was said to be the largest in the country. The copper has since acquired its characteristic green patina.The \\"Father of Waters\\" sculpture Over the years, some of the larger spaces in the building were subdivided to make more office space. In the 1940s and 1950s, the city built a mezzanine floor over its side of the 3rd floor, and the county built an annex building on its side of the courtyard. In 1981, a committee plan recommended converting some of the spaces back to their original design and that other spaces be converted to a more open design with offices fronting onto the courtyard instead of the current corridors. The plan also called for the annex building in the courtyard to be demolished, the courtyard domed, and the Father of Waters sculpture moved in there. Many of these aspects of the plan were rejected, although restoration of certain historic spaces has been completed.

He appeared in seasons 2 and 3, and is portrayed by Mark Lutz. History The Groosalugg is a native of Pylea, a dimension where humans are treated as slaves and called cows. He is a Pylean demon so deformed as to look human, but his only apparent non-human physical characteristic is a pair of dark-colored eyes. Because of his human heritage, he was banished to the \\"Scum Pits of Ur\\" where he was to die, but instead defeated every creature that attacked him. This earned him a reputation for bravery and combat skill, and as such he wandered the countryside as an undefeated champion, or Groosalugg. In Pylea there is a prophecy that the Groosalugg will one day com-shuck, or mate, with the entity that has \\"the curse,\\" which in this case comes to mean Cordelia's visions. After the two have mated, Cordelia's visions will be passed on to him. Since Pylea is dominated by monks loyal to Wolfram & Hart, this would put the instrument of The Powers That Be under the control of evil. Cordelia does not want this, at first because she believes the Groosalugg to be more demon-like, but this objection falls when Cordelia meets him and sees that he is, in fact, very handsome and nearly human. However, Cordelia still does not want to consummate their relationship because she does not want to lose the visions. Groo ends up proving that he is a good man, not a tool of evil, and helps Cordelia and the rest of the characters to escape Pylea. At the end of season 2, Groo is installed as monarch of Pylea, the first to preside over the freedom of the human former slaves. Midway through season 3, Angel and Cordelia are close to starting a relationship when Groo unexpectedly appears in Los Angeles. He explains that he had been deposed in a revolution on Pylea, and decided to find Cordelia again. The feelings that Cordelia has for Angel are immediately put on hold, and instead she chooses to rekindle her romance with Groo. She even goes as far as to find a mystical spell which allows her both to have sex with Groo and to retain her visions. Angel is jealous of Groo for many reasons, including that Cordelia has chosen Groo over him and that Groo is just as formidable a fighter as himself. For a time, Angel is concerned that Groo will replace him, due to him possessing equally dangerous combat skills while lacking most of Angel's weaknesses, but Wesley assures Angel that he remains their reason and drive for fighting the good fight in the first place. Despite a victory against a life-sucking tree demon that Groo could never have defeated himself proving his continued worth to the group, unable to withstand being witness to the relationship between Cordelia and Groo, Angel gives them money and asks that they go on an extended holiday. When Cordelia and Groo return, they find that some terrible things have happened in their absence, such as Connor being stolen by Holtz and Wesley having betrayed the team in an attempt to protect Connor from a prophecy that seemed to foretell Angel killing his son. Cordelia immediately begins to pay more attention to Angel, and Groo starts to realize that Cordelia does not love him but rather Angel. In the last episode of season 3, Groo finally musters up the courage to tell Cordelia this, and he then leaves Los Angeles for parts unknown. =After the Fall= Angel: After the Fall is the canonical continuation of the Angel story, written by Brian Lynch with executive oversight from Joss Whedon. Its story begins immediately after Los Angeles is sent to hell in the Season Five Angel finale \\"Not Fade Away\\". The Groosalugg establishes himself in Silver Lake, a corner of the city that has been cleared of human-hostile demonic influence. He works with Lorne, who has become the freely elected leader of the area. During Angel's visit to Lorne, Groo offers the ex-vampire his services whenever he needs them. He appears riding what appears to be a black pegasus. The beast's name is Cordelia, the same as Angel's dragon. Groo is one of the members of the Angel Investigations team rallied by Lorne to help Angel fight the Demon Lords, and he helps by breaking the chains on Angel's dragon. The Demon Lords are all destroyed. In issue fifteen, Illyria decides to end all reality in order to end emotional pain, starts with demolishing what is left of Los Angeles. The Groosalugg is killed while attempting to stop her. He has enough time to bemoan the nature of this death. He is revived later as Angel forces the Senior Partners to rewind time to before Los Angeles was sent to hell. As with everyone who was involved with the After the Fall storyline, the Groosalugg retains all of his memories. The situation leaves Angel a publicly acclaimed hero. Angel leaves his dragon in the care of the Groosalugg as part of an attempt to regain anonymity. In later comics post-After the Fall, the Groosalugg assists Angel and Spike in saving a comic book convention threatened by various mystical dangers. Lynch had wanted to use Lorne as part of the supporting cast of his Spike series. However, Lorne is off-limits since the death of likeness Andy Hallett and the character's send-off in Music of the Spheres. Consequently, Lynch chose Groo for the series, along with the Cordelia dragon and pegasus. In the series, Groo and the dragon are called in by Spike to help clear a demonic infestation out of the city of Las Vegas.\\"Spike\\" #1-8 (Oct. - May 2010 - 2011) Concept and creation Andy Hallett, who played Lorne, called the Groosalugg \\"Fabio and Keanu Reeves' love child.\\" Mark Lutz says, \\"He's got such a dichotomy to him where he's all brave and noble on one hand, and so naive and brainwashed on the other. I know a lot of the fans say, 'Oh, he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer,' but I think there's more to him than that.\\".

History =Coat of arms of Rhodesia (1924–1981)= The coat of arms of Rhodesia was used from 1924–1981, for the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923–1964 and 1979–1980, known simply as Rhodesia from 1964–1979, Zimbabwe–Rhodesia in 1979, and Zimbabwe from 1980. Official authorisation by Royal Warrant for the coat of arms was granted on 11 August 1924. The shield features a red lion passant and two thistles, taken from the family arms of Cecil Rhodes, after whom the colony was named, and the Latin motto Sit Nomine Digna (May She Be Worthy of the Name) is a reference to Rhodes. The pick, in gold on a green field, represents mining, the economic mainstay of the colony. Also featured above the shield is the soapstone statuette of the Zimbabwe Bird found in the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. The shield of the arms was used on the flag of the colony by being placed in the fly of a British Blue Ensign, in the tradition of most other British colonies. This design changed in 1964 when the field of the flag was changed to light blue. In November 1968, the full coat of arms was placed in the centre of a new Rhodesian flag which was a green, white, green triband. After Rhodesia was declared a republic in 1970, the arms also featured on the President's flag. The arms remained unchanged following the renaming of the country as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, and were initially used by the government of Zimbabwe from 18 April 1980 to 21 September 1981, following which the present coat of arms of Zimbabwe were introduced. =Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Mutapa (1569–1760)= Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Mutapa In 1569, Sebastian of Portugal made a grant of arms to the Mwenemutapa. These were blazoned: Gules between two arrows Argent an African hoe barwise bladed Or handled Argent — The shield surmounted by a Crown Oriental. This was probably the first grant of arms to a native of southern Africa; however it is unlikely that these arms were ever actually used by the Mwenemutapa.

Swarm was initially developed at the Santa Fe Institute in the mid-1990s, and since 1999 has been maintained by the non-profit Swarm Development Group. Also known as the Swarm Simulation System,Swarm it is available for free download Software main page downloads and use, covered by the GNU General Public License.GNU General Public License Early development work on Swarm was completed by Chris Langton (SFI), Roger Burkhart (John Deere), Nelson Minar (SFI), Manor Askenazi (SFI), Glen Ropella (SFI), Marcus Daniels (SFI), and Alex Lancaster (SFI). Since that time, many hundreds of people around the world have contributed to the continued open source development of the suite of Swarm ABM tools.  Applications  = Scientific applications= Agent-based modeling seeks to replicate these complexities and adaptations in computational environments where these interactive emergent behaviors can be analyzed multi-dimensionally. By defining and assigning agencies reflective of prescribed behaviors, known or estimated, to active software agents in a computer simulation, scientists can approximate experimental results not possible in natural temporal frameworks. Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms afford scientists the opportunity to conduct and visualize experiments in these synthetic macro and microenvironments for testing scientific theories, natural data sets, and other analyses while free of pressing constraints like time, volume, hazards, or many other parameters. = Commercial applications = Agent-based models have been used since the mid-1990s to solve a variety of business and technology problems. Examples of applications include: * supply chain optimization and logistics; * modeling of consumer behavior, including word of mouth and social network effects; * distributed computing; * workforce management; * traffic management; and * portfolio management. In these and other applications, the system of interest is simulated by capturing the behavior of individual agents and their interconnections. Agent-based modeling tools can be used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the overall, emergent system behavior.

The film stars Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise, Brawley Nolte, Delroy Lindo, Liev Schreiber, Evan Handler, Donnie Wahlberg, and Lili Taylor. Gibson was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. The film was the 5th highest-grossing film of 1996 in the United States. The original story came from a 1954 episode of The United States Steel Hour titled \\"Fearful Decision\\". In 1956, it was adapted by Richard Maibaum and Cyril Hume into the feature film Ransom!, starring Glenn Ford, Donna Reed, and Leslie Nielsen. The film was also influenced by Ed McBain's police procedural novel King's Ransom. Plot While multi- millionaire Tom Mullen and his wife Kate attend a science fair, their son Sean is kidnapped. Sean is taken to an apartment by Maris Conner, a caterer for the Mullens, along with brothers Clark and Cubby Barnes, and Miles Roberts, and Detective Jimmy Shaker, Maris' boyfriend and the mastermind behind the kidnapping. Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding $2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may have been behind it. They visit Brown in prison, but he angrily denies any involvement with the kidnapping. Tom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the ransom. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is electronically disguising his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand the money over when Cubby fails to give him the directions Shaker had promised him. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby. He dies before he can reveal Sean's location. Shaker later arranges another drop off. While Tom initially agrees to take the money alone, he realizes there is no guarantee Sean will be returned alive and instead appears on television to offer the ransom as a bounty on the kidnappers' heads, promising to withdraw the bounty and drop all charges if the kidnappers return his son alive and unharmed. Despite the pleadings of Kate and Agent Hawkins, Tom sticks to his plan, believing it is the best chance of having Sean returned. Shaker lures Kate to a meeting where he tells her to pay the ransom or Sean will die before ditching Sean's blood stained t-shirt. Tom responds by increasing the bounty to $4,000,000. Shaker calls Tom and demands to be paid, but Tom still refuses, and Shaker fires a gunshot after Tom hears Sean scream for help, leading Tom and Kate to believe their son is dead. Clark and Miles attempt to abandon the plan and flee, but Shaker calls in the NYPD to request backup and kills both of his men while making it look like Miles shot first, and kills Maris after she shoots him in the arm from behind. The NYPD arrive and find Shaker with Sean, believing Shaker found and rescued the boy. Hawkins informs Tom and Kate and they are reunited with their son while Shaker is hospitalized. Tom also recognizes Maris. Shaker later pays Tom a visit to claim the reward and leave the country before investigators discover his connection with Maris. Tom and Sean, however, recognize Shaker as the kidnapper, and Shaker realizes this. Though his initial plan is to kill everyone in the apartment, Tom persuades him to accompany him to the bank to gain the money and leave peacefully. On the way, however, Tom discreetly alerts Hawkins and the police and FBI converge on Tom and Shaker outside the bank. As soon as Tom and Shaker exit the bank, two officers (who greeted Shaker and Tom before entering the bank) inform Shaker that he is going to be detained, causing Shaker to go berserk and shoot them down, before Tom knocks him to the ground, after which a chase ensues in which Tom and Shaker grapple furiously before falling through a shop window, severely injuring both and impaling Shaker through the neck. Tom picks up a hidden pistol (that Shaker pulled out during the scuffle) and points at Shaker before Hawkins and other police officers keep demanding that he drop the gun and walk away. In desperation, Shaker draws another hidden gun, but is shot dead by Tom and Hawkins. Tom finally drops the gun and police rush in to arrest Tom, but Hawkins tells them to hold as it was self-defense, allowing Tom and Kate to leave the scene.

It was a tailless aircraft for which aerodynamic data from projects of the German Arado and Messerschmitt companies, obtained at the end of World War II through German scientists who worked on the projects, contributed; though Vought designers denied any link to the German research at the time.Angelucci 1987, p. 447. The F7U was the last aircraft designed by Rex Beisel, who was responsible for the first fighter ever designed specifically for the U.S. Navy, the Curtiss TS-1 of 1922. Regarded as a radical departure from traditional aircraft design, the Cutlass suffered from numerous technical and handling problems throughout its short service career. The type was responsible for the deaths of four test pilots and 21 other U.S. Navy pilots. Over one quarter of all Cutlasses built were destroyed in accidents. Design and development The first F7U-1 launching from the carrier in 1951 The Cutlass was Vought's entry to a U.S. Navy competition for a new carrier-capable day fighter, opened on 1 June 1945. Former Messerschmitt AG senior designer Waldemar Voigt, who supervised the development of numerous experimental jet fighters in Nazi Germany, contributed to its design with his experience in the development of the Messerschmitt P.1110 and P.1112 projects.LePage 2009, pp. 275–276.Schick and Meyer 1997, p. 167. The requirements were for an aircraft that was able to fly at at . The design featured broad chord, low aspect ratio swept wings, with twin wing- mounted tail fins either side of a short fuselage. The cockpit was situated well forward to provide good visibility for the pilot during aircraft carrier approaches. The design was given the company type number of V-346 and then the official designation of \\"F7U\\" when it was announced the winner of the competition. Pitch and roll control was provided by elevons, though Vought called these surfaces \\"ailevators\\" at the time. Slats were fitted to the entire span of the leading edge. All controls were hydraulically-powered. The very long nose landing gear strut required for high angle of attack takeoffs lifted the pilot 14 feet into the air and was fully steerable. The high stresses of barrier engagements, and side-loads imposed during early deployment carrier landings caused failure of the retract cylinder's internal down-locks, causing nose gear failure and resultant spinal injuries to the pilot. The aircraft had all-hydraulic controls which provided artificial feedback so the pilot could feel aerodynamic forces acting on the plane. The hydraulic system operated at 3000 psi, twice that of other Navy aircraft. The hydraulic system was not ready for front-line service and was unreliable. The F7U was underpowered by its Westinghouse J34 turbojets, an engine that some pilots liked to say \\"put out less heat than Westinghouse's toasters.\\" Naval aviators called the F7U the \\"Gutless Cutlass\\" and/or the \\"Ensign Eliminator\\" or, in kinder moments, the \\"Praying Mantis\\".O'Rourke, G.G, CAPT USN. \\"Of Hosenoses, Stoofs, and Lefthanded Spads.\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings, July 1968. = Testing = None of the 14 F7U-1s built between 1950 and 1952 became approved to be used in squadron service. On 7 July 1950 Vought test pilot Paul Thayer ejected from his burning prototype in front of an airshow crowd. On 20 December 1951, the F7U-3 version took off for its maiden flight. The F7U-3 featured other engines, a stronger airframe larger by a third and extra maintenance panel for service access. Test pilot and later astronaut Walter Schirra wrote in his autobiography that he considered the F7U-3 accident prone and a \\"widow maker\\". On the positive side, test pilots found it a stable weapons platform, maneuverable, fun to fly and the strengthened airframe to be sturdy. Test pilots particularly praised its high roll rate at 570 degrees/s, three times faster than most production jets at the time. = Flight characteristics = The Cutlass would gyrate after a stall. When Lt. Morrey Loso found himself tumbling about in the cockpit in his tumbling aircraft after a stall, he found that when he let go of the control stick to reach with both hands for the ejection handle, the Cutlass self- corrected. This meant that normal recovery procedures did not apply to the Cutlass and the result was later confirmed in wind-tunnel testing. Operational history Vought F7U-3 Cutlass Three prototypes were ordered in 1946, with the first example flying on 29 September 1948, piloted by Vought's chief test pilot, J. Robert Baker. The maiden flight took place from Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, and was not without its problems. During testing one of the prototypes reached a maximum speed of 625 mph (1,058 km/h).Angelluci 1987, p. 448. Production orders were placed for the F7U-1 in a specification very close to the prototypes, and further developed F7U-2 and F7U-3 versions with more powerful engines. Because of development problems with the powerplant, however, the F7U-2 would never be built, while the F7U-3 would incorporate many refinements suggested by tests of the -1. The first 16 F7U-3s had non-afterburning Allison J35-A-29 engines. The -3, with its Westinghouse J46-WE-8B turbojets, would eventually become the definitive production version, with 288 aircraft equipping 13 U.S. Navy squadrons. Further development stopped once the Vought F8U Crusader flew. The F7U's performance suffered due to a lack of sufficient engine thrust; consequently, its carrier landing and takeoff performance was notoriously poor. The J35 was known to flame out in rain, a very serious fault. The first fleet squadron to receive F7Us was Fighter Squadron 81 (VF-81) in April 1954. Few squadrons made deployments with the type, and most \\"beached\\" them ashore during part of the cruise owing to operating difficulties. Those units known to have taken the type to sea were: * VF-124, , August 1955 – March 1956. After pilot George Millard was killed in a Cutlass landing accident, the captain ordered every Cutlass off the ship and the squadron spent its Pacific cruise at the Atsugi naval air station in Japan. * VF-81, , November 1955 – August 1956; after a pilot was injured after a nosegear collapse, the squadron was ordered ashore at Naval Air Station Port Lyautey. * VA-86, , January – March 1956 shakedown cruise; * VA-83, , March – September 1956; * VA-116, USS Hancock, April - September 1957; * VA-151, , May - December 1956; * VA-212, , August 1956 – February 1957. * Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 4 (VX-4), and USS Lexington In 1957, Chance Vought analysed the accident record and found that with 78 accidents and a quarter of the airframes lost in 55,000 flight hours, the Cutlass had the highest accident rate of all Navy swept-wing fighters. The poor safety record meant that Vice Admiral Harold M. “Beauty” Martin, air commander of the United States Pacific Fleet replaced his Cutlass aircraft with Grumman F9F-8 Cougars. =Blue Angels= The Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, flew two F7U-1 Cutlasses (BuNos 124426 & 124427) as a side demonstration during their 1953 show season in an effort to promote the new aircraft, but did not use them as part of their regular formation demonstration. Both the pilots and ground crews found the aircraft generally unsatisfactory, and it was apparent that the type was still experiencing multiple teething troubles.Angelluci 1987, p. 448. Among the failures were landing gear failures, hydraulic failures, engine fires while in the air and on one occasion a landing gear door fell on a spectator grandstand but through sheer luck did not injure anyone. During the Blue Angels' first airshow appearance in 1953, pilot Lt Edward \\"Whitey\\" Feightner, the former program manager for the F7U, experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the backup system came on. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd. Later, while traveling to an airshow at Naval Air Station Glenview in Chicago, Illinois, another Blue Angel pilot, Lt Harding MacKnight, experienced an engine flameout in his Cutlass, forcing him to make an emergency landing at NAS Glenview. Traveling with him, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed O'Hare Airport. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Following these incidents, the two Cutlasses were deemed unsuitable for demonstration flying and were flown to Naval Air Station Memphis, Tennessee, where they were abandoned to become aircraft maintenance instructional airframes for the Naval Technical Training Center.Powell 2008, p. 37.

He seems to have been employed by the ducal court until around 1538. In 1535 he published his first book, a parlor game with music called El juego de mandar. The next year he issued what would be his most important book.  El Maestro (1536)  Milán’s Libro de música de vihuela de mano intitulado El Maestro was printed in December 1536 and dedicated to King John III of Portugal. The dedication, and the inclusion of six villancicos in Portuguese, suggests that Milán traveled to that country and spent time there. El Maestro is the first collection of vihuela music in history, and was in part intended for students of the instrument, with scores presented in grades from simple to complex so that vihuelists could proceed from elementary to harder pieces. The set divides into two books, one for the vihuela alone and the other for voice and vihuela. (A breakdown of its 72 works is at Spanish Wikipedia.) There are forty fantasías, six pavanas, and four tientos in the instrumental volume. For voice there are twelve villancicos, four romances, and six sonetos (sonnets). All of these are to Castilian texts, except for the sonetos, which are in Italian, and half of the villancicos, as already noted. Much of the collection requires considerable virtuosity. Still, not all the ornamentation is provided in detail. The style of the compositions varies from simple homophony to polyphony and virtuoso passage-work; unusual chromaticism also occurs, including strange double-inflections which were quite rare in music from other parts of Europe at the same time. It appears that the book was prepared with great care; alternative passages are given for players who wish to avoid more virtuosic parts, sections of pieces are indicated as optional, and he provided descriptive tempo indications, for example ni muy apriessa ni muy a espacio sino con un compás bien mesurado (\\"neither too quickly nor too slowly, but with a moderate measure\\").  Late works  Milán’s last publication, El cortesano (1561), modeled on Il Cortegiano by Baldassare Castiglione, gives a vivid and entertaining picture of life in the Valencian ducal court. While it contains no music, it is a valuable account by a professional musician at the time.  Legacy  The music of Luis de Milán is popular with performers on the present-day classical guitar because it can be adapted very easily to their instrument.

Biography Leon (Yehudah Leib) Pinsker inherited a strong sense of Jewish identity from his father, Simchah Pinsker, a Hebrew language writer, scholar and teacher. Leon attended his father's private school in Odessa and was one of the first Jews to attend Odessa University, where he studied law. Later he realized that, being a Jew, he had no chance of becoming a lawyer due to strict quotas on Jewish professionals and chose the career of a physician. Jewish and Zionist activism Pinsker believed that the Jewish problem could be resolved if the Jews attained equal rights. In his early years, Pinsker favored the assimilation path and was one of the founders of a Russian language Jewish weekly (see also: Haskala). The Odessa pogrom of 1871 moved Pinsker to become an active public figure. In 1881, a bigger wave of anti- Jewish hostilities, many state-sponsored, swept southern Russia and continued until 1884. Then Pinsker's views changed radically, and he no longer believed that mere humanism and Enlightenment would defeat antisemitism.The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem, Alex Bein In 1884, he organized an international conference of Hibbat Zion in Katowice (Upper Silesia, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia). His visit to Western Europe led to his famous pamphlet Auto-Emancipation, subtitled Mahnruf an seine Stammgenossen, von einem russischen Juden (Warning to His Fellow People, from a Russian Jew), which he published anonymously in German on 1 January 1882, and in which he urged the Jewish people to strive for independence and national consciousness. The book raised strong responses, both for and against. As a professional physician, Pinsker preferred the medical term \\"Judeophobia\\" to the recently introduced \\"antisemitism\\". Pinsker knew that a combination of mutually exclusive assertions is a characteristic of a psychological disorder and was convinced that pathological, irrational phobia may explain this millennia-old hatred: > : \\"... to the living the Jew is a corpse, to the native a foreigner, to the > homesteader a vagrant, to the proprietary a beggar, to the poor an exploiter > and a millionaire, to the patriot a man without a country, for all a hated > rival.\\" His analysis of the roots of this ancient hatred led him to call for the establishment of a Jewish National Homeland, either in Palestine or elsewhere. Eventually Pinsker came to agree with Moses Lilienblum that hatred of Jews was rooted in the fact that they were foreigners everywhere except their original homeland, the Land of Israel. He became one of the founders and a chairman of the Hovevei Zion movement, with the backing of Baron Edmond James de Rothschild. Zionist agricultural settlement In 1890, the Russian authorities approved the establishment of the Society for the Support of Jewish Farmers and Artisans in Syria and Palestine,The Hovevei Zion in Russia- The Odessa committee 1889-1890 dedicated to the practical aspects of establishing Jewish agricultural colonies there. Pinsker headed this charity organization, known as the Odessa Committee. Disagreements between various Jewish religious and secular factions, an internal movement crisis and the ban by the Ottoman Empire on Jewish immigration in the 1890s caused Pinsker to doubt whether Eretz Israel would ever become the solution. Death and legacy Pinsker died in Odessa in 1891. His remains were brought to Jerusalem in 1934 and reburied in Nicanor's Cave next to Mount Scopus. Moshav Nahalat Yehuda, now a neighborhood in Rishon LeZion, is named after him, as well as a street in Tel Aviv and several other locales in Israel.

Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as John Kimble, a tough police detective working undercover as a kindergarten teacher to apprehend drug dealer Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) before he can get to his ex-wife and son. While undercover, Kimble discovers his passion for teaching and considers changing his profession to become an educator. Pamela Reed plays his partner, Phoebe O'Hara, and Penelope Ann Miller plays Joyce, the teacher who becomes his love interest. The original music score was composed by Randy Edelman. The film was released in the United States on December 21, 1990. Plot After years of pursuing Cullen Crisp, an infamous drug dealer, LAPD detective John Kimble arrests him for murder; a witness saw him murder an informant after getting information regarding the whereabouts of his ex-wife, Rachel, who allegedly stole millions of dollars from him before fleeing with his son. Partnered with former teacher-turned-detective Phoebe, Kimble goes undercover in Astoria, Oregon to find Rachel and offer her immunity in exchange for testifying against Crisp in court. To this end, Phoebe must act as a substitute teacher in Cullen Jr's kindergarten class at Astoria Elementary School. Phoebe gets a terrible case of stomach flu, falling ill at the last moment, so Kimble takes her place. The suspicious school principal, Miss Schlowski, is convinced he will not last long before quitting. Though initially overwhelmed, he adapts to his new status quickly, despite not having any formal teaching experience. With the use of his pet ferret as a class mascot, positive reinforcement, his police training as a model for structure in class and his experience as a father, he becomes a much admired and cherished figure to the students. Kimble begins to enjoy his undercover role. At one point, he deals with a case of child abuse by assaulting and threatening the father of the abused child, winning Miss Schlowski's favor. In observation of his teaching style, she assures him that even though she does not agree with his methods, she can see that he is a good teacher. Kimble also becomes fond of Joyce, a fellow teacher whose son Dominic is one of his students. She is estranged from her husband and will not speak of him, telling Dominic that he lives in France. Conversing with the gradually more trusting Joyce, Kimble deduces that she is Rachel and that Dominic is Cullen Jr. Back in California, the case holding Crisp in jail is closed after the witness dies from using tainted cocaine provided by Crisp's mother, Eleanor. He is subsequently released from prison, and quickly travels to Astoria with Eleanor to search for Cullen Jr. When Kimble learns Crisp has been released, he confronts Rachel about her identity, saying he can protect her if she cooperates. Outraged that he misled her, she tells him that Crisp lied about her stealing the money to convince drug dealers to help him find her; the real reason was to find his son, as he was angry that Rachel disappeared with him. Crisp starts a fire in the library as a distraction to kidnap his son, but uses him as a hostage when Kimble arrives. Kimble's ferret, who was hiding in Cullen Jr's shirt, bites Crisp in the neck, allowing Cullen Jr to escape; Crisp shoots Kimble in the leg and then Kimble fatally shoots him in return. Outside, Eleanor injures Phoebe with her car before going inside and discovering Crisp dead; she wounds Kimble in the shoulder, but Phoebe appears and knocks her unconscious with a baseball bat. Eleanor is then arrested and the unconscious Kimble is hospitalized with Phoebe, with both of them making a full recovery. Phoebe returns to the police force in Los Angeles, while Kimble decides to retire, staying in Astoria to become a kindergarten teacher at the school full-time. Rachel joins him and the two share a kiss while everyone cheers. Cast Production =Casting= Bill Murray was approached to play the role of Kimble. Director Ivan Reitman and casting director Michael Chinich auditioned more than 2,000 children for the roles of the students. =Filming locations= Exterior scenes at Astoria Elementary School were filmed at John Jacob Astor Elementary School, located at 3550 Franklin Avenue in Astoria, Oregon. Universal Studios hired local artists Judith Niland and Carl Lyle Jenkins to paint murals on the walls at Astoria, and provided new playground equipment, a fenced playground, and a new lawn and hedges around the school. Most of the filming was completed after school was out in June 1990 allowing many of the students and faculty to be extras in the film. Students' artwork was also used. Schwarzenegger's contract stipulated that a private studio for daily workouts and weightlifting be provided for the actor and his personal staff; a suitable studio was located, but when an agreement could not be reached, the actor threatened to pull out of the production. An Astoria business owner stepped in and donated unused commercial space deemed suitable for Schwarzenegger, and the shoot continued. Also filmed in or near AstoriaAstoria & Warrenton Area Chamber of Commerce: * John and Phoebe stayed at the Bayview Motel, 783 W. Marine Drive. The vintage lodging facility \\"played itself\\" in the film. * Scenes involving John and Phoebe walking to dinner, and Crisp and Eleanor shopping, were filmed on Commercial Street in downtown Astoria. * The exterior portions of the restaurant scene were filmed outside the Seafare Restaurant at the Red Lion Inn, 400 Industry Street. * Scenes at Joyce and Dominic's house were filmed at a private residence located at 414 Exchange Street. * Highway scenes were filmed on U.S. 26 east of Seaside, Oregon, twenty miles from Astoria. * The school picnic was filmed at Ecola State Park near Cannon Beach, Oregon, twenty five miles south of Astoria. Interior school scenes were shot at Universal Studios in Hollywood. The film's opening scene was filmed at the Westfield MainPlace in Santa Ana, California, and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California. Reception =Box office= Kindergarten Cop grossed $91.4 million in North America, $110.5 in other territories, and $202 million worldwide. It was released in the United Kingdom on February 1, 1991, and topped the country's box office that weekend. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 51% based on 37 reviews. The site's consensus states: On Metacritic, it has a score of 61 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Reviewer Caryn James of The New York Times said, \\"Like Twins, which was also directed by Ivan Reitman, nothing in the film is as funny as the idea of it.\\" In Kim Newman's review for Empire, he wrote, \\"with a heart of purest mush, the film still manages to be generally entertaining\\" and gave it 3 stars out of 5. An EW.com review at the time of release notes that: \\"the movie never quite gels and it is not going to generate quite the mega hit business their producers are counting on,\\" giving it a 'C' grade. Roger Ebert said the film: \\"is made up of two parts that shouldn't fit, but somehow they do, making a slick entertainment out of the improbable, the impossible and Arnold Schwarzenegger\\" and awarded it three stars. On April Fool's Day 2012, as a prank, it was announced that the film was selected for a release on DVD and Blu-ray Disc as part of the Criterion Collection, a video distribution company dedicated to the release of \\"important classic and contemporary films\\". It was said to be selected as important in part because of its genre revisionist use of both the policier and family comedy genres in the same film. It was officially released on Blu- ray, though not by Criterion, on July 1, 2014. =Legacy= For the video game Silent Hill, parts of Astoria Elementary School from the film were used as reference for the location Midwich Elementary School. Several of Schwarzenegger's memorable lines from the film were used in sound boards for prank phone calls that became popular in the early 2000s. Music =Soundtrack= =Track listing= Sequel In June 2015, Showbiz 411 announced that Universal Studios' 1440 division was developing a sequel, with Don Michael Paul as director and David H. Steinberg as scriptwriter. The protagonist has an Indian sidekick named Sanjit, and they are searching for a flash drive stolen from the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. Showbiz 411 suggested a television series was also under consideration. Dolph Lundgren was seen shooting scenes for the film./ The sequel, Kindergarten Cop 2, was released direct to DVD in May 2016.

The film stars the original cast members John Travolta and Kirstie Alley as James and Mollie Ubriacco, the parents of Mikey (voiced by Bruce Willis), a toddler coping with the newest addition to the family, baby Julie (voiced by Roseanne Barr). In addition to this, he is having trouble using a potty, and the unorthodox advice he gets from his playmate, Eddie (voiced by Damon Wayans), doesn't make his problem any better. Plot The movie picks up with the now married Mollie (Kristie Alley) and James (John Travolta) preparing for the birth of a new baby girl (voice of Roseanne Barr), while teaching Mikey (voice of Bruce Willis) how to use the potty. Meanwhile, James is working diligently to bring in more income for the family. Mikey looks forward to meeting his sibling as well as being a responsible big brother. When the baby is about to be born, her umbilical cord gets caught around her neck, putting her in distress. Given the name \\"Julie\\", she is born through a c-section and is taken to the nursery area for observation. When Julie meets Mikey, she is unimpressed. Mikey, on the other hand, quickly begins to resent his sister when his dreams of being a responsible big brother don't match the reality. Meanwhile, Mollie's slacker right-wing younger brother, Stuart (Elias Koteas), comes to stay, to whom James takes an immediate dislike. This, combined with James being pressured into taking a demanding piloting job arranged by Mollie's parents and his belief that Mollie is too protective of Mikey, causes several arguments between the pair which eventually lead to James leaving. Mikey is upset about this and, believing he has left because of Julie, tears up one of his sister's stuffed animals. James occasionally hangs out with his kids (including scamming their way into a movie theater) and has fun with them. Following a burglary, Mollie's best friend Rona (Twink Caplan) moves in with her and she soon starts dating Stuart. Following the 'death' of her beloved stuffed penguin (whom she named Herbie), Julie decides to learn to walk and leave. Later, Julie manages to walk to the sofa without support. Mollie sees this and is initially excited but then saddened that James isn't there to share the moment. As he watches Julie sleep one night, Mikey realizes how badly he's treated her and resolves to change his ways. Mollie decides to win James back and dresses sexily for him, but he isn't interested. As the two bicker, Mikey uses the toilet for the first time and calls his parents, who are immensely proud of him and share a tender moment. One night as James prepares to fly, Mollie watches the news and learns that storms are all around the area. She goes to get James before he takes off, leaving Stuart with Mikey and Julie. She catches him and tries to persuade him not to take off, just as the control tower cancels the flight. The two then make up. Meanwhile, a burglar (presumably the same one who also robbed Rona) breaks in and runs when Stuart comes in with his unloaded gun. Stuart pursues him having forgotten about the kids and completely oblivious to the fact that he left paper on a hot stove which quickly causes a fire to start. Mikey doesn't panic and takes charge, pushing Julie out of the apartment to safety. Stuart and the burglar run into James who subdues the thief. Mollie and James soon find out the kids were left alone and spot the fire in the apartment, only for Mikey and Julie to emerge from the elevator as the two prepare to head in to save them. James then puts out the fire before it can cause too much damage. The next day, James, Mollie, Stuart, Rona, and Mollie's parents attend a barbecue. There, Julie asks Mikey why he saved her when they're always fighting. Mikey tells her that for as much as they get on each other's nerves, they're the kids and should stick together since the grown ups never make any sense to them. The two then walk off hand in hand. Cast * John Travolta as James Ubriacco/Voice of James' sperm cells (uncredited) * Kirstie Alley as Mollie Ubriacco/Voice of Mollie's egg (uncredited) * Lorne Sussman as Mikey Ubriacco * Megan Milner as Julie Ubriacco (age 1 year) **Georgia Keithley as Julie (age 4 months) **Nikki Graham as Julie (fetus–newborn) * Elias Koteas as Stuart Jensen * Twink Caplan as Rona * Olympia Dukakis as Rosie Jensen * Lesley Ewen as Debbie * Gilbert Gottfried as Joey, the baby gym instructor * Don S. Davis as Dr. Fleischer Voices * Bruce Willis as Mikey Ubriacco * Roseanne Barr as Julie Ubriacco * Damon Wayans as Eddie * Mel Brooks as Mr. Toilet Man Production The famous TriStar Pictures theme music, composed by Dave Grusin, was played during the scene when Julie practices walking. A variation exists at the beginning of the logo when Bruce Willis (voice of Mikey) was doing a Mister Ed imitation. Casting The bum teaser at the end of the first film portrayed an uncredited Joan Rivers, providing the voice of Julie. Due to scheduling conflicts, she declined the role. Also in the early trailer, Richard Pryor was originally going to be the voice of Eddie. Also appearing are Olympia Dukakis, Elias Koteas, and Gilbert Gottfried. Further vocal talents include Damon Wayans in a supporting role as the voice of Eddie. Mel Brooks makes a cameo appearance as the voice of Mr. Toilet Man. The film was followed by another sequel, Look Who's Talking Now, in 1993. Alternative versions When the film aired on ABC Family, many of its deleted scenes (such as Mollie threatening Mikey with a spanking if he takes Julie away again) were shown. One notable addition is a running gag where Mollie chats with her friends and folks and it ignites a daydream of James cheating on her. There is even one sequence where she imagines him as John Lennon and herself as Yoko Ono parodying their activism. In one version, James and Stuart have a conversation after he arrives in the apartment. Reception Unlike its predecessor, it received mostly negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 13% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 3.07/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. The film was released in the United Kingdom on March 22, 1991, and reached #2 in the country's box office that weekend. It grossed $47,789,074 at the box office, making it a moderate success at the box office. It was also nominated for two Razzie Awards, including Worst Supporting Actor for Gilbert Gottfried and Worst Supporting Actress for Roseanne Barr, and a Stinkers Bad Movie Award for Worst Picture.

Soap Co.\\" Synopsis The album consists of two 28-minute pieces, each taking up one side of the original vinyl release. = \\"How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All\\" = This opens with a late- night TV commercial by car salesman Ralph Spoilsport (Philip Proctor), a spoof of Southern California Ford dealer Ralph Williams. As he extols the virtues of a featured new car, the main character Babe (Peter Bergman), runs across traffic onto the lot and interrupts Ralph's spiel with an immediate desire to buy the car in question. Ralph enthusiastically invites Babe to take a look inside his \\"beautiful new home\\". The impossibly luxurious car contains a \\"home entertainment system\\", with AM and FM radio and television. Spoilsport turns on each component in turn, creating a cacophonous din. Babe buys the car and, as he drives it, the text of road signs and billboards along the road is spoken as he passes them. He decides to take the Antelope Freeway, and the distance signs to it progress per Zeno's paradox (one mile, 1/2 mile, 1/4 mile, etc.) The infinite series is broken only when he decides to try the \\"all-weather climate control\\", and selects \\"tropical paradise\\" from a list of options. At the push of a button, this transforms the interior of his car into a tropical rainforest, complete with sounds of exotic birds, thunder, and rainfall. A troupe of wise-cracking explorers emerge from the trees, including someone who sounds like W. C. Fields, on a half-hearted expedition. Babe tries to escape the interlopers by changing the climate control to \\"Land of the Pharaohs\\" and is transported to ancient Egypt, but to no avail; the explorers have come with him. Increasingly annoyed, he complains that the sun is setting and it will be night soon. They reply he's confused, the horizon is moving up; so they stand him on his head to convince him that it is morning. Babe loses his balance and falls to the ground, causing one to remark, \\"He's no fun! He fell right over!\\". A loud rumbling is heard, and the group realizes that a pyramid is opening. The pyramid is actually a motel, with a vacancy. Babe enters the lobby and encounters a pair of partiers. They gradually morph into panoply of characters who launch a satirical celebration of America which parodies Norman Corwin's 1941 patriotic radio pageant We Hold These Truths.CD Liner Notes by David Ossman This includes sardonic references to slavery and the conquest of the American Indians. At one point, each member of the group rhythmically repeats the names of the candidates in the 1968 presidential election mimicking a steam locomotive: \\"Rockefeller, Nixon, Humphrey, and Kennedy.\\" Eventually, Babe is drafted into the army, and the play morphs again into the closing scene of a World War II musical film \\"Babes In Khaki\\", starring Lillie Lamont (Proctor). The movie is broadcast on television, and after it ends, channel surfing reveals snippets of random commercials and program segments. At one point we hear a crime drama, with tough guys saying they hate cops. One named Nick declares he's \\"gonna get even with every rotten cop in this city\\", by turning in his badge and burning his uniform. Finally, Spoilsport returns as \\"Ralph Icebag\\", selling marijuana instead of cars. His spiel morphs into a close paraphrase of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy which closes James Joyce's novel Ulysses. = \\"The Further Adventures of Nick Danger\\" = This is presented as an episode (titled \\"Cut 'Em Off at the Past\\") of a fictional 1940s radio drama, Nick Danger, Third Eye, broadcast on December 7, 1941. Nick Danger (Phil Austin) is a '40s-style hardboiled private investigator in the Raymond Chandler mold. In live performances and photographs, he wears the stereotypical fedora and trench coat. He has the obligatory nemesis on the police force, Lieutenant Bradshaw (Bergman), who questions Danger's every move. Bradshaw specifically blames Danger for a botched pederasty arrest. His \\"mark\\" is Rocky Rococo (Proctor), a Peter Lorre parody. True to the clichés of the genre, there is a suspicious butler, Catherwood (David Ossman), and a femme fatale: Danger's old college flame Betty Jo Bialosky (Proctor, or Bergman in scenes with Rocky Rococo), with aliases Melanie Haber, Audrey Farber, and Susan Underhill, whom \\"everyone knew as Nancy\\" (parodying a line from the Beatles' song \\"Rocky Raccoon\\"). This sketch is not as surreal or Kafkaesque as most other Firesign Theatre material, though it is intermixed and loaded with references to the Beatles, the I Ching, and other counterculture topics. The basic plot involves the attempt by Rococo to sell Danger a stolen ring, that belonged to Nancy; Danger is thus drawn into a trap and framed when Nancy and Catherwood kill Rococo because he found out about time travel experiments by Catherwood, leading Danger to a violent confrontation with all of them and forcing a confession from Catherwood at gunpoint. It also parodies characteristics of old-time radio drama production, e.g. referring to a fireplace fire as \\"the cellophane\\" and \\"coming in out of the cornstarch\\" (used to create the sound effects); actors reading the wrong lines, or dropping their scripts; actors stepping out of character to read commercials; and referring to the use of voice fade-outs and organ cues to signal transitions between flashbacks. At one point, Nancy faints and falls over, causing Danger to say, \\"She's no fun, she fell right over.\\" He remembers he (Austin) said this same line on side 1 of the record, and asks, \\"Where am I? I'd better check.\\" The side 1 track is then heard playing backwards, and Danger says, \\"It's OK, they're speaking Chinese\\" and continues with the play. The climax is reached as Catherwood's return from a flashback is bungled, resulting in the duplication of every character except Lieutenant Bradshaw. Just as Danger is about to try something daring to solve this problem and extricate himself from his trap, the action is abruptly interrupted by a special news bulletin, in which President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Bergman) wearily tells the American people of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He declares our \\"rendezvous with destiny\\" demands the United States \\"unconditionally surrender\\" to the Empire of Japan. The bulletin ends, but it is too late to find out what Danger did; Bradshaw is congratulating him for solving the case. The closing organ theme chord segues into Austin laughing and singing \\"ta-da!\\", and the Firesign Theatre talk to the producer, announcing their intent to \\"go back to the other side of the record\\". The producer then announces, \\"Scene 3, take 600\\".

Newars form a linguistic and cultural community of primarily Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman ethnicities following Hinduism and Buddhism with Newar language as their common language. Newars have developed a division of labour and a sophisticated urban civilisation not seen elsewhere in the Himalayan foothills. Newars have continued their age-old traditions and practices and pride themselves as the true custodians of the religion, culture and civilisation of Nepal. Newars are known for their contributions to culture, art and literature, trade, agriculture and cuisine. Today, they consistently rank as the most economically, politically and socially advanced community of Nepal, according to the annual Human Development Index published by UNDP. Nepal's 2011 census ranks them as the nation's sixth-largest ethnicity/community, with 1,321,933 Newars throughout the country. Page 4. The Kathmandu Valley and surrounding territories constituted the former Newar kingdom of the Nepal Mandala.Slusser, Mary (1982). Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley. Princeton University. . Page vii. Unlike other common-origin ethnic or caste groups of Nepal, the Newars are regarded as an example of a nation community with a relict identity, derived from an ethnically-diverse, previously-existing polity.Granthavali-v-1-11(pb) vol-5, Hazari Prasad khè\\", Rajkamal Prakashan Pvt Ltd, 1 January 2007, p.279 Newar community within it consists of various strands of ethnic, racial, caste and religious heterogeneity, as they are the descendants of the diverse group of people that have lived in Nepal Mandala since prehistoric times. Indo-Aryan tribes like the Licchavis, Kosala, and Mallas (N) from respective Indian Mahajanapada (i.e. Licchavis of Vajji, Kosala, and Malla (I)) that arrived at different periods eventually merged with the local population by adopting their language and customs. These tribes however retained their Vedic culture and brought with them their Sanskritic languages, social structure and Hindu religion, which was assimilated with local cultures and gave rise to the current Newar civilisation. Newar rule in Nepal Mandala ended with its conquest by the Gorkha Kingdom in 1768. Origin of the name The terms \\"Nepāl\\", \\"Newār\\", \\"Newāl\\" and \\"Nepār\\" are phonetically different forms of the same word, and instances of the various forms appear in texts in different times in history. Nepal is the learned (Sanskrit) form and Newar is the colloquial (Prakrit) form. Page 7. A Sanskrit inscription dated to 512 in Tistung, a valley to the west of Kathmandu, contains the phrase \\"greetings to the Nepals\\" indicating that the term \\"Nepal\\" was used to refer to both the country and the people. Page 1. The term \\"Newar\\" or \\"Newa:\\" referring to \\"inhabitant of Nepal\\" appeared for the first time in an inscription dated 1654 in Kathmandu. Italian Jesuit priest Ippolito Desideri (1684–1733) who traveled to Nepal in 1721 has written that the natives of Nepal are called Newars.Desideri, Ippolito and Sweet, Michael Jay (2010). Mission to Tibet: The Extraordinary Eighteenth-Century Account of Father Ippolito Desideri, S.J.. Wisdom Publications. . Page 463. It has been suggested that \\"Nepal\\" may be a sanskritization of \\"Newar\\", or \\"Newar\\" may be a later form of \\"Nepal\\". Page 353. According to another explanation, the words \\"Newar\\" and \\"Newari\\" are colloquial forms arising from the mutation of P to W, and L to R. Page 51. As a result of the phonological process of dropping the last consonant and lengthening the vowel, \\"Newā\\" for Newār or Newāl, and \\"Nepā\\" for Nepāl are used in ordinary speech. History The Vajji or Vrijji Mahajanapada and Malla Mahajanapada in 600 BCE; Notable Licchavi (kingdom) and Malla (Nepal) of Nepal Mandala originated from respective ones For about a thousand years, the Newar civilization in Central Nepal preserved a microcosm of classical North Indian culture in which Brahmanic and Buddhist elements enjoyed equal status.George Campbell,Compendium of the World's Languages: Ladakhi to Zuni, Volume 2 Snellgrove and Richardson (1968) speak of 'the direct heritage of pre-Islamic India'. The Malla dynasty was noted for their patronisation of the Maithili language (the language of the Mithila region) which was afforded an equal status to that of Sanskrit in the Malla court. Maithil Brahmin priests were invited to Kathmandu and many Maithil families settled in Kathmandu during Malla rule. Due to influx of people from both north (Tibet) and south (Bihar) who brought with them not only their genetic and racial diversity but also greatly moulded the dominant culture and tradition of Newars. The different divisions of Newars had different historical developments. The common identity of Newar was formed in the Kathmandu Valley. Until the conquest of the valley by the Gorkha Kingdom in 1769, Pages 320–322. all the people who had inhabited the valley at any point of time were either Newar or progenitors of Newar. So, the history of Newar correlates to the history of the Kathmandu Valley (or Nepala Mandala) prior to the establishment of the modern state of Nepal. The earliest known history of Newar and the Kathmandu Valley blends with mythology recorded in historical chronicles. One such text, which recounts the creation of the valley, is the Swayambhu Purana. According to this Buddhist scripture, the Kathmandu Valley was a giant lake until the Bodhisattva Manjusri, with the aid of a holy sword, cut a gap in the surrounding hills and let the water out. This apocryphal legend is supported by geological evidence of an ancient lakebed, and it provides an explanation for the high fertility of the Kathmandu Valley soil. According to the Swayambhu Purana, Manjusri then established a city called Manjupattan (Sanskrit \\"Land Established by Manjusri\\"), now called Manjipā, and made Dharmākara its king. A shrine dedicated to Manjusri is still present in Majipā. No historical documents have been found after this era till the advent of the Gopal era. A genealogy of kings is recorded in a chronicle called Gopalarajavamsavali.Vajracharya, Dhanavajra and Malla, Kamal P. (1985) The Gopalarajavamsavali. Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH. According to this manuscript, the Gopal kings were followed by the Mahispals and the Kirats before the Licchavis entered from the south. Some claim Buddha to have visited Nepal during the reign of Kirat King Jitedasti. Newar reign over the valley and their sovereignty and influence over neighboring territories ended with the conquest of the Kathmandu Valley in 1769 by the Gorkhali Shah dynasty founded by Prithvi Narayan Shah. Page 271. Prior to the Gorkha conquest, which began with the Battle of Kirtipur in 1767, the borders of Nepal Mandala extended to Tibet in the north, the nation of the Kirata in the east, the kingdom of Makwanpur in the south Page 308. and the Trishuli River in the west which separated it from the kingdom of Gorkha. Page 123. Economic history Newar traders in Lhasa in the 1940s. Trade, industry and agriculture have been the mainstay of the economy of the Newars. They are made up of social groups associated with hereditary professions that provide ritual and economic services. Merchants, craftsmen, artists, potters, weavers, dyers, farmers and other castes all played their part in creating a flourishing economic system. Elaborate cultural traditions which required the use of varied objects and services also fueled the economy. Towns and villages in the Kathmandu Valley specialized in producing particular products, and rich agriculture produced a surplus for export. For centuries, Newar merchants have handled trade between Tibet and India as well as exporting locally manufactured products to Tibet. Rice was another major export. Porters and pack mules transported merchandise over mountain tracks that formed the old trade routes. Since the 18th century, Newars have spread out across Nepal and established trading towns dotting the mid hills. They are known as jewelry makers and shopkeepers. Today, they are engaged in modern industry, business and service sectors. Castes and communities Newars forms an ethnolinguistic community distinct from all the other ethnic groups of Nepal. Newars are divided into various endogamous clans or groups on the basis of their ancient hereditary occupations, deriving its roots in the classic late-Vedic Varna model. Although first introduced in the time of the Licchavis, the present Newar caste system assumed its present shape during the medieval Malla period. *Artisan castes: \\"Ritually pure\\" occupational castes (Sat-Shudra): Balami (field workers and farmers), Bha/Karanjit (death ritual specialists), Chipā/Ranjitkar (dyers), Duhim/Putwar/Dali (carriers), Gathu/Mālākār/Mali (gardeners), Khusa/Tandukar (palanquin bearers/farmers), Pahari/Nagarkoti (farmers from Valley outskirts), Kau/Nakarmī (blacksmiths), Nau/Napit (barbers), Puñ/Chitrakar (painters), Sayami/Mānandhar (oilpressers), etc. *Shakya: Descendants of Lord Buddha, Buddhist temple priests and also traditionally goldsmiths. *Brahmin: The two main groups are: Rajopadhyaya (Dyabhāju Brāhman or Bājyé) who are purohits for Hindu Newars, and Maithil Brahmin (Jhā Bajé) who are temple priests of Kathmandu's various Hindu shrines. *Chyamé/Chamaha: Traditionally fishermen, sweepers. A Scheduled Caste. *Dhobi: Traditionally washermen. A Scheduled Caste. *Dyahla/Podé: Traditionally temple cleaners, fishermen, sweepers. A Scheduled Caste. *Gubhāju/Bajracharya: Buddhist purohits and temple priests of Kathmandu's various Buddhist shrines. *Jyapu: Traditionally farmers; majority of Newar population inside Kathmandu Valley. Also includes Suwāl, Basukala, etc. (Bhaktapur Hindu Jyapus), Kumhā/Prajapati (potterers and clay workers), Awalé (brickmakers), Sāpu (descendants of Gopāl dynasty), etc. *Jogi/Kapali (Newar caste): A caste associated as being descendants of the Kanphata Yogi sect. Also traditionally tailors, musicians. Previously, a Scheduled Caste. *Chathariya Srēṣṭha: Kshatriya aristocratic bloc which includes Malla descendants, their numerous Hindu courtier clans (Pradhan, Pradhananga, Maskay, Hada, Amātya, Mathema, etc.) and Kshatriya-status specialists like Joshi (astrologers), Vaidya (Ayurvedic practitioners), Rajbhandārī (treasurers), Karmāchārya (Tantric priests), Kayastha (scribes), among others. *Kulu/Dom: Traditionally leather workers. A Scheduled Caste. *Nayé/Khadgi/Shahi: Traditionally butchers and musicians. Previously a Scheduled Caste. *Panchthariya Srēṣṭha: Chief Hindu trader and merchant group including Shrestha (administrators and traders). *Rajkarnikar or Halwai: Traditional confectioners and sweetmakers. Kathmandu Halwais are Buddhist, whereas Lalitpur Halwais are Hindu. *Shilpakar: Wood carvers. *Tamrakar: Trader and merchant group from Lalitpur; traditionally involved as coppersmiths. *Urāya/Udās: Chief Buddhist trader, merchant and artisan group including Tuladhar and Bania (merchants), Kansakar (bronzesmiths), Sthapit, Kasthakar (architects/carpenters), etc.  Religion  Pashupatinath. Statue of Vairochana Buddha on the Swayambhu Stupa. Buddhist deity Manjusri {{Main Newar Buddhism Newar Hinduism According to the 2011 Nepal Census, 87.38% of the Newars were Hindu and 10.74% were Buddhist. Out of the three main cities of the Kathmandu Valley which are historically Newar, the city of Patan is the most Buddhist containing the four stupas built by Indian emperor Ashoka. Bhaktapur is primarily Hindu, while Kathmandu is a mix of both. Generally, both Hindu and Buddhist deities are worshiped and festivals are celebrated by both religious groups. However, for ritual activities, Hindu and Buddhist Newars have their own priests (Rajopadhyaya Brahmins for Hindus and Vajracharyas for Buddhists) and varying amounts of cultural differences. Religiously, the Newars can be classified as both Hindu and Buddhist. The major cults are Vajrayana Buddhism and Tantric Hinduism. The former is referred to as Buddhamarga, the latter as Sivamarga. Both creeds have been established since antiquity in the valley. Both Buddhamargi and Sivamargi Newars are Tantricists, Within the Newar community, many different esoteric Tantric cults of Buddhist, Shaiva, and Vaishnava denominationd are practiced. In this regard, cults of the Mother Goddesses and their consorts, the Bhairavas, are particularly important. The most important shrines in the Valley are Swayambhunath (Buddhist) and Pashupatinath (Hindu). Different castes worship different deities at different occasions, and more or less intensively. Only the higher echelons in the caste system claim to be exclusively Buddhist or Hindu. The Vajracharyas, Buddhist priests, will adamantly maintain that they are Buddhists, and so will the Bare (Shakya) and the Uray (Tuladhars, et al.), whereas, the Dyabhāju Brāhman, the Jha Brāhman, and the dominant Shresthas will maintain that they are Hindus. Further down in the caste hierarchy no distinction is made between Buddhists and Hindus. Hindu and Buddhist alike always worship Ganesh first in every ritual, and every locality has its local Ganesh shrine (Ganesh Than).At the Indo-Tibetan Interface http://web.comhem.se/~u18515267/CHAPTERII.htm#_ftn49 Although Newar Buddhism (Vajrayana) had been traditionally practiced in the Kathmandu Valley, Theravada Buddhism made a comeback in Nepal in the 1920s and now is a common form of Buddhism among Buddhamargi Newars. Page 7. Language \\"Nepal Bhasa\\" is classified as among the Sino-Tibetan languages but it has greatly derived much of its grammar, words and lexicon from the influences of southern Indo- Aryan languages like Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Maithili. Newars are bound together by a common language and culture. Volume 8, Number 1 and 2, Page 18. Their common language is Nepal Bhasa or the linguistic progenitor of that language. Nepal Bhasa is the term recognised by the government. Nepal Bhasa already existed as a spoken language during the Licchavi period and is believed to have developed from the language spoken in Nepal during the Kirati period.Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Pages 19–20. Inscriptions in Nepal Bhasa emerged from the 12th century, the palm-leaf manuscript from Uku Bahah being the first example. Pages 15–25. Nepal Bhasa developed from the 14th to the late 18th centuries as the court and state language.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 3. It was used universally in stone and copper inscriptions, sacred manuscripts, official documents, journals, title deeds, correspondence and creative writing. In 2011, there were approximately 846,000 native speakers of Nepal Bhasa. Page 48. Many Newar communities within Nepal also speak their own dialects of Nepal Bhasa, such as the Dolakha Newar Language.Genetti, Carol (2007). A Grammar or Dolakha Newar. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co. . Page 11. Nepal Bhasa is of Tibeto-Burman origin but has been heavily influenced by Indo-Aryan languages like Sanskrit, Pali, Bengali and Maithili. Scripts Nepal Bhasa script is a group of scripts that developed from the Brahmi script and are used primarily to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit. Among the different scripts, Ranjana, Bhujinmol, and Prachalit are the most common. Nepal script is also known as Nepal Lipi and Nepal Akhala.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 2. Nepal Bhasa scripts appeared in the 10th century. For a thousand years, it was used on stone and copper plate inscriptions, coins (Nepalese mohar), palm-leaf documents and Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts. Devanagari began to be used to write Nepal Bhasa in the beginning of the 20th century, and Nepal script has limited usage today.Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Pages 14 and 306.  Literature  Nepal Bhasa is one of the five languages in the Sino-Tibetan family with an ancient literary tradition. Literature in Nepal Bhasa began as translation and commentary in prose in the 14th century AD. The earliest known document in Nepal Bhasa is called \\"The Palmleaf from Uku Bahal\\" which dates from 1114 AD during the Thakuri period. Pages 15–25. Classical Nepal Bhasa literature is represented by all the three major genres—prose, poetry, and drama. Most of the writings consist of prose including chronicles, popular stories and scientific manuals. Poetry consists of love songs, ballads, work songs, and religious poetry. The earliest poems date from the 1570s. Epic poetry describing historical events and tragedies are very popular. The ballads Sitala Maju, about the expulsion of children from Kathmandu, Silu, about an ill-fated pilgrimage to Gosaikunda, and Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni, about a luckless Tibet trader, are sung as seasonal songs. The dramas are based on stories from the epics, and almost all of them were written during the 17th and 18th centuries. Nepal Bhasa literature flourished for five centuries until 1850.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 1. Since then, it suffered a period of decline due to political oppression. The period 1909–1941 is known as the Nepal Bhasa renaissance period when writers defied official censure and braved imprisonment to create literary works. Modern Nepal Bhasa literature began in the 1940s with the emergence of new genres like short stories, poems, essays, novels and plays.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 4. Politics =Newa Autonomous State= Newa Autonomous State is a proposed federal state of Nepal which establishes the historical native homeland of Newa people as a federal state. Newars assert Newa Autonomous State Himalayan Times Nepal govt urged to give autonomy to Newa state The Daily Star The historical territories of Newars is called Nepal Mandala. The Newa Autonomous State mandates to reconstruct the district division and create an autonomous Newa province. It includes historically Newa residing settlements and Newa dominant zones of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Newa towns of Dolakha, Newa settlements of Nuwakot, Newa settlements of Makwanpur, Newa settlements of Ramechhap, Newa settlements of Sindupalchok, Newa settlements of Kavre West. Restructure Districts of Nepal Newars assert Newa Autonomous State The Himalayan Times The need of Newa Autonomous State The demand of Newa Autonomous State also means to re-structure the districts. The territory of the State would consist every historical Newa settlement, spread East to Dapcha, Panauti, Dhulikhel, etc.; spread north to Tibet and the Newa towns of Dolakha; the Bajrabarahi, Kulekhani, Tistung and Chitlang of Makawanpur district; Nuwakot district up to the Trishuli(Sangu Khusi); Villages like Tauthali and other Newa villages of Sindupalchok.  Dance  The Nyetamaru Ajima masked dance is performed at Nyeta in Kathmandu in April. =Masked dance= The Newar dance consists of sacred masked dance,Prajapati, Subhash Ram (ed.) (2006) The Masked Dances of Nepal Mandal. Thimi: Madhyapur Art Council. . religious dance without the use of masks known as Dyah Pyakhan, dance performed as part of a ritual and meditation practice known as Chachaa Pyakhan () (Charya Nritya in Sanskrit) and folk dance. There are also masked dance dramas known as Daboo Pyakhan which enact religious stories to the accompaniment of music. = Dhime dance = The dance done in the tune of Dhime are Dhime dance.  Music  Traditional Newa music consists of sacred music, devotional songs, seasonal songs, ballads and folk songs.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 9. One of the most well-known seasonal songs is Sitala Maju. The ballad describes the expulsion of children from Kathmandu in the early 19th century. Another seasonal song Silu is about a pilgrimage to Gosaikunda that went wrong. Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni is a tragedy song about a newly married couple. The ballad Rajamati about unlucky lovers is widely popular. In 1908, maestro Seturam Shrestha made the first recording of the song on gramophone disc in Kolkata. Common percussion instruments consist of the dhimay,Wegner, Gert-Matthias (1986). The Dhimaybaja of Bhaktapur: Studies in Newar Drumming I. Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner. Nepal Research Center Publications No. 12. . khin, naykhin and dhaa. Wind instruments include the bansuri (flute), payntah (long trumpet) and mwahali (short trumpet), chhusya, bhusya, taa (cymbals), and gongs are other popular instruments. String instruments are very rare. Newa people call their music Dhime Baja. The musical style and musical instruments are still in use today. Musical bands accompany religious processions in which an idol of a deity is placed in a chariot or portable shrine and taken around the city. Devotional songs are known as bhajan may be sung daily in community houses. Hymn societies like Gyanmala Bhajan Khala hold regular recitals. Dapa songs are sung during hymn singing seasons at Temple squares and sacred courtyards. Gunla Bajan musical bands parade through the streets during Gunla, the 10th month of the Nepal Sambat calendar which is a holy month for Newar Buddhists. Musical performances start with an overture which is a salutation to the gods. Seasonal songs and ballads are associated with particular seasons and festivals. Music is also played during wedding processions, life-cycle ceremonies and funeral processions.Grandin, Ingemar (1989).

The Newars are the creators of most examples of art and architecture in Nepal. Traditional Newar art is basically religious art. Newar devotional paubha painting, sculpture and metal craftsmanship are world-renowned for their exquisite beauty. Page 105. The earliest dated paubha discovered so far is Vasudhara Mandala which was painted in 1365 AD (Nepal Sambat 485). The murals on the walls of two 15th-century monasteries in the former kingdom of Mustang in the Nepal Himalaya provide illustrations of Newar works outside the Kathmandu Valley. Stone sculpture, wood carving, repoussé art and metal statues of Buddhist and Hindu deities made by the lost-wax casting process are specimens of Newar artistry.Bangdel, Lain S. (1989) Stolen Images of Nepal. Kathmandu: Royal Nepal Academy. Page 22. The Peacock Window of Bhaktapur and Desay Madu Jhya of Kathmandu are known for their wood carving. Building elements like the carved Newar window, roof struts on temples and the tympanum of temples and shrine houses exhibit traditional creativity. From as early as the seventh century, visitors have noted the skill of Newar artists and craftsmen who left their influence on the art of Tibet and China. Newars introduced the lost-wax technique into Bhutan and they were commissioned to paint murals on the walls of monasteries there.Pommaret, Françoise (1994) Bhutan. Hong Kong: Twin Age. . Page 80. Sandpainting of mandala made during festivals and death rituals is another specialty of Newar art. Besides exhibiting a high level of skill in the traditional religious art, Newar artists have been at the forefront of introducing Western art styles in Nepal. Raj Man Singh Chitrakar (1797-1865) is credited with starting watercolor painting in the country. Bhaju Man Chitrakar (1817–1874), Tej Bahadur Chitrakar (1898-1971) and Chandra Man Singh Maskey were other pioneer artists who introduced modern style paintings incorporating concepts of lighting and perspective. =Traditional painting= * Paubhā * Thanka  Architecture  Kathmandu Durbar Square. Miaoying Temple, an example of Newar architecture in China There are seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites and 2,500 temples and shrines in the Kathmandu Valley that illustrate the skill and aesthetic sense of Newar artisans. Fine brickwork and woodcarving are the marks of Newar architecture. Residential houses, monastic courtyards known as baha and bahi, rest houses, temples, stupas, priest houses and palaces are the various architectural structures found in the valley. Most of the chief monuments are located in the Durbar Squares of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, the old royal palace complexes built between the 12th and 18th centuries. Newa architecture consists of the pagoda, stupa, shikhara, chaitya and other styles. The valley's trademark is the multiple-roofed pagoda which may have originated in this area and spread to India, China, Indochina and Japan. Pages 105–106.Hutt, Michael et al. (1994) Nepal: A Guide to the Art and Architecture of the Kathmandu Valley. Kiscadale Publications. . Page 50. The most famous artisan who influenced stylistic developments in China and Tibet was Arniko, a Newar youth who traveled to the court of Kublai Khan in the 13th century AD. He is known for building the white stupa at the Miaoying Temple in Beijing.  Settlements  Durbar squares, temple squares, sacred courtyards, stupas, open-air shrines, dance platforms, sunken water fountains, public rest houses, bazaars, multistoried houses with elaborately carved windows and compact streets are the characteristics of traditional planning. Besides the historical cities of Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Madhyapur Thimi, Chovar, Bungamati, Thankot and Kirtipur, small towns with a similar artistic heritage dot the Kathmandu Valley where almost half of the Newar population lives. Pages 92–97. Outside the valley, historical Newar settlements include Nuwakot, Page 194. Nala, Banepa, Dhulikhel, Panauti, Dolakha, Chitlang and Bhimphedi. Chapter VI. The Newars of Kathmandu founded Pokhara in 1752 at the invitation of the rulers of Kaski. Over the last two centuries, Newars have fanned out of the Kathmandu Valley and established trade centers and settled in various parts of Nepal. Bandipur, Baglung, Silgadhi and Tansen in west Nepal and Chainpur and Bhojpur in east Nepal contain large Newar populations. Outside Nepal, many Newars have settled in Darjeeling and KalimpongHilker, D. S. Kansakar (2005) Syamukapu: The Lhasa Newars of Kalimpong and Kathmandu. Kathmandu: Vajra Publications. . in West Bengal, Assam, Manipur and Sikkim, India. Newars have also settled in Bhutan. Colonies of expatriate Newar merchants and artisans existed in Lhasa, Shigatse and Gyantse in Tibet till the mid-1960s when the traditional trade came to an end after the Sino-Indian War.Tuladhar, Kamal Ratna (2011) Caravan to Lhasa: A Merchant of Kathmandu in Traditional Tibet. Kathmandu: Lijala & Tisa. . Page 112. In recent times, Newars have moved to different parts of Asia, Europe and America. Festivals Chariot pulled in procession during Biska Jatra in Bhaktapur. Newar religious culture is rich in ceremony and is marked by frequent festivals throughout the year.Anderson, Mary M. (1971) The Festivals of Nepal. Allen and Unwin. . Many festivals are tied to Hindu and Buddhist holidays and the harvest cycle. Street celebrations include pageants, jatras or processions in which a car or portable shrine is paraded through the streets and sacred masked dances. Other festivals are marked by family feasts and worship. The celebrations are held according to the lunar calendar, so the dates are changeable. Mohani (Dasain) is one of the greatest annual celebrations which is observed for several days with feasts, religious services, and processions. During Swanti (Tihar), Newars celebrate New Year's Day of Nepal Sambat by doing Mha Puja, a ritual in which a mandala is worshipped, that purifies and strengthens one spiritually for the coming year. Similarly, Bhai Tika is also done during Swanti. It is a ritual observed to worship and respect a woman's brothers, with or without blood relation. Another major festival is Sā Pāru when people who have lost a family member in the past year dress up as cows and saints, and parade through town, following a specific route. In some cases, a real cow may also be a part of the parade. People give such participants money, food and other gifts as a donation. Usually, children are the participants of the parade. In Kathmandu, the biggest street festival is Yenya (Indra Jatra) when three cars bearing the living goddess Kumari and two other child gods are pulled through the streets and masked dance performances are held. The two godchildren are Ganesh and Bhairav. Another major celebration is Pahan Charhe when portable shrines bearing images of mother goddesses are paraded through Kathmandu. During the festival of Jana Baha Dyah Jatra, a temple car with an image of Karunamaya is drawn through central Kathmandu for three days. A similar procession is held in Lalitpur known as Bunga Dyah Jatra which continues for a month and climaxes with Bhoto Jatra, the display of the sacred vest. The biggest outdoor celebration in Bhaktapur is Biska Jatra (Bisket Jatra) which is marked by chariot processions and lasts for nine days. Sithi Nakha is another big festival when worship is offered and natural water sources are cleaned. Page 14. In addition, all Newar towns and villages have their particular festival which is celebrated by holding a chariot or palanquin procession. Paanch Chare is one of the many occasions or festivals celebrated by the Newa community, natives from Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. This is celebrated on the Chaturdasi (Pisach Chaturdashi) day according to new lunar calendar on the month of Chaitra. Clothing A Newar woman wearing parsi, circa 1860-1900 Western wear is the norm as in urban areas in the rest of the country. Traditionally men wear tapuli (cap), long shirt (tapālan) and trousers (suruwā), also called Daura-Suruwal. Woman wear cheeparsi (sari) and gaa (long length shawl) while younger girls wear ankle-length gowns (bhāntānlan). Ritual dresses consist of pleated gowns, coats and a variety of headresses. Jyapu women have a distinctive sari called Hāku Patāsi which is a black sari with distinctive red border. Jyapu men also have a distinctive version of the tapālan suruwā. Similarly, a shawl (gā) is worn by men and women. Traditionally, Newar women wear a shoe made out of red cloth, Kapa lakaan. It is decorated with glitters and colorful beads (potya). One of the major parts of Newar dress ups is bracelets (chūra) and mala(necklaces). Cuisine Meals can be classified into three main categories: the daily meal, the afternoon snack and festival food. The daily meal consists of boiled rice, lentil soup, vegetable curry and relish. Meat is also served. The snack generally consists of rice flakes, roasted and curried soybeans, curried potato and roasted meat mixed with spices. Food is also an important part of the ritual and religious life of the Newars, and the dishes served during festivals and feasts have symbolic significance.

Different sets of ritual dishes are placed in a circle around the staple Bawji (rice flakes or Flattened) to represent and honour different sets of deities depending on the festival or life-cycle ceremony.Tuladhar, Tara Devi (2011). Thaybhu: A Description of Feast Materials. Kathmandu: Chhusingsyar. . Kwāti (क्वाति soup of different beans), kachilā (कचिला spiced minced meat), chhoyalā (छोयला water buffalo meat marinated in spices and grilled over the flames of dried wheat stalks), pukālā (पुकाला fried meat), wo (वः lentil cake), paun kwā (पाउँक्वा sour soup), swan pukā (स्वँपुका stuffed lungs), syen (स्येँ fried liver), mye (म्ये boiled and fried tongue), sapu mhichā (सःपू म्हिचा leaf tripe stuffed with bone marrow), sanyā khunā (सन्या खुना jellied fish soup) and takhā (तःखा jellied meat) are some of the popular festival foods. Dessert consists of dhau (धौ yogurt), sisābusā (सिसाबुसा fruits) and mari (मरि sweets). Thwon (थ्वँ rice beer) and aylā (अयला local alcohol) are the common alcoholic liquors that Newars make at home. Traditionally, at meals, festivals and gatherings, Newars sit on long mats in rows. Typically, the sitting arrangement is hierarchical with the eldest sitting at the top and the youngest at the end. Newar cuisine makes use of mustard oil and a host of spices such as cumin, sesame seeds, turmeric, garlic, ginger, mint, bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, chilli and mustard seeds. Food is served in laptya (लप्त्य plates made of special leaves, held together by sticks). Similarly, any soups are served in botā (बोटा bowls made of leaves). Liquors are served in Salinchā (सलिंचाः bowls made of clay) and Kholchā (खोल्चाः small metal bowls). Newar people are much innovative in terms of cuisine. They have a tradition to prepare various foods according to the festivals. Some of the popular cuisines that are prepared with the festivals are: One of the popular sweet, \\"Yomari\\" Life-cycle ceremonies Mandala made on the third day after death as part of death rituals among Buddhist Newars Elaborate ceremonies chronicle the life cycle of a Newar from birth till death. Newars consider life-cycle rituals as a preparation for death and the life after it. Hindus and Buddhists alike perform the \\"Sorha Sanskaar Karma\\" or the 16 sacred rites of passage, unavoidable in a Hindu person's life. The 16 rites have been shortened to 10 and called \\"10 Karma Sanskar\\" (). These include important events of a person's life like \\"Jatakarma\\" () (Childbirth), \\"Namakaran\\" () (Naming the child), \\"Annapraasan\\" () (First rice feeding ceremony), \\"Chudakarma\\" or \\"Kaeta Puja\\" (first hair shaving and loin cloth ceremony), \\"Vivaaha\\" () (Wedding), among others. * Chudakarma ceremony and (Bare Chuyegu/Acharyabhisheka or Bratabandha/Upanayana) Once such important rite of passage ceremony among the male Newars is performing the loin-cloth and head-shaving ceremony called Chudākarma () followed by the Bratabandha or Kaeta Puja () which is traditionally performed for boys aged five to thirteen according to the religious affiliation Newars identify with. In this ceremony, Buddhist Newars - Gubhāju-Baré (Bajracharya-Shakya), Urāy, Jyapu and few artisan castes like Chitrakār - perform their Pravrajyā () ceremony by mimicking Gautama Buddha's ascetic and medicant lifestyle and the steps to attain monkhood and nirvana where the boy stays in a Buddhist monastery, Vihara, for three days, living the life of a monk and abandoning all material pleasures. On the fourth day, he disrobes and returns to his family and henceforth becomes a householder Buddhist for the rest of his life. The Buddhist priestly clan Gubhāju-Baré (Bajracharya and Shakya) go through an additional initiation ceremony called Bare Chuyegu (becoming a Baré) while Bajracharya boys are further required to go through Acharyabhisheka () which is a Tantric initiation rite that qualifies a Bajracharya to perform as a purohita. Hindu Newars perform the male initiation ceremony called Kaeta Puja as a ritual observance of the brahmachārya - the first stage in the traditional four stages of life. During the ritual, the young boy renounces family and lineage for the celibate religious life. His head is fully shaved except a tuft in the top, he must don yellow/orange robes of the mendicant, he must beg rice from his relatives and prepare to wander out into the world. Having this symbolically fulfilled the ascetic ideal, he can be called back by his family to assume the life of a householder and his eventual duty as a husband and a father. Twice-born (Brahmin and Kshatriya) Newars - Rajopādhyāyas and Chatharīyas - additionally perform the Upanayana initiation where the boy receives his sacred thread () and the secret Vedic mantras - RV.3.62.10 (Gāyatrī mantra) for Brahmins and RV.1.35.2 (Shiva mantra) for Chatharīyas. The boy is then fully inducted into his caste status as a Dvija with the obligation to observe henceforth all commensal rules and other caste obligations(). *Macha Janku This is the rice feeding ceremony, \\"Annapraasan\\" (). It is performed at the age of six or eight months for boys and at the age of five or seven months for girls. *Ihi ceremony For a female child, Ihi (Ehee)() short for Ihipaa (Eheepā)() (Marriage) is performed between the ages of five to nine. It is a ceremony in which pre-adolescent girls are \\"married\\" to the bael fruit (wood apple), which is a symbol of the god Vishnu. It is believed that if the girl's husband dies later in her life, she is not considered a widow because she is married to Vishnu, and so already has a husband that is believed to be still alive. *Bahra Girls have yet another ceremonial ritual called Bahra Chuyegu() when a girl approaches puberty. This is done in her odd number year like 7,9 or 11 before mensuration. She is kept in a room for 12 days hidden and is ceremonially married to the sun god Surya. *Jankwa Jankwa or Janku is an old-age ceremony which is conducted when a person reaches the age of 77 years, seven months, seven days, seven hours, seven minutes, seven-quarter. Three further Janku ceremonies are performed at similar auspicious milestones at age 83, 88 and 99. The first Janwa is called \\"Bhimratharohan\\", the second \\"Chandraratharohan\\", the third \\"Devaratharohan\\", and the fourth \\"Divyaratharohan\\". After the second Jankwa, the person is accorded deified status. * Vivaaha (Wedding) The next ceremony common to both boys and girls is marriage and the rituals performed are similar to most normal Hindui marriages. The Newar custom, similar to that of Hindus, is that the bride almost always leaves home at marriage and moves into her husband's home and adopts her husband's family name as her own. Cross-cousin and parallel-cousin marriage is forbidden. Marriage is usually arranged by parents who use a gobetween(lamee). Marriage by elopement is popular in some peripheral villages. * The Sagan ceremony where auspicious food items are presented is an important part of life-cycle rituals. * All Newars, except the Laakumi and Jogi caste, cremate their dead. The Jogis bury their dead. As part of the funeral, offerings are made to the spirit of the deceased, the crow and the dog. The crow and the dog represent ancestors and the god of death. Subsequently, offerings and rituals are conducted four, seven, eight, 13 and 45 days following death and monthly for a year and then annually. * Buddhist Newars also make a mandala (sand painting) depicting the Buddha on the third day after death which is preserved for four days. Newa Games The games which had been played by prasanga people from their ancient time can be classified as Newa games. Kana kana pichha (Blindfold game), Piyah (a game played with stone by pushing stone within the marks drawn in the ground), Gatti ( another game played with stone by hand), pasa are some games played by Newar people since ancient time.

Paper lanterns come in various shapes and sizes, as well as various methods of construction. In their simplest form, they are simply a paper bag with a candle placed inside, although more complicated lanterns consist of a collapsible bamboo or metal frame of hoops covered with tough paper. Sometimes, other lanterns can be made out of colored silk (usually red) or vinyl. Silk lanterns are also collapsible with a metal expander and are decorated with Chinese characters and/or designs. The vinyl lanterns are more durable; they can resist rain, sunlight, and wind. Paper lanterns do not last very long, they soon break, and silk lanterns last longer. The gold paper on them will soon fade away to a pale white, and the red silk will become a mix between pink and red.  History  There does not appear to be any authoritative publication on the history or origin of the paper lantern available to the lay researcher. In fact, until the publication of an updated scholarship in 2016, the most recent academic quality research on the more fundamental subject of the history of paper was a volume in an edited series on Chinese technology and invention first published in 1949. This volume, however, copyrighted the inevitable conclusions derived from recent discoveries that fundamentally changed the inherited story of paper, reordering our understanding of how and why this material came to be a fundamental medium for the transmission and understanding of human society. Paper, it appears, was used for a wide variety of decorative and commercial functions (including the manufacture of lanterns) for more than two hundred years before the famous innovator Cai Lun, previously revered as the inventor of paper in Chinese history, popularized its use as a medium for the recording of general information. While writing appears on the oldest known samples of paper, as labeling, advertising and prayer, it appears that Cai Lun’s contribution to the story of paper is in generalizing this use for all types of knowledge and records. It is, however, in these original uses of paper as medium for advertisement and prayer that the Chinese paper lantern first found its light. Before books were ever written on paper (wood or bamboo blocks were the preferred material for general knowledge and record-keeping at the time), the hopes and dreams of Chinese Buddhists were signified in the light of paper lanterns, often decorated with the stylized characters which communicated those thoughts to those who could not bear audial witness to their formation. To these Buddhist monks of the early Han Dynasty, roughly one hundred and fifty years before the epoch defining deaths of Caesar Augustus and Jesus of Nazareth, the glow of candlelight within the paper walls of the lantern became a miniature version of the bonfires, lit with the walls of their fortress abbeys on ceremonial occasions, which, in turn, symbolized the light of their pious thoughts, emanating outward to illuminate the ignorance of the unenlightened world. As they studied and recorded and analyzed the world around them, protected from the harsh opinions of the wild world by the walls of their fortresses, so did the candle consume its fuel, sheltered from the winds while projecting its light to the world beyond. Though the legend became confused and convoluted as Chinese historians came to settle on a narrative of Cai Lun as inventor and not simply innovator of paper technology, it appears that an early Emperor of the Eastern Han Dynasty celebrated the establishment of a new era in his reign, or perhaps simply the return of an embassy to India, by adopting the sacred symbol of the Buddhist lantern for his secular celebration, commanding that the lanterns be burned across the capital city, Luoyang. When the necessity of keeping faith with the representation of Cai Lun as inventor can be ignored, this Emperor is said to have been Ming-ti (Han Mingdi), who welcomed two Buddhist monks to his court alongside his returning ambassadors in the year 67 of the Common Era. Others, however, attribute this adaptation to the earlier, unified Han Dynasty Emperor Wu (Han Wudi), who is known for establishing these new eras in his reign every few years and also sent embassies to India, though history, Chinese or Academic, does not record the return of these efforts, except in the possibility of connection to the legend of secular lantern lighting. Over the two thousand years that have transpired since, the lighting of paper lanterns has become a traditional part of Chinese celebrations of all kinds and has been passed to neighboring cultures from Japan to Southeast Asia. In many places across Eastern Asia, this tradition is most developed in a festival devoted especially to the launch of paper lanterns into the air (as primitive hot air ‘balloons’) or upon a body of water, with their original prayerful or aspirational purpose, that of carrying painted prayers or, more rarely, as purely symbolic manifestations of those wishes. More commonly, however, paper lanterns serve their other early purpose, that of advertisement as the earliest form of lighted signage. While this purpose followed closely the adaptation from religious to secular celebration, it is today, the most common and visible use of these beautiful and graceful objects in everyday life around the world, particularly in cities in Eastern Asia and in ‘Chinatown’ neighborhoods worldwide, where they are commonly found as part of the decorative marketing of restaurants and shops of every sort. In East, Southeast and South Asian culture Often associated with festivals, paper lanterns are common in China (Palace lantern), Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Singapore and Malaysia and, similarly, in Chinatowns, where they are often hung outside of businesses to attract attention. In Japan the traditional styles include bonbori and chōchin and there is a special style of lettering called chōchin moji used to write on them. Airborne paper lanterns are called sky lanterns, and are often released into the night sky for aesthetic effect at lantern festivals. In China, paper lanterns can be classified into 5 distinct classes; the Baby's Bottom is the miniature class, often used in modern times with Christmas lights. The second class is the Rolling Paper, the tall, cylindrical lanterns often associated with restaurants and bars. The third class is the Tomato Light also known as Big Red; the classic round mid-size lantern. The fourth class is the Crystal Magic; the variously-shaped geometric lamps constructed of many square and triangular panes. The last is known as Buddha's Gastronomy; the large and extra large lanterns used to decorate temples and for show at festivals. Also, there are the traditional Chinese lanterns, primarily red but also in other colours, that can be round or capsule-shaped, usually seen in stores, at temples, or during festivals. The color red (fire) traditionally symbolizes good fortune and joy.

During the Festa della Rificolona held in Florence, Italy, children carry colourful paper lanterns through the streets of the city. In Germany, Austria, Switzerland and other German-speaking and some Dutch-speaking parts of Europe there is a tradition of the Sankt-Martins-Umzug (Sint-Maarten in Dutch), during which children parade with paper lanterns that are traditionally handmade.
