He was the founder of Decorah Posten, a Norwegian language newspaper. Background Brynild Anundsen was born at Skien in Telemark, Norway. He was the son of Anund Brynildsen Br√¶kkejord (1817‚Äì1903) and Maren Amundsdatter Berberg (1812‚Äì1883). Anundsen immigrated to the United States during 1864 settling first into La Crosse, Wisconsin. He subsequently served as a private in the Union Army during the American Civil War between 1864 and 1865.B. Anundsen, Biographical (Past and Present of Winneshiek County, Iowa.

Service started with two British-manufactured Vickers Viscount four engine turboprop airliners. Atlantic Gulf was one of very few airlines in the U.S. to operate the Viscount in scheduled passenger service (Continental Airlines and United Airlines operated Viscounts during the 1960s as did Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines). The airline began with service from Miami to St. Petersburg, Florida. By early 1984, the airlines had added Convair 580 turboprops to the fleet and was operating Miami (MIA) - St. Petersburg (PIE) - Atlanta (ATL) service.http://www.departedflights.com, early 1984 Atlantic Gulf Airlines route map & flight schedules The fleet grew to three Convair 580s and cities such as Tallahassee and Fort Lauderdale were added to the route system. Atlantic Gulf Convair CV-580 at Tucson Airport, 1987 Chapter Eleven The St. Petersburg (PIE) market did not work out for Atlantic Gulf and the airline went into Chapter Eleven bankruptcy proceedings. The Convair 580 turboprop planes were returned to their lessors while the airline reorganized. In an unheard of move by a small airline in the 1980s, Atlantic Gulf continued to operate using a British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jet it acquired through a merger with the also bankrupt Air Illinois. The airline's headquarters was also moved from St. Petersburg to Tallahassee (TLH).Book: Sushine Skies by David P. Henderson Downfall The airline had acquired two former Cascade Airways BAC One-Eleven twin jets and began scheduled service from Tallahassee to Miami/Fort Lauderdale and Atlanta. This schedule was pared back when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the two former Cascade jets claiming that the \\"Stage One\\" noise waivers obtained from Cascade did not transfer to Atlantic Gulf. The FAA also threatened Atlantic Gulf with heavy fines because the Cascade jets were BAC One-Eleven series 400 series planes. The original Air Illinois plane and subsequent training program were for the less powerful and slightly different BAC One-Eleven series 200 series aircraft. This, combined with a heavy D check due on one of the Cascade jets, left Atlantic Gulf with one serviceable BAC One-Eleven jet for its entire system.1994 Interview with former Atlantic Gulf president of maintenance In addition, Piedmont Airlines had started its well equipped and well funded dedicated Florida Shuttle using comparable Fokker F28 Fellowship twinjets. Atlantic Gulf responded to this by initiating new international routes from Miami to the Caribbean. The main route was from Atlanta to Tallahassee to Miami to Grand Turk with Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands also being served.http://www.departedflights.com, Atlantic Gulf Airlines route maps Other island destinations were added but the entire system had become too dependent on one airplane. To add more trouble to Atlantic Gulf's woes, the BAC One-Eleven that was getting a heavy check had this work halted when an unexpected high priority contract for a foreign carrier unexpectedly popped up. The battle over the \\"Stage One\\" noise waivers and the training issues had still not been resolved with the FAA. The remaining BAC One-Eleven airframe proved stalwart and did all that was asked of it but it was flying over 400 hours a month.1994 Interview with former Atlantic Gulf president Taking off from a newly resurfaced runway in Miami, a piece of debris (a roughly 2 inch piece of rebar) was thrown into an engine. The takeoff was rejected without incident but the jet was grounded. Only three suitable engines were located but none were available for lease. The different and more powerful engines of the 400 series BAC One-Eleven jets were not compatible. With crushing competition inside Florida, a grounded fleet and dwindling cash resources the airlines ceased operations in 1986.1994 Interview with former Atlantic Gulf president of maintenance and general counsel Transfer of noise waivers The airline did have one Pyrrhic victory. Years after it folded, in a case that went before the U.S. Supreme Court, Atlantic Gulf won their lawsuit against the FAA over the transfer of Cascade Airways \\"Stage One\\" noise waivers.1994 Interview with former Atlantic Gulf general counsel Destinations Destination information is taken from Atlantic Gulf system timetables as well as from Official Airline Guide (OAG) flight schedules. * Atlanta, GA (ATL) * Grand Turk, Turks & Caicos Islands (GDT) * Miami, FL (MIA) * Providenciales, Turks & Caicos Islands (PLS) * Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic (POP) * St. Petersburg, FL (PIE) * Tallahassee, FL (TLH) Fleet * British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven series 200 (acquired from Air Illinois) * British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven series 400 (acquired from Cascade Airways) * 3 Convair 580 * 2 Vickers Viscount  See also  * List of defunct airlines of the United States References External links *http://www.sunshineskies.com/atlanticgulf.html *http://www.crazedfanboy.com/npcr/laflapcr218.html *http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/zy1.htm *http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?airlinesearch=Atlantic+Gulf+Airlines Category:Defunct regional airlines of the United States Category:Airlines established in 1983 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1986 ","title":"Atlantic Gulf Airlines"},{"id":"24757664","text":"If You're Not Dead, Play is a 2005 PBS rock music documentary, a Western Reserve Public Media/ PBS production and the sequel of It's Everything, And Then It's Gone.

The first county existed from the mid-ninth to the mid-eleventh centuries as a vassalage of the Kingdom of Asturias and later the Kingdoms of Galicia and Le√≥n, before being abolished as a result of rebellion. A larger entity under the same name was then reestablished in the late 11th century and subsequently elevated by its count in the mid-12th century into an independent Kingdom of Portugal. First county The history of the county of Portugal is traditionally dated from the reconquest of Portus Cale (Porto) by V√≠mara Peres in 868. He was named a count and given control of the frontier region between the Limia and Douro rivers by Alfonso III of Asturias. South of the Douro, another border county would be formed decades later when what would become the County of Coimbra was conquered from the Moors by Hermenegildo Guterres. This moved the frontier away from the southern bounds of the county of Portugal, but it was still subject to repeated campaigns from the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. The recapture of Coimbra by Almanzor in 987 again placed the County of Portugal on the southern frontier of the Leonese state for most of the rest of the first county's existence. The regions to its south were only again conquered in the reign of Ferdinand I of Le√≥n and Castile, with Lamego falling in 1057, Viseu in 1058 and finally Coimbra in 1064. The leaders of the first county of Portugal reached the height of their power in the late 10th century, when Count Gonzalo Men√©ndez may have used the title magnus dux portucalensium (\\"grand duke of Portugal\\") and his son Menendo used the title dux magnus (grand duke). It could have been this Count Gonzalo who assassinated Sancho I of Le√≥n after inviting the King to a banquet and offering him a poisoned apple.Abdurrahman Ali El-Hajji (1965), \\"Christian States in Northern Spain During the Umayyad Period (138‚Äì366 A.H./A.D. 755‚Äì976): The Borders of those States, their kings, Internal Relations; Its Influence on their Relations and Motives for their Diplomatic Relations with the Muslims,\\" Islamic Quarterly, 9(1/2), 51; Roger Collins (1983), Early Medieval Spain: Unity in Diversity, 400‚Äì1000 (Macmillan), 242. Not all historians, however, believe that Gonzalo Men√©ndez was responsible for the king's death and some attribute the regicide to a contemporary count named Gonzalo Mu√±oz. In the late 960s Gonzalo's lands were ravaged by Vikings, and in 968, he fell out with king Ramiro III over the latter's refusal to fight the raiders. His son Menendo had close relations with Ramiro's rival and successor, Bermudo II, being made the king's alf√©rez and tutor of his son, the future king Alfonso V. Following Alfonso's succession, Menendo would serve as regent for the boy king and marry him to one of Menendo's daughters. The county continued with varying degrees of autonomy within the Kingdom of Le√≥n and, during brief periods of division, the Kingdom of Galicia until 1071, when Count Nuno Mendes, desiring greater autonomy for Portugal, was defeated and killed in the Battle of Pedroso by King Garc√≠a II of Galicia, who then proclaimed himself the King of Galicia and Portugal, the first time a royal title was used in reference to Portugal. The independent county was abolished, its territories remaining within the crown of Galicia, which was in turn subsumed within the larger kingdoms of Garc√≠a's brothers, Sancho II and Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile. Second county The former Kingdom of Galicia, then including modern Portugal as far south as Coimbra, was given by Alfonso VI as a county to his son-in-law Raymond of Burgundy. However, concern for Raymond's growing power led Alfonso in 1096 to separate Portugal and Coimbra from Galicia and grant them to another son-in- law, Henry of Burgundy, wed to Alfonso VI's illegitimate daughter Theresa. Henry chose Braga as the base for this newly formed county, the Condado Portucalense, known at the time as Terra Portucalense or Prov√≠ncia Portucalense, which would last until Portugal achieved its independence, recognized by the Kingdom of Le√≥n in 1143. Its territory included much of the current Portuguese territory between the Minho River and the Tagus River. Count Henry continued the Reconquista in western Iberia and expanded his county's dominions. He was also involved in several intrigues inside the Leonese court together with his cousin Raymond and sister-in-law Urraca of Castile, in which he supported Raymond's ascension in return for promises of autonomy or independence for Portugal. In 1111 the Muslims conquered Santar√©m. When Count Henry died in 1112, the population of the County of Portugal, including the powerful families, favored independence. Henry's widow, Theresa, took the reins on behalf of her young son, and allied herself with Galician nobility in order to challenge her sister queen Urraca's dominance and briefly used the title Queen. However, she was defeated by Urraca in 1121 and forced to accept a position of feudal subservience to the Leonese state. Her own son, Afonso Henriques, took the reins of the government in 1128 after routing his mother's forces in the Battle of S√£o Mamede, near Guimar√£es. After this battle, he began to exhibit a seal with a cross and the word \\"Portugal\\". He continued to win battles, supported by the nobles of Entre-Douro-e-Minho, eventually triumphing in the Battle of Ourique in 1139, which led to his proclamation as King of Portugal by his troops. Nevertheless: It was finally in 1143 when his nominal overlord Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile recognized the de facto independence of Portugal in the Treaty of Zamora.

Plot Yumeiro P√¢tissi√®re: Fourteen-year-old Ichigo Amano (her name means strawberry) is clumsy and doesn't have any talent except for eating sweets (specifically cakes). When she stumbles upon a Sweets Festival, she meets Henri-sensei who acknowledges her ability of taste and invites her to transfer to St. Marie Academy to become a p√¢tissi√®re. Ichigo has trouble adjusting initially, but with the help of the 3 Sweets Princes (Makoto Kashino, Satsuki Hanabusa, and Sennosuke Andou) and the Sweets Spirits (Vanilla, Chocolate, Caramel, and Cafe), she gains the confidence and skill to work towards becoming a p√¢tissi√®re. Throughout the entire anime is Ichigo and the Sweet Princes trying to win the Grand Prix, which allowed them to go to Paris. Throughout the competition, Ichigo has a lot of character change and she grows little by little. She realizes many things and her skills are improving rapidly. Yumeiro P√¢tissi√®re Professional: Two years after studying in Paris, the sixteen-year- old Ichigo now returns to Japan as a professional p√¢tissi√®re. As soon as she returns, Ichigo finds Team Ichigo breaking up. The Sweets Princes, Hanabusa and Andou, take long absences from school to work for their dreams, leaving only Ichigo and Kashino. Kashino skipped a grade due to having top grades back at Paris. Soon a \\"new\\" Team Ichigo is formed by Henri-sensei for the project. The team includes Lemon Yamagishi, Johnny McBeal, Makoto Kashino, and Amano Ichigo. They are now working as professionals for the project and their dreams. In St. Marie Garden Characters Main characters ; : :Like other typical heroines of Shoujo manga, Ichigo is clumsy, naive, and innocent, but is also optimistic and lively. Her mother ignored her for many years because of her having no talent (compared to her younger sister Natsume, who is an aspiring pianist, and who generally excels at almost anything). Due to her incredible palate that allows her to immediately tell what ingredients are used in different sweets, and who made the ingredients, she is spotted by Henri Lucas during a \\"Sweets Festival\\". Following his suggestion she transfers to St.Marie Academy, in order to train to become a p√¢tissiere like her grandmother. Ichigo is also known for her huge appetite for cakes, she claims there is a second stomach specifically for sweets, and has won several cake eating contests in the past. As the story progresses, Ichigo improves her talent as a p√¢tissiere, and gains new friends and rivals along the way. She wins the hearts of almost everyone due her hard work and unwavering love for pastries of highest quality. Her dream is to create sweets that make people smile. She initially had an innocent crush on Henri Lucas because of his princely looks and kindness. However, as the series progresses, she falls in love with Kashino, who ultimately returns her feelings. :At the end of the last episode of the first season of the anime, Ichigo and Kashino promise to tell each other about their feelings when they're accomplished patissiers. During the second season she is 16 years old, and a member of a new \\"Group A\\", consisting of herself, Lemon, Rumi, and Johnny McBeal. She is also a part of the Henri-sensei's project, \\"Marie's Garden\\", which includes Kashino, Lemon, and Johnny. In the very last episode of Yumeiro Patissiere SP Professional, Kashino tells her that he always wants to be able to make sweets with her, and accidentally kisses her. ; : :One of the \\"Sweets Princes\\" of St.Marie's Academy who specializes in chocolate. Andou is his childhood friend and Hanabusa is his roommate. Kashino is sometimes teased or misjudged due to his height, for he is the shortest of the Sweets Princes. He comes from a prestigious family of doctors who do not approve of his career choice. Due to a condition that his family gave him before attending St.Marie, he is forced to be always at the top of his class. Kashino is generally unsociable, straightforward, easily angered, and prickly. He greatly admires his uncle (who is a chocolatier), and he spent a lot of time in his shop when he was little (which inspired him to become a p√¢tissier). Even though he is initially judgemental and sarcastic due to Ichigo's klutzy personality, he warms up to her to the point of being teammates and friends, and later falls in love with her. In episode 34 it is shown that Kashino has a drawing of Ichigo in his notebook. :In the second season, Kashino skipped a year in school because of his excellent grades during Team Ichigo's study abroad in Paris. He is now 16, but still conscious about his height, as Johnny regularly teases him for it. Whenever he sees Johnny holding Ichigo, he becomes visibly jealous (often smacking the back of Johnny's head). At the end of the series, he asks Ichigo if she will stay with him forever. And after that, he accidentally falls on top of her and kisses her. ; : :One of the \\"Sweets Princes\\" of the school, who specializes in candy sculptures and flower-based cakes. Hanabusa's dream is to work with his mother, who excels at Japanese flower arrangement, and is the flower arranging teacher at St.Marie Academy. His father was a horticulturist who specialized in roses, and who died in a car accident several years before the story takes place. The bottle of rose water Hanabusa keeps is a memento of his father. Since his father died, Hanabusa felt that he should be kind to his mother and women in general. As a result, Hanabusa always focused on roses and is extremely nice to all females (to the point of being a borderline perpetual flirt). He also seems narcissistic and heavily concerned about his appearance, at one point his Sweets Spirit Caf√© implies that Hanabusa needs more than an hour to get ready for school in the morning. In Yumeiro Patissiere SP Professional, Hanabusa starts to work towards his dream, together with his mother, and takes an indefinite leave of absence from school. He admits that he is also in love with Ichigo, although he tells Kashino that he can have her (presumably to make Ichigo happy), but that if she ever dumps him he will claim her for himself. ; : :One of the \\"Sweets Princes\\" of the school who specializes in Japanese sweets. Andou's dream is to open his own shop that sells a blend of Eastern and Western sweets next door to his family's Japanese sweets shop, Yumezuki. Andou is the eldest of five siblings, and he often goes to help at his family's shop during holidays and weekends. He is a childhood friend of Kashino, calling him \\"Maa-chan\\" in the manga and \\"Ma-kun\\" in the anime. Andou is always calm, reliable, and tries to reason with everyone, acting somewhat like an older brother to Team Ichigo. Andou cares about Caramel like a little sister, and he is always overjoyed whenever Caramel does something nice for him. He looks out for Ichigo and tends to worry about her a lot. In the second season, Andou is working towards his dream and takes a leave of absence from school, opening a branch of his family's Yumezuki on the international street of Henri-sensei's project. In Episode 11 of season two, he admits that he's in love with Ichigo, but he gives her up for Kashino. Hanabusa claims that the reason behind it was because he was already dating a girl named Kana. Sweets Spirits ; : :Ichigo's sweets spirit who specializes in vanilla. Often labeled as Spartan, Vanilla's attitude is quite fiery. She generally fights with Chocolat, though they don't seem to actually hate each other, and in fact they work together in the manga for a Sweets Kingdom test. She is often called pudgy. Ichigo and Vanilla consider each other to be best friends, and are extremely loyal to each other. Vanilla often plays a big part in cheering Ichigo up whenever she feels discouraged. Her sweets magic is decorating plates, shrinking people to the size of a sweets spirit, filling an entire room with a pastry's scent and translating Sweets Spirit language into Japanese. ; : :Kashino's sweets spirit who is skilled in chocolate. Chocolat has a competitive spirit but is easily frightened. She is a classic example of a tsundere character, though it seems that she is somewhat losing this trait as the series progresses. Although she appears to dislike Ichigo, she actually cares for her and helps her whenever needed. She may not look like it, but she cares for Kashino and considers the pair as a \\"married couple\\". In season two, it shows that she cares deeply about a sweets spirit named Kasshi and may have romantic feelings for him. For example, in one of the episodes, Chocolat goes to the Sweets Kingdom to help out the 'Jerks', but gets Kashino and Kasshi mixed up. When she tries to 'express' the connection she has with Kashino, she ends up clinging to Kasshi, while Vanilla is saying that she clung onto Kasshi on purpose, while Chocolat Tries to deny it. ; : :Andou's sweets spirit who is useful with caramel. Although Caramel is the eldest out of Team Ichigo's Sweets Spirits, she is clumsy like Ichigo and tends to cry a lot. She commonly ends her sentences with desu. Caf√© states that she has a terrible sense of direction. She considers Andou to be her big brother. Her sweets magic allows her to make pastry pictures to show someone how the sweets look like. ; : :Hanabusa's sweets spirit who is good with coffee. Caf√© is polite, smart, and very calm. He looks up to Hanabusa and sees him as his senpai. Caf√© can make extremely bitter coffee as a potent way of making Team Ichigo more awake. ; : :Mari's sweet spirit who specializes in honey.

The courthouse was placed on the National Register. History Delaware County was established in 1807 by an act of the Ohio General Assembly. The county seat was placed at Berkshire until 1808 when Delaware was founded and successfully petitioned to be the county seat. The courts met in various locations until a courthouse was built in 1815. The building cost the county $8,000 and was a simple one story building. The building contained fire walls to protect the structure from burning, but a fire struck the building towards the end of the 1800s forcing the county to rent a different location. A new courthouse was chosen and planned in 1868 in the Italianate style and designed by Robert N. Jones. The courthouse cost the county $80,000 to build. In 1996, the county renovated the courthouse for six months at a cost of $500,000. The county is faced with a growing population and a new Justice Center is currently under construction. That building is scheduled for completion and occupancy in August or September 2017. The General and Domestic Relations Divisions of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas will move to the new building as will the Public Defender's Office, the Delaware County Clerk of Courts, the adult probation office, and a meeting room for the grand jury. The county has announced plans to renovate the historic courthouse, and a facilities use study is underway to determine which county offices will occupy the building once renovated. Exterior The square two-story structure is built of red bricks. The main facade contains a central projection capped with a pediment. The door sits in a recessed alcove and is contained within an arch faced with stone blocks. A window above contains two thin arched windows within an arched recess. To either side of the projection are two arched windows, the lower windows being shorter with squat arches and the top floor containing longer fully arched windows. Each window is surrounded by decorative stone casings. The hipped roof rises to a central square drum supporting a dome topped by a statue of Justice. A wrought iron railing runs around the drum and arched windows light the floors below.

When completed the fort was twenty-five feet across and had a wall thirty inches thick, constructed of stone. The wall was eight feet high and had twenty-five gunholes for its defenders to fire through if under attack.

This was the first game in the Harpoon series. It was ported to the Amiga and Macintosh. Development history In the late 1970s, a manual wargame called SEATAG was introduced by the United States Navy for exploring tactical options. It was available in both classified and unclassified versions. SEATAG was developed into a true tactical training game called NAVTAG that ran on three networked microcomputers for the Red Side, Blue Side, and Game Control. Former naval officer and future author Larry Bond's exposure to this system in 1980 while on active duty led to the eventual development of Harpoon. Plot The player is the commander of either NATO or Soviet forces, commanding ships and aircraft, selecting from over 100 different weapon systems, and taking responsibility for judgment calls. The game mainly focuses on combat in the GIUK Gap. Gameplay Harpoon is a naval simulator that uses data reflecting real-world equipment and weaponry, based on a miniatures wargame. There are no preset battle algorithms that dictate combat outcomes, and no play balance between sides. The game includes a user's guide with an appendix on superpower politics and maritime strategies in modern warfare, a Harpoon Tactical Guide by Larry Bond, and a booklet by author Tom Clancy that deals with Russian destroyers. Clancy used the simulation to test the naval battles for Red Storm Rising, which he co-authored with Bond. Reception Sales of Harpoon surpassed 80,000 copies by 1993. Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer, a United States military officer, gave the game five stars out of five. He stated that \\"there is no question that Harpoon is the most detailed simulation to appear in the civilian marketplace ... a must-have for the serious naval gamer\\", and that he had learned more from six hours with the game than one year at the Naval War College. In 1990, Dragon gave the PC DOS/MS-DOS version of game 5 out of 5 stars. In 1991, they gave the Macintosh version 5 stars as well. The Amiga version received 5 out of 5 stars. The One reviewed Harpoon in 1991, calling it a \\"combat simulation for purists\\", due to the lack of \\"flashy action scenes\\" or joystick controls. The One furthermore states that the game requires \\"careful\\" and \\"arduous\\" strategic planning, and express that \\"It's hard to fault the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the military hardware database which supports Harpoon, and it would be unfair to criticise the lack of more usual arcade-style sequences. The game makes no claim to be anything other than a realistic and heavily strategic representation of cold war conflict ‚Äì as such it succeeds.\\" The One concludes by expressing that \\"Even so, it's too dryly erudite to appeal to as wide an audience as most simulations.\\" In 1990, Computer Gaming World named it as Wargame of the Year. The editors of Game Player's PC Strategy Guide likewise presented the game with their 1990 \\"Best PC Wargame\\" award. They dubbed it \\"the most detailed, authentic, and convincing simulation of modern naval warfare yet devised.\\" In 1994, PC Gamer US named Harpoon the 36th best computer game ever. The editors called it \\"probably the best known and most successful naval war game there's ever been. It's still selling today, even five years after its initial release, and military academies have been known to use the game as a training aid. Now that's realism!\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Harpoon the 40th-best computer game ever released.

The wealthy congregation of St George's Church, St Kilda, Victoria, Australia had been seeking a minister from the British Isles and Rentoul was nominated by London preacher Oswald Dykes. Rentoul and his wife arrived in Australia in 1879. Five years later Rentoul was appointed professor in the theological hall, Ormond College (University of Melbourne), his subjects being Hebrew and Old Testament Criticism, New Testament Greek, and Christian Philosophy. In 1884, Rentoul was given the degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Theological Faculty of Ireland. At Ormond College, Rentoul had a great influence over many generations of candidates for the Presbyterian ministry, and was a conspicuous figure in all the counsels of his church. He showed great ability in conducting religious controversies, for which he was equipped with wide reading and knowledge of the languages of the original texts. He stated once that he never entered on a fight willingly, but once the contest had started he fought with great vigor and, many of his friends thought, with a full appreciation of the joy of combat. It was not for nothing that he was popularly known as \\"Fighting Larry\\"; but he had no ill-will to his opponents and never bore rancor. He was made moderator-general of the Presbyterian Church of Australia for 1912‚Äì14, and when World War I broke out was appointed chaplain-general of the Australian Imperial Force. Rentoul's last years were clouded by the long illness of his wife following an accident, and the nervous breakdown of his younger son Ormond, a youth of extraordinary promise, while studying for his examinations. Rentoul died suddenly on 15 April 1926 leaving a widow, two sons and two daughters. He was buried in St Kilda Cemetery following a funeral service at Scots' Church, Melbourne. Legacy Rentoul was the author of From Far Lands; Poems of North and South (1914) and At Vancouver's Well and Other Poems of South and North (1917). His poetry has been praised, a good example of it is \\"Australia\\" which was included in The Oxford Book of Australasian Verse. In prose Rentoul published in 1896, The Early Church and the Roman Claims, which ran into six editions. He also wrote The Church at Home; Prayers for Australian Households, and several pamphlets. Rentoul was somewhat frail- looking but was in reality strong and active, showing much endurance during his yearly trout-fishing holidays in New Zealand. He was interested in the Australian Aborigines and all oppressed people, and incurred some odium by taking up the cause of the Boers at the time of the Second Boer War. Rentoul was a fine scholar, learning all his life, and his erudition, keen wit, versatility, strength of conviction, and scorn of compromise, made him a remarkable preacher and lecturer. As a debater he had great readiness in retort, and in developing his argument his words flowed with an almost volcanic passion. In private life he was courteous, kindly and generous. His elder daughter, Annie Rattray Rentoul, wrote verse with some ability. A list of volumes of her songs which were set to music will be found in Percival Serle's A Bibliography of Australasian Poetry and Verse. The younger daughter, Ida Sherbourne, afterwards Mrs Ida Rentoul Outhwaite, became well known as an illustrator of fairy tales.

He became a flying ace in 1918, credited with six aerial victories. Early life He was born as Alan Rice Oxley in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire on 1 July 1896. His parents were Edward Charles Rice Oxley (c. 185414 Mar 1927) and Emily Armstrong (18161883) His parents had married in Shrewsbury on 14 January 1896. This was the his father's second marriage, his father's first wife, Ann Eliza Hall (c. 18571894) had borne 5 children and Rice was the middle child of three from the second marriage. Rice-Oxley was educated at Watford Grammar School for Boys, which he attended between January 1908 and July 1914. Military career Sopwith Camels of No. 45 Squadron RFC at an airfield in Italy, December 1917. Rice-Oxley first served as a private in the 21st (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (1st Surrey Rifles), until 5 February 1915 when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, The King's (Shropshire Light Infantry). He was seconded for duty with the Royal Flying Corps, and appointed a flying officer on 10 September 1916. He trained as a pilot and initially served with No. 15 Squadron in France, tasked with artillery-spotting and reconnaissance. He was wounded in action during the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, and after recuperating became a fighter pilot. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1917. Subsequently, in 1918 he joined the Sopwith Camel equipped No. 45 Squadron on the Italian Front. He recorded his first victories in a combat on 12 July 1918. Piloting Camel D8240, he and Captain Cedric Howell engaged a formation of between ten and fifteen Austro-Hungarian aircraft in proximity to the town of Feltre. In the ensuing dogfight Rice-Oxley destroyed two of the enemy, and for his conduct in this action was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Over the course of the following three days, he destroyed another enemy aircraft and drove a further two down out of control. On 16 August he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain, and achieved his sixth and final victory on 22 August. Rice-Oxley was transferred to the RAF's unemployed list on 26 March 1919, and relinquished his commission in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry on 30 September 1921. Later life In 1921 Rice-Oxley emigrated to North Borneo to join the armed constabulary there, and was appointed as an officer of Class B in the following year, with the rank of Captain. His duties included showing visitors around and, in 1926, while motoring with the author Somerset Maugham, Rice-Oxley came across a 13-foot (4-metre) snake and killed it with his malacca cane. He was appointed Superintendant of Police, Adjutant, and Superintendant of Prisons, in Jesselton in 1929. His career continued apace and he attained the position of Commissioner of Police. On 12 November 1936 he officially changed his name from Alan Rice Oxley to Alan Rice-Oxley by deed poll. In early 1937 he married Valerie Helen Gardner. Valerie was the widow of a fellow former RAF officer, Herbert Gardner who had left the RAF in 1926 to move to the Federated Malay States, but was killed in Marsielles in 1929. After their marriage the coupled sailed in May 1937 from London on the P&O; SS Ranchi; after the outbreak of the second World War the couple returned to England; later during the war Valerie remained in England when Rice-Oxley returned to North Borneo. From 1942‚Äì1945 Rice-Oxley was interned by the Japanese as a civilian internee at Batu Lintang camp near Kuching, Sarawak. Post-war, he returned to Britain and was working as a dairy farmer at Knowle Farm, Uploders, Dorset, when he died on 21 July 1961.

The divide cuts through the English Midlands. Sometimes, the term is widened to include the whole United Kingdom, with Northern Ireland included as part of \\"the North\\". In political terms, the South, and particularly South East England (outside inner London) and East of England, is largely centre-right, and supportive of the Conservative Party, while the Greater North (particularly the towns and cities) was, until the 2019 general election, generally more supportive of the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party have been the most supported in Scotland since the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, while support for the Liberal Democrats, and many of the smaller parties, is generally more equally spread out. There is some criticism of this analysis in the West Country which, until the 2015 general election, had consistently provided a solid base for the Liberal Democrats, and also in places (particularly parts of Bristol, Devon, and Cornwall) which suffer from many of the same economic problems as the North. Existence The North-South divide is not an exact line, but one that can involve many stereotypes, presumptions and other impressions of the surrounding region relative to other regions. The existence of the North-South divide is fiercely contested. Some sources claim it exists but also that it is even expanding. For example, a report in 2001 found that North East England, North West England and Scotland had poorer health levels than South. The same data have been interpreted otherwise to indicate only a very small difference. Indeed, results are highly dependent on the categories chosen for evaluation. As a generalisation, the following tend to indicate that there is some sort of north-south divide: *Health conditions, which are generally seen as being worse in the north, though spending on health care is higher *House prices, which are higher in the south, particularly the South-East. *Earnings, which are higher in the south and east. *Government spending per person on drivers of growth such as transport, infrastructure and R&D;, which is far higher in the South-East. *Political influence. *Devolution of powers to local government. London has a directly elected mayor with control over public transport whilst most Northern cities do not have mayors and have transport policies decided by the UK government. However, many middle-class and affluent areas are located near most major cities north of the divide, and conversely there are pockets of large deprivation in the south. A 2004 report into wealth by Barclays Bank also highlighted the anomaly that the wealthiest parliamentary constituency outside London was actually Sheffield Hallam. A 2012 survey by Halifax stated that whilst nine of the top ten most expensive places to live in Britain were in the south of England, Edinburgh was ninth on the list, ahead of Salisbury. This has led some commentators to suggest that other divisions, such as class or ethnicity might be more important. There is also controversy as to what constitutes the South given that it extends much farther longitudinally than the North of the country; some commentators have placed the West Country (in this case, Bristol, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall) into a region of its own because the poverty in some of these areas is often as widespread as it is in the North, and political support is also focused on the usually widespread Liberal Democrats, until the 2015 general election when the Conservatives took virtually all the seats west of Bristol. Politics The North has been generally perceived as being supportive of Labour as well as in Scotland the SNP and the South being generally supportive of the Conservatives. During the 1980s, Labour councils in the North were often openly dismissive of any orders from the Thatcher government. Examples include Liverpool under the Militant tendency and Sheffield under David Blunkett. Furthermore, after the 2010 General election, the Conservatives held only one seat in Scotland and none in the major cities of Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Hull and Sheffield, all of which were dominated by Labour. The Conservatives hold two seats in Leeds. It can also be noted that major city councils in southern England tend to swing politically between Labour and Conservative control, despite being located in a wider region dominated singularly by the Conservatives. Examples of this include the cities of Southampton and Plymouth.

Empire Beatrice joined the convoy at Oran. On 27 July 1944, Empire Beatrice was torpedoed in the Strait of Dover () by German E-boats. She was beached at Dungeness where temporary repairs were made to make her fit enough for the forward section of the ship to be towed by the tugs Empire Betsy and Empire Humphrey to Tilbury, from where she was later towed to Glasgow for permanent repairs including a new stern. On 23 April 1945, Empire Beatrice was being towed by tugs Empire Larch and Thames off Aberdeen when she was attacked by U-2326. HMT Macbeth sailed southwards from Aberdeen to escort the towing ships. This was the voyage that returned Empire Beatrice to the Clyde for repairs. Following the provision of the new stern, the ship was fitted with a triple expansion steam engine which had cylinders of 23¬Ω inches (60 cm), 37¬Ω inches (95 cm) and by stroke. It was built by John Brown & Co Ltd, Clydebank. Those lost whilst serving on Empire Beatrice during the war are commemorated at the Tower Hill Memorial, London. Postwar career In 1946, Empire Beatrice was sold to Cheriton Shipping Co Ltd and renamed Beatrice N. She was placed under the management of P B Pandelis Ltd, London. In 1952 she was sold to N G Kyrikades Shipping Ltd and renamed Mary K. In 1964, she was sold to Winchester Shipping Co Ltd and renamed Winchester Princess, operated under the management of G O Till, London. In 1966, she was sold to B Bottigliere di Giuseppe, Naples and renamed Grazia Bottigliere. She was scrapped at Split, Yugoslavia, in March 1966.

It is located near Tancarville in Seine-Maritime, Normandy. It has been classified as a Monument historique since 1862 by the French Ministry of Culture.French Ministry of Culture database entry for Ch√¢teau de Tancarville History Raoul, chamberlain of the Duke of Normandy, first had walls and the old tower built. In the 12th century the square tower with walls 1.65 metres thick was built. In 1316, Jeanne de Tancarville, sole heiress, married Jean II de Melun and their son became the second earl of Tancarville. In 1417, the Countess Marguerite married Jacques d'Harcourt . In 1418 at the time of the conquest of Normandy by Henry V of England, the title of Count of Tancarville was given to John Grey, while in the kingdom of France it was used by the House of Harcourt who recovered the castle after the departure of the English. In 1709, a wing in classical style was added to the medieval parts of the building by the Count of Evreux. After the French Revolution in 1789, the castle was looted and partly burned down. For 29 years, from 1910 to 1939, the castle was rented by Mr. Fernand Prat and his wife born Jehanne Leblanc (sister of Maurice Leblanc) who received many personalities of the arts and letters such as Maurice Maeterlinck and his companion Georgette Leblanc, Colette, Margaret Caroline Anderson, James Joyce, Bertrand de Jouvenel, Pierre Lecomte Nouy and Louis Fabulet. In the 1960s, the castle served as a summer camp for children in the area. The title of Earl of Tankerville is still extant in the Peerage of Great Britain. The castle now belongs to Saqqara, a real estate company in Figeac (Lot), which has been offering luxury apartments since 2001. While waiting to be renovated, it remains closed to the public.

As an adjective, it refers to non-variance (i.e. unchanging with respect to some other value); as a noun, it has two different meanings: * A fixed and well-defined number or other non-varying mathematical object. The terms mathematical constant or physical constant are sometimes used to distinguish this meaning. * A function whose value remains unchanged (i.e., a constant function). Such a constant is commonly represented by a variable which does not depend on the main variable(s) in question. This is the case, for example, for a constant of integration, which is an arbitrary constant function (i.e., one that does not depend on the variable of integration) added to a particular antiderivative to get all the antiderivatives of the given function. For example, a general quadratic function is commonly written as: :a x^2 + b x + c\\\\, , where , and are constants (or parameters), and a variable‚Äîa placeholder for the argument of the function being studied. A more explicit way to denote this function is :x\\\\mapsto a x^2 + b x + c \\\\, , which makes the function-argument status of (and by extension the constancy of , and ) clear. In this example , and are coefficients of the polynomial. Since occurs in a term that does not involve , it is called the constant term of the polynomial and can be thought of as the coefficient of . More generally, any polynomial term or expression of degree zero is a constant.  Constant function  A constant may be used to define a constant function that ignores its arguments and always gives the same value. A constant function of a single variable, such as f(x)=5, has a graph of a horizontal straight line parallel to the x-axis. Such a function always takes the same value (in this case, 5), because its argument does not appear in the expression defining the function.  Context-dependence  The context- dependent nature of the concept of \\"constant\\" can be seen in this example from elementary calculus: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{dx} 2^x & = \\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{2^{x+h} - 2^x} h = \\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} 2^x\\\\frac{2^h - 1} h \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = 2^x \\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{2^h - 1} h & & \\\\text{since } x \\\\text{ is constant (i.e. does not depend on } h\\\\text{)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = 2^x \\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{constant,} & & \\\\text{where }\\\\mathbf{constant}\\\\text{ means not depending on } x. \\\\end{align} \\"Constant\\" means not depending on some variable; not changing as that variable changes. In the first case above, it means not depending on h; in the second, it means not depending on x. A constant in a narrower context could be regarded as a variable in a broader context. Notable mathematical constants Some values occur frequently in mathematics and are conventionally denoted by a specific symbol. These standard symbols and their values are called mathematical constants. Examples include: * 0 (zero). * 1 (one), the natural number after zero. * (pi), the constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.141592653589793238462643. * e, approximately equal to 2.718281828459045235360287. * i, the imaginary unit such that i2 = ‚àí1. * \\\\sqrt{2} (square root of 2), the length of the diagonal of a square with unit sides, approximately equal to 1.414213562373095048801688. * œÜ (golden ratio), approximately equal to 1.618033988749894848204586, or algebraically, 1+ \\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2. Constants in calculus In calculus, constants are treated in several different ways depending on the operation. For example, the derivative of a constant function is zero. This is because the derivative measures the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable, and since constants, by definition, do not change, their derivative is hence zero. Conversely, when integrating a constant function, the constant is multiplied by the variable of integration. During the evaluation of a limit, the constant remains the same as it was before and after evaluation. Integration of a function of one variable often involves a constant of integration. This arises due to the fact that the integral operator is the inverse of the differential operator, meaning that the aim of integration is to recover the original function before differentiation. The differential of a constant function is zero, as noted above, and the differential operator is a linear operator, so functions that only differ by a constant term have the same derivative. To acknowledge this, a constant of integration is added to an indefinite integral; this ensures that all possible solutions are included. The constant of integration is generally written as 'c', and represents a constant with a fixed but undefined value. Examples If is the constant function such that f(x) = 72 for every then :\\\\begin{align} f'(x) &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\int f(x) \\\\,dx &= 72x + c \\\\end{align} See also *Constant (disambiguation) *Expression *List of mathematical constants *Physical constant References External links * Category:Algebra Category:Elementary mathematics ","title":"Constant (mathematics)"},{"id":"24758171","text":"The Numbers Band (a.k.a. 15-60-75) are an American blues rock and experimental rock band formed in Kent, Ohio, United States in 1969. They are part of the 'Akron Sound' that sprang forth from their home state. Career The original personnel were Robert Kidney (guitar, lead vocals), the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde's brother Terry Hynde (saxophone), Hank Smith (guitar, keyboards), Greg Colbert (bass) and Tim Hudson (drums). Chris Butler, from Tin Huey and The Waitresses, also played in the band for a stint as a bassist. They premiered as a live act at the local nightspot The Kove in July 1970. Later, they incorporated jazzy influences as well and they have stuck with their sound ever since. By 1972 though, Gerald Casale, future co-founder of Devo (bass), and David Robinson were added to the lineup. Casale was thrown out after wearing a monkey-mask on-stage. Due to interior pressures, Kidney terminated the project by year's end and joined his brother Jack's band, King of Hearts. However, King of Hearts reformed as a new Numbers Band a few weeks later with a retooled lineup that consisted of the Kidney brothers, Hynde, Drake Gleason (bass) and Jay Brown (drums). After two years of playing gigs, Brown left the band and Robinson came back. Michael Stacey (guitar), was added prior to the cutting of their 1976 live album Jimmy Bell's Still in Town. The following year, Gleason was replaced by Bart Johnson (bass). The Numbers Band, like most of the other Ohioans, never became renowned nationally and were not signed by the major labels. The second album (first studio), 15 60 75 The Numbers Band 2 was not released until 1982. The next year, its single, \\"Here in the Life\\", was released through Pere Ubu's David Thomas' label, Hearpen. Subsequently, Fred Tribuzzo took over the bass playing from Johnson. The Golden Palominos did their own rendition of the Kidney composition \\"The Animal Speaks\\" from Jimmy Bell in 1985. Robert Kidney even toured with the Palominos the following year. The third Numbers Band album, Among The Wandering, came out in 1987, but despite some local success and radio airplay of the single \\"High Heels Are Dangerous\\", they remained a locally known band. Stacey departed in February 1989, but he was not replaced. In 1990, Robert Kidney received a kidney transplant, necessitated by a birth defect and complicated by years of hard living. Blues by the Numbers, their second live album, showed up the following year, as did the retrospective, 15 60 75 Twenty. A new studio effort, Hotwire, emerged in 1992, but nothing else was forthcoming for the rest of the decade. Robert and Jack Kidney performed with David Thomas and his \\"Mirror Man\\" stage production at the South Bank Center, London in 1998. The brothers also toured with the troupe in the Netherlands and Canada, and again in Los Angeles in 2003. The entire Numbers Band performed at the South Bank Center in 2000. The band, now comprising the Kidney brothers, Hynde, Bill Watson (bass) and Frank Casamento (drums), are still going strong playing in their hometown circuit today. In 2003, The Numbers Band were among the rockers profiled in the PBS documentary It's Everything, And Then It's Gone. Their latest album, Inward City, was released in 2009. In 2010 Anton Fier reunited the Golden Palominos for a limited number of shows in New York City and Robert Kidney joined the performances at The Living Room and Le Poisson Rouge. 2011 saw the departure of Frank Casamento on drums as he moved to Chicago. Clint Alguire has replaced him, and the band continues to perform and evolve as they approach a 50-year anniversary. Robert Kidney was awarded the Cleveland Arts Prize Lifetime Achievement Award for Music in 2012. The CAP created this video of Robert for their web site...Cleveland Arts Prize, Robert Kidney. The Kidney Brothers (Robert & Jack) released their first duet CD, \\"Coal Tattoo\\", on ReR Megacorp Records in 2013, available at numbersband.com. Also in 2013, the re-release of their first LP, \\"Jimmy Bell's Still in Town\\" is available as a deluxe double vinyl LP (from Exit Stencil Recordings) with three extra tracks which were recorded in the same time period. The band traveled to New York City in December 2013 to perform songs from the album at the Bowery Electric. Long time fan David Fricke from Rolling Stone was in attendance. David wrote the liner notes for the re-release. Robert Kidney released his first solo effort in early 2016, \\"JackLeg\\", a collection of songs written by Robert with acoustic guitar, recorded at Studio G in Brooklyn, NY (released by Exit Stencil Records). The Numbers Band celebrated their 45th Anniversary at The Kent Stage in Kent, Ohio on October 3, 2015. In 2020 they released a CD recorded live in the studio titled ‚ÄúEndure: Outliers on Water Street‚Äù. And on February 28th they celebrated their 50th Anniversary at the Kent Stage, performing to a sold out crowd.

(born circa 1875 in Brest Litovsk, died 1966 in New York City)Gertrud Pickhan, \\"Sara Szweber\\" in Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia . was one of the leaders of the Bund and a trade unionist in the Russian Empire, the Second Polish Republic and later in the United States. She was one of the few women that held leadership positions in the Jewish socialist and trade union movements of the late 19th and early 20th century. Sara came from a family that was initially prosperous but became impoverished while she was young. Her parents died during her childhood and she was raised by her aunt. She worked as a dressmaker in a tailor shop which she helped to organize into a union shop. The workshop she organized, where all workers were paid the same wage and worked the same hours, was used as an example of a democratic workplace by the Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky in his novel What Is to Be Done?. In 1900 Szweber joined the Jewish Labour Bund (The Bund) and became active in its educational activities and meetings. As a result, she was arrested by the Tsarist authorities in 1903. After her release, during the Revolution of 1905 she headed a joint Polish and Jewish workers' demonstration in Kalisz and for the first time spoke before a large crowd. Afterward she moved to Lublin and then ≈Å√≥d≈∫. She was arrested by the Russians again, imprisoned in Lublin castle,Nochum Winik, The ‚ÄúBund‚Äù in Chelm and its Socialist-Revolutionary Work, translated by Howard Bergman . and went on a hunger strike. Possibly because of the hunger strike, she contracted tuberculosis and was therefore released on bail. She took that opportunity to escape to Galicia where she later met her future husband, Elijahu Szweber, an activist who promoted the use of Yiddish.Henryk Piasecki, Sekcja ≈ªydowska PPSD i ≈ªydowska Partia Socjalno- Demokratyczna, 1892-1919/20, Zak≈Çad Narodowy im. Ossoli≈Ñskich, 1982, pg. 226 . They lived there until the break out of World War I. In 1918 Sara moved to Warsaw where she worked as a trade union official in the local garment worker's union. Later, together with the Bundist Victor Alter she headed a one hundred thousand strong labor union which joined together Polish and Jewish workers, the Landrat. According to Szweber, the activities of the Landrat were hampered by splits within the party which were being organized by Communist party members in the 1920s and '30s. While in Warsaw Szweber became one of the members of Bund's Central Committee. In 1938 she was elected to the Warsaw City Council, together with sixteen other Bund members. After the Nazi invasion of Poland Szweber initially escaped to the east, making her way back to her home town of Brest (which had been occupied by the Soviet Union). However, because she was a notable member of the Bund she was in danger of arrest by the NKVD. She managed to escape the Soviets via Vilna, eventually making her way to the United States. In New York she once again worked as a dressmaker and remained active in the Bund √©migr√© community. At the age of 90, she took part in Bund's fourth World Congress.

It is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram- positive bacteria. It retains some activity of later-generation cephalosporins having broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria, but its effectiveness is relatively much weaker. It is currently being investigated for community-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infection. Ceftaroline is being developed by Forest Laboratories, under a license from Takeda. Ceftaroline received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin infections on 29 October 2010. In vitro studies show it has a similar spectrum to ceftobiprole, the only other fifth- generation cephalosporin to date, although no head-to-head clinical trials have been conducted. Ceftaroline and ceftobiprole are on an unnamed subclass of cephalosporins by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019.  Clinical use  Ceftaroline is a novel cephalosporin with activity against MRSA with phase III clinical trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections with reported non-inferior efficacy against MRSA compared to vancomycin and aztreonam. In 2009, ceftaroline had completed phase-III clinical trials for community-acquired pneumonia comparing it against ceftriaxone with non-inferior results and similar adverse reaction profile. However, only results for phase-II clinical trials in treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections have been published. Sept 2009 : Phase III trials results reported. On 8 September 2010, the FDA Advisory Committee recommended approval for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections. In October 2010, FDA approval was gained for treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, including MRSA.  Safety  The clinical studies indicated ceftaroline was well tolerated. The overall rate of adverse events was comparable between the two treatment groups (The CANVAS I and CANVAS II trials evaluated ceftaroline monotherapy versus vancomycin plus aztreonam in adult subjects with complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.). The overall discontinuation rate for ceftaroline- treated subjects was 2.7% compared to a rate of 3.7% for the comparator group- treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions occurring in > 2% of subjects receiving ceftaroline in the pooled phase-III clinical trials were diarrhea, nausea, and rash.:  Contraindications  * Known serious hypersensitivity to ceftaroline or other members of the cephalosporin class * Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions  Warnings and precautions  The warnings and precautions associated with ceftaroline include: Hypersensitivity reactions Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported with beta-lactam antibiotics, including ceftaroline. Exercise caution in people with known hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics including ceftaroline. Before therapy with ceftaroline is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made. If this product is to be given to penicillin- or other beta-lactam-allergic people, caution should be exercised because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial agents has been clearly established. If an allergic reaction to ceftaroline occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions require emergency treatment with epinephrine and other emergency measures, that may include airway management, oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and vasopressors as clinically indicated. Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all antibacterial agents including ceftaroline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterials not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Development of drug-resistant bacteria Prescribing ceftaroline in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Direct Coombs test seroconversion In the pooled phase-III CABP trials, 51/520 (9.8%) of subjects treated with ceftaroline compared to 24/534 (4.5%) of subjects treated with ceftriaxone seroconverted from a negative to a positive direct Coombs' test result. No clinical adverse reactions representing hemolytic anemia were reported in any treatment group. If anemia develops during or after treatment with ceftaroline, drug-induced hemolytic anemia should be considered. If drug-induced hemolytic anemia is suspected, discontinuation of ceftaroline should be considered and supportive care should be administered to the patient if clinically indicated. Interactions No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ceftaroline fosamil. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicated that neither ceftaroline fosamil nor ceftaroline inhibits the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Therefore, neither ceftaroline fosamil nor ceftaroline is expected to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner. Use in specific populations For pregnant or nursing mothers, ceftaroline fosamil should be used only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or child. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric children has not been studied. Because elderly people 65 years of age or older are more likely to have decreased renal function and ceftaroline is excreted primarily by the kidney, care should be taken in dose selection in this age group as in younger people with impaired renal function. Dosage adjustment is required in people with moderately (30 to ‚Ä∞¬§ 50 mL/min) or severely (< 30 mL/min) impaired renal function. The pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline in people with hepatic impairment have not been established.  Side effects  No adverse reactions occurred in greater than 5% of people receiving ceftaroline. The most common adverse reactions occurring in > 2% of people receiving ceftaroline in the pooled phase-III clinical trials were: * Diarrhea * Nausea * Rash  Chemistry  Ceftaroline fosamil is used in form of the acetate. It is a prodrug that is converted to active metabolite ceftaroline and inactive metabolite ceftaroline-M1. Initial in vitro and in vivo animal studies referred to ceftaroline fosamil acetate as PPI-0903. Characteristic of cephalosporins, ceftaroline has a bicyclic ring with four-member Œ≤-lactam ring fused to a six- member cephem ring. Ceftaroline is thought to have activity against MRSA with its 1,3-thiazole ring.

The data from this survey were made public on 31 March, 2009.The 6dF Galaxy Survey DR3, Heath Jones et al., (2009) The survey has mapped the nearby universe over nearly half the sky. Its 136,304 spectra have yielded 110,256 new extragalactic redshifts and a new catalog of 125,071 galaxies. For a subsample of 6dF a peculiar velocity survey is measuring mass distribution and bulk motions of the local Universe. As of July 2009, it is the third largest redshift survey next to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). Description The 6dF survey covers 17,000 deg2 of the southern sky which is approximately ten times the area of the 2dFGRS2dFGRS; Colless et al. 2001 and more than twice the spectroscopic areal coverage of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.SDSS DR7; Abazajian et al. 2009 All redshifts and spectra are available through the 6dFGS Online Database, hosted at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. An online 6dFGS atlas is available through the University of Cape Town. The survey was carried out with the 1.2 meter UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales, Australia with the 6dF instrument permitting the observation of a field of 6 degrees per pointing. The instrument possesses a multi-object fiber spectrograph with 150 optical fibers per field plate. One feature of the 6dF Galaxy Survey compared to earlier redshift and peculiar velocity surveys is its near-infrared source selection. The main target catalogs are selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey.2MASS; Jarrett et al. 2000 There are several advantages of choosing galaxies in these bands. * The near-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies are dominated by the light of their oldest stellar populations, and hence, the bulk of their stellar mass. Traditionally, surveys have selected target galaxies in the optical where galaxies dominated by younger, bluer stars. * The effects of dust extinction are smaller at longer wavelengths. For the target galaxies, this means that the total near-infrared luminosity is not dependent on galaxy orientation and so provides a reliable measure of galaxy mass. Furthermore, this means the 6dF can map the local Universe nearer to the plane of the Milky Way than would otherwise be possible through optical selection. Baryon Acoustic Oscillation detection The 6dF survey is one of the few surveys which are big enough to allow a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal to be detected. The low redshift of 6dF made it possible to derive the Hubble constant H0 with an uncertainty competitive with the distance ladder technique. The result is reported in Beutler et al. (2011)Beutler et al. 2011 and is given by H0 = 67 ¬± 3.2 km/s/Mpc. The peculiar velocity survey The redshift of a galaxy includes the recessional velocity cause by the expansion of the Universe (see Hubble's law) and the peculiar velocity of the galaxy itself. Therefore, a redshift survey alone does not provide an accurate three-dimensional distribution for the galaxies. However, by measuring both components separately, it is possible to obtain a survey of the (peculiar) velocities of the galaxies. In the 6dF survey distance estimators are based on the Fundamental plane of early-type galaxies.FP; Dressler et al. 1987, Djorgovski & Davis 1987 This requires measurements of the galaxies' internal velocity dispersions which is much more difficult than the determination of the redshift. This restricts the number of galaxies usable for the peculiar velocity survey to about 10% of the overall 6dF galaxies. Finally the peculiar velocities can be measured as the discrepancy between the redshift and the estimated distance.

It consists of a formal requirements specification for a generic electronic records management system, accompanied by testing documentation and related information. Published in 2008 by the European Commission, it is intended for use across the European Union, but can be used elsewhere. MoReq2 is generally considered a de facto standard in Europe but it does not have any formal status as a standard. Purpose The MoReq2 specification is intended for users and suppliers of electronic records management systems and services, and educators. Its main intended usages are to serve as a basis for invitations to tender (also known as requests for proposal) and as a framework to guide development of new electronic records management systems. It can also be used to provide a basis for auditing existing electronic records management systems or services, and as a resource for academic or commercial trainers. Availability All the components of MoReq2, as well as translations and Chapters Zero (see below), are free to download from the official MoReq website. They are also available from several other websites. The requirements specification is also available in paper form from the European Commission as . History The original MoReq was first conceived in the late 1990s by the DLM Forum (a European not-for-profit body), following the development and publication of US DoD 5015.2 by the United States Department of Defense. MoReq was intended to serve the same function as 5015.2, namely to describe a good electronic records management system; but whereas 5015.2 was designed specifically for the US defence community, MoReq was designed from the outset to be useful across the European Union and in any sector or industry. 5015.2 and MoReq therefore differ because the former is a standard that defines the mandatory behaviours of a system, whereas MoReq provides guidelines that define the capabilities of a good generic system ‚Äì not all of which need be mandatory in a specific instance. Development of the first version of MoReq was funded by the European Commission, and took place during 2000. MoReq was developed by a team of consultants supported by and Editorial Board of international experts. The resulting specification, frequently referred to (informally) as MoReq1, was published in 2001. MoReq1 was received enthusiastically, being the subject of about a dozen translations and adaptations. However, its success was not accompanied by any form of governance or development; and there was no MoReq1 compliance testing programme. This prompted the DLM Forum to initiate the development of a major update, which was to become known as MoReq2. Following the production of a scoping study report, the European Commission funded development of MoReq2. The development was once again performed by consultants, this time supported by panels of volunteer reviewers as well as by an Editorial Board of international experts. The panels were drawn from: * suppliers of electronic records management system software; * users and potential users of software; * National Archives; * professional bodies and trade associations. The volunteer panellists were drawn from 35 countries, and over 100 contributed actively to the review process. In March 2010, the DLM Forum signed a contract to develop a new version of MoReq, to be known as MoReq2010; this was published in mid-2011. Compliance testing A compliance testing scheme was launched by the DLM Forum in Summer 2008. This scheme allows suppliers of electronic records management systems to submit their products for formal compliance testing. Suppliers can choose any testing centre accredited by the DLM Forum, and the results are applicable across Europe. Compliance testing requires that the core MoReq2 requirements are met; at the option of the supplier, requirements of any combination of 13 the optional modules. The first software product which has been MoReq2-certified is (Fabasoft Folio).First certification of MoReq2(recalled at May 17th 2010] List of certified software products (recalled at May 17th 2010) It is at this time (June 2014) the only one worldwide. Key features MoReq2 is designed specifically to be an evolutionary upgrade of MoReq1. In addition to specifying functional requirements for a good, generic, electronic records management system it includes: * Non-functional requirements. * 13 ‚Äúoptional modules‚Äù, each of which defines requirements for a set of features that are often required in tight integration to electronic records management, such as document management (thus providing the basis of a specification for an Electronic Document and Records Management System), fax, collaborative working environment, and content management. * A metadata model that defines 345 metadata elements needed to support the functionality defined in the functional requirements. * Testing documentation (test data, test conditions, expected results, instructions) to allow compliance testing. * An xml schema consistent with the metadata model. * Explanatory text, appendices and references. In addition the MoReq2 structure allows for countries to develop country-specific, language-specific, or region-specific ‚ÄúChapters Zero‚Äù that take account of linguistic differences, national and regional legislation, national standards etc. Governance The DLM Forum has established a MoReq Governance Board to guide the future development of MoReq.http://dlmforum.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=16&Itemid;=18‚ü®=en The Board is charged with: * Managing ongoing development of MoReq. * Managing the compliance testing process. * Promoting the use of MoReq2. * Validating translations and Chapters Zero. * Ensuring the name and logo of MoReq2 are not inappropriately used.

Continuum theory is the branch of topology devoted to the study of continua.  Definitions  * A continuum that contains more than one point is called nondegenerate. * A subset A of a continuum X such that A itself is a continuum is called a subcontinuum of X. A space homeomorphic to a subcontinuum of the Euclidean plane R2 is called a planar continuum. * A continuum X is homogeneous if for every two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h: X ‚Üí X such that h(x) = y. * A Peano continuum is a continuum that is locally connected at each point. * An indecomposable continuum is a continuum that cannot be represented as the union of two proper subcontinua. A continuum X is hereditarily indecomposable if every subcontinuum of X is indecomposable. * The dimension of a continuum usually means its topological dimension. A one-dimensional continuum is often called a curve.  Examples  * An arc is a space homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1]. If h: [0,1] ‚Üí X is a homeomorphism and h(0) = p and h(1) = q then p and q are called the endpoints of X; one also says that X is an arc from p to q. An arc is the simplest and most familiar type of a continuum. It is one-dimensional, arcwise connected, and locally connected. * The topologist's sine curve is a subset of the plane that is the union of the graph of the function f(x) = sin(1/x), 0 < x ‚â§ 1 with the segment ‚àí1 ‚â§ y ‚â§ 1 of the y-axis. It is a one-dimensional continuum that is not arcwise connected, and it is locally disconnected at the points along the y-axis. * The Warsaw circle is obtained by \\"closing up\\" the topologist's sine curve by an arc connecting (0,‚àí1) and (1,sin(1)). It is a one-dimensional continuum whose homotopy groups are all trivial, but it is not a contractible space. Warsaw circle * An n-cell is a space homeomorphic to the closed ball in the Euclidean space Rn. It is contractible and is the simplest example of an n-dimensional continuum. * An n-sphere is a space homeomorphic to the standard n-sphere in the (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space. It is an n-dimensional homogeneous continuum that is not contractible, and therefore different from an n-cell. * The Hilbert cube is an infinite-dimensional continuum. * Solenoids are among the simplest examples of indecomposable homogeneous continua. They are neither arcwise connected nor locally connected. * The Sierpinski carpet, also known as the Sierpinski universal curve, is a one- dimensional planar Peano continuum that contains a homeomorphic image of any one-dimensional planar continuum. * The pseudo-arc is a homogeneous hereditarily indecomposable planar continuum.  Properties  There are two fundamental techniques for constructing continua, by means of nested intersections and inverse limits. :* If {Xn} is a nested family of continua, i.e. Xn ‚äá Xn+1, then their intersection is a continuum. :* If {(Xn, fn)} is an inverse sequence of continua Xn, called the coordinate spaces, together with continuous maps fn: Xn+1 -> Xn, called the bonding maps, then its inverse limit is a continuum. A finite or countable product of continua is a continuum.  See also  * Linear continuum * Menger sponge * Shape theory (mathematics)  References   Sources  * Sam B. Nadler, Jr, Continuum theory.

That is, each player assumes the persona of a character (like a \\"handle\\" in an online environment) and maintains that persona until the character dies. This variation is similar to the variation that also exists in table-top and computer games. Some table-top games (like Monopoly) don't require the player to assume a distinct persona, but games like Dungeons & Dragons do have this requirement. The same is true of computer games‚Äîthe player of the single-player version of Half-Life assumes the role of a character with a name and personality; The player of Tetris does not. Live- action gaming is sometimes described to novice players as a hobby lying somewhere between LARP and historical reenactment.The Gherkin Patch - Live Action Gaming http://www.covengaming.org/wordpress/?cat=6 This is accurate in that the game contains the WYSIWYG philosophy and minimalist rules of historical reenactment, but adds the unpredictable outcome and player-created plot found at some LARP events. Rules Rules for live-action games are extremely simple compared to other forms of live interactive games like American Football or Orienteering. Combat is simulated, with one hit causing a wound. There are no 'hit points' or other conventions. Game rules are not used as stand-ins for components of the imaginary environment. If a novice player cannot immediately understand a rules convention, that rules convention is not used. Referees are not used and players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules. A special effort is made to convey and adhere to the spirit of the game. Environment The key to live action gaming is an attempt by the game directors to create a WYSIWYG environment. Instead of using a laminated card to represent a magical staff, an actual staff is used, as one might build for a play. Weapons (such as boffer swords or airsoft guns) are almost always part of the experience. Players stay \\"in character\\" at all times (with the exception of medical emergencies). There is no convention for removing oneself from the playing environment. Production Live action games are run by a staff that writes a plot that binds together the expected events of the game into a rough storyline, creates obstacles for the players to overcome, and plays the adversaries in the game world. Implementation A single live action game can span anywhere from 2 hours to 14 days. Active groups can run as many as 18-20 events per year, with a mix of new players and veterans at each event. Most events are run by volunteer organizations for the enjoyment and exercise of the players and staff. Some events are free and use publicly available sites (such as college campuses), while others charge a fee to cover a private site rental (such as an outdoor camp) and equipment (and sometimes food).

Background Beerbohm returned to England from his home in Rapallo in Italy in about 1935 when his wife, Florence Kahn was cast in a revival of Peer Gynt on the London stage. At this time he resumed writing essays when the BBC invited him to give regular radio broadcasts. He talked about cars and carriages and music halls, among other topics. He and his wife remained in Britain during World War II during which period Beerbohm continued to broadcast, giving his last 'on air' talk in 1945. The success of these broadcasts made Beerbohm a well-known emeritus of British humour.Beerbohm on Answers.com Six of these radio talks were collected together with six other essays and published as Mainly on the Air in 1946.

Here he took advantage of the absence of Philip V of Macedon, and the incapacity of Eperatus the Achaean strategos, to make frequent incursions into the Achaean territories. Having established a fortified post on Mount Panachaikon, he laid waste the whole country as far as Rhion and Aigion. The next year (217 BC) he concerted a plan with Lycurgus, king of Sparta, for the invasion of Messenia. However, he failed in the execution of his part of the scheme, being repulsed by the Cyparissians before he could effect a junction with Lycurgus. In consequence he returned to Elis, but as the Eleans were dissatisfied with his conduct, he was shortly after recalled by the Aetolians and replaced by Euripidas. (Polybius V. 30, 91, 92, 94.) At a later period he obtained the office of strategos of the Aetolians, in the same year (208 BC) that this office was bestowed as an honorary title upon Attalus I, king of Pergamon. In the spring of that year he advanced with an army to Lamia to oppose the passage of Philip V of Macedon towards the Peloponnese. Though supported with an auxiliary force both by Attalus and by the Roman praetor Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus, he was defeated by Philip in two successive battles (First and Second Battle of Lamia) and forced to retire within the walls of Lamia. (Livy, XXVII.30) It is not improbable that Sipyrrhicas, who appears in Livy (XXXI.46) as chief of the Aetolian deputation which met Attalus at Heracleia, is only a false reading for Pyrrhias. Another Pyrrhias of Aetolia was an Olympic winner in the stadion race in 200 BC, according to the Chronicon of Eusebius of Caesarea. He may have been a son of the previous, although nothing confirms that supposition.

She heads the Siam Hotel in the Royal Quarter of Bangkok, part of the company's Siam Hotel & Resorts holdings. Siam Hotels and Resorts and other businesses are part of the Kamol Sukosol Co. Ltd. The company dates back to 1939, when Mr. Kamol Sukosol started his trading business with a shipment of 12 radio sets from the United States. Over the following years, Mr Sukosol expanded the business into several other industries, including automotive, finance, insurance, and construction. When the company needed to form independent business units to maintain focus, the Kamol Sukosol Electric Co. Ltd was established in 1973. Henceforth led by his daughter, Kamala Sukosol, the company now focuses on the trading of electric and medical equipment. The real estate holdings of the group include numerous property and office rentals in and around Bangkok. Kamala's son Sukie assists with Siam Hotel operations and is also the creator of Thailand's largest indie music label: Bakery (music label). Kamala's father sold General Electric radios before branching out in business with manufacturing, real estate and car dealerships. Hotel business Siam Hotels & Resorts is an independently owned and branded Thai hotel group established in the 1970s. Its properties consist of the Siam City Hotel in Bangkok and the Siam Bayshore Resort & Spa and Siam Bayview Hotel in Pattaya, a seaside city two hours southeast of Bangkok. In all, the group currently operates 4- and five-star luxury properties in Thailand with a hotel-room inventory of over 1,000, overseen by a team of 1,100 local and international management and staff.  History  The origins of the brand date back to 1972 when Kamol Sukosol‚Äîentrepreneur, business tycoon and chairman of the Kamol Sukosol Company‚Äîacquired a plot of land in Pattaya and built a resort. The Siam Bayshore Resort opened in 1975 under the leadership of his daughter and managing director, Kamala Sukosol. In 1983, the family acquired another beachfront plot in the centre of Pattaya and built the Siam Bayview Hotel. To complement its Pattaya operations, in 1990 the hotel group opened the Siam City Hotel in downtown Bangkok, adjacent to the Phayathai Skytrain Station.  Company name  What began as Siam Bay Hotels in 1983 has changed over time. In 1990, with the addition (along with the Siam Bayview Hotel and Siam Bayshore Resort & Spa) of the Siam City Hotel in Bangkok, the name \\"Siam Bay Hotels\\" was no longer adequate. The group was renamed \\"Siam City Hotels and Resorts\\", to represent the three properties. Then again, in 2009, with the looming addition of yet another hotel, The Siam, another name change, to Siam Hotels & Resorts, was made.  Ownership and management  Siam Hotels & Resorts is wholly owned and operated by the Sukosol family: Kamala Sukosol is president, her eldest daughter, Marisa Sukosol Nunbhakdi, is executive vice president; her youngest daughter, Daranee Sukosol Clapp, is vice president of finance, her youngest son, Krissada Sukosol Clapp, is a consulting designer and her eldest son, Kamol Sukosol Clapp, is director of projects. The hotel is managed by a team of Thai and multi-national hotel professionals. Siam Hotels & Resorts currently has 1,100 employees.  Art and architecture (Siam City Hotel)  In the geographical center of Bangkok, the Siam City Hotel is the capital's only five-star hotel in the city's \\"Palace Quarter\\", serving important government agencies, the foreign ministry, the United Nations, and major corporations in the vicinity. Built on an 8-rai (3.2 acres) plot of land, the hotel comprises two main buildings. The ten-storey Ayuthaya Wing was an existing building on the acquired property; it has since been entirely renovated. The 23-storey Siam Wing was designed by the architect, Associate Professor Ajarn Rangsan Torsuwan. He has designed several major buildings in Thailand, including the head offices of several major banks and Huamark Stadium, Thailand's biggest, with over 60,000 seats. Respectful of the hotel's location near several major palaces‚Äîopposite Suan Pakkad Palace, residence of the grandson of King Rama V, Prince Chumbhot Paribatra; two blocks east of Chitrlada Palace, the king's residence; and two blocks south of King Rama V's country villa, Phayathai Palace‚Äîthe hotel‚Äôs lobby and garden pavilion courtyard reflect early 20th-century palace architecture as seen during the reign of King Rama V and King Rama VI. The main lobby is graced by a recreation of a Victorian-style conservatory designed by the American glass maker Stephen Gormley. Similarly, Bent Severin & Associates, an international hospitality design company, echoed a similar concept in the interior decoration of the hotel, whereby Thai-style ambience is combined with early 20th-century Art Nouveau and Art Deco influences. The Siam City Hotel is also home to an extensive art collection, curated by its owner, Kamala Sukosol. Scattered throughout the hotel are collectibles from Asia and around the globe. Items include Chinese mother-of-pearl inlay cabinets, benjarong ware, hun krabog puppets, prehistoric Ban Chiang pottery, art deco/neo-classical lamps, Burmese wooden sculpture, sao ching cha pottery, Ming Dynasty porcelain, Han Dynasty earthenware, Burmese chests, traditional Thai-style mural painting on canvas, celadon plates and Art Nouveau cabinets.

The band consists of four members: Yoon Doo-joon, Yang Yo-seob, Lee Gi-kwang, and Son Dong-woon. Original member Jang Hyun-seung officially left the group in April 2016, and Yong Jun-hyung left in March 2019.https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=009&aid;=0004319814 In late 2016, the group moved labels from Cube Entertainment to Around Us Entertainment and subsequently changed their name to Highlight in 2017. As Beast, the group released three Korean full-length albums, nine Korean mini- albums, two Japanese full-length albums, and numerous singles. The group debuted in 2009 with the mini-album, Beast Is the B2ST. In 2011, they released their first full-length album, Fiction and Fact, and made their Japanese debut with the single, \\"Shock\\" (Japanese Version). As Highlight, the group debuted in 2017 with the mini-album, Can You Feel It?. Beast initially received attention for the lack of industry success previously experienced by its members, with media outlets referring to them as \\"a group of recycled material.\\" However, the group has achieved significant commercial success and critical accolades and is one of the most awarded groups of all time at the Golden Disk Awards, the Seoul Music Awards, and the Melon Music Awards. History 2009‚Äì2010: Debut and Shock of the New Era Prior to their debut, Korean news outlets reported that Cube Entertainment would be releasing a new boy group known as \\"B2ST\\", an abbreviation for \\"Boys to Search for Top\\" pronounced as \\"Beast\\". The name was changed to \\"Beast\\" before their debut, but the group retains the original stylisation in all their promotional material. In October 2009, Beast held their debut showcase at the MTV GongGae Hall and made their live performance debut on KBS Music Bank with their debut single, \\"Bad Girl\\". A documentary recording the story of the group's debut titled \\"MTV B2ST\\" was filmed during this time, showing the members as they filmed their first music video and bonded with each other. Their debut mini-album, Beast is the B2ST featured five songs, including the intro track \\"Beast is the B2ST,\\" \\"Mystery,\\" and \\"Oasis.\\" The song \\"Yet\\" (, Ajigeun) was banned from airplay due to swearing in Jun-hyung's rap. Beast won their first award, Rookie of the Month for December, awarded by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. In early 2010, Beast promoted their second single, \\"Mystery,\\" from the mini- album. The members created their own humorous amateur music video for the song, featuring fellow Korean pop singers including members of Girls' Generation and Kara. The mini-album went on to sell 40,000 copies, an unusual feat for a Korean rookie group, with the album's original print run of 20,000 copies selling out in its first month. In January 2010, Beast and their labelmates, girl group 4minute, signed with worldwide album company Universal Music Group for their international promotions and album launches and began their first international promotions in Taiwan with 4minute. The group was awarded the Best Newcomer Award alongside girl groups T-ara and After School at the 19th Seoul Music Awards in February 2010. Beast released their second mini-album Shock of the New Era in March 2010 with the lead single \\"Shock.\\" The group achieved their first number-one win on Mnet‚Äôs M! Countdown with \\"Shock.\\" The album quickly sold 20,000 copies in Korea and was certified into the Gold Disk category in Singapore. Reviews of the title track described it as having both powerful vocals and a rock-influenced strong sound, a departure from the pop feel of their debut single, and praised the complex choreography for the track in live performances. During the promotion period for \\"Shock,\\" the group performed an orchestra version of Korean group Noel's ballad \\"Despite Holding On\\" (, Butjapgodo) and was recognized as a boy group with outstanding singing ability. A digital single version of their track \\"Easy\\" from their Shock of the New Era album was released in April 2010 with the title \\"Easy (Sincere Ver.).\\" The track used strings and piano as opposed to the hip-hop feel and electronic instruments of the original. Beast at the 2010 Mnet 20's Choice Awards, in August 2010 In August 2010, Beast received the Golden Disk Award from Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand at the '2010 Summer CUBE Stars Party' in Seoul. Beast and 4minute also became the first Korean artists to be invited to perform on the Singapore Youth Olympics pre-opening stage. The group was awarded with the Cool Star Award in the 2010 Mnet 20's Choice Awards. American R&B; musician Omarion made a surprise appearance as a guest onstage with the group as they received their award. Omarion had earlier invited Beast to perform with him after viewing a YouTube clip of the group delivering a dance performance of his single \\"Ice Box\\". 2010: Mastermind, Lights Go On Again and My Story On September 17, 2010, Beast released the song \\"Jumeogeul Kkwak Jwigo‚Äù (Ï£ºÎ®πÏùÑ ÍΩâ Ï•êÍ≥†, lit. Clenching a Tight Fist) as a single from their third mini-album, Mastermind. The song gained anticipation and attention from the public for the excellent vocal ability they displayed. Mastermind was released on September 28, 2010. On October 8, 2010, a week after their comeback, Beast claimed first place on KBS Music Bank with the song \\"Soom‚Äù (Ïà®, lit. Breath) from Mastermind. The song was noted for its original sound and distinctive choreography.

It was a pioneer of the TV dinner industry beginning in 1958. For many years, it was an important employer in Buffalo, New York. It was founded by Buffalo businessman Paul Snyder and at one point had over 1,000 employees. In 2004, its Buffalo plant failed a government safety inspection and was closed by Home Market Foods, its corporate parent. The company was previously owned by United Foods. The plant's closure left many employees unemployed. The USDA inspection found such violations as live cockroaches in the gravy tank on multiple occasions. In response, Freezer Queen first requested a new USDA inspector, then suggested that parts of the facility were debris-strewn and not normally cleaned, and finally elected to shut down the facility rather than fix the unsafe and unsanitary conditions. In its final years, Freezer Queen was merely a brand entity for the line of frozen dinners and entrees it had previously produced. Among those Freezer Queen-branded products were \\"Gravy with Salisbury Steaks,\\" and \\"Broccoli with Cheese Sauce.\\" Home Market Foods then transitioned the brand to \\"Family Buffet,\\" ending Freezer Queen's history.

Children acquire nationality of Iran through their fathers, but not their mothers. There has been a move in the past to change this law to enable a large population of Afghan men, and their Iranian-born children full citizenship. The full nationality law is defined in Book 2 of the Civil Code of Iran, Articles 976 through 991. Definition of Iranian nationals Article 976 of the Civil Code of Iran defines who is an Iranian national: # All residing in Iran except those whose foreign nationality is established; the foreign nationality of such persons is considered to be established if their documents of nationality have not been objected to by the Iranian Government. # Those born in Iran or outside whose father is Iranian. # Those born in Iran of unknown parentage. # People born in Iran of foreign parents, one of whom was also born in Iran. # People born in Iran of a father of foreign nationality who have resided at least one more year in Iran immediately after reaching the full age of 18; in other cases their naturalization as Iranian subjects will be subject to the stipulations for Iranian naturalization laid down by the law. New legislation passed by the Iranian Parliament in 2012 grants permanent residency to children born to Iranian mothers and foreign fathers. # Every woman of foreign nationality who marries an Iranian husband. # Every foreign national who has obtained Iranian nationality. Naturalisation An application for naturalisation as an Iranian must be submitted to either directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or through the Governors, or the Governors-General and must contain certified copies of identity documents in relation to the applicant and his family (wife and children). certificate certifying period of residence, clean criminal record, sufficient property and employment that ensures a livelihood. Deprivation of citizenship, dual nationality Iran does not recognize dual nationality, and considers dual citizens as Iranian citizens only. Nevertheless, article 977 of the Civil Code of Iran deals with multiple citizenship. As a consequence of Paragraphs 4 or 5 of article 976, some Iranian minors may have multiple citizenship. If they wish to retain the non-Iranian nationality after age 18, they have to inform Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In theory, voluntary renunciation of Iranian citizenship is possible for persons over the age of 25, subject to approval by the Council of Ministers. However this rarely occurs in practical terms. Travel freedom Visa requirements for Iranian citizens In 2016, Iranian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 37 countries and territories, ranking the Iranian passport 98th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.

As a result, large cargo units can be lowered into place. If it is possible, the holds or hatches are designed around standard cargo unit sizes. Sometimes a gantry crane is fitted. There is special attention for cargo-handling shipping gear. These conbulkers are expensive because there is extra steel necessary to widen the hatches. This is crucial to provide strength. The open hatches are useful for forest products, such as pre-slung timber and logs. The heavy units are more easy to handle than in a conventional bulk carrier. The open hatch bulk carriers can also be used to carry containers on the outward leg, and dry bulk on the return leg.

Life He was eldest son of Stephen Cleasby, and brother of Anthony Cleasby, born on 30 November 1797. He was educated at a private school, and for some years assisted his father in his business, but in 1824 gave up trade and went to the continent to study philosophy and literature. After spending four years principally in Italy and Germany, he returned for a winter's term at the University of Edinburgh, went again to the continent, and eventually settled in 1830 at Munich to study philosophy under Friedrich Schelling and Old German under Johann Andreas Schmeller and Hans Ferdinand Massmann. He made excursions into many districts of Germany, gaining a knowledge of German dialects. A liver complaint often sent him to Carlsbad, and he occasionally revisited England. His first visit to Denmark and Sweden was in May 1834, and he became attracted by Scandinavian subjects. In 1839 he collated the Codex Argenteus at Uppsala, and in January 1840 he formed the plan of his Icelandic-English Dictionary, starting work by April. He worked while travelling between England, German spas, and Copenhagen, where he had amanuenses. In the summer of 1847 his health grew worse, and on 6 October he died of an attack of typhoid fever. The poetical vocabulary, prepared under his direction by Sveinbj√∂rn Egilsson, was ready for publication in 1846. In the following year Cleasby had set up in type specimens of the prose dictionary. Arrangements were made for the completion of the work at Copenhagen. After some false starts and the temporary loss of some of Cleasby's papers, Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson in 1864 took over the Dictionary, and George Webbe Dasent lobbied the Clarendon Press for backing. The work was eventually completed in 1873, and published with a preface by Henry Liddell, and an introduction and memoir of Cleasby by Dasent.

In 2010/11 season, he had 24 league and 2 cup appearances and he was the captain of Asteras Tripolis. On 27 August 2011,he make his debut with Atromitos on a 1‚Äì1 away draw against OFI and scored his first goal on 12 February 2012 in a 3‚Äì1 home win against Kerkyra. On summer of 2013, Atromitos has announced the re-signing of Sokratis Fytanidis to a new 4-year contract just days after transfer speculation had the Greek midfielder on his way to Super League rivals PAOK. Fytanidis' new deal means he will remain at the club until the end of the 2016/2017 Greek Super League season. The club announced the re-signing of the 29-year-old via the club's official website, \\"Atromitos is pleased to announce the renewal of its partnership with Sokratis Fytanidis\\", the statement read. The club's statement referred to Fytanidis as the \\"rock\\" of the club's defense, a label Fytanidis has earned thanks to his solid partnership alongside Nikolaos Lazaridis and Efstathios Tavlaridis in the Atromitos back-line. Fytanidis with his defensive awareness immediately helped the club to reach back-to-back Greek Cup finals in 2011 and 2012. Fytanidis' success with Atromitos also earned him a call-up to the Greek national football team. According to transfer reports, Fytanidis was rumored to be joining Panathinaikos on a free transfer until it was revealed that new PAOK owner Ivan Savvidis was keen to bring Fytanidis to Thessaloniki. Fytanidis commented on his decision to remain an Atromitos player and his hopes for future success with the club. \\"I am happy to continue my career Atromitos. I could not do so at another club after the support from the [club president] Mr. George Spanos and the high standard that has been set by the club and the fans\\", Fytanidis stated. \\"Besides, through my discussions with Mr. Yiannis Angelopoulos, I know that the team has no ceiling for its aspirations.

Its derived members, the Megaraptoridae are noted for their elongated hand claws and proportionally large arms, which are usually reduced in size in other large theropods. Megaraptorans are incompletely known, and no complete megaraptoran skeleton has been found. However, they still possessed a number of unique features. Their forelimbs were large and strongly built, and the ulna bone had a unique shape in members of the family Megaraptoridae, a subset of megaraptorans which excludes Fukuiraptor and Phuwiangvenator. The first two fingers were elongated, with massive curved claws, while the third finger was small. Megaraptoran skull material is very incomplete, but a juvenile Megaraptor described in 2014 preserved a portion of the snout, which was long and slender. Leg bones referred to megaraptorans were also quite slender and similar to those of coelurosaurs adapted for running. Although megaraptorans were thick-bodied theropods, their bones were heavily pneumatized, or filled with air pockets. The vertebrae, ribs, and the ilium bone of the hip were pneumatized to an extent which was very rare among theropods, only seen elsewhere in taxa such as Neovenator. Other characteristic features include opisthocoelous neck vertebrae and compsognathid-like teeth. The clade was originally named in 2010 as a subset of the family Neovenatoridae, a group of lightly-built allosauroids related to the massive carcharodontosaurids such as Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus. A 2013 phylogenetic analysis by Fernando Novas and his colleagues disagreed with this classification scheme, and instead argued that the megaraptorans evolved deep within Tyrannosauroidea, a superfamily of basal coelurosaurs including the famous Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent refinements to Novas's data and methodologies have supported a third position for the group, at the base of Coelurosauria among other controversial theropods such as Gualicho, but not within the Tyrannosauroidea. Regardless of their position, it is clear that megaraptorans experienced a large amount of convergent evolution with either Neovenator-like allosauroids or basal coelurosaurs. Megaraptorans were most diverse in the early Late Cretaceous period of South America, particularly Patagonia. However, they had a widespread distribution. Phuwiangvenator and Fukuiraptor, the most basal and second most basal known members of the group, lived in Thailand and Japan, respectively. Megaraptoran material is also common in Australia, and the largest known predatory dinosaur from the continent, Australovenator, was a megaraptoran.  Description  Life restoration of Megaraptor Megaraptorans were medium to large-sized theropods, ranging from Fukuiraptor, which was about 4.2 meters (14 feet) in length, to the 9 meter (30 feet)-long Aerosteon, and the 42 foot long Bahariasaurus, if it is a member. Most megaraptorans are known from very fragmentary remains, although certain characteristics can be identified in multiple members of the clade. At least some megaraptorans, such as Murusraptor and Aerosteon, had extensively pneumatic bones (most noticeably the ilia and ribs), which likely housed sinuses connected to the lungs, similar to modern birds. The slender leg bones and long metatarsals of several species indicate that members of this group likely had cursorial habits. Most megaraptorans are part of the family Megaraptoridae, which was named by Fernando Novas and his colleagues in 2013. This family is united by several adaptations of the ulna and claws which are not present in the basal megaraptoran Fukuiraptor.  Skull and teeth  A restoration of the head of Megaraptor, based on the juvenile specimen described in 2014 No megaraptoran fossil is known to preserve a complete skull, although skull material is known for several taxa. Aerosteon, Orkoraptor, and Murusraptor preserve several bones of the rear part of the skull, lower jaws are known from Australovenator, and a juvenile specimen of Megaraptor described in 2014 preserved much of the snout as well as parietal fragments. Teeth have been found in many genera. Collectively, megaraptorans can be reconstructed as having a long, lightly built skull with many relatively small teeth. Based on Megaraptor, the premaxillary bone at the tip of the snout is small, with a long and rod-like branch of bone which extends above the external nares (nostril holes). The nares themselves were very large and elongated, akin to some early tyrannosauroids (Dilong, Proceratosaurus, etc.). The snout also had some similarities to carcharodontosaurids, namely the straight upper edge of the maxilla and rectangular nasal bones. The parietal bones at the top of the skull, behind the eyes, had a strongly developed sagittal crest, as in tyrannosauroids. Otherwise, the rear part of the skull is rather simple, without any pronounced crests or bosses, although the lacrimal and postorbital bones did have rugose patches in some genera. Aerosteon and Murusraptor possessed a pneumatic quadrate, as in a few allosauroids (Sinraptor, Mapusaurus) and tyrannosauroids. The dentary, which is only known in Australovenator, is long and graceful, with the first tooth smaller than the rest (as in tyrannosauroids). The mandible as a whole has only a single meckelian foramen, as in carcharodontosaurians, tyrannosaurids, and ornithomimids. However, the rear part of the mandible (as seen in Murusraptor) was significantly more lightly built than that of tyrannosauroids. Preserved braincase material has similarities to both carcharodontosaurians and tyrannosauroids. The premaxillary teeth of Megaraptor were variably similar to those of tyrannosauroids, being small, incisiform (chisel-like) and D-shaped in cross section. However, Murusraptor's premaxillary teeth were fang-like, as in non-tyrannosauroid theropods. Megaraptoran maxillary teeth show much variety between genera, although they were generally small compared to the snout with minimal enamel ornamentation. Some megaraptorans, such as Orkoraptor, Australovenator, and Megaraptor, had teeth which were 8-shaped in cross section and completely unserrated from the front (similar to dromaeosaurids and compsognathids), while Murusraptor had anterior serrations only at the tip of its teeth. Fukuiraptor had very laterally compressed and blade-like teeth (similar to carcharodontosaurs) with both anterior and posterior serrations.  Vertebrae and ribs  Opisthocoelous cervical vertebrae from Aerosteon The cervical (neck) vertebrae of megaraptorans were nearly unique among theropods in the fact that they were strongly opisthocoelous. This means that they were convex from the front and concave from behind. Opisthocelous vertebrae are also characteristic of Allosaurus and sauropods, and they may facilitate high flexibility without sacrificing defense against shear forces. Otherwise, the cervicals were similar to those of carcharodontosaurians, with short neural spines, transverse processes (projecting rib facets) located around mid-length on the centra, and a pair of large lateral pits known as pleurocoels. In fact, one or more pleurocoels were present in most megaraptoran vertebrae, and they connected to a complex system of numerous small air pockets within the vertebrae. This web-like internal structure of megaraptoran vertebrae (and that of a few other theropods) has been described as \\"camellate\\". The proximal caudals (vertebrae at the base of the tail) had a longitudinal ridge running along their lower surface, similar to the case in Neovenator but unlike tyrannosauroids. They also had a pair of lateral ridges which stretched downwards from the transverse processes to the centra. These ridges, known as centrodiapophyseal laminae, defined a large depression (infradiapophyseal fossa) under the transverse processes. Although these ridges were also present in dorsal (back) vertebrae and have been found in other theropods, megaraptorans were practically unique in the fact that their centrodiapophyseal laminae were well-developed at the base of the tail, sometimes even more so than the dorsal vertebrae. Only spinosaurids share this feature. The strong development of these ridges may indicate that the tail was deep and muscular. The dorsal ribs were thick and curved yet hollow and pierced by a hole near their connection to the vertebrae. The gastralia (belly ribs) were wide and strongly built paddle-shaped structures, with the left and right sides fused at the midline of the chest. These features signified that megaraptorans were wide-bodied theropods, akin to the condition in tyrannosaurids.  Forelimbs  Megaraptorans have a sigmoid (S-shaped) humerus (forearm bone), similar to that of both basal allosauroids and basal coelurosaurs. Most megaraptorans had large, robust humeri akin to those of Allosaurus, but the basal-most member Fukuiraptor has a much more slender humerus. The distal part of the humerus (near the elbow) has a well-developed system of condyles and grooves similar to that of coelurosaurs, particularly the dromaeosaurids.260x260pxThe ulna of megaraptorids is characteristic in several regards. The olecranon process is well-developed, though it is thin, blade-like, and extends as a crest longitudinally down the shaft of the ulna. In addition, megaraptorids have acquired another long, crest-like structure on the ulna called the lateral tuberosity, which is perpendicular to the blade of the olecranon. As a result, the ulna of megaraptorids is T-shaped in cross section, with three prongs formed by the forward-projection anterior process, the outwards-projecting lateral tuberosity, and the backwards-projecting olecranon process. These adaptations are absent in the most basal megaraptoran, Fukuiraptor. The radius is not unusual compared to other theropods. Megaraptorans also had very characteristic hands. The first two fingers were large and slender, but the third one was small. These relative differences in finger length are somewhat similar to the case in tyrannosauroids and various other basal coelurosaurs, but the megaraptoran trend of forearm and finger enlargement is opposite to the trend towards forearm diminishment which characterizes advanced tyrannosauroids. Megaraptor retained a vestigial fourth metacarpal, the hand bone that would have connected to the fourth finger in early dinosaurs. This was a primitive feature lost by most other tetanurans. The first two fingers had absurdly large unguals (claws); in Megaraptor the first claw was larger than the entire ulna. Unlike the large unguals of many other theropods (megalosauroids, for example), megaraptoran claws were thin and oval-shaped in cross-section. These claws also had asymmetrically-positioned grooves on their flat faces and a sharp ridge on their lower edge in megaraptorids (non-Fukuiraptor megaraptorans). The carpus (wrist) of megaraptorans incorporated a semilunate (crescent-shaped) carpal similar to that of maniraptorans.  Hindlimbs  The left and right tibiae of Australovenator in multiple views. Note the structure of the front surface of the distal tip (seen in C and O). The femur (thigh bone) of megaraptorans is only known in Australovenator and Fukuiraptor, but it is similar to that of coelurosaurs in several respects. For example, the greater trochanter is well-developed and offset from the femoral shaft by a deep concavity. The size of the greater trochanter has the added effect of making the portion of the femur near the hip socket rectangular, when seen from above. In non-coelurosaur theropods, the greater trochanter is small, making the femur teardrop-shaped when seen from above. The femoral head is slightly upturned as in carcharodontosaurians (particularly carcharodontosaurids) and some coelurosaurs. In megaraptorans, the portion of the femur near the knee is asymmetrical when seen from the front due to the lateral condyle projecting further distally than the medial condyle. The tibia was also similar to that of coelurosaurs. It was a long and thin bone. The front of the lateral condyle of the tibia hooks downwards, similar to the condition in Neovenator, Tanycolagreus, and some tyrannosauroids. The medial and lateral malleoli are expanded and project away from each other, as in advanced tyrannosauroids (both) and carcharodontosaurians (medial malleolus only). The front surface of the distal tip of the tibia (near the ankle) had the form of a flattened facet for the reception of the astragalus bone of the ankle, similar to the case in coelurosaurs. The inner edge of this facet was defined by a ridge, a feature unique to megaraptorids. The upper edge of the facet lacked a well-defined supra-astragalar buttress, unlike allosauroids. The ascending process of the astragalus, which lays on the facet, is expanded into a large trapezoidal plate of bone, similar to coelurosaurs but unlike the small, triangular ascending process of allosauroids. Fukuiraptor, Australovenator, and Aerosteon have a distinct forward-pointing prong on the outer edge of the astragalus, and Fukuiraptor and Australovenator have an additional prong that projects backwards. The fibula is also long and strongly tapers away from the knee, as in coelurosaurs. It connects to a small facet on the outer edge of the astragalus (as in coelurosaurs) rather than a large facet on the upper edge (as in allosauroids). Near the knee and facing the tibia, the fibula has a wide groove or depression known as a proximomedial fossa. Metatarsal III, the foot bone which connected to the middle toe, was very long and slender in all megaraptorans, as in coelurosaurs. The joint for the middle toe is tall and pulley-shaped, with a deep and crescent-shaped depression visible from below.  Hip  The ilium of Aerosteon. Pneumatization is visible on the main blade in medial view (B) and the pubic peduncle in lateral view (A). The ilium (upper plate of the hip) was a heavily pneumatized bone, filled with air pockets and perforated by pits. The only other large theropod known to possess a pneumatic ilium is Neovenator. In some megaraptorans, the preacetabular blade has a notch along its front edge, as in tyrannosauroids. A stronger concavity was present a bit lower, between the preacetabular blade and pubic peduncle. This concavity, known as the cuppedicus (or preacetabular) fossa, was rimmed by a prominent shelf on the inner face of the ilium. This trait is also known in various coelurosaurs, Chilantaisaurus, and probably Neovenator. The postacetabular blade, on the other hand, lacks a large concavity. In non- coelurosaurian tetanurans, this portion of the ilium has a large depression known as a brevis fossa, which is visible from the outer face of the ilium. However, coelurosaurs and megaraptorans have a much smaller brevis fossa which occupies only a portion of the rear edge of the ilium, and it is mostly hidden from outside observers. The ischium (rear lower plate of the hip) is only know in Murusraptor. It is slightly expanded, similar to that of carcharodontosaurids. The pubis (front lower plate of the hip) has a much more pronounced scythe-like expansion at its tip, which is over 60% as long as the main shaft of the bone. This adaptation, known as a pubic boot, is also known in carcharodontosaurians and tyrannosaurids. The pubis is also expanded near its contact with the ilium. The left and right pubic bones are not entirely fused to each other, they are separated along their midline by an oval-shaped hole. Evolution and origin The origins of megaraptorans have recently been determined. Studies by paleontologists Phil Bell, Steve Salisbury et al. of a newly discovered, as-yet-unnamed megaraptorid (referred to by the public media as \\"Lightning Claw,\\" and possibly synonymous with Rapator) from opal fields southwest of Lightning Ridge, Australia, dating back 110 million years ago reveals that megaraptorans likely evolved in Australia, then spread to the rest of Gondwana in an episode of evolutionary radiation. The specimen also allowed for alternative phylogenetic testing as to the placement of megaraptorans as either tyrannosauroids or carcharodontosaurids. Classification  Early hypotheses  The genera which make up Megaraptora had been placed in a number of different theropod groups before the formation of the clade in 2010. Megaraptor and Fukuiraptor were independently considered to be giant dromaeosaurids when they were first discovered in the 1990s due to the large hand claws being misidentified as foot claws. However, these mistakes were rectified after closer inspection of the holotype (in the case of Fukuiraptor) or the discovery of new specimens (in the case of Megaraptor). By the mid-to-late 2000s, they were considered to be basal tetanurans, usually members of Allosauroidea. Smith et al. (2008) reported Megaraptor-like ulnae from Australia, and found evidence that Megaraptor was a spinosauroid. The same year, Orkoraptor was described as an unusual giant coelurosaurian with some similarities with the much smaller compsognathids. Aerosteon was considered a relative of Allosaurus in its description less than a year later, while Australovenator was considered to be the sister taxon to Carcharodontosauridae.  Placement within Neovenatoridae  This influx of new data in the late 2000s led to several major reanalyses of basal tetanuran phylogenetics, with interesting implications for these taxa. A study by Roger Benson, Matt Carrano & Steve Brusatte in 2010 found that Allosauroidea (or Carnosauria, as it was sometimes called) included a major subdivision known as Carcharodontosauria, which was split into the Carcharodontosauridae and a newly named family: Neovenatoridae. Neovenatorids, as formulated by these authors, contained Neovenator, Chilantaisaurus, and a newly named clade: Megaraptora. Megaraptora contained Megaraptor, Fukuiraptor, Orkoraptor, Aerosteon, and Australovenator. These genera were allied with the other neovenatorids on the basis of several features spread out throughout the skeleton, particularly the large amount of pneumatization present. The pneumatic ilium of Aerosteon was particularly notable, as Neovenator was the only other taxon known to have that trait at the time. Neovenatorids were envisioned as the latest-surviving allosauroids, which were able to persist well into the Late Cretaceous due to their low profile and coelurosaur-like adaptations. Later studies supported this hypothesis, such as Carrano, Benson & Sampson (2012)'s large study of tetanuran relationships, and Zanno & Makovicky (2013)'s description of the newly discovered theropod Siats, which they placed within Megaraptora. Fukuiraptor and Australovenator were consistently found to be close relatives of each other; this was also the case for Aerosteon and Megaraptor; Orkoraptor was a \\"wildcard\\" taxon difficult to place with certainty. The cladogram below illustrates the most recent revision of the Benson, Carrano, & Brusatte (2010) hypothesis that megaraptorans were allosauroids within the family Neovenatoridae. The cladogram follows Coria & Currie (2016), who added Murusraptor to the study and utilized the family Megaraptoridae, which was originally named by Novas et al. (2013).  Placement within Tyrannosauroidea  However, an alternative hypothesis was forming, first published as an Ameghiniana abstract by Fernando Novas et al. (2012). Novas and his colleagues argued that the features used to link Neovenator to Megaraptora were more widespread than the 2010 paper implied, and that the proposed coelurosaurian convergences may have signified a legitimate connection between Megaraptora and Coelurosauria. In addition, they noted that Benson, Carrano, & Brusatte only sampled three coelurosaurs in their analysis. Novas et al.'s arguments were formulated and published in a 2013 review of patagonian theropods, which removed Megaraptora from the Carcharodontosauria and instead placed the group within Coelurosauria. More specifically, megaraptorans were found to be deep within the Tyrannosauroidea, a radiation of basal coelurosaurs including the famed tyrannosaurids. As Novas et al. (2013) removed Megaraptora from Neovenatoridae, they named a new family, Megaraptoridae, which contained all Megaraptorans apart from the basal (\\"primitive\\") taxon Fukuiraptor. They found little evidence that Chilantaisaurus, Neovenator, or Siats were megaraptorans, but they did place the tyrannosauroid Eotyrannus within Megaraptora. Despite the hypothesized close relation between megaraptorans and tyrannosaurids, Novas et al. noted that the megaraptoran lineage had a functional morphology which diverged in a direction opposite to the tyrannosaurids. While tyrannosaurids had small arms and large, powerful heads, megaraptorans had large arms, giant claws, and relatively weak jaws. The skull of a newly discovered juvenile specimen of Megaraptor, published in 2014, supported this hypothesis due to its similarities to the skull of basal tyrannosauroids such as Dilong. Nevertheless, megaraptorans still retained many similarities to carcharodontosaurians such as Neovenator, so the uncertainty behind their classification was not fully resolved. The cladogram below illustrates the results of a study which supports the Novas et al. (2013) hypothesis that megaraptorans are derived tyrannosauroids. This study was Porfiri et al. (2014), which described the juvenile Megaraptor specimen. Gualicho, Murusraptor, and Tratayenia were not yet described when this study was undertaken. In 2016, Novas and his colleagues published a study of megaraptoran hand anatomy, in an attempt to help settle the question of their classification. They found that megaraptorans lacked most of the key features in the hands of derived coelurosaurs including Guanlong and Deinonychus. Instead, their hands retain a number of primitive characteristics seen in basal tetanurans such as Allosaurus. Nevertheless, there are still a number of traits that support megaraptorans as members of the Coelurosauria. A 2016 study of the \\"lightning ridge megaraptoran\\" by Bell et al. supported the idea that megaraptorans were tyrannosauroids based on the fact that Porfiri et al. (2014) incorporated skull data from Megaraptor and a wider variety of coelurosaurians compared to Benson, Carrano, & Brusatte (2010). Motta et al. (2016) agreed, and proposed that a new fragmentary patagonian theropod, Aoniraptor, was a non-megaraptorid megaraptoran. Their study also noted the similaritires between Aoniraptor, the enigmatic theropod Deltadromeus, and Bahariasaurus, a giant African theropod with remains destroyed by World War II bombings. Therefore, they suggested that Bahariasaurus and Deltadromeus were also basal megaraptorans, and that Aoniraptor, Bahariasaurus, and Deltadromeus could have formed a distinct family, the Bahariasauridae. A 2019 redescription of Murusraptor by Rolando, Novas, & Agnol√≠n continued to find Megaraptora in a polytomy at the base of Tyrannosauroidea, based on the dataset of Apesteguia et al. (2016).  Placement within non-Tyrannosauroidea Coelurosauria  In 2016, a third hypothesis for megaraptoran relations was derived from Porfiri et al. (2014)'s revision to the Novas et al. dataset. That year, Sebastian Apestegu√≠a and his colleagues described an unusual new theropod, Gualicho. The addition of Gualicho, Deltadromeus, and several corrections within the Novas et al. dataset led to an interesting result. Megaraptorans were far removed from the position deep within Tyrannosauroidea which the Novas et al. dataset had originally supported. Allosauroidea was rendered a paraphyletic grade, with carcharodontosaurids, Neovenator, a clade formed by Chilantaisaurus and Gualicho, and finally Megaraptora progressively closer to traditional coelurosaurs. Another study, Porfifi et al. (2018), expanded on the dataset of Apestegu√≠a et al. (2016) by adding two additional megaraptorids. Although the results are different, the methodology analysis was practically identical to that of Apesteguia et al. (2016), only differing in the fact that it incorporated two megaraptorans not sampled in the analysis of Apesteguia et al. One of these was Murusraptor, which was described in 2016 around the same time as Gualicho. The second was a new megaraptorid, Tratayenia. Porfiri et al. (2018) placed Tratayenia and Murusraptor as megaraptorids, with Fukuiraptor as the basalmost megaraptoran as found by all previous revisions to the Novas et al. dataset. However, Megaraptora was in a polytomy at the very base of Coelurosauria, along with Chilantaisaurus, Gualicho, and Tyrannoraptora (\\"traditional \\" coelurosaurs). Non-coelurosaurian avetheropods were also subjected to a large polytomy owing to the unstable position of Neovenator. Porfiri et al. (2018) also commented on Motta et al. (2016)'s erection of Bahariasauridae, and noted that Gualicho may be a bahariasaurid in light of its similarities with Deltadromeus. If this was the case, then megaraptorans experienced much more diversity in their forelimbs than previously considered; Gualicho had very small, tyrannosaurid-like forelimbs. In late 2018, Delcourt & Grillo published a study focusing on tyrannosauroids. They reused Porfiri et al. (2018)'s analysis, though corrected some scores and added data from recent studies. The study returned Neovenator to a monophyletic Allosauroidea, and placed megaraptorans as basal non- tyrannosauroid coelurosaurs close to Chilantaisaurus and Gualicho. Murusraptor was also placed as the second-most basal megaraptoran, ahead of Fukuiraptor. The cladogram below follows the results of Delcourt & Grillo (2018)'s phylogenetic analysis.

They are visible at night, unlike overhead wire markers which rely on daylight. Conductor marking lights Background Power distribution on overhead power lines, often suspended to widely spaced masts, represents an almost invisible obstacle to low flying aircraft, requiring the installation of warning beacons on the masts themselves. A simple and cost-effective solution to this problem is installing the marking lights directly on the wires. Nevertheless, there are significant technical difficulties to a low-cost extraction of power from a distribution system which carries high voltages and wide-range AC current. Moreover, the warning system should not add to the existing power distribution lines the burden of additional cabling, with its potential serious isolation problems. These facts rule out the recourse to conventionally powered light sources. Power supply  The ideal warning light must be able to power itself while clamped to a single wire of the line. Lights may be powered either from the electric field surrounding the energized wire, or the magnetic field produced by current through the wire. The first approach takes advantage of the high electric potential gradient between conductors, but a strong enough capacitive coupling is requested to allow capacitive extraction of the power required from the warning light. This means that long conductors must be suspended parallel to the line using glass/ceramic isolators: in fact several meters of suspended conductor are generally required, total length being inversely proportional to the line voltage. The second approach is based on Faraday's law of induction involving magnetic flux flowing through a circuit which powers the warning light. Inductive coupling device Inductive coupling device (about 8 kg weight) This beacon is powered by the magnetic field surrounding the power distribution wire and uses an electronic circuit integrated in a compact clamp-on warning light. The operating principle is that of a Rogowski coil, similar to a current transformer. This solution is usually intended for medium and high voltage lines up to 440 kV. However inductive coupling devices are able to work on any AC at 50 Hz or 60 Hz, from 15 up to 2000 Amps.

Interference  The most important problem encountered in broadcasting via terrestrial transmitters is the interference from other broadcasters. In principle, each broadcaster has a different radio frequency (planned by the public authority) in a common reception area to avoid interference from each other. However still there are two problems: spurious radiation of adjacent channels and fringe reception. Fringe reception is unintended reception under certain weather conditions. The exceptionally long- range reception means that the receiver may be tuned to more than one transmitter (transmitting at same frequency) at the same time. These transmitters may transmit programs of different broadcasters as well as the programs of the same broadcaster. In analogue transmission, even the transmitters transmitting the very same program interfere each other because of phase differences of the incoming signal, but in digital transmission the transmitters transmitting the same program in the same channel may reinforce each other.  The shift in RF  In order to reduce the interference from the fringe area transmitters transmitting in the same channels, a method named frequency offset is often used. By this method, a slightly shifted RF is assigned for a transmitter which may experience interference from other transmitters. In TV transmission, the shifted RF is calculated by the formula; :f_{os} = f_{ch} + \\\\frac{f_L\\\\cdot p}{12} where, :f_{os} is the offset RF, : f_{ch} is the standard channel frequency, :p is an integer such that -12 or 0>p>12 :f_L is the line frequency.

The story is not recounted in the Gospels of either John or Mark. According to these accounts, a Roman centurion asks Jesus for his help because his servant is ill. Jesus offers to go to the centurion's house to perform a healing, but the centurion hesitates and suggests that Jesus' word of authority would be sufficient. Impressed, Jesus comments approvingly at the strong religious faith displayed by the soldier (despite not being a Jew) and grants the request, which results in the servant being healed the same day. Sources Scriptural sources The story of the Centurion appears both in the Gospel of Matthew and that of Luke: Matthew 8:5‚Äì13 (TNIV) Luke 7:1‚Äì10 (TNIV) Origins The story of the Centurion is not mentioned in the Gospel of Mark, the earliest of the four gospels. One theory is that material not in Mark but found in both Matthew and Luke may have came from a lost source known as \\"Q\\". If true then this passage would still be an anomaly as Q is believed to have been a collection of sayings of Jesus (a list of sermons and quotations) with no other contextual material; but the story of the Centurion does include background detail. It would also be the only miracle story that originated in Q. One possibility is that only the dialogue was in Q, and both Matthew and Luke added the background details from a shared oral history. The Gospel of John does narrate the account of Jesus healing the son of a royal official at Capernaum at a distance in . Some modern commentatorsFred Craddock: Luke, 2009 , page 94 treat them as the same event. However, in his analysis of Matthew, R. T. France presents linguistic arguments against the equivalence of pais and son and considers these two separate miracles.The Gospel according to Matthew: an introduction and commentary by R. T. France 1987 page 154 Merrill C. Tenney in his commentary on JohnMerrill Tenney: John, Expositor's Bible Commentary, vol. 9, Zondervan. and Orville Daniel in his Gospel harmonyOrville Daniel: A Harmony of the Four Gospels, 2nd Ed, Baker Books Pub. also consider them two different incidents. Use in the liturgy The words of the Centurion are used in the Prayer of Humble Access contained in many Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, and other Christian Eucharist liturgies.Marion Hatchett, Commentary on the American Prayerbook, New York: Seabury Press, 1981. p. 382 The words are also used as part of the Communion rite in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Interpretations According to I. Howard Marshall, there were no Roman forces in Galilee prior to AD 44; therefore, the soldier was probably a member of Herod Agrippa's troops, which modeled Roman organization. While his nationality is not given, he is clearly a Gentile.Marshall, I. Howard, The Gospel of Luke, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1978, p. 279 Meaning of \\"servant\\" Luke 7:2 and 7:10 refer to the person to be healed as doulos, unambiguously meaning \\"servant\\" but has the Centurion himself call him \\"pais\\" ‚Äì which has a number of more ambiguous meanings including \\"child\\" (e.g., , \\"son\\" () and, \\"servant\\" (, ).  Gnostic interpretation  In his Against Heresies, Irenaeus tells us that some Gnostics believed the story to be metaphorical, with the centurion being merely a symbol of the demiurge. According to this interpretation, the demiurge tells Jesus that he has tried all he could to save the servant (humanity) but his laws have not succeeded in healing humanity or offering it a proper means towards spiritual development. Accordingly, the demiurge urges Jesus to say a word (spread gnosis) to offer true salvation to humanity. Irenaeus, Against Heresies, Book 1 chapter 7  Homosexual interpretation  Daniel A. Helminiak, an American Catholic Priest, theologian and author of \\"What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality\\", states that the word pais, used for the servant, could have a sexual meaning. Theodore W. Jennings Jr. and Tat-Siong Benny Liew, also authors of various Christian books, further write that Roman historical data about patron-client relationships and about same-sex relations among soldiers support the view that the pais in Matthew's account is the centurion's \\"boy-lover\\", and that the centurion, therefore, did not want Jesus to enter his house for fear perhaps that the boy would be enamoured of Jesus instead. The Roman military historian D.B. Saddington writes that while he does not exclude the possibility, the evidence the two put forward supports \\"neither of these interpretations\\".

History Its motley line-up mainly focuses on electronic musicians and aims at a professional audience as well as the general public. The fact that its open-air concerts are free of charge makes Les Siestes √©lectroniques a rare occurrence within the landscapes of European festivals. Les Siestes offers an opportunity to experience contemporary music though concerts, club nights, workshops and sometimes exhibitions. The festival runs for four or five days, usually starting on a Wednesday or a Thursday in the last week of June. Next edition of the festival will be held June 26‚Äì29, 2014. Les Siestes Electroniques has been an event by Rotation since 2002. Since 2011 the festival falls into two editions. One takes place in Toulouse and the other in Paris at the Mus√©e du quai Branly. Born of a reflection around the themes of the cultural diversity, the parisian edition proposes to musicians an exceptional access to the audio collection of the museum (dedicated to non- occidental cultures). These musicians will thus be invited to sample a set of resources of an unsuspected wealth, and then to replay it during an ultimate public event which is free and open-air  Line-Up  *2013 @ Toulouse: Marvin, Pneu, Electric Electric, Papier Tigre, Bipolar, Dscrd, Polar Inertia, Cold, DIY Music Academy, Redshape, The Analogue Cops, Dj Deep, Polygron, Sturqen, Cut Hands, Boston Bun, Paris Suit Yourself, Andy Stott, Spectral Park, Redinho @ Paris: Vincent Moon, Kangding Ray, Sinner DC, Pierre Bastien, Sylvain Chauveau, Low Jack, Dj Arc de Triomphe, Gangpol & Mit *2012 @ Toulouse: Nils Frahm, Elektro Guzzi, Hypnolove, Funkineven, Pional, John Talabot, Saaad, Morphosis, Matthew Friedberger, James Blackshaw, Kassem Mosse, Tom Terrien, Tanya Tagaq, Aymeric Hainaux, Bruce Lamont, Luke Abbott @ Paris: Plapla Pinky, Keith Fullerton Whithman, Alan Bishop, Hicham Chadly, Sam Tiba, Jean Nipon, Doug Shipton, NLF3, Arandel *2011 @ Toulouse: Villa Nah, Lone, Umberto, Connan Mockasin, James Pants, Ata, Prins Thomas, Arto Mwambe, Oliver Hafenbauer, Etienne Tron, Shangaan Electro, DIRTY Soundsystem, Arnaud Fleurent Didier, Cadik Travel Agency, Lucrecia Dalt, Jess & Crabe @ Paris: Paris : D√©bruit, Pilooski, The Berg Sans Nipple, Bimbo Tower Sound System, Secousse Sound System, Awesome Tapes From Africa, Romain BNO, Laurent Jeanneau *2010 : Kawabata Makoto, Keiji Haino, Stanley Brinks, Pantha du Prince, Joakim, Jackson and his computer band, Es, The Ruby Suns, Machine Drum, Mount Kimbie, Junior Boys, Rebolledo, Chateau Marmont, Marc D√©mereau, Aquaserge *2009 : Alva Noto, Ariel Pink, Para One & San Serac, Kim Hiorthoy, Dominique Leone, Hudson Mohawke, Fukkk Offf, Prosumer, Suicide Club, Anoraak, The Eternals, Lawrence, Isol√©e, Dj Koze, Ghostape, Etienne Jaumet, Half a rainbow, Larytta *2008 : Atom Heart, Tenori-On, Bertrand Burgalat, Fancy, Turzi, Sebastien Tellier, Lindstr√∏m, Damon & Naomi, Damian Lazarus, Les Shades, So So Modern, American Tourister, A Mountain of One, Milky Globe & Isan, The Emperor Machine, Mondkopf, Dapayk & Padberg, Errorsmith *2007 : Para One, Superpitcher, Pascal Comelade, Sebastien Tellier, Fujiya & Miyagi, Joakim, Robert Henke, Appleblim, Pierre Bastien, Charlemagne Palestine, Xela, Kammerflimmer Kollektief, Ch√¢teau Flight, Echo, Todd Terje, Marco Passarani, Henning, Angel, Anton Prize, Pigna People *2006 : Juan Atkins, Modeselektor, Legowelt, Kevin Blechdom, A Hawk and a Hacksaw, Toshiyuki Yasuda, Schneider TM, Ada, Justus Koehncke, Taylor Savvy, Hauscka, Marion Lambert, Daniel Wang, Tellemake, Midi & Demix, France Copland, Koyote & Goon, Electroluxe, Midaircondo, Krikor, Ensemble, Avia Gardner, Opiate, Juicy Panic *2005 : DAT Politics, Vladislav Delay, Agf, Marc Collin, Jan Jelinek, Sylvain Chauveau, Modeselektor, Feadz, Mike Dred, Magnetophone, Funckarma, Thomas Fehlman, Rex The Dog, Dexima, Fedaden, Trapist, Brooks, Masha Qrella, Phonem, N√¥ze, Daniel Meteo *2004 : Funkst√∂rung, Richard Devine, Lusine ICL, Dabrye, Arovane, Bernhard Fleischmann, Tujiko Noriko, Benge, Jonas Bering, Yoshihiro Hanno, Orchestre de chambre de Toulouse, Sink, Suzywan, Donna Regina, T√©l√©fax, Aoki Takamasa, Gangpol und Mit, Cabanne, Won, Domotic, The Konki Duet, Softland, Ark *2003 : Sylvain Chauveau, Murcof, Colleen, Hermann & Kleine, Apparat, VS Price, Hensley, Sogar, Arco5, Del Wire, Braille & Angstr√∂m Crew, Aoki Takamasa, Miles Whittaker, Aurel, Bmx  International Edition  Since 2007, Les Siestes Electroniques have developed internationally their project. *Les Siestes Electroniques @ BERLIN, January 2007 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ RIGA, April 2007 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ LA HAYE, September 2007 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ CAIRO, February 2008 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ KYOTO, October 2008 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ MONTREAL, August 2009 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ BRAZZAVILLE, November 2010 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ BERLIN, February 2011 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ BERLIN, September 2011 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ ABU DHABI, June 2012 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ BERLIN, September 2012 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ BRAZZAVILLE, November 2012 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ MONTEVIDEO & BUENOS AIRES, April 2013 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ AMSTERDAM, June 2013 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ MONTR√âAL, July 2013 *Les Siestes Electroniques @ SAIGON & HANOI, October 2013 See also *List of electronic music festivals  External links  * official webpage Category:Music festivals established in 2003 Category:Toulouse Category:Tourist attractions in Haute-Garonne Category:Electronic music festivals in France Category:Electroacoustic music festivals ","title":"Les Siestes Electroniques"},{"id":"24759172","text":"Youth Development Administration The Youth Development Administration (YDA; ;Bopomofo :„Ñã„Ñß„Ñ¢Àä „Ñà„Ñö „Ñì„Ñ¢Àá „Ñï„Ñ®Àá) is a branch of the Ministry of Education of the Taiwan (ROC) with a responsibility for youth affairs.

The ship is owned by Swire Shipping and registered in Hong Kong. She has also sailed under the names, Pacific Challenger, and Changsa. Coral Sea oil spill As MV Pacific Adventurer, the vessel was sailing from Newscastle to the Port of Brisbane. During rough seas created by Cyclone Hamish 230 tonnes of fuel oil, 30 tonnes of other fuel and 31 shipping containers (620 tonnes) of ammonium nitrate spilled into the Coral Sea, off the coast from Cape Moreton. 100,000 litres of oil washed up on the coasts of Queensland resulting in the area being declared a disaster zone by Premier Anna Bligh. The leak was contained before reaching Hamilton Wharf in Brisbane, the nearest port. The ship then leaked oil while docked in the Brisbane River which caused another 500 m long oil slick. After the Australian Maritime Safety Authority inspected the ship and declared her seaworthy it left Brisbane in April 2009 with a new captain at the helm. In August 2009 the ships owners agreed to pay $25 million compensation. Totals costs for cleaning up after the spill reached $34 million.

Its aim is to expand the knowledge of the philately of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory located at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar. The study circle looks at the philately of Gibraltar in all its forms for the benefit of collectors (philatelists) from all walks of life. This includes studying the postal history, postage stamps, revenue stamps, postal stationery and associated overprints from Gibraltar and any of these used in Morocco. Any new information is shared with the membership via its quarterly journal, \\"The Rock\\", which has been published since 1975, showing articles of interest not only to philatelists but also historians, artists and sociologists. The society has bi-annual meetings over a long weekend, mostly in the UK but sometimes in Gibraltar. The Spring meeting is generally held for the Annual General Meeting whilst the other is held in the Autumn for the annual competition, at which displays of a wide variety of philately related material are shown - not just stamps, but any historical or artistic artefacts with a (sometimes tenuous) link to Gibraltar philately. The Study Circle welcomes members from all corners of the globe, whatever your level of expertise or area of interest. The circle is not to be confused with the Gibraltar Philatelic Society which is based in Gibraltar itself.

It is usually conducted during the second week of November every year. The 2019 edition is occurring on 22-24 November. History IIM Indore hosted the first edition of its management festival, Iris during 2‚Äì5 November 2001. Iris started as a national management festival with participation from all the premier B-schools of India. It served as the platform for the brightest minds of India to exhibit their potential in the various facets of management - Finance, Marketing, Human Resources, Operations, Strategy and Information Technology. The 2008 edition of the event featured participants from more than 30 business schools in India. In the year 2009, IRIS evolved into Ahvan, literally meaning \\"evocation\\" in Sanskrit. It signifies a call to the nation, for awakening, commitment, collaboration and action, only to be renamed back to IRIS in 2014. Themes for IRIS * 2010: \\"Inspire to Act, Act to Inspire\\" * 2011: \\"Lead to Transform\\" Events Ashwamedha Ashwamedha, spread over 45 days, aims to select 'India's best leader' among the best managerial talent in the country. It tests the candidates in aspects like decision making, teamwork under highly stressful conditions. The event tests the contestants on a broad repertoire of qualities like leadership, intellect, teamwork and ingenuity. In the final round, the top three candidates are put under the 'Spotlight' in an extremely tense public interview conducted by a select panel of judges. Bulls n Bears Bulls n Bears is the finance spot event at Ahvan where the contestants trade the traditional way - by shouting and finding the counter-party and negotiating the price to execute their trades. Participants trade on stocks, derivatives and commodities as they try to make sense of the news flow and market sentiments. Chain Reaction Chain Reaction is the supply chain management event of Ahvan where the competing teams have to manage the various components of the value chain ranging from the manufacturer to the distributor while considering inventory levels, production possibilities, quality requirements and customer consumptions. It is a simulation game that checks the teams' risk taking capabilities and their ability to apply the theories of Operations Management to real-life scenarios. Chanakya Conceptualised in 2010, Chanakya is the consulting flagship event of IRIS. The event aims to test contestants on skills integral to a successful consulting career like client management, problem structuring, innovative thinking and presenting a feasible solution. The first round is the elimination round in which the teams have to submit solutions to small caselets involving multiple aspects of business like HR, Finance and Marketing. The second round involves a real-life case to be solved in conjunction with the clients. The teams selected for the final round have to defend their solutions in front of a distinguished panel of industry leaders and academicians. Entrepid Entrepid is an interactive business simulation event which deals with management issues across industries. The participating teams are required to own and manage several business units with the aim of creating vertical and horizontal synergies across the supply chain. Each team will take management control for 60 months in which their decisions regarding strategic positioning, production levels and inventory management would affect the profitability of the company driving the share prices. Envision Envision is the speaker series of IIM Indore where distinguished speakers from all walks of life converge to IIM Indore to express their perspectives on creating tomorrow's world leaders. The speaker series is conducted with the annual management summit forming the backdrop of the talks. The ensemble of speakers encompasses a wide cross-section of areas like business, public administration, social development and many more. Industry leaders share their experience, insights and ideas around a host of issues that are pertinent to the central theme of Ahvan. The discussions ensure that the exchange of ideas and dissemination of knowledge is meaningful, thought provoking and inspiring for the audience. Over the years, IIM Indore and Ahvan have played host to eminent speakers like the Dalai Lama, Mr. Sam Pitroda, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Mr. M. Damodaran, Mr. S. Ramadorai, Mr. Jyotiraditya Scindia, Mr. Gurcharan Das, Mr. N.R. Narayana Murthy, Mr. P. Harshavardhan, Mr. Philip Jackson and many more. At Ahvan '09, Mr. V. Shankar.MD and CEO of Rallis India spoke about wealth creation at his company. Finance League Finance League started at Ahvan '09. The event is designed to test the overall finance knowledge including banking, insurance, and capital markets. The preliminary round is an online quiz testing the knowledge in various domains of finance and the latest happenings in the corporate world. The second round is an online market simulation game where the participants are tested on their trading acumen. The third round is a variation of board game, Monopoly, in which the participants try to create a monopoly in their industries to capture competitive advantage. The event culminates in a debate on the contemporary issues in Finance testing the understanding of current affairs and communication skills of the teams. Gordian Knot Gordian Knot has transformed from being a part of the B-plan competition Sanjeevani at IRIS 2008 to a flagship event at Ahvan 2010. The event tests the thinking ability of the participating teams in the real world by giving them real-life tasks to be performed across the city of Indore. I-Rising I-rising is a series of online quizzes spanning over a month which serves as a prelude to the management festival, Ahvan. It attracts participation from people across professions and not just students. Kalpavriksha Kalpavriksha, the social b-plan contest of Ahvan, is one of the most prestigious business plan events across the country. It was conceptualized in 2006 with the focus on sensitizing the participants about their responsibility and the potential difference they can make. It provides a platform for budding entrepreneurs to showcase self-sustainable B-plans with a strong societal focus. The event has been associated with reputed sponsors like Infosys, Tata Group, Deloitte and Cognizant. Kalpavriksha has also tied up with Foster Business School, Seattle since 2008, whereby the winnerof Kalpavriksha secures a direct entry in the semi-finals of the \\"Global Social Entrepreneurship Competition\\". The finalists are offered mentorship under the knowledge partners and faculty coordinators of the event to make the plan viable. Finalists of Kalpavriksha '08, Team \\"Aahar: Meals for Poor at Rs.5\\", went on to win GSEC '09. Klueless Klueless is the annual online puzzle (or Online Treasure Hunt as it is popularly known as) which was launched in October 2005 by students of IIM Indore as an event during the annual management summit Ahvan of IIM Indore. It now ranks itself amongst the most popular Indian puzzles of its kind, with enthusiasts from over 1100 cities in over 80 countries logging in to play the game every year, being the first of its kind in India. The game has seen its player base grow over the years to nearly 3 million hits in the previous edition alone, and usually registers over a million hits within 3‚Äì4 days of commencement. Modeled on the lines of the popular Notpron, which has also been tagged as \\"The Hardest Riddle on the Internet\\", this game too follows a linear format where players are required to solve each level by using hints in different parts of the page - the URL, the Source Code, the page title, image names and the images themselves. Off late though, it has also brought in the concept of non-linearity, thus making it closer to a real-life treasure hunt. The players who solve a level get to progress on to the next level and on eventual completion of the game, get to the Kluless Hall of Fame. The game differentiates itself from most other by having a fresh edition every year, with an altogether new set of puzzles. Each year, the game's developers, work towards creating an entirely different set of 30 to 40 quizzical levels, making a conscious effort to avoid repetition of similar levels over the editions. Now in its 15th year running, the themes for different levels range over a broad spectrum of topics, from popular comic book and movie references, to mathematical and advanced computing concepts. Launched around the month of October each year, quizzers and puzzle fanatics from all across the world spend close to 3 entire days trying to crack the game and enter the game's Hall of Fame. With the number of spots in this Hall of Fame varying across years, the objective for most players is not only to solve the levels by hook or by crook, but is also to do it the fastest, which makes the game highly competitive. http://www.livemint.com/2010/11/12205551/The-kult-of-the-Klueless.html Live wire Live wire is the annual concert held as the last event of the festival.

Residents lived there from the summer of 1944 to the beginning of 1946. The region of Dalmatia (in today's modern Croatia, then Yugoslavia) was evacuated by the Allies, ahead of a German invasion in 1944. The camp was disbanded in 1946 after the war ended. Background Fleeing the German offensive in the beginning of 1944, a large number of civilians (over 30,000) in fear of reprisals, escaped to the island of Vis. Vis had been established as the Headquarters for the Partisan army. The allied British army was not able to accept so many people who were fleeing to Italy. It was decided that the non-combatant population of the island and evacuated refugees would be sent to southern Italy. Firstly they were sent to Bari, and then to Taranto. The refugees were mostly from Makarska (around 6,000), Vodice, Hvar, Vis, Korƒçula, Ravni Kotari and Bukovica. There was heavy fighting in Italy between the Allied forces and the Germans. It was decided to transfer the refugees to Egypt, which was then under the British control. The camp  The camp was located near the Suez Canal. It was divided into five smaller bases. Refugees were housed in tents (average one to two families per tent). Although far from home and living in poor conditions, they tried to preserve the illusion of normal life. They established schools, various workshops, a shared laundry, and issued a newspaper (Our Paper/Na≈° List). One tent was designated as a church. Josip Hatze, a famous Split-born composer and conductor, who was in his later years, spent his time organizing choirs. People from Dalmatia had difficulty adjusting to desert conditions, especially children who suffered from intestinal diseases. Many of them died. The British government also kept a strict regime, allowing exit from the complex only with passes. On several occasions, the area of El Shatt was bombed. More than 30,000 people lived in the refugee camp for a total of 18 months. During their time in the camp, there were 300 marriages. Additionally 650 children were born. They returned home at the beginning of 1946 when the war was over and a more stable political situation in Yugoslavia was established. At the place of their exile rests a graveyard with 825 graves of people who did not withstand the tough conditions of life in the desert. Legacy John Corsellis, a British worker (who later became an author) at the camp wrote, \\"People mysteriously appeared and disappeared with a frequency reminiscent of a popular transit hotel\\". He also added, \\"I must not give the impression that these people created a little paradise here on the desert with their resourcefulness. Their extreme lack of everything only makes what they do more impressive, standing as it does against such a background.\\" The refugees were mostly women and children. The Refugee cemetery was seriously damaged in the Six-Day War in 1967.http://www.croatia.org/crown/articles/6971/1/E-The-memorial-at-El-Shatt- is-silent.html Finally, in 2003 with the support of the Croatian government, a memorial site was established.

The computer servers holding the data were run by Microsoft. The brand of phone affected was the Danger Hiptop, also known as the \\"Sidekick\\", and were connected via the T-Mobile cellular network. At the time, it was described as the biggest disaster in cloud computing history. T-Mobile Sidekick 2 The Sidekick smartphones were originally produced by Danger, Inc., a company that was bought by Microsoft in February 2007. After the acquisition, the former Danger staff were then absorbed into the Mobile Communications Business (MCB) of the Entertainment and Devices Division at Microsoft, where they worked on a future Microsoft mobile phone platform known as Project Pink. However, most of the ex-Danger employees soon left Microsoft to pursue other things. Microsoft took over the running of the data servers, and its data centers were hosting the customers' data at the time it was lost. On Friday, October 2, 2009, T-Mobile Sidekick phone users started noticing data service outages occurring. The outages lasted approximately two weeks, and on October 10, 2009, T-Mobile announced that personal information stored on Sidekick phones would be permanently lost, which turned out to be incorrect. According to the Financial Times, Microsoft said the data center it acquired from Danger 18 months previously had not been \\"updated to run on Microsoft technology.\\" A company statement said the mishap was due to \\"a confluence of errors from a server failure that hurt its main and backup databases supporting Sidekick users.\\" T-Mobile blamed Microsoft for the loss of data. The incident caused a public loss of confidence in the concept of cloud computing, which had been plagued by a series of outages and data losses in 2009. It also was problematic for Microsoft, which at the time was trying to convince corporate clients to use its cloud computing services, such as Azure and My Phone. On October 14, 2009, a class action lawsuit was launched against Microsoft and T-mobile. The lawsuit alleged: > T-Mobile and Microsoft promised to safeguard the most important data their > customers possess and then apparently failed to follow even the most basic > data protection principles. What they did is unthinkable in this day and > age. The class action lawsuit was settled in 2011, with affected users compensated with a \\"$35 T-Mobile gift card, a $17.50 check payment, or up to 12 free downloadable items.\\" On October 15, Microsoft said they had been able to recover most or all data and would begin to restore them. Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer disputed whether there had been a data loss at all, instead describing it as an outage. Ballmer said, ‚ÄúIt is not clear there was data loss\\". However, he said the incident was \\"not good\\" for Microsoft. Even before this data loss, Danger had marketed an application for Windows computers which would back up all Sidekick data onto a user's computer and also to allow changes to be made and then re-downloaded to the Sidekick in real-time. Users who had this backup storage option were able to save all of their data. In the United States, T-mobile marketed this application for a one-time charge of $10. Immediately after the data had been restored to all their users, T-mobile incorporated the Sidekick storage website with the regular T-mobile backup site. The application to the user's personal computer, the Danger backup site, and the T-mobile backup site could then be synchronized together.

More recently he has moved to New York and specialised in depictions of live music performances. Biography Bolle studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and Maryland Institute College of Art before setting up his studio in Chicago in the 80s. There he mounted many exhibits and workshops, some of which included musical performances. He also collaborated widely including multimedia performance group Environmental Encroachment, artist groups Mucky Three Plus One and The Ever-So-Secret-Order Of The Lamprey, and the All American Anti War Marching Band, with whom he appeared dressed as a vegetable playing the tuba. Bolle's work with springs started with an art car - The Spring Car - a car covered with springs. He parked the car outside the Art Chicago exhibit where it received much attention. By 1998 Bolle had extended his spring work to clothes and adopted the character of 'Springman' - an eccentric genteel superhero. He returned to Art Chicago with a second version of The Spring Car - a BMW 2002 painted red with blue circles and adorned with 5,000 chrome and iridescent plated springs and paraded around the exhibit as ' The Spring Ambassador'. Bolle continued to make his unofficial appearances at Art Chicago until 2001 when he was arrested. Bolle's The Spring Cow - a contribution to the Cows On Parade in 1999 - was well received. His 'Spring Bikini' received TV coverage. After moving to New York in 2005 Bolle did various projects, including Camouflage Installation at Chashama in Oct 2006., before settling on his current oeuvre of portraying live performances by musicians.

Life before 1848  His teacher Mih√°ly V√∂r√∂smarty influenced Perczel to become a democrat and patriot. In April 1827 he enrolled in the 5th Infantry Regiment as a student. In 1831 during the Polish November Uprising he started a rebellion in the Imperial Infantry. He tried to convince them to desert to the Polish soldiers, but they removed him. His political career started in Tolna shire county and later he became extremely radical. Afterwards he got more power in shire and rural politics. In the diet of 1843-44 he became a minister, and one of the most popular mavericks. His brave and enthusiastic speeches got everyone's attention. Later on he joined the Radical Party.

On 1 September 1848 he formed the Zr√≠nyi army and with his leadership they fought against Josip Jelaƒçiƒá. The members of the army were mostly volunteers. In the Battle of P√°kozd he covered the wing of the Hungarian army south of Lake Velence. After the battle he led the movements against Jelaƒçiƒá's army reserves.

During the army's withdrawal he received a letter from Lajos Kossuth and decided to fight against the Emperor. On 30 December 1848 he lost the battle against Jelaƒçiƒá in the Battle of M√≥r.

Then Perczel made contact with the Hungarians besieged in Petrovaradin fortress and established his center of operations there.Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \\"From the Theater of War: The Peasant War in Bukovina\\" (April 16, 1849: Neue Rheinsche Zeitung contained in the Collected Works: Volume 9, p. 289. Together with Count Lajos Batthyany, former Prime Minister of the new Hungarian Republic, but since 15 September 1848 a general in the Hungarian Army, Perczel move the main body Hungary military forces against Danube and the Drava Rivers to threaten Slavonia and to restrict Austrian navigation between Pest and Mohacs.Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \\"From the Theater of War (April 22, 1949, Neue Rheinsche Zeitung) contained in the Collected Works: Volume 9, p. 318. This action effectly cut off the Austrians on the western front from contact with Laval Nugent and Serbian forces in the southern front. The maneuver had the additional effect of sending the Austrians on the western front retreating back toward Zagreb in southwestern Hungary and Osijek.Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \\"From the Theater of War\\" (April 19, 1849, Neue Rheinsche Zeitung) contained in the Collected Works: Volume 9, p. 293. Marching back across the Banat toward the Theiss River, Perczel's army was stopped pushed into retreat by Serbian forces under Georg Stratimirovich, and Kusman von Todorovich.Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \\"From the Theater of War\\" (April 25, 1849, Neue Rheinsche Zeitung) contained in the Collected Works: Volume 9, p. 334. On 29 April at Melenci he won a battle against Tudorovic and on 10 May he marched on Panƒçevo. Later, with the contribution of General J√≥zsef Bem, he occupied Temesk√∂z. This brought the southern operations to a successful close. On 7 June 1849 Perczel fought against Jelaƒçiƒá, but he lost this battle at Kaƒá. Because of the defeat the government relieved him and gave an order to set up and lead the reserve army. In the middle of July another army joined Perczel's near Cegl√©d with Perczel as commander of the two, but he did not want to fight larger battles. When the government and the leading generals met, Perczel criticised the leadership, especially Lajos Kossuth. They forced him to resign his commission. Perczel fought as a volunteer in the Battle of Sz≈ëreg on 5 August 1849 and Battle of Temesv√°r on 9 August 1849. He was in Orsova when he heard news of the final surrender at Vil√°gos (now ≈ûiria, Romania).  Banishment  On 21 September 1851 Perczel and his brother Mikl√≥s (Michael) were sentenced to death. Perczel escaped to Turkey and in 1852 to England. He lived for a while on the Channel Island of Jersey. In 1859 Perczel tried to forget his arguments with Lajos Kossuth and traveled to Italy to help the Hungarian Nationals Trust, an organisation set up to help Hungarian emigrants.  Back home  In 1867 Perczel was allowed to return to Hungary and went back to Bonyh√°d, his birthplace. He was an advocate of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, but only because Kossuth was against it. After a short time as a delegate he retired and wrote his memoirs.

Biography He was born in Allenstein, East Prussia (today Olsztyn), then part of the German Empire. From 1923 he studied musicology in several universities‚ÄîUniversity of Heidelberg, University of Munich, and University of Leipzig‚Äîand also took courses at the Mannheim Conservatory. His teachers included Adolf Sandberger. He took the doctorate at the University of Leipzig in 1927, and then taught musicology first at the University of K√∂nigsberg, and then at the University of Bonn. Schrade's interests at the time lay mostly in early music: his Leipzig dissertation was on early organ music, and he completed the Habilitation in K√∂nigsberg in 1929 with a work on early instrumental music notation. Schrade left Germany for the USA in late 1930s. In 1938 he was appointed assistant professor at Yale University, where he went on to become associate professor (1943), and finally professor of music history (1948); all the while, from 1939, also working as director of graduate studies in music (1939‚Äì1958). In 1958 he succeeded Jacques Handschin as professor and director of the musicology institute at the University of Basel. Schrade held these positions until his death in 1964; he died at Sp√©rac√®des, France. Schrade's critical editions of works by Guillaume de Machaut, Francesco Landini, and other medieval composers (in the Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century series) are still of utmost importance for early music performers. He is also known today for his universal approach to the history of music: he worked not only on specialist topics such as medieval music, but also on works by Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, and many other composers. His large scale study of early opera composer Claudio Monteverdi, Monteverdi: Creator of Modern Music, still controversial among early music scholars, remains a key work in the evolution of critical attitudes towards the music of Monteverdi.Tommasini, Anthony, New York Times, August 17, 2007 Schrade founded and edited the Yale University Collegium Musicum series of critical editions (which included, during his time, first publications of the Wickhambrook Lute Manuscript, works by Alessandro Scarlatti, Michael Haydn, and others) and the Yale Studies in the History of Music series of publications; he also worked as co-editor of several journals, such as Journal of Renaissance and Baroque Music and Annales musicologiques.

She earned a Ph.D. in clinical psychology but instead chose to work in the field of genetics. The daughter of a Huntington's patient, she led a research team into a remote part of Venezuela where the disease is prevalent. She visited the villages of Laguneta, San Luis, and Barranquitas. She obtained samples of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from a large family with a majority of the members having Huntington's disease. The samples her team collected were instrumental in allowing a global collaborative research group to locate the gene that causes the disease. Wexler participated in the successful effort to create a chromosomal test to identify carriers of Huntington's Disease. Early life and Education Nancy Wexler was born 19 July 1945, in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Pacific Palisades, California and Topeka, Kansas. Wexler's father, Dr. Milton Wexler, was a psychoanalyst and clinical psychologist, and her mother was a geneticist who taught biology before her children were born. Both parents taught the girls different areas of science, including the environment, nature, physics, and astronomy. Wexler's grandfather died when her mother, Leonore, was only 15 years old. Leonore looked up Huntington's disease (HD) at the library and read that it was ‚Äúa fatal, inherited disease only affecting men.‚Äù Leonore's three brothers, Seymour, Paul, and Jesse Sabin, all suffered from HD and died within four years of each other. The diagnosis was kept a secret from the rest of the family for many years. The uncles were called \\"nervous,\\" instead of ill. When Leonore started showing symptoms of HD, her then ex-husband, Milton, kept the diagnosis from her for about a year. She still thought that HD only affected men. When they finally told her she had HD, Nancy said, ‚ÄúHer mother did not protest. It seemed as if Leonore, knowing her family history, had perhaps understood the truth all along.‚Äù Wexler thought at an early age she would want to know as much as possible about the disease. Nancy Wexler attended many workshops including her own. She was most impressed by the workshop of George Hunting which was a film showing Huntington disease patients as a part of a community near Lake Maracaibo in comparison to most U.S patients confined to nursing homes. Years later, Nancy became involved in the Venezuela research. From 1963, Wexler studied for her A.B. in psychology at Radcliffe College, graduating in 1967. She then earned a PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Michigan in 1974. While studying for her A.B. she was required to take an introductory biology course, which constitutes \\"[her] only formal education in biology.\\" In 1968 her father started the Hereditary Disease Foundation, which introduced her to scientists such as geneticists and molecular biologists. Along with textbooks and lectures she attends, the scientists \\"have really been [her] teachers since then.\\" Nancy and Alice both became very involved in the foundation and both became trustees. Nancy is now President of the foundation. The group raises funds for research on HD and related inherited diseases. They also sponsor interdisciplinary workshops for scientists who work on HD and other genetic diseases. Her sister, Alice Wexler is three years older, and has her PhD in History and also contributed to the field of Huntington's. Nancy Wexler and the rest of the Wexler family feature prominently in Alice's book, Mapping Fate -A Memoir of Family, Risk, and Genetic Research that describes how the Wexlers coped with an affected mother while simultaneously trying to spearhead HD research. Alice Wexler is now working on a new book on the social history of HD.

Career In 1976 the U.S. Congress formed the Commission for the Control of Huntington's Disease, and as part of their work, Wexler and the team travelled to Barranquitas and Lagunetas, two settlements on Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, where villagers had a particularly high occurrence of Huntington's. Starting in 1979, the team conducted a twenty-year-long study in which they collected over 4,000 blood samples and documented 18,000 different individuals to work out a common pedigree. The discovery that the gene was on the tip of chromosome 4 led to the development of a test for the disease. For her work, she has been awarded the Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service, the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science (2007), and honorary doctorates from New York Medical College, the University of Michigan, Bard College and Yale University. She is a fellow of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution. Wexler's mother's symptoms progressed from fingers moving constantly, to uncontrollable motions. Nancy explains, ‚ÄúWhen she sat, her spasmodic body movements would propel her chair along the floor until it reached a wall, her head would bang repeatedly against the wall. To keep her from hurting herself at night, her bed was padded with lamb‚Äôs wool.‚Äù She continued to lose weight; she needed to consume at least 5,000 calories a day because of her unique metabolism. She died on Mother's Day, 1978. Wexler continued her research of the HD disease and accredits her ambition and motivation to her father, Milton Wexler; he and her sister Alice worked closely with her for years until her father turned his work over to her and her colleagues, feeling that science had become too complicated for him. Wexler has held many public policy positions, including: Chair of the Joint NIH/DOE Ethical, Legal and Social Issues Working Group of the National Human Genome Research Institute; Chair of HUGO, the Human Genome Organization; and member of the Institute of Medicine. She has served on the American Association for the Advancement of Science board of directors, and the advisory committee on Research on Women's Health, NIH. Huntington's disease location In taking over the work of her father, Nancy Wexler met with many issues and difficulties. The goal of Wexler's research was to continue the work. The studies were done on maternal and fraternal parents with Huntington's disease. For years the researchers used DNA to study DNA of Huntington's disease patients. Nancy Wexler first encountered the idea of using polymorphisms as markers in October 1979. She was hosting a workshop and listened as key theorists explained their visions of gene hunting and was struck with the idea. It was from her idea that James F. Gusella focused on finding HD markers. He quickly hit upon the marker that would determine if a person had HD. Wexler gave Gusella samples of blood that she had collected from people in Venezuela and one after another, the samples confirmed the early finding. Huntington's disease is one of several trinucleotide repeat disorders which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases‚Äîcytosine- adenine-guanine (CAG)‚Äîrepeated multiple times (i.e. ... CAGCAGCAG ...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the genetic code for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing Since 1986, presymptomatic and prenatal testing for HD has been available internationally. Nancy Wexler served as a director of a program that provided presymptomatic and prenatal testing for Huntington's disease. She also worked as a counselor in this program and had the opportunity to speak with over 100 individuals regarding testing. Regarding prenatal testing, Wexler believes that in-depth and detailed counseling must accompany both disclosing and nondisclosing testing. Because the disease had no treatment or cure it was hard to get participants for many of the research studies. Patients would sometimes become depressed and even suicidal, not wanting to deal with 50 ‚Äì 90% chance of inheriting the disease. Before the gene location was identified definitively, early methods of testing for HD made use of closely linked markers for the gene to determine whether a person had a very high likelihood of either escaping or developing the disease. Thus, the client can be told the test is noninformative. Wexler and her sister Alice never wanted to know the results of the testing. Wexler learned that the disease was usually detected in midlife, but was sometimes found in children as young as two years old. The disease would affect the muscles that control swallowing. Wexler would often take her research personally because of her family ties to the disease. She would often associate things that happened to her as symptoms of the HD. Wexler had pondered her own decision. ‚ÄúI wonder if I would really be that much happier if I knew I wouldn‚Äôt get the disease.‚Äù Yet she is tantalized by the chance to know. ‚ÄúWhen my sister and I both decided not to have children,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúneither of us ever expected anything to happen in our lifetime that might change that.‚Äù Wexler did not stop outside research projects although battling with her own testing. Testing was done in Canada, Great Britain and Europe. There are two types of prenatal tests being offered as a part of the presymptomatic testing program. The main form of prenatal testing that is most frequently requested is known as exclusion testing. Exclusion testing tells if the fetus has inherited the short arm of chromosome 4 from a particular parent. This test is valuable in two situations: one, when at-risk parents do not have sufficient information on the genetics of their families to determine their own genotype and two, when at-risk parents prefer not to know their own genotypes. If the fetus is shown to have a short arm of chromosome 4 from the affected or at-risk parent, then the parents are faced with the choice of aborting the fetus that has a 50% chance of developing the disease. The test provides 96% accuracy whether or not a person will develop the disease. Personal views on genetic counseling Wexler believes that people who come for presymptomatic testing will benefit from intensive counseling, sometimes in lieu of the test itself. Her beliefs regarding counseling stem from her own experience regarding presymptomatic testing and also talking with colleagues in other programs. Being at risk has had a profound effect on most people's lives. They may have had an ill parent, with whom they may or may not have had contact, and perhaps other relatives who have suffered from HD. Almost all welcome the opportunity to talk with someone knowledgeable about the experience that they are going through. Wexler states that, ‚ÄúThe genetic test gives people a crystal ball to see the future: will the city be free of bombs from now on or will a bomb crash into their home, killing them and jeopardizing their children?‚Äù Tetrabenazine On December 6, 2007 Prestwick Pharmaceuticals presented information to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding tetrabenazine. Tetrabenazine was a drug that helped treat chorea, a symptom associated with Huntington's disease. Wexler posted a note of action to her Hereditary Disease Foundation regarding the safety of this drug. In her letter, Wexler stated that she would speak in front of the FDA committee regarding her own personal experience with HD and why she believed tetrabenazine could benefit those with HD. Until this point, there were no approved treatments in the United States for chorea associated with HD. She urged patients suffering from chorea to speak to the potential for this much needed use of tetrabenazine. It was with the aid of Nancy Wexler that tetrabenazine was able to be approved by the FDA.

This species of moth is found to frequent mesic areas including the edges of aspen bluffs and hayfields, old fields, meadows, etc.  Identification  A small (approx. 2.5-2.7 cm wingspan) dark red-brown or yellowish-brown moth. There is a black basal streak, short is some specimens but extending half way across the wing in the fold in others. The most prominent markings are the contrasting white cubital and median veins, and to a lesser degree the anal and radial veins as well. For the most part this white scaling stops well short of the wing margin. The trailing edge of the forewing is usually pale yellow or buff. The hindwings are dark sooty brown or black. Sexes similar. The combination of small size, robust build, red-brown color and contrasting white cubital vein will usually identify this moth.  History  Poorly known. No information is presently available regarding this species in the Pacific Northwest. It is expected to occur in bogs and other wetlands in northern British Columbia. The adults are nocturnal and come to light. There is a single brood, which flies in mid-late summer. The larval host(s) is apparently unknown. Related species are borers in plant stems.  Global Distribution  Hypocoena basistriga is found in the western boreal zone, from Alaska to Alberta and the western Great Lakes region. It does not occur further east. Several records are shown for the Sierra Nevada in California.  Life Cycle   Larvae  No information is presently available regarding the larval biology of this species. It bores in monocots like sedges (Cyperaceae).; perennial plants that resemble grasses, grow in shallow water or moist soils, and can reach 4 feet in height.  Adult  This species has been collected in late summer and early fall across its range, most commonly during August and September. The limited number of records from British Columbia are from September and early October. It is nocturnal and comes to lights. Adults wingspan is 25‚Äì27 mm. Adults are on wing from mid to late summer. There is one generation per year.

It was published in Britain in 1919 by Heinemann. In the United States there was a 1920 limited edition from Alfred A. Knopf with drawings of the characters by Beerbohm, followed by a popular edition in 1921. An enlarged edition, Seven Men, and Two Others, containing the new story \\"Felix Argallo and Walter Ledgett\\" interpolated as the last but one item, was published by Heinemann in 1950. The work Seven Men contains Beerbohm's persuasive biographies of six characters from the fin-de-si√®cle world of the 1890s. Interacting with them, Beerbohm himself is the seventh man. As a leading member of the literary life of that past time, he writes \\"with such circumstantial detail and such gentle realism\\" that readers are lulled almost into accepting the fantastic events that he describes.The Spectator, 10 March 1950, p.22 Four of the five stories in the collection had previously appeared in The Century Magazine: \\"James Pethel\\" in January 1915, \\"Enoch Soames\\" in May 2016, \\"A. V. Laider\\" in June 1916, \\"Hilary Maltby\\" (under that title) in February 1919.\\"Max Beerbohm\\" Wikisource The story that was added to the enlarged edition of 1950 had originally appeared as \\"Not that I would boast\\" in the London Mercury in May 1927.Essays on English and American Literature, Amsterdam 1987, pp. 201‚Äì2 The growing popularity of the collection, already described as \\"a little masterpiece\\" by Virginia Woolf,\\"The Limits of Perfection\\", Virginia Woolf: The Complete Works, Musaicum Books 2017 was endorsed by the same judgment being repeated in a recent Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.\\"Sir Max Beerbohm\\", 2009 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Martin Maner has commented of Seven Men and Two Others that in it Beerbohm anticipated postmodernism and specifically that it is \\"a postmodernist fiction written before its time\\" in such features as \\"its narrative self- consciousness\\" and \\"its blurring of the boundary lines between fact and fiction\\", its use of parody and Beerbohm's insistence that the book's format \\"should be of a kind suitable to a book of essays\\".Maner, Martin. \\"Beerbohm's Seven Men and the Power of the Press\\", English Literature in Transition, 34, 2 (1991) pp. 133‚Äì151 The characters Seven Men includes three supernatural comedies, \\"Enoch Soames: A Memory of the Eighteen-Nineties\\", \\"Hilary Maltby and Stephen Braxton\\" and \\"A. V. Laider\\". In the first of these, Enoch Soames is the Decadent author of three \\"dim\\" works in various genres that go completely unrecognised. Convinced of his own genius, he makes a pact with the Devil to go a century forward in time so as to read what others have written about his work. All he could find, however, was an account of Max's story of their friendship in which the critic described him as an imaginary writer. The story was frequently adapted for radio performance between 1939 and 1998.Radio Times 1923‚Äì2009 \\"Hilary Maltby and Stephen Braxton\\" are novelists of contrasting character who achieve literary success at the same time. Both then sink into obscurity and Max only learns the reason decades later when he runs into Maltby in a small Italian town. Maltby admits that after he had been invited to an aristocratic country house weekend he had persuaded his hostess not to invite Braxton. The envious Braxton revenges himself by sending a doppelg√§nger who ruins Maltby's social success. The story has been described as \\"semi-autobiographical\\", in that the location and characters are based on reality.N. John Hall, Max Beerbohm: A Kind of a Life, Yale University 2002, p. 94 In 1950 it was adapted for performance on the BBC Third Programme by Douglas Cleverdon.Radio Times 1923‚Äì2009 Max meets \\"A. V. Laider\\" while convalescing from influenza at a seaside hostel one February. In a very English way, they manage to avoid speaking to each other for almost their entire stay and only start on Max's last evening there. Then a chance remark about palmistry leads Laider to admit once foreseeing the future death of his companions in their palms on a return by train from a stay in the country and not warning them through weakness of will. At the same time the following year, Max meets Laider again at the hostel and the latter admits that he is a fantasist and that his story was untrue. They pass the rest of their stay in comfortable silence until on the final evening a chance remark reminds Laider of something awful that had once happened to him. \\"It was\\", says Max, \\"a very awful thing indeed.\\" The story was later adapted for both radio and television performance.Radio Times 1923‚Äì2009 It is in the casino at Dieppe that Max encounters the gambler \\"James Pethel\\" and, though he finds most gamblers repulsive, warms to Pethel because he is not typical. Over the course of the next day, which Max spends with Pethel and his family, it becomes clear to Max that it is risk-taking in all departments of life that appeals to Pethel ‚Äì in his investments and business dealings and in leisure activities like swimming in rough seas and motoring at speed. Disgusted that Pethel risks not only his own life but those he loves for the sake of experiencing the keenest of thrills, Max refuses to follow up Pethel's demonstrations of friendship. In Joseph Epstein's opinion, the portrait drawn in the story is \\"the best literary work on the subject of gambling ‚Ä¶ written by an outsider\\".Joseph Epstein, Masters of the Games: Essays and Stories on Sport, Rowman & Littlefield 2015, p.59 The later interpolated story, \\"Felix Argallo and Walter Ledgett\\", is largely set in the Edwardian era. Max attempts to play the good angel to Ledgett, a popular author whose reputation is being ruined by deprecating remarks made about him in the posthumously published letters of the great. To restore Ledgett's confidence, Max persuades Argallo, a late literary success, to write four letters addressed to Beerbohm that praise the writer's work. Shortly afterwards, Argallo commits suicide and Beerbohm submits the letters to a memoir of him. Since the letters refer to incidents involving Argallo and Ledgett together, of which Ledgett naturally has no memory, Max then has to persuade him that he is suffering from a rare form of amnesia. \\"Savonarola Brown\\" is a hybrid work consisting of a farcical introduction to a farcical Shakespearian tragedy. A clerk with dramatic leanings intended to take Sardanapalus as his subject but, because the encyclopedia he consulted had opened first at Savonarola, took him as subject instead. Max is named his literary executor after Brown is run over by a bus. He then discovers an unfinished verse drama full of anachronisms, not the least of which are modern idioms adapted to Elizabethan English ‚Äì \\"Seeming hawk is dove/ And dove's a gaol-bird now. Fie out upon 't!\\" Read on the page, with time to reflect on it, the script is extremely funny.

Life He was third son of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland and Maud, daughter of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. He is not known to have been educated at a university, but was vicar of Giggleswick, Yorkshire, from 1508 to 1517. On 6 May 1515 he received the rectory of St. Anne, Aldersgate, London, which he held till 1518. The new foundation of St. John‚Äôs College, Cambridge, chose him as their second master on 29 July 1516, probably with an eye to his Lancastrian connections and family influence, But he resigned the mastership two years later on 1 November 1518; the college granted him a small pension and some residence privileges. On 2 April 1520 Henry VIII gave him a house and garden at Stepney, Middlesex, and he gave up claims on the college the following year. With other preferments he pursued a clerical career. On 25 October 1521 he became rector of St. Mary-at-Hill, London, which he held for the rest of his life. In 1526 Thomas Boleyn, Viscount Rochford presented him to the rectory of Mulbarton, Norfolk. He became Master of the collegiate church of the Holy Trinity at Arundel, where he succeeded the musician Edward Hygons at some point between 1535 and 1539. The College might have escaped the Dissolution of the Monasteries, since in the early 1540s it had been granted property from Hayling Priory, and other land from the dissolved St John's Priory at nearby Poling and Shipley. But an eventual dissolution of the College was prompted at court by Henry Lord Maltravers; and a late stage Percy joined with the two fellows in surrendering it to the king on 12 December 1545. Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk gave him the rectory of Earsham, Norfolk, in 1558; he had also been rector of Stanley Regis, Gloucestershire from 1551. Percy died in May 1560, and was buried in the old chapel of St. John's College, where there were a brass and a marble tomb to his memory.

His work included several churches and public houses. Life Drinkwater was born in Warwick on 17 March 1844, the son of George Drinkwater, a coachman, and his wife Eliza. At the time of the 1851 Census the family was still living in Warwick, but by 1860 they had moved to Oxford and George had become landlord of the George Inn, 33 Cornmarket Street. In 1878 Drinkwater married Rose Carr at St Mark's parish church, Maida Vale, London. They made their home at 1 Farndon Road, North Oxford. Rose bore him two daughters and a son: Grace in 1879, George in 1880 and Ruth in 1883. George attended SS Philip and James Boys' School in Leckford Road, which Drinkwater designed and which was built in 1879. Drinkwater became a Freemason, joining the Alfred Lodge (340). He was appointed Junior Deacon in 1881, Worshipful Master and Provincial Grand Senior Warden in 1885. He was also initiated into the Royal Arch Chapter and the Knights Templar, and was made a Worshipful Master of the Royal Mark Master Masons. In 1895 Drinkwater fell ill and paid a visit to Wokingham, Berkshire, in the hope of improving his health. He died there on Sunday 13 October. His funeral was held in Oxford on Wednesday 16 October 1895, when he was buried in St Sepulchre's Cemetery, Oxford. Drinkwater's widow Rose and their three children survived him. Their son George followed his father into architecture and also became a painter. Rose died in 1926 at her home at 67A St Giles', Oxford, and is buried with her husband in St Sepulchre's Cemetery. Their nephew John Drinkwater became a poet and playwright. Career St Augustine's parish church, Dudley Drinkwater was a pupil of William C. C. Bramwell in Oxford 1860‚Äì1865 and then assistant to the Gothic Revival architect G. E. Street 1865‚Äì1873.

Drinkwater followed Street into designing and restoring Church of England churches and designing vicarages, but also undertook a number of commissions for Hanley's Morrell's and Weaving's breweries. Drinkwater's brother Albert was involved in the New Theatre, Oxford. In 1885 Drinkwater bought shares in the Oxford Theatre Company.

It is the primary bank of the Pichincha Group (Grupo Pichincha), a business group that includes the companies associated with the bank and businesses related to Fidel Egas Grijalva and his family, which include Diners Club of Ecuador, Picaval and Teleamazonas. The bank has 1.8 million customers in Ecuador, $4.5 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits, as well as more than 200 branches in the country. Banco Pichincha has a subsidiary in Peru, Banco Financiero Per√∫, in Colombia, Banco Pichincha (before known as \\"Inversora Pichincha\\" and \\"Banco del Pichincha\\", and another in Panama, Banco Pichincha Panam√°. It also has an agency in Miami, and eight representative offices in Spain, including two each in Madrid, Barcelona, Murcia, and Comunidad Valenciana. It has just received regulatory approval to convert its network of offices in Spain into a commercial bank, the first Spanish commercial bank from Latin America. It has applied to the regulators in Colombia for permission to convert its commercial lending operation in that country, Inversora Pichincha, into a commercial bank. Systems The bank's electronic transactions are done using the INTERNEXO system, which replaced the TODO1 system. In January 2007, the bank signed a $140 million, 5-year contract with Tata Consultancy Services for modernizing its information systems and improving efficiency.http://www.business- standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=271623 As a part of this agreement, Tata hired most of Banco Pichincha's systems staff. History Banco Pichincha was established on 11 April 1906. Its first directors were Manuel Jij√≥n Larrea (founding president), Manuel Freile Donoso and Ignacio Fern√°ndez Salvador (founding managers). Although it was a bank of note issue (the first issue, for one million sucres took place in February 1907), it focused on stockbroking. In 1986, the bank established an agency in Miami, Florida. Since 1996, the bank has had a strategic alliance with Banco de Loja (est. 1967), to provide Banco Pichincha's clients coverage in southern Ecuador. The next year, it acquired Banco Financiero de Per√∫, which had been established in 1964 as a company specializing in construction financing, but which had become a full commercial bank in 1982. In 2001, Banco Financiero acquired NBK Bank, in Peru. In 2004, the bank established Banco Pichincha Panam√°, which initially was based in Nassau, in the Bahamas, but which moved its head office to Panama. In 2001, ABN AMRO sold the Ecuadorian operation it had inherited from its acquisition of Hollandsche Bank-Unie to Banco Pichincha. Pichincha first arrived in Spain in 2007, where it now operates a network of nine customer- service centers mainly focused on attending to the more than 750,000 Ecuadorians who live in Spain. In 2010 it received permission from Banco de Espa√±a to establish a commercial bank. Pichincha plans to convert its customer service centers to branches, commencing with those in Madrid, and eventually to open another 20 branches over the next four years.

He appeared as a medium on various paranormal television programs, primarily Paranormal State and Psychic Kids. On Psychic Kids he acts as a mentor towards children who claim to have psychic abilities, primarily seeing ghosts. Coffey's claims of being able to communicate with the dead have been subject to criticism by skeptics. In 2019 it was announced that Coffey will be joining Travel Channel's Kindred Spirits as the third official cast member alongside Adam Berry and Amy Bruni for the fourth season in 2020. History According to Coffey, when he was a child, he would tell his parents when the phone was about to ring and who was calling; referring to his ability to read the past, present and future as a \\"God given talent\\" Coffey said that when he reached adulthood, he began to see full-body apparitions. He also defines what he feels is the difference between a ghost and a spirit is that \\"the latter has completed the journey between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Ghosts, on the other hand, are souls that, for whatever reason, have chosen to stick around. They may not know they're dead, or they may fear judgment on the other side.\\" In 2019, it was announced that Coffey would be joining the main cast of Kindred Spirits for the fourth season. This comes after Coffey appeared in the Haunted Salem 2019 live special with both Berry and Bruni from Kindred Spirits. Criticism Coffey has been criticized by scientific skeptics. In 2009, the James Randi Education Foundation awarded Coffey a Pigasus Award \\"For the psychic who tricked the most people with the least effort\\". According to skeptical investigator Joe Nickell, Coffey has been accused of hoaxing and \\"outright deception\\" involving the television series Paranormal State. In September 2014, members of the Bay Area Skeptics attended one of Coffey's seance sessions as part of what they termed a \\"sting operation\\" intended to reveal the falsity of his psychic claims. According to Ohlone College professor Sheldon Helms, skeptics posing as fans planted stories of fictitious dead family members with Coffey's staff. According to organizer Susan Gerbic, \\"Coffey claimed to be clearly communicating with our nonexistent family members\\". In March 2018, Gerbic published an article in Skeptical Inquirer summarizing a number of techniques which she says are used by psychics, such as Coffey, to achieve their effects. In October 2013, Coffey appeared on the KFXN-FM morning show The Power Trip. Host Cory Cove confronted Coffey with skepticism regarding his alleged psychic powers. Coffey reportedly \\"stormed out of the studio\\". In a survey of various psychic's social media accounts in June 2020, investigator Susan Gerbic found that not only had Coffey not predicted the Covid-19 pandemic but he shared a post on April 8, 2020 on social media saying, \\"As of today, I have not left my house for 32 days. Never, in my wildest dreams or worst nightmares, did I envision something like Covid-19 occurring\\".

The film set in a film studio where a war film is being made. The film was made by Hideo Nakata while trying to fund production for his documentary film about director Joseph Losey. It was not a success in Japan, but prompted an English-language remake in 2009 which was directed by Fruit Chan. The film also influenced the creative choices Nakata would have for his popular film Ring in 1998. Plot On the set of a dark war time drama at an old movie studio, a young director, Toshio Murai (Yanagi), is trying to complete his debut film. The two starring actresses, Hitomi Kurokawa and Saori Murakami, play sisters in his film. Murai has a crush on Hitomi (Shiroshima), the seasoned leading actress, and keeps a photo of her by his bed. The younger and less experienced actress, Saori (Ishibashi), is annoying and likes to have recess on the set. The production of the movie is consistently interrupted by strange occurrences and the cast and crew begin to get spooked. When Murai reviews the shoot, he is shocked to see that scenes from an unreleased (and presumed destroyed) drama from years earlier are intermingled with his negatives. As Murai is watching his footage, the scene is interrupted by a film within a film of an unidentified actress on a movie set, with something that looks like a woman behind her, long black hair, pale skin, out of focus, laughing hysterically. Murai is fascinated with the freaky footage, as it looks strangely familiar. The production shuts down for a formal investigation. Murai has only three days left to find out what is going on and finish the shoot. Murai looks into his own past, and finds a frightening connection between the film he is shooting and the strange footage he has uncovered. Cast * Y≈´rei Yanagi as Toshio Murai / the director * Yasuyo Shirashima as Hitomi Kurokawa / the seasoned actress * Kei Ishibashi as Saori Murakami / the debuting actress * Ren Osugi as Ootani / the cinematographer (as Ren Oosugi) * Takanori Kikuchi as Masaru Hayama * Hiroyuki Tanaka as Sekikawa (as Sabu) * Reita Serizawa as Sadaoka Production Prior to working on Don't Look Up, Hideo Nakata joined the Japanese film company Nikkatsu in the 1980s. In the 1970s, Nikkatsu was predominantly producing pornography films in the Roman Porno (Romantic Pornography) genre. By the time Nakata joined Nikkatsu in the 1980s, the company had been struggling as the availability of home video made theatrical pornography wane in popularity. In 1991, Nakata left Nikkatsu and Japan to study the British Free Cinema movement in London's National Film Archive. When Nikkatsu collapsed in 1993, Nakata did not have a job to return to and decided to develop an independent film on director Joseph Losey. To help gain money for the documentary took various film jobs for hire, including returning to directing in Japan where he began developing the film Don't Look Up for J-Movie Wars, a subsidiary of a major Japanese satellite television company. The majority of the film was shot on the abandoned stages of Nikkatsu. Release Don't Look Up ran for six weeks in a limited release in Japan. Hideo Nakata stated that only about 800 people attended these screenings. It was released on video in Japan on March 6, 1996. Remake In 2003, the South African-based company Distant Horizon purchased the rights to Don't Look Up, initially with Hideo Nakata to direct the film again. In 2007, Variety announced that Fruit Chan would direct this English-language remake of Don't Look Up. The remake was shown at the 2009 Lund Fantastisk Film Festival in Sweden and was later released on DVD in the United States in 2010. Hideo Nakata's film Ghost Theater was promoted as a remake of Don't Look Up. Maggie Lee (Variety) noted in her review of the film that \\"the only thing the two films have in common is a malevolent female entity that hates rising actresses.\\" Reception For his work on the film, Hideo Nakata won the Best New Director award at the 1997 Michinoku International Mystery Film Festival. Nakata later felt that he showed too much of the phantoms's face in the film. Josh Ralske (AllMovie) praised Nakata's confidence in the film, stating that he \\"clearly understands his milieu (it takes place on a film set) and is assured enough to let the tension build very slowly\\", while noting that there \\"are times, in fact, when the movie seems to be going nowhere\\" and that this lead Ralske to feel that the screenplay felt unfinished, concluding that the film \\"promises a more chilling film than Nakata has delivered. Nakata continued that \\"I've had people tell me 'Don't Look Up wasn't exactly frightening, it was...' For me, of all the possible adjectives that could finish that phrase, the word I most long to hear is 'frightening' That's the description I want to elicit.\\" These reactions influenced Nakata's later film Ring (1998), where he decided to cover up the ghosts' face completely.

History Allentown Cardinals Breadon Field was named for St. Louis Cardinals owner Sam Breadon, who built the ballfield in 1948 as a replacement for Fairview Field. Allentown, Pennsylvania had been a Cardinals \\"Class B\\" minor league club since the 1940 season when it bought the Allentown Dukes, a Boston Braves minor league farm team that had opened Fairview Field the season before in 1939.Baseball at Breadon Field 60 years ago was once place to be Whelan, Frank, WFMZ In 1946 Breadon announced the creation of a new baseball field in the vicinity of what is now Route 22 and MacArthur Road, approximately where the Lehigh Valley Mall is today. Breadon Field was the name given to the new, 5,000 seat, $425,000 ballpark that opened on August 6, 1948. In 1950, the Cardinals turned the task of running Breadon Filed over to Don Dix, a former minor league player in the Cardinals organization. Dix seemed to understand that the world of minor league baseball was changing. He created a number of promotions, most notably a Miss Allentown Cardinals beauty contest. However, a combination of bad weather, TV baseball and the collapse of the Interstate League, of which the Allentown Cardinals were a part, led the Cardinals organization to close Breadon Field after the 1952 season. Allentown Red Sox In 1954, the club resumed operations in Allentown as part of the Eastern League under new Cardinals ownership. However, declining attendance led the sale of club and facilities in August 1957 to some local Allentown investors that included Lehigh County District attorney Paul A. McGinley and Brass Rail Restaurant owner Philip Sorrentino, for $180,000. MgGinley and Sorrentino brought a new club to Allentown, the \\"Class A\\" farm team of the Boston Red Sox, which became the Allentown Red Sox (A-Sox). Everything appeared to be going well until 1960 when stunned baseball fans learned that the Breadon Field had been purchased for $300,000 by Max Hess, Jr, owner of the Allentown Hess Brothers department store. Hess had no real interest in baseball, and to this day it is unclear why he bought the team. Hess renamed the stadium after himself (Max Hess Stadium). The club suffered both a dismal season on the field and also a lack of attendance in 1960. After the season ended, the Red Sox announced that the club would be moved to Johnstown, Pennsylvania for the 1961 season. Demolition After the Red Sox moved out several attempts to obtain another minor league team were made and failed. During the summer of 1961, local businessman Irwin Kreindel posted a $2,500 franchise fee with the Eastern League and obtained a working agreement with one of the National League's new expansion teams, the New York Mets. All he needed was an agreement to use Hess Stadium. However, Kreindel was unable to secure a lease, partly because Hess was negotiating a potential sale to a \\"big discount organization\\" looking at the site for a shopping center. In 1963, the National Association opened talks with Hess about finding a way to put an Eastern League team back in Allentown. Talks went nowhere. Hess claimed no team wanted to play unless guaranteed at least a 50,000 a season attendance, and the stadium sat vacant. Finally, in 1964 Hess decided to demolish the ballpark. After being razed, the former baseball field eventually was sold by Hess in October 1965. The land was undeveloped for about a decade, going through several owners and eventually being incorporated into a larger tract. It was developed into the Lehigh Valley Mall, which opened in 1976. The site of Breadon Field is located approximately where the entrance road from MacArthur Road enters the mall parking lot.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 100 in 2000. Geography Rios is located at (27.4517023, -98.2650068). It is situated along FM 1329 in southeastern Duval County, approximately 13 miles southeast of Benavides, 16 miles northeast of Premont, and 21 miles south of San Diego. Although Rios lacks any official boundaries, many locals consider the stretch of FM 1329 between County Road 233 to the south and Victor's Farm and Ranch Store to the north, as part of the community. History Permanent settlement in the area predates the independent Republic of Texas and Texas statehood, but a community did not begin to develop at the site until the 1890s. The community was initially known as La Gloria, but by the time a post office was established in the late 1930s, that name had already been taken. Felipe V. Rios, who eventually became postmaster, then suggested the name Vera after a local rancher, Saturnino Vera. That name, however, was also in use by another community in northern Texas. His final submission was the name Rios, after his family whose roots in the area date back to the late 19th century, which was approved by postal authorities. Rios had an estimated population of 75 with four businesses in the early 1940s. The population remained at that level for the remainder of the 20th century. By 2000, the community was dispersed and the number of inhabitants had risen to 100. Education Public education in the community of Rios is provided by the Premont Independent School District. All of the district's campuses are located in the city of Premont, approximately 16 miles southeast of Rios. Premont ISD has served Rios since the late 1960s.

With the disaffiliation of the JSF from the Socialist Party of America in 1921, the minority opposed to this formed the JSV, which became the SPA's Jewish language federation. Prominent members of the JSV at its foundation included Jacob Panken, Otto Branstetter, Benjamin Feigenbaum, Charles Solomon, B. C.

In 1957 when the SDF reunited with the Socialist Party the JSV and the SDFs largest local, New York, opposed this and founded the Democratic Socialist Federation. In 1972 the DSF and the Socialist Party merged, with the JSV finally re-affiliating with the Socialist Party. The JSV remained affiliated with the Socialist party's legal successor group, the Social Democrats USA. It still was in existence at least until the early 1980s.

They are held captive around the world, usually for financial purposes. The Tiger Species Survival Plan devised by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums has condemned the breeding of white tigers. The genes responsible for white colour are represented by 0.001% of the tiger population. However, in 2008‚Äì2009, a closing stock of 264 Bengal tigers and 100 white Bengal tigers were accounted for in Indian zoos. The disproportionate growth in numbers of the latter points to the relentless inbreeding resorted to among homozygous recessive individuals for selectively multiplying the white animals. This progressively increasing process will eventually lead to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability.Xavier, N. (2010) A new conservation policy needed for reintroduction of Bengal tiger-white. Current Science 99 (7): 894‚Äì895. Mohan and the Rewa strain A white tigress with her cubs. Mohan was the founding father of the white tigers of Rewa.Van Nostrand, Mary L., \\"Mohan The Ghost Tiger Of Rewa\\", Zoonooz May 1984 pgs. 4‚Äì7 He was captured as a cub in 1951 by Maharaja of Rewa, whose hunting party in Bandhavgarh found a tigress with four 9-month-old cubs, one of which was white. All of them were shot except for the white cub. After shooting a white tiger in 1948 the Maharaja of Rewa had resolved to capture one, as his father had done in 1915, at his next opportunity. Water was used to lure the thirsty cub into a cage, after he returned to a kill made by his mother. The white cub mauled a man during the capture process and was clubbed on the head and knocked unconscious. He was not necessarily expected to wake up, and this was his second brush with death. He recovered though, and was housed in the unused palace at Govindgarh in the erstwhile harem courtyard. The Maharaja named him Mohan, which roughly translates as \\"Enchanter\\", one of the many names of the Hindu deity Krishna.The name of the Maharaja was Raja Martand Singh. The white tiger the previous Maharaja had kept in captivity from 1915 to 1920 was also a male, unusually large like most white tigers (Mohan was no exception in this regard), and had a white male sibling still living in the wild. After the captive white tiger's death in 1920 he was mounted and presented to the Emperor King George V, as a token of loyalty.Sankhala, K.S., Tiger ! The Story Of The Indian Tiger, Simon & Schuster, New York 1977 This specimen is now in the British Museum. The first live white tiger reached England in 1820, and was exhibited at London's Exeter Change menagerie where it was examined by the famous French anatomist Georges Cuvier, who described it in his \\"Animal Kingdom\\" as having faint stripes only visible from certain angles of refraction. In 1960 there was a mounted white tiger, with faint reddish brown stripes, in the throne room of the Maharaja of Rewa. In 1953, Mohan was bredAlderton, David, Wild Cats Of The World, Blandford UK London 1993 pgs. 43‚Äì44 to a normal-coloured wild tigress called Begum (\\"royal consort\\"), which produced two male orange cubs on September 7, one of which went to Bombay Zoo. In 1955 they had a litter of two males and two females on April 10 (which included a male named Sampson and a female named Radha), all normal-coloured. On July 10, 1956 they again had a litter of two males and two females, which included a male named Sultan who went to Ahmedabad Zoo, and a female named Vindhya who went to the Delhi Zoo and was later bred to an unrelated male named Suraj.Thornton, I.W.B., K.K. Yeung & K.S. Sankhala. 1967. The genetics of white tigers in Rewa. J. Zool. 152: 127‚Äì35 Once again, the breeding experiments failed to yield a single white cub. Mohan was then bred to his daughter Radha (who carried the white gene inherited from her father) with success. The initial litter of four cubs‚Äîa male named Raja, and three females named Rani, Mohini, and Sukeshi‚Äîwere the first white tigers born in captivity, on October 30, 1958.Stracey, P.D., Tigers, London: Baker, New York: Golden P., 1968 Raja and Rani went to the New Delhi Zoo, and Mohini was bought by the German-American billionaire John KlugeReed, Theodore H. \\"Enchantess: Queen Of An Indian Palace Rare White Tigress Comes To Washington.\\" National Geographic May 1961 for $10,000, for the National Zoo in Washington D.C., as a gift to the children of America, in 1960.

In exchange the Maharaja's white tiger breeding would be subsidized and he would receive a share of their cubs. He wanted Rs 100,000 for them. Technically Sukeshi was also the property of the New Delhi Zoo, and in a sense India had nationalized the captive white tigers of Rewa. The Parliament of India would hear reports on the progress of the white tigers, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and U Nu of Burma participated in public christening ceremonies for white cubs at New Delhi Zoo.Rai, Usha. 1987, Will they outlast this century? Times of India, New Delhi March 15 Sukeshi remained at Govindgarh Palace, in the harem courtyard where she was born, as a mate for Mohan. That same year, India imposed a ban on the export of white tigers,Roth, T.W. \\"Rare White Tiger Of Rewa\\" Journal of cat Genetics Vol. 1 April May June 1964 No. 3;Gee, E.P.,\\"The White Tigers\\" Animals 3:282‚Äì286\\"White tiger exports banned\\", N.Y.

A11 in an effort to preserve a monopoly (as a tourist attraction), possibly because Anglo-Indian naturalist Edward Pritchard Gee recommended that Govindgarh Palace, and its white tiger inhabitants, be made a \\"national trust\\", which did not happen. Mohini was only allowed to leave India because US President Dwight D. Eisenhower intervened personally with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, to ask for the release of the United States government's white tiger. A white sister of Mohini's had been brought to New Delhi the year before to show the President, who was no stranger to white tigers. After the export ban was imposed the Maharaja threatened to release all of his white tigers into the Rewa forest, and so he was given dispensation to sell two more pairs abroad, to offset his costs.Gee, E.P., \\"The Wildlife Of India\\" London: Collins 1964 Six zoos acquired white tigers from the Maharaja of Rewa including the Bristol Zoo in England (a brother and sister pair named Champak and Chameli on June 22, 1963 for the equivalent of $10,000 each.)\\"White tigers at Bristol Zoo\\", The Times August 17, 1963, pg. 8b. and the Crandon Park Zoo (which closed around 1983, and moved out of Crandon Park to the site of the Miami MetroZoo) in Miami acquired a white tigress in 1968.Cousins, D., 1977 The white tiger and its status in captivity. International Zoo News 24(7) 147:16‚Äì19 Bristol Zoo's pair, born in 1962, came from another litter of four, all white, but two (one female and one male) did not survive. Years later the Bristol Zoo needed a new breeding male and traded a white female to New Delhi Zoo for a white tiger named Roop, who had been named by U Nu, the Prime Minister of Burma. He was the son of Raja by his own mother and half sister- Radha, born in New Delhi. Radha, and many other tigers from Govindgarh including Sukeshi, were later transferred to New Delhi. Begum went to live at Ahmedabad Zoo and was bred to her son Sultan. They produced twelve cubs in four litters between 1958 and 1961. Bristol Zoo later transferred two male white tigers to Dudley Zoo. A white Bengal tiger in National Zoological Park Delhi, India. The government of West Bengal bought two white males, named Niladari and Himadri, from the Maharaja for the Alipore Zoological Gardens (Calcutta Zoo), and an orange female named Malini, from the same litter of three born in 1960, accompanied them there. The Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, recovered the purchase price of its white tigers within six months by charging extra to see them. By 1966 the Bombay Zoo had a white tigress named Lakshmi, born in 1964, from the Maharaja. The Calcutta Zoo sold a white tigress named Sefali to Gauhati Zoo and sent a second white tiger there on loan. Circus owner Clyde Beatty also bought a white tiger from the Maharaja in 1960, for $10,000 in a deal facilitated by the Smithsonian National Zoo director T.H. Reed, who had traveled to India to escort Mohini to Washington, which had to be canceled because of the export ban, which made Mohini even more valuable. She was estimated to be worth $28,000. President Tito of Yugoslavia visited New Delhi Zoo and asked for white tigers for Belgrade Zoo, but was refused.Desai, J.H., & Malhotra, A.K., \\"The White Tiger\\" New Delhi Publications, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India, 1992 A white tiger named Dalip from New Delhi Zoo represented India in two international expositions in Budapest and Osaka. A white tigress named Nandni, who was born in New Delhi Zoo in 1971, went to Hyderabad Zoo. By 1976 the Lucknow Zoo also had a white tiger which was a gift from New Delhi Zoo. Zoos with white tigers constituted a most exclusive club and the white tigers themselves represented a single extended family. In 1965 or 1966 Terence Walton, a member of the Maharaja of Rewa's staff, was attending a performance of the Ringling Bros. Circus in Madison Square Garden and had a note passed to tiger trainer Charles Baumann, on the Maharaja's stationary, requesting an opportunity to discuss white tigers. He may have hoped to make a sale. Baumann was invited to Rewa, but was not able to go. Mohan was featured in the National Geographic documentary \\"Great Zoos Of The World\\" in 1970. He died later that year, aged almost 20, and was laid to rest with Hindu rites as the palace staff observed official mourning. He was the last recorded white tiger born in the wild. The last white tiger seen in the wild was shot in 1958 in the Hazaribagh forests of Bihar. There have been rumors of white tigers in Hazaribagh, the Tora forsts of Rewa, and Kanha National Park since 1958, but these were not considered credible by K.S. Sankhala. A photograph of Mohan's stuffed head, in a display case in the private museum of the Maharaja of Rewa in Govindgarh Lake Palace, appears in the National Geographic book \\"The Year Of The Tiger.\\"Nichols, Michael & Ward, Geoffrey C., The Year Of The Tiger, National Geographic Society 1998 pg. 82 Another picture of Mohan's head appears on the official website of the Maharaja of Rewa (MP).Official website of the Maharaja of Rewa (M.P.) The Maharaja of Rewa turned Mohan's native forest into the Bandhavgarh National Park, because he could not control the poaching. The Maharaja was negotiating the sale of a white male, named Virat, as late as 1976, when he died of enteritis. Virat was a son of Mohan and Sukeshi. At Bandhavgarh visitors can stay at the White Tiger Lodge, which is the local version of Tiger Tops in Royal Chitwan in Nepal. Pushpraj Singh, the reigning Maharaja of Rewa, has asked students to sign a petition to ask the President of India to return at least two white tigers to Govindgarh Lake Palace, as a tourist attraction.\\"MP students want white tiger back in its homeland\\", Hindustan Times, December 1, 2007 http://hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?id=b274835b-1b55-403a-83f2-2eea243ae05d&&Headline;=Indian+ Mohini Rewa (Enchantress) and Sampson Mohini, a daughter of Mohan, was officially presented to President Eisenhower by John W.

Reed, the director of the National Zoo, gave this description of Mohini: \\"Her stripes were black, shading into brown, but her main coat was eggshell white instead of the normal rufous orange. Exotic coloring and magnificent physique made her a tiger without peer. For a two-year-old kitten she had tremendous growth-almost 190 pounds, three feet tall at the shoulders, and eight feet from nose to tail.\\" White tigers are larger and heavier than regular orange tigers. The average length of a white tiger at birth is 53 cm, compared to 50 cm for a normal orange cub. Shoulder height is 17 cm (normal 12 cm), weight 1.37 kg (normal 1.25 kg). Dalip and Krishna, two white tigers at New Delhi Zoo, weighed 139 kg and 120 kg respectively, at two years of age. Ram and Jim, two normal colored tigers at the same zoo, weighed 106 kg and 119 kg, at the same age. Raja, the white tiger, had a shoulder height of 100 cm, at ten years of age, while Suraj, an orange tiger, had a shoulder height of only 90 cm, at 12 years of age, according to New Delhi Zoo director K.S. Sankhala. Ratna and Vindhya, orange tigresses \\"from the white race\\", who carried the white gene as a recessive (both were fathered by Mohan), were higher at the shoulder than average, measuring 87 and 88 cm, compared to a normal orange tigress named Asharfi, who measured 82 cm at the shoulder. White tigers also grow faster than orange tigers.Leyhausen, Paul & Reed, Theodore H., White tiger care and breeding of a genetic freak, Smithsonian April 1971 This would have given them an advantage in the wild.

Her name is the feminine of Mohan, and translates as \\"Enchantress\\". She was her father's namesake. She was a great attraction, and the zoo wanted to breed more white tigers. At the time, no more white tigers were being allowed out of India, so Mohini was mated to Sampson, her uncle and half brother, who was sent from Ahmedabad Zoo in 1963.Crandall, Lee S., The management of wild mammals in captivity, University of Chicago Press 1964 (It seems probable that financial considerations may have also precluded Washington from acquiring a second white tiger as a mate for Mohini.) Sampson was donated to the National Zoo by Ralph S. Scott.Samson Arrives at Washington Zoo, The Washington Post Jan. 6, 1963 pg. A3 Mohini was originally betrothed to an orange Bengal tiger named \\"Mighty Mo\\", who was captured in Central India in the forests of the Maharaja of Panna by Ralph S. Scott, and donated to the National Zoo on June 19, 1959. Today there is a Panna National Park. Unfortunately Mohini used to push Mighty Mo around. The original plan was to breed Mohini with an unrelated orange tiger, and then breed her to one or more of her male offspring, in the hope of producing white cubs. That was before Sampson arrived. Sampson fathered the first two of Mohini's four litters, which were born in 1964 and 1966. Mighty Mo and another tiger named \\"Foa\\" were given to the Pittsburgh Zoo in August 1966. After Sampson's death in 1966, at age 11 of kidney failure, Mohini was bred to her son Ramana, who was then the only male white gene carrier available. This resulted in the birth of a white daughter named Rewati on April 13, 1969Reed, Elizabeth C., \\"White Tiger In My House\\".

He was born in a litter of five, which included two white males and three orange females. One was stillborn and the mother crushed the others after three days. When Moni was a cub he was photographed with Mrs. Suharto, the wife of Indonesian President Suharto, when she visited the National Zoo. Rewati had an orange male littermate which died after two days. Ramana was born on July 1, 1964 and had two litter mates-a white male named Rajkumar, who was the first white tiger born in a zoo, and an orange female named Ramani.Casey, Phil, Being a White Tiger no Problem For Mohini's Five-Week-Old-Cub, The Washington Post Feb. 14, 1964 pg.

All of Mohini's cubs were named by the Indian Ambassador. At the time of his death, at only ten months of age, Rajkumar already weighed 175 pounds, and could hardly be called a cub. He was first named \\"Charlie\\" by one of his keepers, before the Indian Ambassador gave him his official name. The National Zoo planned to trade Rajkumar for a number of other animals. He was equal to ten zebras in value. The Smithsonian Institution stepped in and vetoed the plan, insisting that Rajkumar would remain a permanent resident of Washington D.C. Rajkumar was the only white tiger fathered by Sampson. The birth of Mohini's first litter was televised in a national special. Mohini's orange daughter Kesari was born in 1966 with an orange female who was stillborn. It was even suggested, although probably not too seriously, that Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi be asked to bring a white tiger cub for the zoo, when she was scheduled to visit Washington in 1966. After Moni died in 1971 the National Zoo tried to acquire an orange tiger named Ram from Trivandrum Zoo, in southern India, as a mate for Mohini.\\"Death of white tiger\\" Washington Post July 9, 1971 pgs. B1, B5 Ram was her first cousin, a grandson of Mohan, and there was a 50% chance that he carried white genes. 25% of Ram's genes came from Mohan and 25% from Begum. 25% of Mohini's genes were from Begum and 75% from Mohan. Ram was a son of Vindhya and Suraj born on 23 IV 1965 at New Delhi Zoo, the same Ram discussed earlier. Two sisters of Ram, born on 22 Feb. 1967, went to the Romanshorn Zoo in Switzerland. In 1973 an Indochinese tiger (Panthera tigris corbetti) named Poona, who was born at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle in 1962, was sent to Washington on a six-month breeding loan from the Brookfield Zoo and bred to Mohini\\"20 year old Mohini Rewa put to death at National Zoo\\" The Washington Post April 3, 1979 pg.

(Poona would have been regarded as a Bengal tiger for the first two years of his life because the Indo-Chinese subspecies was not recognized until 1968.) Mohini did not conceive. Kesari produced six orange cubs, an extraordinary number, especially for a first litter, but only one survived, a female named Marvina. Kesari handed Marvina over to her keepers and kept the other five. Marvina was mistaken for male, and named Marvin which was changed to Marvina when it was discovered that he was a she. Washington Zoo keeper Art Cooper, who hand reared Marvina, observed that white tigers were the most obstinate cats in the zoo, and said that Marvina had a typical white tiger personality.\\"A Zoo for all seasons: the Smithsonian animal world\\"/Alfred Meyer, editor; writers, Thomas Crosby...et al., Washington D.C. Smithsonian Exposition Book; New York: distributed by Norton, c 1979, (Poona also fathered litters by two other tigresses in Brookfield.) In 1974 Marvina, Ramana, and Kesari were sent to the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, and Rewati and Mohini went to the Brookfield Zoo, to be boarded during renovations in Washington, until 1976. As a fringe benefit of inbreeding the four cubs were pure-Bengal tigers, and they were the last registered Bengal tigers born in the United States. Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, Peela, and Rewati had inbreeding coefficients of 0.406.Goebel, Anna M. & Whitmore, H.

A white half sister of Mohini's, bred from Mohan and Sukishi, born on March 26, 1966, named Gomti and later renamed Princess, lived in the Crandon Park Zoo in Miami for almost three years, before she died of a viral infection at age five in December 1970. She arrived in Miami on January 13, 1968. Miami mayor Chuck Hall met the 22-month-old 350 lbs. white tigress at the airport and rode with her to the zoo. He wanted to call her Maya, the name suggested by the Maharaja, which translates as Princess. Ralph S. Scott, who paid $35,000 for her and gave her to the Zoological Society of Florida, preferred the name Princess.Bruning, Fred, \\"Hall Has A White Tiger By The Handle\\" The Miami Herald Jan. 14, 1968\\"Lady Is A Tiger\\" The Miami Herald Jan. 19, 1968 The Zoological Society of Florida loaned Princess to the Crandon Park Zoo. It was Ralph S. Scott, a famous big game hunter, who suggested to John W. Kluge that he buy a white tiger for the children of America. He had seen the white tigers in Govindgarh Palace while tiger hunting in India. The government of India wanted Princess to be the last white tiger exported from the country. A male white tiger, named Ravi, acquired by Ralph S. Scott for the Crandon Park Zoo died at Kanpur railway station en route from India in 1967. He was a son of Raja and Rani born in New Delhi Zoo, and sold by the Maharaja of Rewa. In 1970 Jimmy Stewart was on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and said that his wife was going to buy a white tiger from the Maharaja of Rewa for the Los Angeles Zoo. Ralph S. Scott was watching and felt as though he was being robbed. He had been trying to get a mate for Princess for years. A bidding war erupted between Scott, Jimmy Stewart, a major league baseball team, a Hollywood producer, and a major European zoo. Scott said of Princess \\"It is cruel to expect an animal like that to live alone. And you can't mate her with an ordinary tiger-she's so superior...I appealed to the Maharaja from a conservation standpoint and it hit home.\\" Princess and Rajah were to be a \\"royal couple.\\" The Los Angeles Zoo had already spent $20,000 building a white tiger exhibit. Scott said that he would try and send them a pair of cubs from Princess and Rajah, but Princess died a week before Rajah was scheduled to arrive. Scott hired an Indian taxidermist to stuff Princess, and she was presented to the Museum of Science in Miami in 1972, but she is now in the reception area of the Miami MetroZoo's administration building. Scott paid around $45,000 for Raja, who he thought might still be mated to Mohini, but Rajah never arrived in Crandon Park. Scott was so respected as a tiger hunter that he was asked to deal with man eaters which were terrorizing villages. He was a hunter turned conservationist, and a cat-lover.Glass, Ian, Miami News, Crandon Park coup: a new white tiger, Dec. 10, 1970; White Tiger Donor Snaps Up A Mate (Before Bigmouth) Dec. 11, 1970; Autopsy still incomplete, Viral infection killeed Crandon's white tiger, Dec. 18, 1970; Dangaard, Colin, Miami's White Tiger Dies A Week Before Wedding, Miami Herald, Dec. 17, 1970; Princess's Ghost, Miami Herald, May 4, 1972 Mohini died in 1979.Park, Edwards, Around The Mall And Beyond, Smithsonian Sept. 1979 The skins and skulls of Mohini and Moni are in the Smithsonian, but are not on display. An orange brother of Mohini's named Ramesh lived in the M√©nagerie du Jardin des Plantes (Paris Zoo), and was bred to an unrelated tigress, but none of the offspring survived to reproduce. Ramesh was born in Govindgarh Palace and had an orange female littermate, named Ratna who went to New Delhi Zoo, and a white male littermate named Ramu. They were the fourth and last litter of Mohan and Radha. Ratna was paired with a wild caught male named Jim, at New Delhi Zoo, and produced three litters. Each cub would have had a 50% chance of inheriting the white gene from Ratna. Jim was captured in the Rewa forest, so they thought there was a chance he carried white genes. He had been somebody's pet, but after he ate a cat he was given to New Delhi Zoo. Jim used to appear leaping into his pond, at New Delhi Zoo, in the opening of one of Gerald Durrell's TV shows. Edward Pritchard Gee mentioned, in his book \\"The Wildlife Of India\\" (which has a foreword by Jawaharlal Nehru), that Bristol Zoo wanted to acquire one of the cubs of Mohan and Begum, as a mate for one of its white tigers, Champak or Chameli, to lessen the degree of inbreeding, as the US National Zoo had done with Sampson.Gee, Edward Pritchard. The wild life of India; with a foreword by Jawaharlal Nehru, London: Collins, 1964 , The Bristol Zoo did acquire one of the daughters of Mohan and Begum.Schomberg, Geoffrey, The Penguin guide to British zoos, Harmondsworth, Penguin 1970 In 1987 Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, and Peela were sold to the International Animal Exchange. Ranjit, Priya, and Peela went to the IAE's facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. The phenomenon of spontaneous ovulation in a tiger was first observed by Devra Kleiman, in one of the white tigresses at the National Zoo, which meant that it was possible to breed tigers by artificial insemination. Mohini died in 1979 at 20 years of age. Edwards Park wrote in Smithsonian magazine that National Zoo director Ted Reed was \\"mourning his queen the late Mohini Rewa.\\" Ted Reed said \\"It's impossible to say how much the zoo owes that cat and her cubs. They drew attention to the facility and made all of our recent improvements so much easier. If she had been human she would have been a movie star.\\" Tony, Bagheera, and Frosty: A new strain Tony, born in July 1972 in the Circus Winter Quarters of the Cole Bros. Circus (the Terrell Jacobs farm) in Peru, Indiana, was the founder of many American white tiger lines, especially those used in circuses.Geringer, Dan, \\"Now He's The Cat's Meow\\" Sports Illustrated Vol. 65 No. 3 July 21, 1986 His grandfather was a registered Siberian tiger, named Kubla, who was born at the Como Park, Zoo, and Conservatory in Saint Paul, Minnesota.Warner, Edythe Records, The tigers of Como Zoo, New York: Viking Press 1961Siberian tiger cubs born at Como Zoo, The New York Times July 23, 1958 pg. 40:2 Kubla's parents were born in the wild and believed to be brother and sister. Kubla was bred to a Bengal tigress named Susie, from a west coast zoo, at the Great Plains Zoo in Sioux Falls in South Dakota. She was once co-owned by Clyde Beatty. Between April 10, 1966 and August 3, 1969 Kubla and Susie produced 13 or 14 cubs in 5 or 6 litters. The cubs were widely distributed. One eventually reached Paris, and another went from the Utica Zoo in New York State to Japan. Two of their cubs (Rajah and Sheba II) were bred by Baron Julius Von Uhl, who lived in Peru, Indiana. Julius Von Uhl was born in Budapest and came to America in 1956 from Hungary after the revolution. One of the results of his tiger breeding was Tony, who therefore carried mixed bloodVan Nostrand, Mary L., \\"Mohan The Ghost Tiger Of Rewa\\" Zoonooz May 1984 pgs. 4‚Äì7 He may have been the source of a gene for stripelessness. Kubla was also bred to an Amur tigress named Katrina, who was born at the Rotterdam Zoo, and passed through the hands of two American zoos before joining Kubla and Susie at the Great Plains Zoo. Kubla and Katrina have living pure-Amur descendants which may include a line of white tigers, that are claimed as pure-Amurs, which originated out of Center Hill, Florida. These white tigers are not registered Amur tigers. A tiger trainer named Alan Gold owned a pair of Amur tigers which once produced a stillborn white cub. In 1972 there were four white tigers in the United States: Mohini and her daughter Rewati in Washington D.C., Tony, and his first cousin named Bagheera, a female born on July 8, 1972 in a litter of two white cubs, including a male which did not survive, in the Hawthorn Circus of John F. Cuneo Jr. Bagheera's mother, Sheba III, was a sister of Tony's mother, Sheba II. Bagheera's father was either an Amur tiger, named Ural, who was her preferred mate, and may have been her uncle and a littermate, or younger sibling, of Kubla, born at the Como Zoo; or one of two of her brothers, named Prince and Saber, who were also brothers to Tony's parents.Thornton, I.W.B. 1978. White tiger genetics-further evidence. J. Zool. 185:389‚Äì394 Most of Sheba III's litters did not include white cubs, but at least 50% of her orange cubs would have been white gene carriers, since they could have inherited the gene from their mother, and if both parents were heterozygotes 66%, or two out of three, of their orange cubs are likely to have been carriers. She had 27 cubs in 9 litters between July 8, 1972 and July 26, 1975, of which only 3 were white, or 11%, not 25% as would be expected if both parents in each mating were heterozygotes. Prince was castrated before Sheba III conceived another white cub, a male named Frosty, born on Feb. 25, 1975, in a litter which included two orange females and one orange male. It seems odd that a tiger which may have been fathering such valuable cubs (Prince) would have been neutered. Saber was never observed trying to mate, so perhaps Ural did sire one or more of Sheba III's white cubs, which would have been three quarters Siberian had this been the case. It is possible for tigers from the same litter to have different fathers. It's also possible that any or all three tigers-Ural, Prince, and Saber, carried the white gene. Ural was a sad specimen. He was cross eyed, although he was not white. Bagheera and Frosty were both severely cross eyed. Tony was purchased by John F. Cuneo Jr., owner of the Hawthorn Circus Corp. of Grayslake, Illinois,\\"Grrr! Ownership of rare white tiger disputed\\" The Detroit News Feb. 11, 1975 Section A. pg. 3Tiger's Sale O.K.ed For Extra $4000, The Detroit News Feb. 14, 1975 Section A. pg. 5 in February 1975 for $20,000 in Detroit. Tony's parents, Raja and Sheba, produced two more white cubs at the Baltimore County Fair on June 27, 1976.\\"Rare tigers born at fair\\", N.Y. Times June 28, 1976 The cubs were a white male, named \\"Baltimore County Fair\\", a white female named \\"Snowball\\", and an orange male. National Zoo spokeswoman Sybille Hamlem said: \\"This could be a real bonus for the breed if the two stay in the United States. The white tigers are no longer found in the wild and there have been genetic problems because of inbreeding. But that's apparently not the case here.\\"\\"2 tiger cubs, rare Siberian, born at fair\\", The Baltimore Sun, Monday June 28, 1976 pg. C.1 Snowball's name was later changed to \\"Maharani\\", and all three cubs were sold to the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus in Washington D.C.. Maharani died in 1984. Baron Julius Von Uhl had another three white cubs born between June 18 and 19, 1977 at Kingdom's 3 (formerly Lion Country Safari) at Stockbridge, Georgia off I-75 south of Atlanta.Rare White Tigers Born, The Atlanta Constitution Journal Sunday June 19, 1977 pg. 1 Two lived only a short time. The other, named Scarlett O'Hara, died at the Grady Memorial Hospital's animal research clinic in Atlanta, on Jan. 30, 1978, of cardiac arrest resulting from anaesthesia. She was there to undergo surgery to correct crossed eyes. (She was only cross eyed in the right eye, which turned inward toward the nose.) She was still owned by Julius Von Uhl at the time.Taylor, Ron, Scarlett O'Hara Sets Sights On Grady, The Atlanta Constitution Journal Wednes. Jan. 18, 1978 pg. 2AShealy, Larry, Scarlett's Beauty May Have Been Cub's Fatal Flaw, The Atlanta Constitution Journal Friday Jan. 20, 1978 pg. 1A, Tiger's Genetic Flaw Fatal? pg. 19A Tony was sent on breeding loan to the Cincinnati Zoo in 1976, to be bred to Rewati from the US National Zoo. However, Tony and Rewati did not breed, so he was bred to Mohini's orange daughter Kesari instead, resulting in a litter of four white and one orange cub June 27, 1976, the same day that eight-year-old Sheba had her white cubs in Baltimore, Maryland. It is an astounding coincidence that both tigresses gave birth to white cubs on exactly the same day. On that one day America's white tiger population nearly doubled from 8 to 14. Kesari's 1976 litter represented a mixture of the two unrelated strains. All of the white cubs from Kesari's 1976 litter by Tony were cross-eyed, as were Rewati, Bagheera, and Frosty. The Cincinnati Zoo retained a brother and sister pair from the litter, named Bhim and Sumita, and their orange sister Kamala. Two white males returned to the Hawthorn Circus with Tony as John Cuneo's share from the breeding loan. John Cuneo also asked the Bristol Zoo to trade some white tigers, to diversify the gene pool, but the Bristol Zoo declined, perhaps not wishing to exchange pure-Bengals for mongrels. Tony, Bagheera, and Frosty lived for years with a troop of Hawthorn Circus tigers stationed at Marineland and Game Farm, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Because of selective breeding only a few of the oldest white tigers in the Hawthorn Circus today are cross eyed. Bhim and Sumita became the world record parents of white cubs. In 1976 there were 39 white tigers-7 in New Delhi, 7 in Kolkata, one in Guwahati, one in Lucknow, one in Hyderabad, 8 in Bristol, Cincinnati Zoo had 2, Washington had 5, John Cuneo had 5, and Julius Von Uhl had 2. The Maharaja of Rewa retired from the white tiger business in 1976. He later abdicated in favor of his son so that he could run for the family seat in parliament and became an MP. There is a white tiger cub on the shield of the coat of arms of the Maharajas of Rewa. Over 70 white tigers have been born at the Cincinnati Zoo, which is no longer in the white tiger business. The Cincinnati Zoo sold white tigersWhite Bengal tiger imported for Longleat Safari Park, The Times March 22, 1989 pg. 3d for $60,000 each. Siegfried & Roy bought a litter of three white cubs from the Cincinnati Zoo, which were offspring of Bhim and Sumita, for around $125,000. Prior to 1974 the Cincinnati Zoo wanted to acquire a white tiger, but no zoo would sell at any price. By the 1980s the Cincinnati Zoo was the world's leading purveyor of white tigers. It was a cousin of the Maharaja of Rewa, Lt. Col. Fatesinghrao \\"Jackie\\" Gaekwad, the Maharaja of Baroda, who was also the Commissioner of Indian Wildlife and an MP, who suggested to Siegfried and Roy that they acquire white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo and include them in their act.Fischbacher, Siegfried; Horn, Roy Uwe Ludwig, & Tapert, Annette, Siegfried and Roy: mastering the impossible, New York: W. Morrow, c 1992\\"Jackie\\" was also the President of the World Wildlife Fund India. In the mid 1980s Siegfried & Roy owned 10% of the world's white tigers, and they were escorting two big white tiger cubs, with dark stripes, to their new home in Phantasialand in Br√ºhl, Germany, when the white tigers were briefly stolen with their truck in New York City.thieves abandon stolen truck containing 2 white tiger cub(s) The Washington Post, June 5, 1987 pg. A 13b The driver stopped for coffee. The white tigers made their debut in Germany at a ceremony attended by the United States Ambassador. The Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska bought Tony's parents and orange sister Obie (born in 1975) in 1978,Simmons, Lee G., White Tigers The realities, Tigers Of The World, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987 and bred more white tigers. Kesari also went to live at Omaha Zoo, but did not have any more cubs. Some of Tony's white siblings born in Omaha proved to be sterile. Obie was paired with Ranjit from the National Zoo, and their cubs like those of Tony and Kesari, included non inbred white tigers. A white tiger named Chester, who was a son of Ranjit and Obie, born at the Omaha Zoo, fathered the first test tube tigers,Stolzenburg, William, Battling extinction with test-tube tigers, Science News May 26, 1990 and then became the first white tiger in Australia when he was sent to the Taronga Zoo in Sydney. His brother, Panghur Ban, was the National Zoo's last white tiger.National Zoo's only white tiger euthanized https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-10-02-white-tiger-dies_x.htm A white tiger named Rajiv, a son of Bhim, became the first white tiger in Africa, when he was sent to Pretoria Zoo in exchange for a king cheetah.\\"First White Tiger In Africa\\" & \\"How To Breed A White Tiger\\" Zoon No. 29, 1988‚Äì4 In 1983 Rewati was paired with Ika, from Kesari's 1976 litter, at the Columbus Zoo.\\"Rewati\\" Columbus ZooViews Autumn 1981 By this time he was a three legged amputee retired from circus performance, put out to pasture to breed. Ika killed Rewati in the act of mating.\\"D.C. born white tiger killed by mate in Columbus (Ohio) zoo\\" Washington Post April 8, 1983 pg. B3 Ika was then mated with a white tigress named Taj, who was a grand daughter of his brothers Ranjit and Bhim. Ika was also bred to Taj's orange mother Dolly, a daughter of Bhim and an unrelated orange tigress named Kimanthi, in Columbus. Taj's father, Duke, was a son of Ranjit from an outcross to an unrelated orange tigress. Isson, a white grandson of Kesari and Tony, was also dispatched to Columbus on breeding loan from the Hawthorn Circus, of Grayslake, Illinois, which eventually had 80 white tigers, the largest collection in the world at the time. In 1984 five white tiger cubs were stolen from the Hawthorn Circus in Portland, Oregon, and two died. The tigers were touring with the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus. The culprit was a veterinarian who was sentenced to one year in prison and six months in a halfway house. Cincinnati Zoo director Ed Maruska testified in the case that the five white cubs had a dollar value in excess of $5000.\\"Verdict upheld in cubs case\\"The Baton Rouge Advocate, Nov. 16, 1986 In 1974 a white cub was born in the Racine Zoological Gardens in Wisconsin, from a father-daughter mating. The father, named Bucky, killed the white cub. The mother, named Bonnie, was later bred with an orange littermate of Tony named \\"Chequila\\", who belonged to James Witchey of Ravenna, Ohio, who bought him from Dick Hartman of South Lebanon, Ohio, when he was four or five years of age. Chequila proved to be a white gene carrier and fathered at least one white cub in the Racine Zoo in 1980. It is not known whether Bucky, who came from the Fort Wayne Children's Zoo in Indiana, and his daughter Bonnie, were related to any of the established strains of white tigers, but it is possible that Bucky was another one of the cubs of Kubla and Susie, born in Sioux Falls. By 1987 10% of North American zoo tigers were white. The Orissa strain Three white tigers were also born in the Nandankanan Zoo in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India in 1980. Their parents were an orange father‚Äìdaughter pair called Deepak and Ganga, who were not related to Mohan or any other captive white tiger ‚Äì one of their wild-caught ancestors would have carried the recessive white gene, and it showed up when Deepak was mated to his daughter. Deepak's sister also turned out to be a white gene carrier. These white tigers are therefore referred to as the Orissa strain, as opposed to the Rewa strain, of white tigers founded by Mohan.Roychoudhury, A.K., Chapter 34 \\"White Tigers And Their Conservation\\", Part IV \\"White Tiger Politics\\", Tigers Of The World, The Biology, Biopolitics, Management And Conservation Of An Endangered Species, Noyes Publications, Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987Roychoudhury, A.K., & L.N.

Times of India, New Delhi March 15 When the surprise birth of three white cubs occurred there was a white tigress already living at the zoo, named Diana, from New Delhi Zoo. One of the three was later bred to her creating another blend of two unrelated strains of white tigers. This lineage resulted in several white tigers in Nandan Kanan Zoo. Today the Nandankanan Zoo has the largest collection of white tigers in India. The Cincinnati Zoo acquired two female white tigers from the Nandan Kanan Zoo, in the hopes of establishing a line of pure-Bengal white tigers in America, but they never got a male, and did not receive authorization from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)'s Species Survival Plan (SSP) to breed them. The Zoo Outreach Organisation used to publish studbooks for white tigers, which were compiled by A.K. Roychoudhury of the Bose Institute in Calcutta, and subsidized by the Humane Society of India.Roychoudhury A.K. 1989 About studbook of white tigers in India. Zoos' Print Journal 4:8‚Äì9 The Columbus Zoo had also hoped to breed pure-Bengal white tigers, but were unable to obtain a white registered Bengal mate for Rewati from India.Ferguson, David A., & Kohl, Steven G., Developing International Conservation Programs, Tigers Of The World, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987 There were also surprise births of white tigers in the Asian Circus, in India, to parents not known to have been white gene carriers, or heterozygotes, and not known to have any relationship to any other white tiger strains. There was a female white cub born at Mysore Zoo in 1984, from orange parents, descended from Deepak's sister. The white cub's grandmother Thara came from the Nandankanan Zoo in 1972. Mysore Zoo had a second female white tiger cub from New Delhi Zoo in 1984. On August 29, 1979 a white tigress named Seema was dispatched to Kanpur Zoo to be bred to Badal, a tiger who was a fourth generation descendant of Mohan and Begum. The pair did not breed so it was decided to pair Seema with one of two wild caught, notorious man eaters, either Sheru or Titu, from the Jim Corbett National Park. Seema and Sheru produced a white cub, and for a while it was thought there might be white genes in Corbett's population of tigers, but the cub did not stay white.Roychoudhury, A.K., The Indian White Tiger Studbook, Zoo Zen, International Zoo Outreach Org., Tamil Nadu, India 1989The White Bengal Tiger http://www.518.ips12.in.us/CamsPhotos/Tigers/3518.aspx.htmlZoo Dynamics There have been other cases of white tiger, white lion, and white panther cubs being born, and then changing to normal color. White tigers which were a mixture of the Rewa and Orissa strains, born at the Nandan Kanan Zoo, were non inbred. A white tiger from out of the Orissa strain found its way to the Western Plains Zoo in Australia. Australia's Dreamworld, on the Gold Coast, wanted to breed this tiger to one of their white tigers from the United States.

It had a magnitude of 6.8 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing extensive damage in Himachal Pradesh, in northern India. Its epicentre was in Kinnaur district in the southeastern part of Himachal Pradesh and caused 47 casualties. Landslides, rock falls and avalanches caused major damage to the Hindustan-Tibet Road. The earthquake affected many monasteries and buildings in the state and led to an extensive restoration work in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Himachal Pradesh. The Spiti and Parachu valleys in particular suffered the greatest damage being on the north‚Äìsouth Kaurik-Chango fault, causing damage to landmarks such as Key Monastery and Tabo Monastery. Tectonic setting The state of Himachal Pradesh lies towards the southern boundary of the Himalayan mountain belt, which was formed by the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The mountain building that formed the Himalayas is an example of thrust tectonics and is dominated by thrust faulting. There is however, a significant amount of extension along the length of the mountain belt, possibly related to its arcuate form, with the extension accommodating the bulging out of the frontal part of the Himalayas. However, the faulting in the NW Himalayas demonstrates west‚Äìeast extension, which is at a fairly high angle to the trend of the main thrust structures and may be better explained as partly accommodating the eastward spreading of the Tibetan Plateau. One of the most significant extensional structures in Himachal Pradesh is the Kaurik-Chango Fault Zone. This is interpreted to be seismically active from the presence of thermal springs and gypsum deposits and from studies of soft-sediment deformation structures thought to be seismites. These seismites have been used to suggest eight earlier earthquakes of magnitude greater than 6 in the Sumdo area affecting these Late Pleistocene to Holocene sediments. The estimated recurrence interval for earthquakes along this fault zone is about 10,000 years. Earthquake The earthquake rupture is estimated to be about in length and in area, with a displacement of about . The mainshock was preceded by a major foreshock. Ground rupture was observed in the form of a series of small vertical faults, with downthrow to the west, offsetting part of National Highway 22 between Sumdo and Kaurik, with displacements up to 50 cm. The isoseismal lines for the earthquake are elongated in a north‚Äìsouth direction, parallel to the strike of the Kaurik-Chango Fault Zone. The focal mechanism of the earthquake indicates normal faulting along a north‚Äìsouth trending, west- dipping fault. Damage The areas most strongly affected by the earthquake were the districts of Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti. The worst affected villages were in the Parachu and Spiti river valleys. The village of Karauk showed the greatest degree of damage, with no building being unaffected. Buildings sited on slopes or at the base of slopes were not only affected by the shaking but by boulders falling from the hills above them. The performance of the different types of residential buildings varied greatly. Houses made from mud, either directly or as sun-dried bricks showed damage over a wide area (up to from the epicenter) and those in the epicentral area were often severely damaged. Unreinforced masonry structures were also badly affected, particularly those made of \\"random rubble stone masonry\\" (RRSM) with mud mortar, some of them having collapsed completely. The best performing buildings were barrack type houses constructed from corrugated iron covering a timber frame, which generally showed little or no damage. The many monasteries and temples in the area were mostly badly damaged. They were often constructed with mudbrick or RRSM walls and had heavy roofs. Strong vertical motion during the earthquake led to excessive loads on the upper part of the supporting walls causing them to bulge outwards. There were many landslides, rockfalls and avalanches triggered by the earthquake. One landslide dammed the Parachu river to a height of , forming a lake that caused flash flooding when it burst two months later. Aftermath Damaged temples and monasteries were repaired or rebuilt immediately after the earthquake. The Guru Ghantal monastery at Tupchiling, which was completely destroyed in the earthquake, was rebuilt using stone masonry and cement mortar. The roof, which was originally wooden, although it had already been replaced by slates by 1975, now consists of corrugated iron sheets. The original design of these earthen buildings had already evolved to contain elements of earthquake resistance before the damage in 1975. The walls were reinforced using ring beams around the whole structure to prevent outward displacement during an earthquake. Further reinforcement was in some cases provided by buttresses of stone or brick at each corner of the building. Initial repairs after the earthquake by the local people involved additional corner buttresses, replacement wooden roofs and repair of the upper walls with stone masonry. Most of these repairs however, have either caused further problems or may do so in the future.

As of 2016, he is a design consultant for Eternal, in addition to streaming and casting Hearthstone and certain associated tournaments. Kibler is also a professional card player, and has had great success at Magic: The Gathering with five Pro Tour Top 8s, winning Pro Tour Austin in 2009 and Pro Tour Honolulu in 2012. He also has 13 Grand Prix Top 8s, winning three of them including the first one held in the 1997‚Äì98 season and most recently Grand Prix Sendai. In August 2004, he won the inaugural VS System Pro Circuit event taking home $40,000 and a spot in history as the game's first champion. Owing to a pause in his career, he was finally inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2010. Career Kibler began his Magic: The Gathering career at the age of fifteen, placing 30th in the Junior Division of the first-ever Pro Tour, Pro Tour New York 1996. Kibler would not qualify for the senior Pro Tour until Pro Tour Chicago 1997, which he qualified for by winning Grand Prix Toronto 1997. All his opponents in the Top 8 of Grand Prix Toronto went on to work at Wizards of the Coast, including Mike Turian, Matt Place and Erik Lauer. Kibler would also attend Pro Tour Los Angeles in the 1997‚Äì1998 season, placing within the Top 64, however he would not return to the Pro Tour until the 1999‚Äì2000 season. Kibler made his first Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour Chicago 2000. This was also the tournament where Kibler would earn the nickname of The Dragonmaster, after beating Jon Finkel in the Swiss rounds and Zvi Mowshowitz in the quarterfinals with a combination of and . He would go on to lose to Kai Budde in the semi-finals, taking third place in the overall standings. This would be Kibler's best Pro Tour performance before he retired from the game at the end of the 2004 season. In 2005, Kibler was one of a small number of players commemorated by Wizards of the Coast with a \\"Pro Player\\" collectible reference card. After taking several years away from Magic (while working at Wizards' direct competitor Upper Deck) he returned in 2009. Kibler claims that a major motivating factor for his return was his desire to enter the Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame, which was created the year following his retirement. Kibler would make consecutive Pro Tour Top 8s upon his return, making Top 8 at Pro Tour Honolulu before going on to win his first Pro Tour at Pro Tour Austin, defeating Tsuyoshi Ikeda in the tournament finals. By the end of the year he placed in the top 10 of the year's best performers on the Magic Pro Tour, achieving enough points to guarantee him invites to major championships, free air travel, and a guaranteed appearance fee for attending all 2010 events. Additionally, he was tied for 6th among player committee votes of the possible entrants for the 2009 Hall of Fame, carrying around 20% of their vote. In 2010, Kibler's high performance continued, granting him his third Grand Prix title, another Pro Tour Top 8, and finally induction into the Hall of Fame. Kibler was inducted in the Hall of Fame Class of 2010 alongside Gabriel Nassif and Bram Snepvangers. In the 2012 season, Kibler made his fifth career Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour Dark Ascension in Honolulu. The Top 8 would also feature two other Hall of Fame members in Jon Finkel and Jelger Wiegersma.

The building was designed by the Danish architectural practice PLOT (BIG+JDSA). The apartments scale the diagonally sloping roof of the parking garage, from street level to 11th floor, creating an artificial, south facing 'mountainside'. Each apartment has a \\"backyard\\" on the roof of the property in front and below it. The resulting courtyard penthouses are an attempt to balance \\"the splendours of the suburban backyard with the intensity of an urban lifestyle\\". Throughout the building, it plays on a mountain metaphor as well as the clash between the urban vibe of the interior parking space as well as the surroundings and the peaceful and organic hillside. Parking garage The interior The interior The parking garage contains parking spots for 480 cars. The space has up to 16 m high ceilings, and the underside of each level of apartments is covered in aluminum painted in a distinctive colour scheme of psychedelic hues which, as a tribute to Danish 1960s and '70s furniture designer Verner Panton, are all exact matches of the colours he used in his designs. The colours move, symbolically, from green for the earth over yellow, orange, dark orange, hot pink, purple to bright blue for the sky. Besides being a sloping podium for the residential units to sit on, maximizing sunlight and views, the central garage space also serves as an atrium containing the building's circulation, affording the only access to the apartments. A set of metal stairs climb through the main space over the parking lot, providing access to the hallways across suspended industrial- looking metal-clad concrete connections, while a Swiss-manufactured, ski lift- style inclined elevator moves along the wall of the garage. Each level's hallway is enclosed and encased in painted metal both on the interior and exterior, colored according to floor in the same hues used in the main space. Apartments The sloping roof is covered with a single layer of 80 penthouses. Each apartment has an L-shaped floor plan and a terrace and small garden outside, located on the roof of the in-front, lower-level apartment. The design is inspired by suburban rowhouses developments. The L-shape floor plan in combination with a small courtyard was inspired by J√∏rn Utzon's Kingo Houses north of Copenhagen. The facades of the apartments towards the gardens are clad in untreated wood to increase the organic and calm feel of the setting. Artwork and ornamental features The Himalaya feature Himalayan panorama The northern and western facades of the parking garage depict a 3,000 m¬≤ photorealistic mural of Himalayan peaks. The parking garage is protected from wind and rain by huge shiny aluminium plates, perforated to let in light and allow for natural ventilation. By controlling the size of the holes, the sheeting were transformed into the giant rasterized image of Mount Everest. The picture is based on a photo commissioned from a Japanese Himalaya photographer, though it had to be stretched to fit the proportions of the site. Murals The interior walls of the car park are decorated with a series of murals by the French street artist Victor Ash, depicting scenes of wildlife such as moose and wolves standing atop 'automobile mountains' of wrecked cars. \\"The slope\\" in March 2015 Planting The roof gardens are edged by elevated flowerbeds in the shape of planter railings, designed to block the view to neighbouring, lower-level apartments. They are planted according to a coordinated scheme of plants, which will make the colours and the appearance of the mountain slope change according to the changing seasons. The building has an extensive watering system which collects rainwater and uses it for automatically watering the roof gardens during dry periods. Other use Interior of Mountain Dwellings For special occasions, the urban space of the parking garage is used for events and parties, such as the closing party of Copenhagen Distortion in 2008. A public staircase on the outside allows the general public to \\"climb\\" the mountain, and a local mountain climbers‚Äô association will soon install a climbing wall at the back of the building, near the peak. Mountain Dwellings is featured in the parkour documentary \\"My Playground\\".

The main objective of the fund is to provide grants for research into causes, diagnosis and treatments of pancreatic cancer. The grants enable equipment to be purchased or leased and cover the employment costs and expenses of researchers. Fundraising The Fund receives no direct Government assistance, except for Gift Aid on qualifying donations. All donations are from private individuals and institutions such as Freemasons' Lodges, with a small amount deriving from corporations. Golf Days, sponsored runs such as the London Marathon, and other similar events all help to generate funds. With the exception of some miscellaneous administration expenditure such as postage and stationery, fund raising costs and annual audit fees, all donations are used for the main objective of the Fund. *In the Financial Year to March 2002, 96% of all donations were used for Charitable purposes. *In the year to March 2003, the figure reduced to 87%, due to a reduction in donations received for the year. *to March 2004, 92% *to March 2005, 94%, *to March 2006, 97%. *to March 2007, 95%, *to March 2008, 87%, due to a reduction in donations received for the year. *to March 2009, 98%. Funded research The charity mainly funds research at St George's University of London, where work is currently focused on the effectiveness of drugs or a combination of drugs on pancreatic cancer cells and also their effectiveness in inhibiting cell resistance to chemotherapy. The research has resulted in a high impact publication in the International Journal of Cancer, showing that a commonly used antibiotic, Doxycycline, is capable of inducing cell death in human pancreatic cancer cells. Other funded research work at St George‚Äôs has concentrated on the effect of protein control on cancer cells, where a naturally occurring hormone-like agent has been identified as having potential as a cancer treatment but which has no effect on healthy cells. Medical equipment In October 2007 the Fund entered into an operating lease for the supply and installation of Endoscopic Ultrasound equipment in the Oncology Department at St George‚Äôs. This equipment enables earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and will provides data and samples to support the research work.

It originally aired on October 19, 2009. Plot Future Ted explains that Robin's Canadian quirks and mannerisms were strange, which got her into trouble in the fall of 2009. After a bar fight, she is charged with assault and could be deported unless she gets American citizenship. Barney encourages her to take the citizenship test and teaches her to be obnoxious, arrogant and willfully ignorant‚Äîthe hallmarks of a true American. Robin walks past her Canadian bar and goes in. After some serious drinking with Canada's national women's curling team, she blacks out and ends up in a Toronto hotel room. Barney tracks her down and convinces her to take the test. They stop at a Tim Hortons, where the cashier mistakes her for an American. Barney makes a speech ridiculing Canadians for letting such an amazing woman go and then is beat up. After some free Canadian health care, they return home and Robin decides she wants dual citizenship. Ted hears Gazola's pizzeria in Chicago is closing down. He and Marshall used to drive straight from Wesleyan to the pizzeria while in college, even though the pizza was awful. The road trips cemented their friendship, and Ted proposes they take one last trip. Pumped to spend some personal time with Marshall, Ted is disappointed that Lily is coming along. Lily needs bathroom breaks frequently and insists they listen to an audiobook parodying Marley & Me. Ted is annoyed when they stop at a bed and breakfast instead of driving through the night. After Lily and Marshall engage in some couples' activities, Ted tricks Marshall into driving with him to Gazola's in his bathrobe. They enjoy the pizza, but Marshall feels guilty over abandoning Lily, and they leave. Ted admits that he is angry that Lily tagged along, and the two stop speaking. They drive back to the bed and breakfast not speaking to each other, but the audio-book story they are listening to makes them realize they need each other's friendship, and they reconcile. Lily hasn't even noticed that they're gone because she has been powerfully sedated by the hotel's spa services. After some severe stomach pains from the pizza, the three head back to New York. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade of A‚àí. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 9.5 out of 10.

Seated (L-R): Ben-Tsien Hofman (Tsivion), Max Goldfarb, Morris Winchevsky, A. Litvak, Hannah Salutsky, Moishe Terman. Standing: Shauchno Epstein, Frank Rozenblat, Baruch Charney Vladeck, Moissaye Olgin, Jacob Salutsky (J.B.S. Hardman). The Jewish Socialist Federation (JSF) was a secular Jewish Yiddish-oriented organization founded in 1912 which acted as a language federation in the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Many of the founding members of the JSF had previously been members of the Bund in Eastern Europe and sought to bring Bundist politics to the socialist movement in the USA. The JSF split in 1921 over the question of the Bolshevik Revolution, with the organization disaffiliating from the SPA and a minority splitting to form a new organization called the Jewish Socialist Verband (JSV) and remaining affiliated to the SPA. The newly independent JSF soon joined the Workers Party of America (legal arm of the underground Communist Party of America) and merged into a previously-existing Jewish Communist Federation of that organization. History Background Scholars have commonly dated the origin of the Jewish labor movement in the United States to the decade of the 1880s.See, for example, Tony Michels, A Fire in Their Hearts: Yiddish Socialists in New York. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005, pp. 30-41; Melech Epstein, Jewish Labor in the USA: An Industrial, Political, and Cultural History of the Jewish Labor Movement: Volume 1, 1882-1914. New York: Trade Union Sponsoring Committee, 1950, passim; Gerald Sorin, The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1985, passim. There were quantitative reasons for this date of origin. Tsar Alexander II was assassinated by a bomb on March 13, 1881, and ushered in a wave of official and popular antisemitic violence known as pogroms in which individuals were killed, cultural institutions sacked, and property destroyed. The reaction raged at its most extreme in the years 1881 and 1882, during which there were scores of violent events throughout the southern and western regions of the Russian empire in which Jews were permitted to dwell.For a monograph on the 1881-1882 terror, see Stephen M. Berk, Year of Crisis, Year of Hope: Russian Jewry and the Pogroms of 1881-1882. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1985. A wave of emigration followed, with the number of Jewish immigrants to the United States rocketing from less than 35,000 for the entire decade of the 1870s to more than 175,000 during the decade of the 1880s.Melech Epstein, Jewish Labor in the USA: An Industrial, Political, and Cultural History of the Jewish Labor Movement: Volume 1, 1882-1914. New York: Trade Union Sponsoring Committee, 1950; pp. 38-39. Jewish emigration, particularly from the violent and anti-semitic Russian empire continued to accelerate during the decade of the 1890s, with more than one out of every ten new arrivals in the United States of Jewish ethnicity during those years.Epstein, Jewish Labor in the USA, vol. 1, pg. 40. Antecedents Early Jewish Socialist political organization in the United States kept its eyes and agenda focused abroad, as American affiliates of the General Jewish Labor Bund, a revolutionary organization seeking the overthrow of tsarism in the Russian empire. The first such American branch of the Bund was formed in 1900 and within five years about 50 such American Bund affiliates were formed, united under the umbrella of a group called the Central Union of Bund Organizations.Nora Levin, While Messiah Tarried: Jewish Socialist Movements, 1871-1917. New York: Schocken Books, 1977; pg. 166. In addition to their Eastern European focus, centered around the raising and transmission of funds to the Russian revolutionary movement, these American Bund groups advocated Jewish cultural and political autonomy rather than assimilation into the domestic orientation of the anglophonic Socialist Party of America (SPA). From 1905 many local Yiddish-language organization were loosely coordinated by a group called the Jewish Socialist Agitation Bureau, founded by a tailor from Rochester, New York named Max Kaufman.Michels, A Fire in Their Hearts, pg. 158. Kaufman's Agitation Bureau was envisioned as a mechanism for bringing prominent Yiddish-language socialists from New York City to address Jewish communities in Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse, and elsewhere in the Northeast. This effort proved successful, with such socialist notables as economist Isaac Hourwich and politician Meyer London sponsored on speaking tours. The Bureau also coordinated the distribution of leaflets and pamphlets in the Yiddish language.Tim Davenport, \\"Jewish (Yiddish) Language Federations,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ The Socialist Agitation Bureau met in convention annually,Michels, A Fire in Their Hearts, pg. 160. with the established network of Bundist clubs playing a key role in the organization's expansion. By 1909 it was estimated that between 80 and 90 percent of the affiliates of the Bureau maintained Bundist ties.Michels, A Fire in Their Hearts, pg. 159. Establishment of the JSF The American urban working class was largely an immigrant population in the early years of the 20th century and the Socialist Party of America sought to improve its connection with non-English-speaking workers through the expansion of its language federations ‚Äî semi-autonomous parallel organizations coordinating the activity of party branches speaking a common language and expediting the distribution of pamphlets and leaflets in that tongue. In contrast to the dozens of independent Finnish-language socialist clubs which joined en bloc to establish the Finnish Socialist Federation of the SPA in 1906, the Jewish Socialist Federation was created largely through the initiative of the Socialist Party itself. Socialist Party branches conducting their business in Yiddish existed as regular units of the state and national Socialist Party, paying full dues to those party organizations and differing from English-language branches only in the language in which they conducted their business. As early as 1907, Jewish Socialist Agitation Bureau founder Max Kaufman proposed the establishment of a Yiddish language federation within the Socialist Party ‚Äî although this proposal was initially shot down by doctrinaire Jewish socialists as an unacceptable compromise with ethnic nationalism rather than class-based internationalism. One prominent Jewish socialist was quick to dismiss the idea of a semi-autonomous Jewish federation paralleling the Bund with the assertion that \\"in America special Russian Jewish wounds do not exist; thus, here in America there can be no place and no value for special Russian Jewish remedies.\\"Mikhail Zametkin, in Tsayt-Gayst (The Spirit of the Times), Jan. 18, 1907, pg. 8. Quoted in Michels, A Fire in Their Hearts, pg. 158. Nevertheless, sentiment seeking organization of Yiddish-language Socialist branches continued to develop. A major step towards language autonomy was taken in the summer of 1910 when the SPA's constitution was amended to entitle any non-English language group with 500 or more dues paying members to federation status with a paid official called a \\"Translator- Secretary\\" granted an office at party headquarters in Chicago.Levin, While Messiah Tarried, pg. 198. Over the next two years SPA Federations had been launched for the party's Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Swedish/Norwegian, and Slovenian members, joined in 1912 with the formation of the Yiddish- language Jewish Socialist Federation. Many or most ethnic Jews in the SPA were not members of the Jewish Socialist Federation, instead participating in English-language branches.Gerald Sorin, The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1985; pg. 104. Indeed, some of these disapproved of the Jewish Federation, preferring promotion of the process of \\"Americanization\\" and integration into American political life over the semi-autonomous federation approach ‚Äî which was characterized by activist and historian Will Herberg as \\"virtually a Jewish Socialist Party within the...Party.\\"Will Herberg, \\"The American Jewish Labor Movement,\\" in American Jewish Year Books, vol. 80 (1952), pg. 25; cited in Sorin, The Prophetic Minority, pg. 104. While tactically useful in coordinating socialist propaganda in the native language of immigrant workers, the implicit emphasis of ethnicity over social class of the federation approach seemed to many a departure from the traditional socialist principle of internationalism. Development The Jewish Socialist Federation grew rapidly, soon numbering some 65 geographic branches with a membership approaching 3,000. Despite the ethnic rather than class orientation behind its organization, the Jewish Federation attracted some of the most radical Jewish socialists to its ranks, soon emerging to the left of the Socialist Party itself.

Sir Henry de Bohun (died 23 June 1314) was an English knight, the grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. He was killed on the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn by Robert the Bruce. Riding in the vanguard of heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of the Scottish king who was mounted on a small palfrey (ane gay palfray Li till and joly) armed only with a battle-axe.Maxton, Sir Herbert, Robert the Bruce and the struggle for Scottish independence, 1909 De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, but Bruce stood his ground. At the last moment Bruce manoeuvred his mount nimbly to one side, stood up in his stirrups and hit de Bohun so hard with his axe that he split his helmet and head in two .

She won the UK and International Songwriting Competition in 2003 with her song Blowing This Candle Out. Her second album Compass was awarded the Best Album title in the Folk / Singer-Songwriter category at the 2010 Independent Music Awards. Career Summary Jane Taylor's debut album hit BBC national radio when Johnnie Walker decided to play the opening track from an album entitled Montpelier that he found on his desk, because he liked the cover (a charcoal sketch of her street which Jane had doodled herself). The response from the listeners was enormous, highly unusual for an 'unknown' and Johnnie Walker played the track over 15 times, despite it not actually being on the playlist and invited Taylor into the studio to perform a live session on the show. Her first album Montpelier had been made on a shoe-string, in a barn, with all manufacturing costs financed by pre selling the album to her dedicated fan base (which she had home grown from the city of Bristol). Taylor, producer Bill Lovelady and her band recorded the album in nine days in a freezing October. Once it was made she just posted it to BBC Radio 2 and crossed her fingers. Because of the response to the airplay she was invited into the BBC to perform a live session on the show. From there she went on to support Jools Holland, Bill Wyman, Seth Lakeman, Paul Buchanan, Andy Fairweather Low and Paulo Nutini. She secured a distribution deal, had \\"Fall on Me\\" played on MTV, and toured the UK and Germany, spreading the word and connecting her music to even more people. Two years later, Taylor released her second album, Compass which was financially backed by two fans of her music whom Taylor now refers to as 'The Angels'. Taylor had never met her benefactors before, but they are now friends indeed. She made the album with Mercury nominated producer Colin Elliot (famous for his work on the Richard Hawley albums) in Sheffield's Yellow Arch Studios. The album featured the Grimethorpe Colliery Brass Band (who performed in the film Brassed Off), a gospel choir made up of some of the finest songwriters and musicians in Bristol and Bath, a rhythm track featuring everything from a rustling bin to the cellists impression of the sound of a dolphin, and classical string arrangements from her resident band Robin Davies, Bethany Porter and Feargus Heatherington. Tracks from Compass received BBC Radio 2 airplay. The album recently won an award for Best Album in the Folk / Singer-Songwriter category in the 2010 Independent Music Awards. After taking some time out to give birth to her son, she booked a concert at St George's Hall, Bristol, which was sold out. Taylor invited musicians to join her on stage including Lizz Lipscombe on violin, Robert Bray on percussion and uke, Robin Davies on double bass and Kate Robey on cello. Other guests included marimba player Alphonse Daudet Touna, singer-songwriter Roger Tarry, The JT Brass Players (Andy Davies, Matt Davies and Chris Sanders) and the Barefoot Collective & Original Sing choirs. The concert was a success and was voted one of the top three gigs in the South West for 2010 by Bristol's Venue Magazine. A recording of the concert was released as Live Album in November 2011. In December 2011, Taylor released her new single \\"Oh December\\". Taylor continues to create music with her band and tour under her own independent label Bicycle Records. She is supported by her fan base, who in 2010 raised over ¬£9000 to help her promote her work and fund her tours. Quotes \\"Without the people who buy my music and support the gigs and concerts I would never have got this far. Being an independent artist, making the kind of music I do, and competing with the more commercial and larger labels can be fiercely overwhelming at times! But then I'll get an incredible email from someone who's connected with the music or have the most wonderful feedback after a gig and I couldn't ever think about doing anything else!!\\" Jane Taylor \\"Classic, timeless songwriting. A quintessentially English Gem.\\" Time Out \\"Beautiful.\\" Johnnie Walker, BBC Radio 2 \\"A very talented artist.\\" Bob Harris, BBC Radio 2 Biography Growing up Taylor was born in Lincolnshire in 1972, in an RAF hospital at Nocton Hall. As well as being in the RAF, her father was an artist, songwriter and guitarist. His musical talent and love of Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Simon and Garfunkel influenced the young Jane, as did her mother's love of classical music. She picked up her father's guitar at the age of five and composed her first song. Brought up in a village near Newark, Nottinghamshire, she attended Brownies and Sunday School at the local Church Hall. She continued to play the guitar and piano and composed throughout her childhood, winning school competitions and gaining a reputation for playing her music to the school. At the age of 19, Jane went to Keele University, Staffordshire, where her music took on a political flavour. In particular, a song entitled \\"Tiananmen Square\\" became a much loved anthem for many of the students visiting the folk club there in the 1990s. Early career Following university, she landed a job in the music industry working for one of the few independents at the time, The Grapevine Label Ltd. Grapevine had signed Emmylou Harris, Christy Moore, and Joan Baez. There she learned how to make and manufacture a record, and most importantly how to promote and sell a record.. Professional musician In 2003, Taylor decided to give up her normal job and become a full-time singer-songwriter. A month later, she recorded her first single with Massive Attack guitarist Angelo Bruschini. The track was called \\"Blowing This Candle Out\\" and went on to win Best Song in the 'International Songwriter of the Year' competition, and landed Taylor her first major gig at Ronnie Scotts. She also went on to tour in Germany and Italy, gathering more fans along the way. Sony TV requested permission to play the track \\"Getting To Me\\" (which was just a demo at the time) on the TV series Dawson's Creek. Taylor set up her own record label, Bicycle Records. Montpelier (2006) Together with Bill Lovelady, Taylor and her band created her first album Montpelier. When Johnnie Walker played the song \\"Fall on Me\\" on his BBC Radio 2 show in 2006, he was inundated with emails wanting to know who this new singer-songwriter was, where they could find out about her, and most importantly would he \\"Please play more\\". Walker invited Taylor to play a live session on his show. Taylor has since appeared on the Radio 4 show Loose Ends, secured an international distribution deal with Pinnacle, had a track from the album included on The Word magazine, and landed support slots opening for Jools Holland, Bill Wyman, Paolo Nutini, Seth Lakeman, Midge Ure, Andy Fairweather-Low and Paul Buchanan of The Blue Nile. Compass (2008) Compass was released in 2008, with a number of special album preview shows in Scotland. The first official launch was in Bristol's converted church, Circomedia. Shortly afterwards Taylor discovered she was pregnant, so plans for a re-release of the album were made for 2010. Meanwhile, songs from the album have been played on the Bob Harris show on BBC Radio 2. Get Rhythm said: \\"Jane Taylor is no ordinary singer songwriter. She has this intangible magic in her voice. The kind that draws you in and holds you right there until the moment you notice that you've forgotten to breathe and then you hear her words (which bizarrely seem to have been written for you), and stand there transfixed like it's a bit of fate that brought you here and I will defy anyone not to leave without a CD or at least humming one of her songs.\\" In January 2011, Compass won Best Album in the Singer-Songwriter Category at the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards.

Life   Early life and career  S√°ndor Szurmay was born in 1860 at Boks√°nb√°nya (now: Boc≈üa, Romania) which located in the historical Krass√≥-Sz√∂r√©ny County. He attended the secondary school for sciences in Szeged, then interrupting his studies he joined the Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company, where he worked as a trainee and later as an official. In 1882 he chose the military way. Szurmay started his service at the Eighteenth Home Defence Battalion of Lugos. After completing the course of studies at the Ludovica Military Academy classes he served as adjutant in a rank of Second Lieutenant at the various corps of the Magyar Honv√©ds√©g. Between 1886 and 1887 he finished the Academy's upper classes and between 1887 and 1889 the Imperial and Royal Staff College (K.u.k. Kriegsschule), that is the staff officer's academy. He was promoted to a First Lieutenant in 1889 and he was ordered onto the Fourth Army Corps' headquarters in Budapest. Later career By November 1917 Szurmay held the rank of General der Infanterie and held the ministerial portfolio for the Hungarian branch of the armed forces, the Honv√©d. In November 1917 he officially demanded the separation of the joint army of Austria-Hungary into separate Austrian and Hungarian formations. At a crown council chaired by the emperor the following month he again pressed for a full division of the k.u.k. army, adding that \\"all groups in Hungary are united on the issue of a Hungarian army.\\"Rothenburg, G.

She was built at Deptford Wharf between 1804 and 1805, and launched in 1805. She served in the North Sea and the Baltic, most notably at the Battle of Lyng√∏r, which effectively ended the Gunboat War. Calypso was broken up in March 1821.Winfield (2008), p.292. Service Commander Matthew Foster commissioned Calypso and in February she was in the Downs. On 14 June 1805 Calypso and a large number of other British warships were in company when the gun-brig Basilisk captured the American ship Enoch. Between 18 and 23 July 1805, she participated in attacks on French convoys off Calais, Wimereux, and Ambleteuse. On 18 July, Calypso, Fleche (Captain Thomas White), and the 20-gun sixth-rate post ship Arab (Captain Kieth Maxwell) and two or three gun-brigs drove on shore six French gun-vessels. However, the bank off Cape Grinez, and the shot and shells from the right face of its powerful battery, soon compelled the British to haul off from the shore. Arab suffered seven wounded and a great deal of damage. Fleche was the closest inshore owing to her light draft of water; she had five men severely wounded and damage to her rigging.James (1837) Vol. III, pp.311-2. Forster received a severe shoulder wound and had to give up command of Calypso.After Forster recovered in 1808 he was appointed to Majestic. He did not receive a pension (of ¬£250/annum), for his wounds until 1814. Commander Matthew Martin Bradby replaced Forster. He commanded her off Dieppe and in the Downs until he received promotion to post- captain in June 1810. Commander Henry Weir was promoted out of the 10-gun Alban to take command of Calypso on 28 June 1810. She was in sight on 12 April 1811 when the hired armed cutter Princess of Wales captured Dragen, S.N. Svarer, Master, Emanuel, H.M. Hansen, Master, and Haabet, N.S. Lauristen, Master. On 2 May Calypso captured Edell Catharina. On 14 June Weir captured the Danish privateer Nayahada off the coast of Jutland and destroyed another.The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 171, p.204. Both were armed with ten guns. Early in September Primus, carrying tar and hemp, Worksam, in ballast, Experiment, carrying iron, Columbus, carrying linseed, Neptunus, carrying timber, and Hector, carrying sundry goods, came into Yarmouth. They were prizes to , , Calypso, , , . and .Lloyd's List, no. 4596, - accessed 16 May 2014. That autumn Calypso was caught in a storm in October or November in which she lost her top masts and suffered extensive damage. To survive, she had to throw her guns overboard. On 26 October Calypso captured Den Norske Bonde. On 28 March Calypso captured Tallette. 12 April 1812 Calypso captured the Danish galliot Phoenix. Then on 14 April Calypso captured Mette Catharina. Gunboat War Battle of Lyng√∏r On 6 July 1812, during the Gunboat War, Calypso, still under Weir, was off the island of Merd√∏ on the coast of Norway. She was together with the 64-gun third rate Dictator (Captain James Patteson Stewart), 14-gun brig-sloop Podargus (Captain William Robilliard) and gun-brig Flamer (Lieutenant Thomas England), when the squadron sighted and chased a Danish squadron. During the ensuing Battle of Lyng√∏r Flamer stayed with Podargus to protect her after Podargus grounded. Dictator and Calypso succeeded in destroying the new, 40-gun frigate Najaden and badly damaging the 18-gun brigs Laaland, Samsoe, and Kiel, as well as a number of gunboats. The British tried to take out Laaland and Kiel but abandoned them when they grounded. The British did not set fire to either as the Norwegian vessels still had their crews and wounded aboard. The action cost Dictator five killed and 24 wounded, Calypso three killed, one wounded, and two missing, Podargus, nine wounded, and Flamer one killed and one wounded. Najaden lost 133 dead and 82 wounded and the Danes acknowledged losing some 300 men killed and wounded overall. Commander Weir received immediate promotion to post-captain; Commander Robilliard received his promotion the next December; Dictators first lieutenant, William Buchanan, received promotion to commander.James (1837), Vol. IV, pp.53-4. In 1847 the surviving British participants were authorized to apply for the clasp \\"Off Mardoe 6 July 1812\\" to the Naval General Service Medal. Several days later the British sent the cutter Nimble to reconnoiter the situation. Nimble reported seeing four vessels at Christiansand, two of 18 guns and two of 16 guns. Nimble also saw numerous gunboats about. The Battle of Lyng√∏r effectively ended the Gunboat War. Baltic and Azores Commander Thomas Groube replaced Weir in July 1812. On 7 March 1813, Calypso captured the Christine. Ten days later, Calypso and Bruizer captured Speculation. On 9 August Calypso captured Marianne, while Orion, Hamadryad and Reynard were in company. Groube conveyed Lord George Walpole to St. Petersburg where Walpole served as Secretary at the Embassy and minister ad interim (ie \\"for the meantime\\"). Calypso participated at the siege of Danzig in 1813, which led to his promotion to post-captain on 7 June 1814.The United service magazine, Volume 1863, Issue 2, p.480. Some accounts put Groube in Calypso at Faial in the Azores in late September. She took back to England some of the wounded from the debacle in which the American privateer General Armstrong, under Samuel Chester Reid, inflicted a defeat and heavy losses on cutting-out parties from the third rate Plantagenet, the frigate Rota, and Carnation, a sister ship to Calypso. Groube's successor in June 1814 was Commander Charles Reid. On 21 February 1815 Reid recaptured Maid of the Mill. Then on 15 March Calypso and Meander were in company with Aquilon when Acquilon recaptured Thomas. In 1816 Lieutenant John Sisson was acting commander. Mediterranean In April 1816, Lord Exmouth concluded treaties with the Regency of Algiers on the exchange of captives and slaves. Calypso carried to Genoa 40 Sardinians who had been slaves and brought back to Algiers eight Algerine captives, together with the ransom for the freed Sardinians.Playfair (1884), p.254. Fate Calypso was in ordinary at Chatham from 1817-1820. She was broken up in 1821. Notable passengers A future governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, who would replace William Bligh after the Rum Rebellion, sailed on board Calypso from Kronstadt, (Russia) to Yarmouth, England in September/October 1807. He briefly visited Copenhagen whilst in transit. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References  Playfair, R. Lambert (1884) The scourge of Christendom : annals of British...

IPI is used by clinicians to quickly assess the patient's respiratory status to determine the need for additional clinical assessment or intervention. The IPI is a patient index which provides a simple indication in real time of the patient's overall ventilatory status as an integer ranging from numbers 1 to 10. IPI integrates four major physiological parameters provided by a patient monitor, using this information along with an algorithm to produce the IPI score. The IPI score is not intended to replace current patient respiratory parameters, but to provide an additional integrated score or index of the patient ventilation status to the caregiver.  Mechanism  IPI chart The IPI incorporates four patient parameters (end-tidal CO2 and respiratory rate measured by capnography, as well as pulse rate and blood oxygenation SpO2 as measured by pulse oximetry) into a single index value.Taft, et al., 2008, Introduction The IPI value on the patient monitor indicates the patient ventilatory status, where a score of 10 is normal, indicating optimal pulmonary status, and a score of 1 or 2 requires immediate intervention. The IPI algorithm was developed based on the data from a group of medical experts (anesthesiologists, nurses, respiratory therapists, and physiologists) who evaluated cases with varying parameter values and whom assigned an IPI value to a predefined patient status.Taft, et al., 2008, Methods A mathematical model was built using patient normal ranges for these parameters and the ratings given to various combinations of the parameters by these professionals. Fuzzy logic, a mathematical method which mimics human logical thinking, was used to develop the IPI model. Clinical validation studies indicate that the IPI value produced by the IPI algorithm accurately reflects the patient's ventilatory status. In studies on both adult and pediatric patients, in which experts‚Äô ratings of ventilatory status were collected along with IPI data, the IPI scores were found to be highly correlated with the experts‚Äô annotated ratings.Y. Gozal, et al., 2009, ResultsD. Gozal, et al., 2009, Results Studies conducted to validate the index also concluded that the single numeric value of IPI along with IPI trend may be valuable for promoting early awareness to changes in patient ventilatory status D. Gozal, et al., 2009, Conclusion and in simplifying the monitoring of patients in busy clinical environments.Y. Gozal, et al., 2009, Conclusion How does IPI help clinicians?  IPI is a real-time patient value, updated every second, always available to the caregiver. An IPI trend graph also shows IPI scores over the previous hour (or other set time period), indicating if the IPI is remaining steady or trending up or down, thus reflecting changes in pulmonary status over time. In the example seen here, the changing IPI score indicates changes in the ventilatory status of the patient; IPI improves after a stimulus is applied. IPI can promote early awareness to changes in a patient's ventilatory status. The caregiver can view the IPI trend, which indicates changes in IPI over time. A quick view of the IPI trend can show that if the IPI has changed over the previous minutes or hours, to help the clinician ascertain if the patient's overall ventilatory status is worsening, remaining steady, or improving. This information can help determine the next steps in patient care. Thus, IPI can simplify the monitoring of patients in clinical environments. The caregiver can quickly and easily assess a patient's ventilatory status by following one number, the IPI, before checking the four parameters that make up this number. The four parameters continue to be displayed on the monitor screen. A significant change in the IPI is a ‚Äúred flag‚Äù indicator, indicating that the clinician should review other monitored data and assess the patient. In the clinical environment, a quick check of the IPI value and IPI trend is a first indicator of pulmonary status of the patient and may be used to determine if further patient assessment is warranted. IPI can increase patient safety, by indicating the presence of slow-developing patient respiratory issues not easily identified with individual instantaneous data to the caregiver in real time. This enables timely decisions and interventions to reduce patient risk, improve outcomes and increase patient safety. Since normal values for the physiological parameters are different for different age categories, the IPI algorithm differs for different age groups (three pediatric age groups and adult). IPI is not available for neonatal and infant patients (up to the age of 1 year).

Birckner especially explored the subject of Freedom of Speech. The American historian H. Arnold Barton has characterised Birckner, along with Niels Ditlev Riegels, as being \\"one of the most original thinkers\\" of the radical group of authors in Denmark in this period.H. Arnold Barton, 1986, p. 242. The Danish jurist Peter Germer in his book The Nature of Freedom of Speech (Ytringsfrihedens V√¶sen, 1973) shows that Birckners ideas was akin to ideas that Scottish-American philosopher Alexander Meiklejohn proposed in his Free Speech and Its Relation to Self-Government (1948).Peter Germer* Peter Germer, Ytringsfrihedens V√¶sen, Juristforbundets Forlag, 1973, p. 202. .  Biography  Michael Gottlieb Birckner was born in Copenhagen. At age three, he lost his mother Anna Marie (born Wiborg), and half a year later his father, brickmason Johan Michael Birckner, died. The city mortician took in the orphan, and in due time Birckner graduated from the city's Latin school in 1772. He achieved his theological degree in 1784. He had also spent his time at the university studying philosophy and philology, and he especially excelled in modern languages, he spoke German like a native and he wrote verses in English. He wanted a position as a priest, but he disliked the parlors of the rich and powerful, so he did not achieve a call until 1790. The position was as a German minister on the isolated island of F√∂hr which was part of the kingdom of Denmark-Norway at the time. Before Birckner left the capital he had become a proponent of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which at that time was becoming popular in Denmark. But he was also under the influence of the radical French anti-clergy rationalism. He had published an article in the influential Danish periodical Minerva with the title An answer to the question: Should the nobility be suppressed? (July 1790). His answer to the question in the title was affirmative, provided that the privileges of nobility is an injustice and that the burgher can become \\"that which at present only the nobility is, without upsetting society as a whole\\". The article was soon translated into German and a reviewer of the G√∂ttingische gel√§rdes Anzeigen (1792, p. 1899) praised it highly.  Stay at F√∂hr  Birckners stay at F√∂hr did not turn out to be as desolate as he and his friends had feared. He passed his time with studies, social visits and a pursuit to \\"form a young man into a productive citizen\\". The inhabitants of the island was pleased by his \\"philosophical\\" preachings which he held every third Sunday. He did express regret at not being within easy reach of the literary means of the capital, but he learned to pass his time thinking instead. It became his habit to first think a subject matter through in his mind before reading what others had written about it. He especially worked on the problem about the freedom of press and its limits, which among other things the recent conviction of the satiric poet Peter Andreas Heiberg had incurred in Danish debate. In his solitude he expressed his thoughts on the matter in writing and the first of his many treaties on the subject was published in the Minerva in March 1791.  Chaplain  The following year he was surprised to learn that his friends had petitioned on his behalf for the chaplaincy in Kors√∏r. In the beginning, he was not pleased with the transition to the small provincial town in Zealand because he had to preach twice every Sunday instead of once every third Sunday. But after making the move, little by little his sentiments changed. He regularly was present by the dinner table of the vicar Frederik Plum, who later became bishop of Fyn, and Birckner found company with which to share his spiritual and philosophical sentiments. It was at the Plums that he met Henriette Christine Hornemann, the daughter of vicar Jacob Hornemann, sister of the philosopher Christian Hornemann, and in 1795 he married this gifted young woman. The journey to his new position had incurred a coughing sickness which over time became very serious. His income was very low, and he often suffered from want so badly that he at one time considered giving up the chaplaincy in favour of a position as a teacher and letting his wife contribute to the household by letting her serve as a chambermaid.  Struggle for Freedom of the Press  The titlepage to the second and extended edition of Birckners On the Freedom of Press and its Laws from 1797. But neither his sickness nor his poverty prevented him from continuing his philosophical endeavours. When the bishop of Zealand Nicolai Balle Edinger had reported the poet Malthe Conrad Bruuns recently published book The Catechism of the Aristocrats (Aristocraternes Catechismus, 1796) to the authorities for infringing the press laws, Birckner anonymously published a small tract which criticised the bishop for playing the part of head of police instead of minding his ecclesiastical pursuits. However his real struggle for freedom of the press was not carried out anonymously. He had already previously shown that the Danish laws regarding this subject did not allow for a complete freedom of the press. It was to achieve this goal that he published his major work On the Freedom of the Press and its Law (\\"Om Trykkefriheden og dens Love\\", 1797). In this book he claims the importance of freedom of press as a powerful means of putting ideas into circulation and thereby enlighten the monarch of things that he would otherwise have been ignorant of. He also writes about it being a \\"revolution from above\\", when a \\"noble and patriotic\\" man, \\"brimming with feelings for the general good of man\\", at once appear among the powerful and without restraint \\"sacrifices his own splendor and absolutism\\". These words were aimed at the reigning crown prince Frederick, who had shown considerable influences from the tolerant enlightenment ideas in his early years on the throne. But Birckner does not only demand freedom to write about the affairs of government, he also demands freedom of speech in matters of religion. He shows that the way to achieve insight into the \\"moral truths\\" can only happen by discussing it in the open. However Birckner does propose some limits on the freedom of press, he does not think it should be allowed to publicly call for rebellion, that is urging the people to overthrow the constitution of the state or in other ways oppose the actions of the government with physical force. Neither, Birckner says, should it be allowed to defame the private affairs of a man in his home, something which has no public interest and it violates the private sphere of the individual. The book became a bestseller in Denmark-Norway. A second revised and improved edition appeared the same year, and a third printing was made for the first volume of the Collected Works of Birckner (a work which had 2.100 subscribers at the beginning of its publication, a very high figure in Danish literary history). Furthermore, he translated the book into German and it was printed in the German periodical Beitr√§ge zur Veredlung der Menschheit, 2. vol., 1. part, 1797, and the same year published as a stand-alone work under the title Ueber die Preszfreiheit und ihre Gesetze, von dem Verfasser selbst aus dem D√§nischen √ºbersetzt, durchgesehen und herausgegeben von C.J.R. Christiani, Kopenhagen und Leipzig. These ideas met opposition from several contemporary writers. Some thought Birckner went too far in his support of free speech, while others thought there should be no limits whatsoever. This prompted Birckner to publish his Further Reflections on the Freedom of Press and its Laws (\\"Videre Unders√∏gelser om Trykkefriheden og dens Love\\") the following year (1798). His response is especially aimed at the criticism posed by professor Johan Frederik Vilhelm Schlegel. Only at one point in this book does he change his stance from his previous work, and that is only \\"half unwillingly\\" he thinks that writers who \\"with their filthy imagination attempts to awaken impure desires in his readers\\", these individuals should be sentenced \\"a fitting punishment\\". His \\"half unwillingness\\" for this stems from the fact that he sees \\"what the result would be, of such a power administered by the judges of geniuses, and how easily such a power can be abused most savagely... And yet, all art and beauty be damned, if it misleads just a single person to stray from the path of virtue\\".  Death  His struggle for freedom of speech was not looked upon favorably in government circles. Nevertheless, he was appointed vicar of Vemmelev and Hammersh√∏j on the 28 November, 1798, an appointment that would have meant the end of his poverty. But this royal grace came too late, his illness had become lethal and he died the 1st of December the same year. His contribution to Danish literature was first acknowledged after his death. His friends praised his character and 2100 subscribers signed up for the first edition of his collected works. Furthermore, they collected 2500 rigsdaler that was donated to his grieving widow and children.  Collected works  Birckner had already begun working on a collected edition of his works prior to his death. This collection was to include all his writings except the two anonymous tracts against bishop Balle. He did manage to publish three volumes of this collection, and the fourth volume was published in 1800 edited by Anders Sand√∏e √òrsted and prefaced by an account of the last days of Birckner written by dean Frederik Carl Gutfeld (Samlede Skrifter, 4 vols., 1797-1800).

The most common and recognized types of marriage at this time consisted of: marriage by agreement, marriage by capture, marriage by mahr, marriage by inheritance and Mutah or temporary marriage.Shah, N. (2006). Women, The Koran and International Human Rights Law. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. pp. 32. . Prior to Islam, in the Arab world, women could not make decisions based on their own beliefs and had little control over their marriages. They were never bound by contract for marriage or custody of children and their consent was never sought. Women were seldom allowed to divorce their husbands and their view was not regarded for either a marriage or divorce. If they divorced, women were not legally allowed to go by their maiden name again. They could not own or inherit property or objects, even if they were facing poverty or harsh living conditions. Marriage by agreement The first of the four common marriages that existed in pre-Islamic Arabia was marriage by agreement. This consisted of an agreement between a man and his future wife's family. This marriage could be within the tribe or between two families of different tribes. Some women were forbidden from marrying outside of their tribe and had to either marry another member of the tribe or a stranger who would agree to live with the tribe. In the case that involved a man and woman of two different tribes, the woman would leave her family and permanently reside with her husband. The children of these marriages were considered part of their father's tribe, unless a different arrangement had previously been made which returned the children to their mother's tribe. The reason for intertribal marriages was to ensure the protection and possession of the children the couple would produce.Muslim Women's League. (1995). Women in Pre-Islamic Arabia. Muslim Women's League. Women in intertribal marriages had more freedom and retained the right to dismiss or divorce their husbands at any time. The women had precise rituals they used to inform their husbands of their dismissal, such as this: \\"if they lived in a tent they turned it around, so that if the door faced east, it now faced west, and when the man saw this, he knew that he was dismissed and did not enter\\".Mernissi, F. (1987). Beyond the Veil: Male-Female Dynamics in Modern Muslim Society. Indiana University Press. pp. 75. . Marriage by Mahr Marriage by Mahr was a more traditional marriage practice. These marriages consisted of the groom or groom's father paying the bride \\"Mahr\\", to marry them. (Mahr is very important in Islamic marriage. Allah has used the word \\"faridah\\" for it. It means something fixed, decided and obligatory. It is obligatory on the husband to pay mahr to his wife unless she expressly by her own will without any pressure forgives him or returns the amount of mahr to him. Mahr belongs to the wife and it is to be given to her only. It is not the property of her parents or her guardian. No one can forgive the husband to pay the Mahr except the wife herself or, in case she did not go to her husband and the marriage ended without consummation, then in that situation her guardian can also forgive the mahr on her behalf. If a husband dies without paying mahr to his wife, it will be an outstanding debt on him and it must be paid before the distribution of his inheritance among his heirs. It helps the women during the time of divorce). Marriage by capture Marriage by capture, or \\"Ba'al\\", was a common pre- Islamic marriage practice. Most often taking place during times of war, marriage by capture occurred when women were taken captive by men from other tribes and placed on the slave market of Mecca. From the slave market these women were sold into marriage or slavery. In captive marriages men bought their wives and therefore had complete control over them. Women in these marriages had no freedom and were subjected to following their husband's orders and bearing his children. These women became their husbands' property and had no right to divorce. Marriage by inheritance Marriage by inheritance was \\"a widespread custom throughout Arabia, including Medina and Mecca\\". This practice involved the possession of a deceased man's wives (When a man died, his son inherited all his wives except his own mother) being passed down to his son. In such a case, the son has several different options. He could keep them as his wives, arrange a marriage by purchase for them to enter into from which he would receive a dowry for them, or he could simply dismiss them. In these cases, as in the majority of marriage practices at this time, the woman had little or no rights and was subjected to follow the orders or her inheritor. Beena Beena is a form of marriage used in pre-Islamic Arabia, in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retained complete independence from her husband, according to William Robertson Smith.Smith, p. 167 The term was suggested by John Ferguson McLennan, who noted that in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) the marriage when a husband goes to live in the wife's village is called \\"beena marriage\\", and suggested \\"beena\\" as a general term for this kind of marriage.Smith, pp. 70, 71 The social system by which a couple lives with or near the wife's family is known by anthropologists as matrilocality.

It was built in 1991 by Japanese Buddhist Bhikshu, Gyomyo Nakamura and part of the Peace Pagoda mission. The Shanti Stupa holds the relics of the Buddha at its base, enshrined by the 14th Dalai Lama. The stupa has become a tourist attraction not only due to its religious significance but also due to its location which provides panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. Construction The Shanti Stupa was built by both Japanese Buddhists and Ladakh Buddhists. Original idea was stated by Nichidatsu Fujii (Fujii Guruji) in 1914. The mission of Nichidatsu Fujii was to build Peace Pagodas and temples over the world and try to resurrect Buddhism back in India. Construction of the Shanti Stupa began in April 1983 under the supervision of Bhikshu Gyomyo Nakamura and Kushok Bakula, a lama of Ladakh from New Delhi, member of the Minority commission of Govt of India, former statesman and former international diplomat of the Republic of India. The project was built with the help of Ladakhi Buddhists, who offered voluntary labour, and Japanese Buddhists, who consider India as the \\"sacred\\" birthplace of the Buddha. The then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, sanctioned the construction of a vehicular road to the stupa in 1984. The state government also provided some financial assistance for the construction of the Shanti Stupa. The 14th and current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso inaugurated the Shanti Stupa in August 1991. Description and significance Main Buddha Shanti Stupa in winter The Shanti Stupa features the photograph of the current Dalai Lama with the relics of the Buddha at its base. The stupa is built as a two-level structure. The first level features the central relief of Dharmacakra with deer on each side. A central golden Buddha image sits on a platform depicting the \\"turning wheel of Dharma\\" (Dharmacakra). The second level has reliefs depicting the \\"birth\\" of Buddha, the death of Buddha (mahanirvana) and Buddha \\"defeating the devils\\" while meditating.The titles of the reliefs are given on the plaques under the reliefs at the Shanti Stupa. Both levels feature a series of smaller meditating Buddha reliefs. The Shanti Stupa was built to promote world peace and prosperity and to commemorate 2500 years of Buddhism. It is considered a symbol of the ties between the people of Japan and Ladakh. Tourist attraction Since its inauguration, Shanti Stupa has become a popular tourist attraction. According to The Hindu it is the \\"most famous tourist attraction\\" around Leh, though its architectural style is different from the Ladakhi style. The Shanti Stupa overlooks the city of Leh, providing panoramic views of the city, the village of Changspa, Namgyal Tsemo in the distance and the surrounding mountains. Sunrise and sunset are considered to provide the best views from Shanti Stupa. The stupa is illuminated with lights at night. The stupa is open for tourists between 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Shanti Stupa, Leh Access Situated at a height of , the stupa is located from Leh - the former capital of Ladakh - on a steep hill facing the Leh Palace.

The pilot introduces viewers to three sets of people who make up a single family. The episode is shot in a mockumentary style, with a cameraman following the characters around their everyday lives and interviewing them at various intervals. It cuts between the experiences of the three separate units before they all come together at the end of the episode. In the episode, Jay's family tries to function despite the age difference between himself and his wife. Claire's family tries to punish their son and watch over her daughter and her new boyfriend. Mitchell tries to hide the fact that he and his partner Cameron have adopted a daughter in Vietnam from his family until Cameron invites Mitchell's family without consulting him (which is revealed to be the other two families). Reviews for the pilot episode compared Modern Family to shows such as Married... with Children (which starred Ed O'Neill), Frasier (which the creators of this show worked on), Malcolm in the Middle and, most strongly, Arrested Development. In the United Kingdom, reviewers saw similarities between Modern Family and Outnumbered. The episode has received multiple nominations and has won Episodic Comedy at the Writers Guild of America Awards 2009 and also a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. Plot The episode begins at the home of Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) Dunphy and their three children; Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould). Claire and Phil shout up the stairs to the children. When Haley emerges, Claire tells her that her skirt is too short but Phil allows her to wear it. In side interviews, Phil calls himself a \\"cool dad\\" while Claire says that if she can prevent her children from making the same mistakes she did when she was growing up, she has \\"done our job\\". Alex comes downstairs to complain that Luke has shot her with the toy gun Phil bought him. Claire forces Phil to follow through on his deal with Luke: if Luke shoots someone, Phil will have to shoot him. Gloria Delgado-Pritchett (Sof√≠a Vergara) and her husband, Jay (Ed O'Neill), are watching Gloria's son Manny (Rico Rodriguez) play soccer. Gloria is overenthusiastic, shouting encouragement to her son and arguing with another parent. Gloria and Jay are then interviewed, where Gloria discusses the differences between their backgrounds; she comes from a small village in Colombia which is \\"number one for murders\\", while he comes from the city and owns a big business. Back on the pitch, Manny misses a goal when he spots a beautiful sixteen-year-old girl riding by on a bicycle. Gloria speaks to the father of one of the other players, who assumes that Jay is her dad. The scene shifts to Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), a gay couple, who are on a plane returning from Vietnam having adopted a baby, Lily (Ella Hiller/Jaden Hiller). The other passengers admire Lily, with one man commenting, \\"You and your wife must be thrilled\\". When Cameron walks on board and sits down beside Mitchell, an uneasy silence develops. In an interview the characters say that they have been together for five years. Back on the plane, Mitchell threatens to make a speech and does so when a woman says \\"look at that baby with those cream puffs\\", which he believes is a reference to him and Cameron. In fact, she is referring to the cream puffs Lily is eating. Cameron apologizes by offering to pay for headsets for all the passengers. Back at the Dunphy residence, Haley has invited Dylan (Reid Ewing), a senior boy from her high school, over. Claire instructs Phil to \\"scare him\\", but Phil hurts his back in the process and Dylan is forced to carry Phil to the couch. Haley brings her boyfriend upstairs and grows annoyed when Claire constantly checks on them. Haley goes downstairs to complain to Phil, who is preparing to shoot Luke against his will. Phil though, accidentally shoots Luke, Dylan, and then himself. After the soccer game, Jay is mistaken for a mall walker so he decides to buy some 'hip' new clothes. Meanwhile, Manny reads a poem for the sixteen-year-old and is crushed when she says she has a boyfriend. The last scene is at Mitchell and Cameron's house where Lily is going to be introduced to the rest of the family and is revealed for the first time that all the characters are related; Jay is Mitchell & Claire's father. Before Lily is introduced, Jay, who is unsure if Mitchell and Cameron are ready for fatherhood, suggests that if they are bored, they should get a dog. Cameron enters, holding Lily aloft before the family while \\"Circle of Life\\" from The Lion King plays. Eventually, the whole family accepts the adoption and welcomes Lily as part of their family. Production Conception While working in the office Lloyd and Levitan were telling stories about their family and they thought that could be a show idea, and started working with the concept of families being observed in a mockumentary style show. They then later decided it would be a show about three families and their experiences. The show was originally called My American Family. Originally, the camera crew would be run by a fictitious Dutch filmmaker named Geert Floortje who had lived with Jay's family as a teenage exchange student and developed a crush on Claire (while Mitchell had a crush on him), but decided against it. The creators pitched it to three of the four major networks (they did not pitch it to Fox due to problems Lloyd had with the network with previous shows). CBS, not ready to use the single-camera style of filming, nor ready to make another large commitment, did not accept the series. NBC, already having two shows of similar style (mockumentary), The Office and Parks and Recreation, decided against accepting the series until the success of the other two series decreased. ABC accepted the series. The series was given a full season pickup on October 8, 2009. On January 12, 2010, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that Modern Family had been renewed for a second season. Casting Casting for Modern Family was very difficult (except for Jesse Tyler Ferguson). Initially Ed O'Neill had lost the part to Craig T. Nelson (who would later go on to play Zeek Braverman on Parenthood on NBC) although he was eventually cast after Nelson turned down the part due to money problems. Eric Stonestreet who was unknown at the time had to fight for the role of Cameron. It was also difficult for Julie Bowen as she was pregnant with twins during filming and had to cover her pregnant belly with clothes, pillows, laundry baskets etc. while Ty Burrell had to test for the role of Phil Dunphy three times. Initially Jesse Tyler Ferguson had auditioned for the role of Cameron before Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan thought he would be better suited for the role of Mitchell. Filming The episode was filmed in Los Angeles in the United States and is set in a nameless suburban neighborhood. It was written and produced by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, who had worked together on Frasier. When Julie Bowen, who plays Claire Dunphy, read the script, she \\"desperately wanted to do it\\" but was pregnant with twins. Bowen \\"auditioned, begged and pleaded\\", eventually convincing the show makers to film around her stomach. In the pilot, shot when Bowen was 8¬Ω months pregnant, Bowen hides her stomach with laundry. When Phil was dancing to the High School Musical song it was very difficult for the child actors not to laugh with everyone laughing when they had finished filming the scene. Reception Ratings The episode premiered on ABC in the United States on September 23, 2009. The show was watched live by 12.61 million viewers, placing it as the most viewed show of the night and the series. It also acquired a Nielsen rating of 4.2/11 in the 18-49 age bracket. The show began broadcasting in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on 15 October 2009. The pilot was watched by 444,000 viewers across two airings, with 348,000 watching the show in the 8pm time slot. Reviews The pilot episode received universal acclaim, with some reviewers highlighting it as one of the best new comedies of 2009. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.8 saying it was \\"Great\\" and \\"The premiere episode does a fantastic job of introducing us to these family units, and it was fun to see how they would be connected to each other in the realm of the series. The smaller issues aside - the mildly unclear format, some forced clich√©s - the pilot episode of Modern Family is a must see comedy\\". Variety wrote \\"Easily the new season's best comedy pilot, Modern Family deftly serves up laughs on multiple levels, from understated one-liners to deft sight-gags.\\" Mary McNamara of the LA Times commented \\"Just when we were thinking it couldn't be done, ABC's Modern Family has single-handedly brought the family comedy back from the dead...Modern Family is sharp, timely and fresh, complicated enough to be interesting but with a soft, sweet center\\". The New York Times' Gina Bellafante called the series \\"the best new half-hour of funny television in a season rife with half-hours of funny television\\". She also felt it was a replacement for Arrested Development, the \\"last great family comedy\\" which ended in 2006. The success of the pilot led to the series holding a rating of 86/100 on Metacritic from 25 reviews. ABC ordered a full 22-episode season of the show. Awards and nominations The episode received multiple award nominations. The episode's director Jason Winer won Directors Guild of America award for Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Comedy Series. The episode also won for Episodic Comedy at the Writers Guild of America Awards 2009 tying with Robert Carlock for his work on a 30 Rock episode: \\"Apollo, Apollo\\". The episode was also nominated for numerous Primetime Emmy Awards winning Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series, but lost Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series to Glee.

The program was succeeded by the Adaptive Engine Technology Demonstrator (AETD) program in 2012 and the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) in 2016, with the latter focused on developing and testing a 45,000 lbf (200 kN) thrust class adaptive cycle engine for next generation fighter aircraft and potential F-35 re-engining. Objective The objective of ADVENT is to develop an engine that is optimized for several design points, rather than the traditional single point. Instead of having an engine that is designed solely for high speed (like many current fighter engines are) or for high fuel efficiency (like many current commercial engines are), the final ADVENT engine would be designed to operate at both those conditions.Barr, Larine. \\"Air Force plans to develop revolutionary engine\\" . US Air Force press release, 11 April 2007, Accessed: 20 October 2009. Specific goals include reducing average fuel consumption by 25% and reducing the temperature of cooling air produced by the engine.\\"Rolls Royce Selected for ADVENT Demonstrator\\", Press Release, 18 Oct 2009, Accessed 20 Oct 2009. Applications The ADVENT engine was originally targeted at the Air Force's 2018 Next-Generation Bomber, but uncertainty in that program has led Rolls-Royce (RR), one of the primary developers involved with the project, to predict that the ADVENT engine will be better suited for a potential 2020 engine upgrade for the F-35 Lightning II. RR, who is partnered with GE Aviation on the embattled F136 alternate engine for the F-35, has suggested that the ADVENT development contracts are all the more reason to continue the F136, as any engine upgrade from Pratt & Whitney (makers of the F135 engine currently used in the F-35) would have to be separately funded, either internally or to additional government cost.Trimble, Steven. \\"Rolls Royce: F136 Survival is key for major F-35 engine upgrade\\" Flight International, 11 June 2009, Accessed: 20 Oct 2009 History The ADVENT program is one of several related development projects being pursued under the Air Force's Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) program. After being announced in April 2007, Rolls-Royce and GE Aviation were awarded Phase I contracts in August 2007 to explore concepts, develop and test critical components, and begin preliminary designs of an engine.Trimble, Steven. \\"Pratt & Whitney Loses Second Bit for USAF Technology Contracts\\".

Operational testing of the engine was expected to begin in 2013. In 2014, Chuck Hagel requested a $1 billion investment in the engine technology. A government official has warned that sequestration risks ending the program. In 2016, the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) was launched with the goal of developing and testing adaptive engines for the future sixth generation fighter programs, Penetrating Counter Air (PCA) for USAF and Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) for US Navy, as well as potential re-engining of the F-35. The program assigned the new designations XA100 for General Electric's design and XA101 for Pratt & Whitney's. In 2017, Pratt wrapped up tests of their three stream engine with a F135 core, which may be used on the Penetrating Counter Air (PCA) platform.

It is managed by REDICO. History Prior to the construction of Green Oak Village Place, the only shopping mall in Brighton was Brighton Mall, a 20-store complex originally anchored by A&P; and Grant City, which was demolished in 1996 for big-box stores, including Marshalls and Best Buy. Following the construction of several new homes in the area, as well as increase in traffic along US-23 and Interstate 96, plans were made in 2004 to build a new lifestyle center called Green Oak Village Place at the interchange of U.S. 23 and Lee Road southeast of town. A small shopping center featuring Costco and Kohl's had already been built at the southwestern quadrant of this interchange. In December 2004, a preliminary approval was granted to build the center, which was developed by Lormax Stern in association with REDICO and Quadrants, Inc. The city's officials formed a task force to determine the impact that the mall would have on the city's downtown business district. Construction began in June 2005, ahead of schedule. At the same time, the Lee Road interchange with U.S. 23 was rebuilt to include three roundabouts, leading one local resident to create a board game based on the roundabouts. Three of Green Oak Village Place's anchors ‚Äî DSW Shoe Warehouse, Dick's Sporting Goods and Old Navy ‚Äî were the first stores to open, doing so in mid-2006. Barnes & Noble opened as the fourth anchor on October 25, followed by a grand opening of the mall on October 27. Inline stores began opening in October as well. Two months after the mall opened, a display at the Victoria's Secret store led to boycotts and protests from members of the community. A JCPenney department store opened in March 2007, and HomeGoods opened as a sixth anchor in September 2008.

The screenplay by Polly Platt is based on the 1970 novel of the same title by William Inge. Inge wrote two novels, both set in the fictional town of Freedom, Kansas. In Good Luck, Miss Wyckoff, high-school Latin teacher Evelyn Wyckoff loses her job because she has an affair with the school's black janitor. The novel's themes include spinsterhood, racism, sexual tension and public humiliation during the late 1950s. The film version stars Anne Heywood, John Lafayette, Donald Pleasence, Robert Vaughn and, in her final film, Carolyn Jones. Plot In 1954 in Freedom, a fictional small Kansas town, Evelyn Wyckoff, a lonely and greatly depressed 35-year-old high-school Latin teacher, no longer finds any satisfaction in her work, in spite of being well- liked by students and colleagues. Attractive but still a virgin, on the verge of premature menopause, her physician Dr. Neal thinks her problems would be solved if she were to begin a romantic relationship. He directs her to Dr. Steiner, a psychiatrist in Wichita. The talks with Steiner help her, and slowly she acknowledges her craving for love. She starts flirting with Ed Eckles, the friendly bus driver on her trips to Wichita. Ed cares for her and suggests they should have a love affair. She hesitates because Ed is married. When she is finally willing, she finds Ed has left town for good. One day she is accosted by Rafe Collins, a cocky black college scholarship student who cleans classrooms at the end of the school day. When the young man boldly makes lewd suggestions and begins to unzip his pants, Evelyn flees in a panic but decides to tell no one what transpired, hoping it was an isolated incident. The following day, Rafe approaches Evelyn again and ruthlessly rapes her on her desk. Ashamed and fearful of the public disgrace she will suffer if she reports being violated by a black man, she chooses to remain silent. A full-fledged psychopath and sadist, Rafe forces himself upon her on a daily basis. Evelyn, in a mixture of intimidation and sexual craving, submits to the humiliating and abusive relationship, sometimes looking forward to their trysts. When Rafe forces Evelyn's body against a hot radiator during sex, her screams alert two other janitors, who enter her classroom and see what is going on. Scandal breaks loose and Evelyn faces unrelenting public ostracism. The friendly principal Havermayer is forced to ask her to resign, referring her to a new job in another town. Everybody turns a cold shoulder on her and she contemplates suicide. But in the end she regains herself and moves out of town to a new life.

Life  He was the son of a forest warden. His first studies were with Giuseppe Alberti in Cavalese. He completed his training with a study trip to Venice, where he worked with Nicola Grassi. After that, he moved to Bolzano, where he painted a version of \\"The Judgment of Solomon\\" in the town hall and became a citizen in 1726. In the years around 1730, he worked at various monasteries and churches in Passau and the lower Inn valley as an altar painter. His paintings include a \\"Baptism of Christ\\" at Vornbach Abbey and two versions of the \\"Holy Family\\" at the chapel in Sch√§rding and the parish church in St. Florian am Inn. Several works from this period have been lost. In 1737, he settled permanently in Vienna, establishing himself as one of the city's leading altar painters, receiving a number of commissions from the Imperial Court. From 1751 to 1754 and again from 1757 to 1758, he was the Rector of the \\"Imperial and Royal Court Academy of painters, sculptors and architecture\\" (now the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna). The title \\"Rector Magnificus\\" was originally bestowed upon him in 1751 by the Empress Maria Theresa. Some of his best-known works in Vienna are at St. Michael's Church and the dome in St. Stephen's Cathedral.Web Gallery of Art: BBrief biography Often cited as his finest work is his depiction of Saint Mary's death at Brixen Cathedral. Upon his death, his valuable collection of paintings and drawings was bequeathed to his younger brother Franz, who was also a well-known painter. In 1899, a street in Vienna's Brigittenau district was named after him.

Government policy contributes to the generally free practice of religion. The United States received no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice in 2007. Religious demography The country has an area of 283,561 square kilometres and a population of 15 million (in 2010). The Catholic Episcopal Conference estimates that 85 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, with 35 percent of Catholics actively practicing. Some groups, particularly indigenous people who live in the mountains, follow a syncretic form of Catholicism that combines indigenous beliefs with orthodox Catholic doctrine. The Evangelical Missionary Union estimates that there are one million Protestants.International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Ecuador. U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (2007). Many of the religious groups registered with the Government have very small numbers; these include Anglicans, Baha'is, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and the Unification Church. Other groups present in small numbers are Muslims, Jews, and adherents of Eastern Orthodox religions. There are also followers of Inti, the traditional Inca sun god, and some atheists, but there were no reliable statistics on the size of these smaller groups. Status of religious freedom The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. The Government at all levels has sought to protect this right in full and does not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The Constitution grants all citizens and foreigners the right to practice publicly and freely the religion of their choice. The only limits imposed by the Government are \\"those proscribed by law to protect and respect the diversity, plurality, security, and rights of others.\\" The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on religion. The Government requires religious groups to be licensed or registered if they engage in proselytizing activity. Religious organizations that do not engage in such activity may still choose to register to obtain a legal identity, which is desirable when entering into contracts. Any religious organization wishing to register with the Government must possess a charter, have nonprofit status, include all names used by the group (to ensure that names of previously registered groups are not used without their permission), and provide signatures of at least 15 members. In addition, groups must file a petition with the Ministry of Government, using a licensed attorney, and pay a $100 registration fee. During the period covered by this report, the Government continued to streamline the registration process for religious groups. The Government permits missionary activity and public religious expression by all religious groups. The Government does not generally permit religious instruction in public schools. Private schools have complete liberty to provide religious instruction, as do parents in the home. Government policy and practice contribute to the generally free practice of religion. Catholics reportedly complained that the Government restricted access for ecological reasons to the Gal√°pagos Islands to the extent that foreign missionaries had difficulty ministering to the 14,500 resident Catholics. There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country. On August 27, 2006, two military officers (Ivan Santi Mucushigua and Cervantes Santamaria Cuji) and a civilian (Lucio Cirilo Dahua) allegedly killed Balti Cadena, a traditional healer (yachak), and injured one of his sons, near the Amazonas Military Fort in Puyo, Pastaza Province. The Public Prosecutor, in a civilian court, charged the two military officers with murder. At the end of the reporting period, the officers were held at the Amazonas Military Fort and had appealed to the Superior Court of Puyo. Press reports added that at least four traditional healers have been killed in the past 10 years in the same area. There were no reports of forced religious conversion. Societal abuses and discrimination There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Many religious groups increased their outreach efforts to their counterparts during the period covered by this report.

SSI is based on RS-422Interfaces article by novotechnik standards and has a high protocol efficiency in addition to its implementation over various hardware platforms, making it very popular among sensor manufacturers. SSI was originally developed by Max Stegmann GmbH in 1984 for transmitting the position data of absolute encoders ‚Äì for this reason, some servo/drive equipment manufacturers refer to their SSI port as a \\"Stegmann Interface\\". It was formerly covered by the German patent DE 34 45 617 which expired in 1990. It is very suitable for applications demanding reliability and robustness in measurements under varying industrial environments. It is different from the Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI): An SSI bus is differential, simplex, non-multiplexed, and relies on a time-out to frame the data. An SPI bus is single-ended, duplex,and uses a select-line to frame the data. However, SPI peripherals on microcontrollers can implement SSI with external differential driver-ICs and program-controlled timing.  Introduction  SSI is a synchronous, point to point, serial communication channel for digital data transmission. Synchronous data transmission is one in which the data is transmitted by synchronizing the transmission at the receiving and sending ends using a common clock signal. Since start and stop bits are not present, this allows better use of data transmission bandwidth for more message bits and makes the whole transmission process simpler and easier. The clock needs its own bandwidth and should be included when determining the total bandwidth required for communication between the two devices. Figure 1 ‚Äì SSI Point to Point Communication In general, as mentioned earlier, it is a point to point connection from a master (e.g. PLC, Microcontroller) to a slave (e.g. rotary encoders). The master controls the clock sequence and the slave transmits the current data/value through a shift register. When invoked by the master, the data is clocked out from the shift register. The master and slave are synchronized by the common clock of the controller. The CLOCK and DATA signals are transmitted according to RS-422 standards. RS-422, also known as ANSI/TIA/EIA-422-B, is a technical standard that specifies the electrical characteristics of the balanced voltage digital interface circuit. Data is transmitted using balanced or differential signalling i.e. the CLOCK and DATA lines are basically twisted pair cables. Inputs can use an opto-coupler for galvanic isolation (For more details see ) that can be driven by RS-422/485 levels. The DATA output of the sensor is driven by an RS-422/485 line driver. Differential signalling improves the resistance to electromagnetic interference (EMI), hence making it a reliable communication channel over long transmission lengths and harsh external environments.  SSI design  The interface has a very simple design as illustrated in the above figure. It consists of 2 pairs of wires, one for transmitting the clock signals from the master and the other for transmitting the data from the slave. The clock sequences are triggered by the master when need arises. Different clock frequencies can be used ranging from 100 kHz to 2 MHz and the number of clock pulses depends on the number of data bits to be transmitted. The simplest SSI slave interface uses a retriggerable monostable multivibrator (monoflop) to freeze the current value of the sensor. The current frozen values of the slave are stored in Shift registers. These values are clocked out sequentially when initiated by the controller. The design is being revolutionized with the integration of microcontrollers, FPGAs and ASICs into the interface. The data format is designed in such a way to ensure proper communication of data. The protocol for the data transmission is based on three different subsequent parts (Leading-‚Äù1\\" -> Data-Bits -> Trailing-\\"0\\"). The main significance of this type of format is to ensure the proper working of the interface and hence secure data transmission free from any hardware or software errors. In idle state the CLOCK is on high level and also the sensor output is on high level, so that it can be used for detecting any broken wire contacts. This helps in observing the proper working condition of the interface. After n-CLOCK pulses (rising edges) the data is completely transmitted. With the next CLOCK pulse (rising edge n+1) the sensor output goes to low level which can be used to detect a short circuit in the cable. If it is high even after n+1 rising edges then it means that the interface has a short circuit. Readings from multiple slaves (up to three) can be enabled at the same time by connecting them to a common clock. However, to avoid ground loops and electrically isolate the slave, complete galvanic isolation by opto- couplers is needed.  SSI timing and transmission  The following keywords will be useful in understanding the SSI data transmission procedure. * ‚Äòtm‚Äô represents the transfer timeout (monoflop time). It is the minimum time required by the slave to realise that the data transmission is complete. After tm, the data line goes to idle and the slave starts updating its data in the shift register. * ‚Äòtp‚Äô represents the pause time. It is the time delay between two consecutive clock sequences from the master. * ‚Äòtw‚Äô represents the repetition time. It is the minimum time elapsed between retransmissions of the same data and is always less than tm. * ‚ÄòT‚Äô represents the width of each clock cycle. It is the time taken between two falling or two rising edges in a continuous clock sequence. * MSB: Most significant bit * LSB: Least significant bit  Single transmission  Single Transmission of the SSI Interface: 1. Freezing of the data. 2. Transmission of the first Databit. 3. End of transmission. 4. after the pause time the SSI went back to idle state ‚Äì is ready for new transmission. The diagram illustrates the single data transmission using SSI protocol: The SSI is initially in the idle mode, where both the data and clock lines stay HIGH and the slave keeps updating its current data. The transmission mode is evoked when the master initiates a train of clock pulses. Once the slave receives the beginning of the clock signal (1), it automatically freezes its current data. With the first rising edge (2) of the clock sequence, the MSB of the sensor‚Äôs value is transmitted and with consequent rising edges, the bits are sequentially transmitted to the output. After the transmission of complete data word (3) (i.e. LSB is transmitted), an additional rising edge of the clock sets the clock line HIGH. The data line is set to LOW and remains there for a period of time, tm, to recognize the transfer timeout . If a clock signal (data-output request) is received within that time, the same data will be transmitted again (multiple transmission). The slave starts updating its value and the data line is set to HIGH (idle mode) if there are no clock pulses within time, tm. This marks the end of single transmission of the data word. Once the slave receives a clock signal at a time, tp (>=tm), the updated position value is frozen and the transmission of the value begins as described earlier.  Multiple transmissions  Multiple transmission Multiple transmissions of the same data happens only if there is continuous clocking even after the transmission of the least significant bit i.e. the clock pulses does not allow the monoflop to go to steady state. This is illustrated below. The initial sequences are the same as that of the single transmission. In the idle state the CLOCK and DATA lines are high but with the arrival of the first falling edge the transmission mode is evoked and the similarly the data bits are transmitted sequentially starting with the MSB with every rising edge. The transmission of the LSB means that the transmission of the data is completed. An additional rising edge pushes the data line to LOW signifying the end of transmission of the particular data. But, if there are continuous clock pulses even after then (i.e. the next clock pulses comes in time tw (< tm )) the value of the slave is not updated. This is because the monoflop is still unsteady and the value in the shift register still contains the same value as before. So with the next rising edge, i.e. after the n+1 rising edge, the transmission of the same data continues and the MSB of data transmitted earlier is re-transmitted at the end of tw. Then, it follows the same procedure as earlier transmissions, leading to multiple transmissions of the same data. The value of the slave is updated only when the timing between two clock pulses is more than the transfer timeout, tm. Multiple transmission is used to check the data integrity. The two consecutive received values are compared, transmission failures are indicated by differences between the two values.  Interrupting transmission  The transmission of data is controlled by the master and the transmission can be interrupted at any time just by stopping the clock sequence, for a period longer than tm. The slave automatically will recognize the transfer timeout and go into idle mode. Cabling ‚Äì according to RS-422 standards Cable length versus signaling rate Since SSI is based on RS-422 standards, it is necessary to select appropriate cables and to stay within the limits of cabling length and clock frequencies. The relation between the cable length and clock frequency is shown in the following figure.*RS422 Cable Characteristics This can be used as a conservative guide. This curve is based upon empirical data using a 24 AWG Standard, copper conductor, unshielded twisted-pair telephone cable with a shunt capacitance of 52.5 pF/meter (16 pF/foot) terminated in a 100 Ohm resistive load. The cable length restriction shown by the curve is based upon assumed load signal quality requirements of: #Signal rise and fall times equal to or less than, one-half unit interval at the applicable data switching rate. #A maximum voltage loss between generator and load of 66% When high data rates are used, the application is limited to shorter cables. It is possible to use longer cables when low data rates are used. The DC resistance of the cable limits the length of the cable for low data rate applications by increasing the noise margin as the voltage drop in the cable increases. The AC effects of the cable limit the quality of the signal and limit the cable length to short distances when high data rates are used. Examples of data rate and cable length combinations vary from 90 kbit/s at 1.2 km to 10 Mbit/s at 5m for RS-422. Cables having characteristics different from the twisted pair 24 AWG, 52.5 pF/meter (16 pF/foot), can also be employed within bounds mentioned above. First, determine the absolute loop resistance and capacitance values of the typical 24 AWG cable provided by the cable length associated with the data signalling rate desired from the figure. Then convert those values to equivalent lengths of the cable actually used. For example, longer distances would be possible when using 19 AWG, while shorter distances would be necessary for 28 AWG. The maximum permissible length of cable separating the master and slave is a function of data signalling rate and is influenced by the tolerable signal distortion, the amount of longitudinally coupled noise and ground potential differences introduced between the master and the slave circuit. Accordingly, users are advised to restrict cable length to a minimum. The type and length of the cable used must be capable of maintaining the necessary signal quality needed for the particular application. Furthermore, the cable balance must be such as to maintain acceptable crosstalk levels, both generated and received.  Derived protocols  Some manufacturers and organizations*Biss interface added additional information to the basic SSI protocol. It was done mainly to ensure proper data transmission. For secure transmission and to indicate the end of data transmission CRC bits or parity bits can be added. In simple words, they were used for identifying if the byte has been correctly interpreted and received. In the original specification multiple transmissions were used to ensure data integrity. In this case, two consecutive transmissions of the same data were initiated and compared for any error in transmission. But this however reduces the protocol efficiency by 50% compared to parallel data transmission.  Benefits  * Serial data transfer has reduced the wiring. This, in addition to the simplicity of SSI design due to use of minimal number of components, has considerably reduced the cost and created more transmission bandwidth for message bits. * High Electromagnetic interference immunity due to RS-422 standards and higher reliability of data transmission due to differential signalling. * Optimal galvanic isolation * Complete protocol flexibility for the number of bits transferred. Not limited to a certain number of words and has an arbitrary choice of message size. * Slaves use master‚Äôs clock and hence don‚Äôt need precision oscillators. * The SSI allows to connect up to three slaves to a common clock. Therefore, it is possible to attain values from multiple sensors. The limitations in this interface are negligible for applications in industrial automation. SSI can handle only short distance communication (up to 1.2 km) and supports only one master device. But, 1.2 km is rather a good distance for communication by automation industry standards. When compared to advanced communication systems based on field buses or Ethernet, SSI is limited to a master slave architecture and a simple point to point communication between a master and a slave. Another disadvantage is that there is no hardware slave acknowledgment i.e. detection of slave for communication.

Traditional electron microscopes use accelerating voltages in the range of 10-1000 keV. Low voltage imaging in transmitted electrons is possible in many new scanning electron detector. Low cost alternative is dedicated table top low voltage transmission electron microscope.LVEM5 from Delong America While its architecture is very similar to a conventional transmission electron microscope, it has a few key changes that enable it to take advantage of a 5 keV electron source, but trading off many advantages of higher voltage operations, including higher resolution, possibility of X-ray microanalysis and EELS, etc... Recently a new low voltage transmission electron microscope has been introduced that operates at variable voltage ranges between 6‚Äì25 kV.LVEM25 from Delong America Advantages Higher contrast A substantial decrease of electron energy allows for a significant improvement of contrast of light elements. The comparison images below show that decreasing the acceleration voltage from 80 kV to 5 kV significantly enhances the contrast of test samples. The improved contrast is a direct result of increased electron scattering associated with a reduced accelerating voltage. LVEM brings an enhancement of imaging contrast nearly twenty times higher than for 100 kV. This is very promising for biological specimens which are composed from light elements and don't exhibit sufficient contrast in classical TEMs. Further, a relatively low mean free path (15 nm) for organic samples at 5 kV means that for samples with constant thickness, high contrast will be obtained from small variations in density. For example, for 5% contrast in the LVEM bright field image, we will only need to have a difference in density between the phases of 0.07 g/cm3. This means that the usual need to stain polymers for enhanced contrast in the TEM (typically done with osmium or ruthenium tetraoxide) may not be necessary with the low voltage electron microscopy technique. Stain not required The improved contrast allows for the significant reduction, or elimination, of the heavy metal negative staining step for TEM imaging of light elements (H, C, N, O, S, P). While staining is beneficial for experiments aimed at high resolution structure determination, it is highly undesirable in certain protein sample preparations, because it could destabilize the protein sample due to its acid pH and relatively high heavy metal concentration. The addition of stain to sectioned samples such as biological materials or polymers can also introduce imaging artifacts. LVEM experiments carried out on an extracted membrane protein sample that was analyzed with and without the staining procedure show a marked improvement in the appearance of the sample when standard staining is omitted. Results show that LVEM could be even more useful than conventional EM for this particular application because it avoids the potentially disrupting staining step, thus providing an undisturbed image of the protein's aggregation state. Additionally, The ability to eliminate the staining step could aid to improve safety in the lab, as common heavy metal stains, such as uranyl acetate do have associated health risks. Resolution The first low-voltage electron microscopes were capable of spatial resolutions of about 2.5 nm in TEM, 2.0 nm in STEM, and 3.0 nm in SEM modes. The SEM resolution has been improved to ~1.2 nm at 800 eV by 2010, while a 0.14 nm TEM resolution at 15 keV has been reported in 2016. Limitations Currently available low voltage microscopes are only able to obtain resolutions of 1.0‚Äì3 nanometers. While this is well beyond resolutions possible from optical (light) microscopes, they are not yet able to compete with the atomic resolution obtainable from conventional (higher voltage) electron microscopes. Low voltage limits the maximum thickness of samples which can be studied in the TEM or STEM mode. Whereas it is about 50-90 nm in conventional TEM, it decreases to around 20‚Äì65 nanometers for LVEM @ 5 kV. However, thicknesses of the order of 20 nm or less are required to attain the maximal resolution in the TEM and STEM modes 5 kV.. These thickness are sometimes achievable with the use of an ultramicrotome. in 2015 these limitations were overcome with a 25 kV low voltage electron microscope that can produce high quality results with thin sectioned samples up to around 100 nm+.

It consists of two flights connected by a landing, the upper flight turning ninety degrees to the left from the lower flight. There is a balustrade adorned with sculptures of a unicorn on the left and a lion on the right. Along with the Memorial Chapel and the adjacent Gilbert Scott Building, it is protected as a Category A listed building. The staircase originally formed part of the University's Old College site on High Street, situated in the Outer Court and leading to the Principal's Residence and the Fore Hall. On 20 June 1690, the University instructed William Riddel, a mason, to place stone bannisters on the staircase with figures of a lion and a unicorn on the first turn, for which he was paid twelve pounds sterling. Work began on 30 June and finished on 15 August that year. When the University moved to its new site in Gilmorehill in 1870, the staircase was transported and incorporated into the new building, along with parts of the High Street gatehouse, which were rebuilt as Pearce Lodge. When the Main Building of the University was originally built, the West Quadrangle was not enclosed on all sides; instead, on the west side, a staircase stood at each end of a small landscaped garden leading from the elevated grass of the quadrangle to the lower level of The Square, where the Principal's and Professors' houses were. The Lion and Unicorn Staircase was the southern of these. The quadrangle was subsequently enclosed when the new Memorial Chapel and additional facilities were built along that side between 1914 and 1929, and the Lion and Unicorn Staircase provided access to these from The Square. When first installed, in Gilmorehill, the staircase turned right at its middle landing, but was altered at this time to turn left. At its original site in the Old College, the staircase had led to the Fore Hall; amongst the new rooms created with the 1929 expansion was a hall, also called the Fore Hall.

The brigade was formed in June 1941, at Poona in India and assigned to the 17th Indian Infantry Division. Under the command of Brigadier George Ballentine, on establishment the brigade drew a mix of regular soldiers, reservists and new recruits to form three infantry battalions; various supporting units were formed between August and September. A signals section was formed in late December. Due to the rapid expansion of the Indian Army, the brigade suffered from a shortage of experienced leaders, with each infantry battalion having on average only three British officers and also lacking Indian viceroy-commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers. The brigade's manpower problems were made worse in late 1941 when an experienced cadre of 250 personnel were transferred from the brigade in order to form another unit. They were replaced by a large number of inexperienced soldiers, many of whom were under 18 years old. In January 1942, the 44th was transferred to Malaya Command which was giving ground to a strong Japanese force that had invaded Malaya the previous December. During the campaign on the peninsula, the brigade was involved in the Battle of Muar. After the withdrawal of British Commonwealth forces across the Johore Strait to Singapore, the brigade was briefly placed under the command of the Australian 8th Division in February 1942 and assigned to defend an area around the Causeway.Wigmore 1957, p. 297.

Career In 1839, Clarke exhibited an antiquarian drawing with the Oxford Society for Promoting the Study of Gothic Architecture. He was made an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1841 and a Fellow of the RIBA in 1850. He became a member of the Ecclesiological Society in 1853. He served as Diocesan Surveyor to the sees of Canterbury and Rochester, and from 1871 to the see of St Albans. He was also Consultant Architect to the Charity Commissioners. In 1852, Clarke published Schools and Schoolhouses: a series of Views, Plans, and Details, for Rural Parishes. In this he condemned the set of model plans issued by the Committee of Council on Education as \\"unsuitable in every way\\" and stressed the advantages of employing an architect for any new school, rather than relying on a standardised design: > The plan should always be formed to the site, and reference had to local > materials; the design of the school, again, should conform to the materials. > Brick and stone each require their separate uses, and so their several > applications. The book included plans of twelve schools he had built in Kent, Essex and Oxfordshire, at Monks Horton, Lydd, Little Bentley, Coggeshall, Clifton Hampton, Coopershall, Wellesborough, Brabourne, Boreham, Foxearth, Hatfield and Leigh (Essex). He drew up ambitious plans for an extension to the House of Charity in Greek Street Soho, including a chapel, refectory, dormitories and cloisters. Only the chapel (begun 1862) was actually built.

In March 2016 a stretch of the England Coast Path from Brean Down to Minehead, which incorporates the West Somerset Coast Path, was opened and designated as part of the England Coast Path. Route It runs from the hamlet of Steart on the Steart Peninsula, and passes through the villages of Kilve, West Quantoxhead, Williton, Watchet, Blue Anchor, and Dunster beach to Minehead. The beach at Kilve was described by William Wordsworth, the Romantic poet, as \\"Kilve's delightful shore\\". Kilve Pill, where the stream from Holford runs into the sea, was once a tiny port, used for importing culm, an inferior type of coal which was used in the limeburning process. It was also the site for \\"glatting\\" which was the hunting of conger eels by dogs. On the shore a Saint Keyne serpent can be seen, which a local legend says is a snake turned to stone, but is in reality an ammonite. It is just possible to make out the remains of a stone jetty and the ruins of a lime kiln nearby. Here the limestone was burnt to provide farmers with the lime to spread on their fields. The limestone carrier Laurina was wrecked at Kilve in 1876. From Williton to Minehead the route is close to the track of the West Somerset Railway which opened in 1862 and was extended from Watchet to by the Minehead Railway in 1874. Although just a single track, improvements were needed in the first half of the twentieth century to accommodate the significant number of tourists that wished to travel to the Somerset coast. Despite this traffic it was closed in 1971 but was then reopened in 1976 as a heritage railway. Watchet is a harbour town, which, according to the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle, was plundered by Danes led by Ohtor and Rhoald in 987 and 997. It is known that it was in frequent use by small boats in 1564 possibly for the import of salt and wine from France. During the English Civil War Royalist reinforcements for the siege of Dunster Castle was sent by sea, but the tide was on the ebb and a troop of Roundheads rode into the shallows and forced the ship to surrender, so a ship at sea was taken by a troop of horse. The primitive jetty was damaged in a storm of 1659 and a larger, stronger pier was built in the early 18th century supported by local wool merchants, although by 1797 the largest export was kelp made by burning seaweed for use in glass making. In the 19th century trade increased with the export of iron ore from the Brendon Hills, paper, flour and gypsum. Harbour trade was aided by the coming of the railway. In the mid-1860s two independent railways terminated at Watchet. The West Somerset Mineral Railway ran down from the iron mines on the Brendon Hills, and the West Somerset Railway came up from the Bristol & Exeter Railway at Norton Fitzwarren. Both lines made extensive use of the harbour at Watchet from where iron ore was shipped across the Bristol Channel for smelting at Ebbw Vale in South Wales. The foreshore at Watchet is rocky, with a high tidal range. The cliffs between Watchet and Blue Anchor show a distinct pale, greenish blue colour, resulting from the coloured alabaster found there. The name \\"Watchet\\" or \\"Watchet Blue\\" was used in the 16th century to denote this colour. Daw's Castle, about west of Watchet, is a hill fort situated on a sea cliff about above the sea. The fort may be of Iron Age origin, but was (re)built and fortified as a burh by King Alfred, as part of his defence against Viking raids from the Bristol Channel around 878 AD. The Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI is a 742.8 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It provides an outstanding series of sections through the Early Jurassic Lower Lias, spanning the Hettangian and Pliensbachian Stages and named the \\"Lilstock Formation\\". This sequence and the good Rhaetian succession beneath are repeatedly affected by faulting, making it of interest to geologists and fossil hunters. It also displays coastal geomorphology which demonstrates a particularly well-developed series of intertidal shore platforms varying in width from about 200-600m. The cliff and beach are rich in reptile remains, including complete skeletons. Lilstock also yields ammonites, shells and fish remains. A unique specimen of an ichthyosaur, named Excalibosaurus costini MacGowan, in which the lower jaw is shorter than the upper was found in the Lower Jurassic Sinemurian Stage, Lower Lias beds on the foreshore at Lilstock and is now in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. The Triassic cliffs have geological interest for the variety of fossils. The coloured alabaster found in the cliffs gave rise to the name of the colour \\"Watchet Blue\\". Dunster Beach, which includes the mouth of the River Avill, is located half a mile from the village, and used to have a significant harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from Saxon times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore. The beach site has a number of privately owned beach huts (or chalets as some owners call them) along with a small shop, a tennis court and a putting green. The chalets, measuring , can be let out for holidays; some owners live in them all the year round.The history of Dunster Beach by Bernard Concannon, Monkspath Books, 1995 () Route and points of interest References External links *The West Somerset Coast Path, National Trail *West Somerset Coast Path directions, Somerset County Council (archived) Category:Long-distance footpaths in England Category:Footpaths in Somerset Category:Coastal paths in England ","title":"West Somerset Coast Path"},{"id":"24761361","text":"Wilson Fernando Cepeda Cuervo (born September 2, 1980 in Paipa, Boyac√°) is a Colombian former professional road racing cyclist.

The Water Rats, a British entertainment charity, helped him with his expenses and with securing travel back to the United States. When the Vaudeville Managers Association (VMA) formed in 1900, and began demanding a 5% kickback from all performers in exchange for steady bookings, Golden called on his experience with the Water Rats to form the White Rats as a labor union for performers. The White Rats attempted to negotiate with the VMA, led by E.F. Albee and B.F. Keith, to reduce or remove the kickback. After negotiations failed, the White Rats called a strike in February 1901. Vaudeville performers all over the United States refused to work. Many claimed they were sick.Samuels, Charles & Louise. Once Upon A Stage: The Merry World of Vaudeville. (New York: Dodd, Mead & Company, 1974) The Western States branch of the VMA gave in to the union's demands, and the Eastern branch went without vaudeville for two weeks. Some theaters shut down completely, others booked replacement acts. Keith and Albee called a meeting with the White Rats in which they claimed they themselves had been against the 5% commission, and would ask the other members of the VMA to remove it. Albee and Keith also agreed to go on the record in the press as being against the 5% commission if the strike was called off, and they did so. As a result, the strike was called off, and performers began to sign contracts with the VMA again in order to secure valuable long-term performing contracts.Trav S.D.

The White Rats received a charter from the American Federation of Labor in 1910.Smith, Bill. The Vaudevillians. (New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., 1976) However, the union was unable to manage funds efficiently, and lost members because many performers did not want to pay dues to the union in addition to paying the vaudeville managers.

It is a area reflecting the extent of the village when it was first incorporated in the 1860s and its subsequent development in the years the Rice Seed Company, largest in the world at the time, was located here. Many of the district's 240 buildings date to the 19th century, with a few 18th-century structures and modern intrusions. Among its contributing properties are the Rice Seed Company's headquarters, a late Victorian opera house and a church with Tiffany interiors and stained glass windows. In 1978 it was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1978, it included 198 contributing buildings and one other contributing site. Geography The district is built around the axis of East and West Main Streets (NY 372 west of North and South Park Street (NY 22), and Washington County Route 67 east of it to just beyond Gilbert Street (NY 313)), and North and South Union Streets (also the dividing line between the towns of Cambridge and White Creek). Some adjacent buildings with addresses on cross streets of Main, including North and South Park Street (NY 22), that front on Main, are included. The area is mostly flat, reflecting the nearby presence of the Owl Kill, a tributary of the Hoosic River which flows through the district in a controlled channel at a small park on the south side of West Main between Pearl Street and Memorial Drive. The tracks of the former Delaware and Hudson Railroad run through the district along Railroad Avenue, dividing Main Street into east and west. The land is densely developed. Most of its buildings are frame houses. Commercial buildings in the district are concentrated on the blocks of West Main between Pearl and Park, and again at the Union Street intersection. There is plenty of residential infill on Main, and a few churches. The 16 non-contributing modern properties within the district are commercial and governmental properties such as a gas station, supermarket and post office, mostly on Main Street near the two major intersections. History Rice Mansion Inn was built in 1903 for seed tycoon of-the-era, Jerome B. Rice, and his wife Laura. Cambridge Hotel, Main & Broad St, Cambridge, NY. The settlement of the future village began in the 1760s, after the resolution of the French and Indian War had made it safe to settle in the previously contested frontier area north of Albany. In 1761, Cadwallader Colden, the colony's surveyor general and acting governor, was involved in the purchase of the Cambridge Patent, part of which was soon conveyed to a group of six partners, his son among them. The provisions of the purchase agreement required that governments be elected by the landowners, that one family for each 1,000 acres (400 ha) be settled and own land outright within the patent within three years, and that 200 acres (80 ha) be set aside for a minister and schoolmaster. These conditions made it possible for a democratic society of free landowners to develop on the patent. The area was especially desirable for settlers because of the great extent of flat and arable terrain around the Owl Kill (although the creek could not be used for mills since it thus generated no power). Few records of the earliest settlement on the land exist because of the long dispute over the land between New York and neighboring Vermont. It is believed that many early settlers came from Scotland and Northern Ireland, because of the early success of the Presbyterian churches in the village. After the Revolution, settlement increased again. The earliest surviving house in the district, and the village, is the Dorr-Randall House on East Main Street, built in 1779. It is one of several proto-Federal style houses from this postwar period scattered around the district. An academy was organized in 1800. It no longer remains, but its boarding house on West Main has been converted into apartments. As the 19th century progressed, three distinct settlements emerged within the area: Cambridge, Dorr Corners and North White Creek, all around crossroads. Early turnpikes connected them with markets to the south, near today's Troy, and at Burlington in the north. Flax and sheep farming were introduced, providing raw material for early textile mills in the nearby cities and small towns like Hoosick Falls and Bennington. The Champlain Canal improved these connections in 1825. It provided enough of an economic stimulus that two new churches could be built: a Methodist church in 1838 (rebuilt in 1861) at 47 East Main, and the village's Baptist church, at 3 West Main, in 1844. Almost three decades later, in 1852, the Troy and Rutland Railroad was built through the town, and a station established at the center of the then-hamlet of North White Creek. Fourteen years later, the three decided to merge into the village of Cambridge. For this reason many of the village's streets intersect at odd angles, even today. The years that followed were the village's economic peak, as reflected by the mid-century architecture of most of its houses. Another church, St. Luke's, was built in the year of incorporation, with a Tiffany interior and windows. The railroad led to some industrial development, and the construction of Hubbard Hall at 25 West Main in 1878 reflected Cambridge's new importance. The strongest catalyst for development was the establishment of the Rice Seed Company's headquarters in the village in 1879. Its warehouse and accompanying office building, completed in 1895, are at 15 West Main. Founder Jerome Rice's home is across the street at 16 West Main. By the turn of the century, Rice was the largest seed company in the world, employing 200 people locally. Over the 20th century, changes in the national and regional economies adversely affected Cambridge.

Preservation Unlike most other municipalities with historic districts in the state, Cambridge has not done anything specific in its zoning to preserve the district's historic character. There is no separate board or commission charged with the task. In 2009 it adopted a new zoning code which recognizes several different types of residential uses within the village and provides for a future historic overlay district., Village of Cambridge, June 15, 2009.

At its peak, the journal published some of the leading writers of its day. History The magazine was started by 1908 by Ford Madox Hueffer (later Ford Madox Ford) \\"in a rage that there was no place in England to print a poem by Thomas Hardy\\" and as a venue for some of the best writers available. Published in December 1908, the first issue contained original work by Thomas Hardy, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, John Galsworthy, W. H. Hudson, R. B. Cunninghame Graham, and H. G. Wells. Hueffer maintained this level of quality in subsequent issues he edited, publishing the early work of Ezra Pound, D. H. Lawrence, and Wyndham Lewis as well. Yet despite its literary excellence, the new venture was not a financial success. Issued as a monthly magazine of approximately 175 pages and sold for half a crown, The English Review did not exceed a circulation of 1,000 during Hueffer's editorship. With the magazine struggling, Hueffer sold the magazine after publishing twelve issues to Alfred Mond. With Hueffer departing as editor, Mond brought in Austin Harrison as Hueffer's successor. Harrison maintained the high quality of contributors, and broadened the scope of the review to include women writers and writers from abroad. In addition to continuing to print works by Conrad, Lawrence, Graham, and Wells, authors such as Sherwood Anderson, Anton Chekhov, Hermann Hesse, Aldous Huxley, Katherine Mansfield, Bertrand Russell, G. B. Shaw, Ivan Turgenev, and William Butler Yeats now appeared in the magazine's pages. Coverage of politics also increased substantially, reflecting Harrison's background as a journalist. Harrison courted controversy by challenging attitudes towards sexuality when he published works by authors such as Frank Harris, leading to condemnation in the pages of other journals. Such notoriety boosted circulation, however, as did a subsequent reduction in the magazine's cover price to a shilling. By 1915, the magazine was profitable to the point when Harrison bought out Mond, becoming the owner as well as the editor.Martha S. Vogeler, \\"Harrison, Austin Frederic\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 25, p. 485. After the First World War, however, the journal began to decline. Harrison sold The English Review to Ernest Remnant in 1923 and the journal took an increasingly conservative and less literary direction. In 1937, the magazine was absorbed by The National Review.

Background Out of the mare, Marshesseaux, Left Bank was sired by Jerome Handicap winner, French Deputy, a son of Deputy Minister who was the 1981 Canadian Horse of the Year and two-time Leading sire in North America. English horseman Michael Tabor purchased Left Bank as a two- year-old for $600,000 at a February 1999 Fasig-Tipton sale at Calder Race Course. Tabor turned him over to trainer Todd Pletcher to race in the United States. However, the colt suffered from colic that necessitated surgery which resulted in the removal of twelve feet of small intestine. Racing career 2000: Three-year-old season Recovered, Left Bank was able to race the following year notably winning the 2000 Discovery Handicap at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack. 2001: Four-year-old season At age four in 2001, Left Bank got off to a slow start but in the fall won two Grade 1 races. He first beat the betting favorite Squirtle Squirt to capture the September 22 Vosburgh Stakes at Belmont Park, clocking the second-fastest time in the race's 62 year history. Then, on November 24 at Aqueduct Racetrack, Left Bank won the Cigar Mile Handicap by defeating top-rated challengers, Graeme Hall and Red Bullet. 2002 Championship year and death Rested since his win in November's Cigar Mile, Left Bank began his five-year-old campaign on May 12, 2002 with a win in the Grade 3 Bold Ruler Handicap. After a poor showing in the May 27 Metropolitan Handicap, on July 4 Left Bank set a Belmont Park track record for seven furlongs in winning the Grade 2 Tom Fool Handicap by six and a quarter lengths. Moving up from sprint race distances, Left Bank followed his record- setting win in the Tom Fool by equaling the Saratoga Race Course track record for 1‚Öõ miles (9 furlongs) in his victory in the Grade 1 Whitney Handicap. After his win in the Whitney, Left Bank was being prepared to run in the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park but suffered another attack of colic. On August 10, 2002 the horse was rushed to the equine hospital at Tufts University near Boston, Massachusetts where he underwent emergency surgery. Following his surgery, Left Bank was sent to recover at Ashford Stud in Versailles, Kentucky but had to undergo further operations from which he was unable to recover and died on October 7, 2002. Assessment Left Bank posthumously earned the Eclipse Award when he was voted the 2002 American Champion Older Male Horse. It marked the first Eclipse Award for trainer, Todd Pletcher.

Shane Geoghegan (7 March 1980 ‚Äì 9 November 2008) was a rugby player for Garryowen who was shot and killed in a case of mistaken identity as part of a gang feud in Dooradoyle, a suburb in the city of Limerick, Ireland. The murder took place in the early hours of Sunday morning, 9 November 2008. He had no links with organised crime gangs. Background to the crime The victim Shane Geoghegan was a 28-year-old native of Limerick City. He worked for Air Atlanta as an aircraft fitter and was a keen rugby fan, playing as prop with Garryowen and was captain of their third team and lived with his girlfriend Jenna Barry. He was described as \\"A nice, decent guy who was well respected by young and old alike\\" by the secretary of his rugby club. It is believed that he bore a resemblance to a drug dealer called John McNamara, who was the target of a contract killing and lived nearby. Limerick criminal gang feud The murder was linked to the ongoing Limerick feud between rival criminal gangs and their battle to control drug supplies in Limerick. At least 13 people had been murdered in a turf war between the McCarthy-Dundon and Keane-Collopy gangs. There have also been cases of abductions and torture. The crime Shane watched the Ireland v Canada rugby international with friends on Saturday night. He then walked home through the Kilteragh housing estate in Dooradoyle at 1.30am. He was gunned down when up to 15 shots were fired at him. Shane managed to run to the rear of a house in Clonmore, where he was shot three times in the upper body and once in the head. Members of the recently established Garda Regional Support Unit were the first at the scene after a 999 call was made from concerned residents who heard the sound of gunshots. A burnt-out getaway vehicle was found nearby. Aftermath Around 2,000 people attended his funeral Mass, including rugby internationals Jerry Flannery and David Wallace, as well as former Ireland rugby team coach Eddie O'Sullivan and the head of the New Zealand Rugby Union. The Catholic Bishop of Limerick described the death as a senseless killing. A minute's silence was held before Ireland's match against New Zealand at Croke Park the following weekend and at the game between Munster and New Zealand at Thomond Park. Garryowen retired the number three jersey from all its teams for the remainder of the season. In the D√°il, Shane's death was described as \\"an obscenity that could not be tolerated in a civilised society\\". Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Dermot Ahern called his killers \\"scum\\". Investigation and trial Up to 200 Garda√≠ worked on the murder enquiry, with 50 officers dedicated to the case on a daily basis. Searches were carried out resulting in seizures of handguns, ammunition and drugs. One of the leaders of the McCarthy-Dundon crime family handed himself in to Garda√≠ in the week following the shooting out of fear of being murdered. During the investigation, some of the suspects were tracked via their Bebo pages. Social networking sites were identified as a problem in glorifying gun crime. In March 2009, Garda√≠ arrested 15 people in connection with the shooting. Twenty-three-year-old Barry Doyle from Portland Row, Dublin but living in Limerick was subsequently charged with the murder. He was put on trial in the Central Criminal Court in February 2011. Doyle was believed to be working on behalf of the McCarthy-Dundon gang and allegedly shot Geoghegan in a case of mistaken identity, thinking he was a criminal linked to the Keane- Callopy gang. The trial of Barry Doyle resulted in a hung jury after one of the longest deliberation in Irish legal history. Due to the fact that according to his defence counsel Martin O'Rourke SC, his confession was due to threats and inducements made while in custody. On 15 February 2012, following a re-trial, Barry Doyle was convicted of the murder of Shane Geoghegan, in which he pleaded not guilty. The jury of three women and eight men returned a unanimous guilty verdict, after deliberating for six hours. Justice Garrett Sheehan imposed a life sentence on Doyle, then a 26-year-old father-of-three. \\"There is only one sentence this court can impose and that's life in prison,‚Äù he said. He thanked the jury for their dedicated service and the \\"careful attention\\" they gave the case, and excluded them from jury duty for five years. Garda√≠ continue to pursue their investigations into this case and in particular targeting more senior figures behind the killing. On 18 August 2012, John Dundon from Limerick City, was also charged with the murder at the Special Criminal Court. He was found guilty on 13 August 2013 and sentenced to life in prison. Political fallout Then Justice Minister Dermot Ahern made a statement to D√°il √âireann following the killing. National public opinion demanded strong action from the Government. Local TD and Minister for Defence Willie O'Dea, came under pressure to secure changes to the law and greater resources to tackle Limerick city's gangland crime. As a result, the Justice Minister introduced the Criminal Justice Bill 2009. This introduced measures designed to tackle gangland crime: * Organised crime offences will be tried in the Special Criminal Court. * Directing or controlling a criminal organisation will carry a sentence of life imprisonment. * Involvement in organised crime will carry a penalty of up to 15 years imprisonment. * Garda opinion evidence as to the existence of criminal gangs will be admissible in evidence. * The penalty for intimidation of a witness or juror will be increased from 10 years to 15 years. * Garda√≠ will be able to detain organised crime suspects for questioning for up to 7 days. There have been concerns that these laws are an infringement upon citizen's rights. The Shane Geoghegan Trust A charity was launched in honour of Shane Geoghegan in October 2009 by his mother and former Ireland soccer international and CEO of Sunderland AFC Niall Quinn. Its aims are to provide children with an alternative to criminal or anti-social behaviour by making a range of sporting and creative activities accessible to them. The trust is based on the Sunderland AFC foundation which helps children in vulnerable communities by getting them involved in sport. Other events Limerick County Council hosted a civic reception for Shane Geoghegan on 12 July 2010. A memorial plaque was unveiled in the county council building's foyer. The next day a major charity match was held at Thomond Park ‚Äì Sunderland A.F.C. versus Munster XI, with funds going to the Shane Geoghegan Trust.\\"Civic reception to honour Shane Geoghegan\\".

It had two sets of wings, one for cross-country flights and the other for speed; it later appeared as a biplane which could be converted into a monoplane. Design and development Though only three Parnall Pixies were built, they appeared with a remarkable variety of wings; a normal span monoplane (Pixie I); a short span monoplane (Pixie II); a biplane readily convertible to a monoplane (Pixie IIIA); and a non-convertible monoplane version of the latter, with a greater span than the Pixie I. The first Pixie was designed to compete in the Lympne Light Aeroplane Trials of 1923, organised by the Royal Aero Club for what they described as single-seat motor-gliders. The intention was to develop economical private aviation, so the engine size was limited to 750 cc with immediate consequences for aircraft size and weight. Various sponsors provided attractive prizes, particularly the total of ¬£1500 jointly from the Duke of Sutherland and the Daily Mail. The event took place from 8‚Äì13 October 1923. There were many entrants from the British aviation industry, including the de Havilland Humming Bird, Gloster Gannet and Vickers Viget. The Pixie I first flew, at Filton on 13 September 1923, in good time for the competition. The sole Pixie I & II, registered G-EBKM, was the same aircraft apart from the wings and engine.\\"Pixie.\\" Flight, 25 October 1923, pp. 653-654. The common fuselage was built around four spruce longerons, stiffened by diagonals or plywood sheet, though most of the fuselage was fabric covered; it had with a rounded decking. The single cockpit was at mid wing chord. The engine was mounted on steel tubes fixed to the ends of the longerons, with a firewall between engine and pilot. There was a triangular tailplane bearing a single piece elevator, with hinge just at the end of the fuselage where there was also a small tail skid. The fin was also triangular, though its trailing edge, carrying the rudder hinge, leant slightly forward, helping the large and almost semi-circular rudder to clear the elevator. The main undercarriage was unusual and looked rather vulnerable. Two steel tubes formed an inverted V, joined at the top to the upper fuselage internally and emerging below to meet a cross-axle at points not much further apart than the width of the fuselage. The axle was more than twice this width, giving a wide track arrangement which was sprung only by deflection of the V struts. Both pairs of wings had similar planforms and the same centre section chord. The leading edges were straight apart from at the tips, as were the centre section trailing edges. Outboard the trailing edges, fully occupied with ailerons swept forward, more sharply on the short span wing. The ailerons were of the differential kind, a recent invention, with less downward movement than upward. Both wing sets were built up around two spruce spars; the only novelty was that the rear spar was not straight but came in two joined sections, the outer part swept forward to meet the forward spar at the wingtip. The wings were hinged to the lower longerons and braced by a pair of streamlined steel tubes from spars to upper longerons. The wings of the Pixie I, long span and designed for fuel economy had a span of 28 ft 6 in and an area of , whereas those of the Pixie II, designed for speed had a span of 17 ft 10 in (5.44 m) and an area of 60 sq ft (5.57 m2). The engines were chosen to match the same purposes. For economy the Pixie I had a 500 cc Douglas horizontal twin and the Pixie II a more powerful 750 cc (the competition limit) engine of the same make and configuration. In 1924 it was flying with a 696 cc Blackburne Tomtit engine. These engines were mounted low on the nose, driving a two-bladed propeller on a shaft above it via a chain reduction gear of ratio 2.5:1. The rules of the 1924 Lympne trials were revised to allow more practical aircraft, rather than motor-gliders. Parnall therefore built a two-seat version, the Pixie IIIA with its fuselage extended by 3 ft 2 in (965 mm) to allow a second cockpit, one now above each wing spar and the wing span extended to 32 ft 5 in. A demountable upper wing, attached by N form interplane struts and several cabane struts and of markedly smaller span and deep central chord\\"Pixie.\\" Flight, 9 October 1924, pp.652‚Äì653. allowed the IIIA to be flown either as monoplane or biplane. Its undercarriage legs now had rubber compression shock absorbers.\\"Pixie.\\" Flight, 9 October 1924, p. 655. Two were built, one with a 32 hp Bristol Cherub III engine and the other with a 35 hp Blackburne Thrush. After the trials and in the following year, the Thrush was replaced with a 1,100 cc Anzani. In 1926, both IIIAs were converted to permanent monoplane configuration as Pixie IIIs, both now with the Bristol engine. Operational history The Pixie did well at Lympne, winning the ¬£500 speed prize at 76.1 mph (122 k/h) as the Pixie II. The Pixie II also won the Wakefield prize at 81 mph (130 km/h) at Hendon, later that October. It flew mostly as the Pixie II thereafter, appearing at Lympne races in 1924 and, with an enlarged rudder, in 1925. It also flew in the RAF display of 1924. After a period of inactivity from about 1925 to 1937, it was in the air again until it crashed in April 1939. Neither Pixie IIIA, competing as biplanes, made as much impact at Lympne 1924, with the Cherub engined machine retiring early, though it flew later in the week as a monoplane.\\"Pixie\\". Flight, 9 October 1924, pp. 650‚Äì659. The other, G-EBKK flying as no.19 and flown by W. Douglas completed all tasks but the two sets of five laps required by the high speed tests. Only two aircraft, the Bristol Brownie and the Beardmore Wee Bee, the overall winner, did complete these high speed tests. It was the top-scorer in the low speed test.\\"Pixie.\\" Flight, 9 October 1924, p.659. At the end of the Lympne trials, no.19 went on to compete in the Grosvenor Cup handicap, where it finished fifth. Converted to Pixie III standard they both flew on into the 1930s, one (G-EBJG) surviving World War II in store but not flying afterwards. Its remains are in deep store in the Midland Air Museum, Coventry.

Many plant and grass species grow well during the rainy season whilst an abundance of food and water, even in the dry period, attracts a large number of herbivorous mammals to the park. Flora The vegetation of the park represents Sri Lanka's dry evergreen forests. Chena cultivation and grasslands surround the tank area. The community of phytoplankton in the Kaudulla tank includes blue green algae, Microcystis spp. and diatoms such as Melosira spp.. Manilkara hexandra, Chloroxylon swietenia and Vitex altissima are the dominant tree species in the forest surrounding the tank. Bushes such as Randia dumetorum, and Calotropis gigantea and grasses such as Imperata cylindrica, and Panicum maximum are abundant in some areas. Fauna The faunal species recorded in the park include 24 species of mammals, 25 species of reptiles, 26 species of fish, and 160 species of bird. In the drought period Sri Lankan elephants move to the Minneriya tank to drink and feed. Around the month of September the elephants move to the Kaudulla tank in search of more water and food. Despite the escalating human-elephant conflict, the number of elephants increased in the dry zone and 211 individuals have been counted in Kaudulla as recently as 2008. Sri Lankan sambar deer, Sri Lankan axis deer, chevrotain, wild boar, Sri Lankan leopard, and sloth bear are other mammals found in the park. Kaudulla National Park is also one of the sites in which the gray slender loris is reportedly found in Sri Lanka. Following the discovery of a two-month-old albino Sri Lankan axis deer calf abandoned by her mother, it is supposed that Kaudulla is probably the only national park in Sri Lanka to have albino axis deer. Large water birds such as spot-billed pelican and lesser adjutant visit the Kaudulla tank. Fish species in the tank include the freshwater Oreochromis mossambicus. Fejervarya pulla is an endemic amphibian to Sri Lanka that inhabits the National Park. Freshwater turtles, Indian flap-shelled turtle and Indian black turtle are the noteworthy reptiles. Conservation It is reported that the spread of invasive, alien species such as Lantana camara is posing a threat to the wildlife of the park. The Kaudulla-Minneriya jungle corridor linking Kaudulla to Minneriya National Park was declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in 2004.

Although he was primarily an instrumentalist, all of his published music is vocal, and consists mainly of madrigals. A few details are known of his life. He was part of a family of musicians, many of whom were trombonists in Lucca, and he was born in that town. A younger brother, Bartolomeo, also played the trombone. Nicolao was hired as a trombonist by the city when it created the Cappella di Palazzo in 1543, and in 1557 he became director of that ensemble, a position he kept for the rest of his life.Gabriella Biagi Ravenni. \\"Dorati, Nicolao.\\" In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08027 (accessed October 20, 2009). Most of Dorati's surviving music was published in Venice. He produced three collections of madrigals for five voices (1549, 1561, 1567); a book of madrigals for from five to eight voices (1551); a collection of madrigals for four voices entitled Le stanze della signora Vittoria Colonna (1570); and a book of madrigals for six voices (1579). In addition to this considerable output of secular music, he wrote at least three motets, two of which were for six voices and published in 1585, and one of which survives incomplete. Additionally, a few works appear in publications primarily devoted to the music of others. As is usual with composers of the time, much of his music may not have been published and could be lost. Even though he was a professional trombonist, he is not known to have written any instrumental music. His madrigals often use the new time signature (C ‚Äì the misura cromatica) rather than the increasingly archaic Image:mensural proportion1.gif, the misura comune. Some of them use a declamatory and chordal style related to that concurrently being developed in Florence by Francesco Corteccia and others. Other innovative features include the use of five or more voices, including division of the ensemble into two groups for the madrigals for six to eight voices (polychoral music was in its infancy in the mid-16th century, and even then was a relative rarity outside of Venice). One of his madrigals, a setting of the several stanzas of Ariosto's romantic epic Orlando Furioso describing the charms of the sorceress Alcina, appears in a collection by Cipriano de Rore, indicating the esteem in which the composer was held, either by Rore or his Venetian publisher. These same stanzas were set by numerous other composers of the same era, including a young Orlande de Lassus.Alfred Einstein, The Italian Madrigal. Three volumes.

It offers programs in health and wellness, creativity, wisdom teachings and leadership development on its Cortes Island campus. It also offers programs at various locations in Vancouver throughout the year. History Hollyhock was founded in 1982 by Rex Weyler, Siobhan Robinsong and Lee Robinsong who met at Greenpeace. While beach walking on Cortes Island, they saw the abandoned hand-crafted buildings of the former Cold Mountain Institute. Siobhan drew Rex's attention to crimson hollyhocks peeking over a hawthorn hedge. Days before, Rex was given that same vision by an intuitive seer at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival. Friends Peggy Taylor, Rick Ingrasci, Torkin Wakefield, Charles Steinberg, Yvonne Kipp and Michael Moore joined to purchase the land. Many others invested over the years, and in 1982, this group of 30 'founders' purchased the abandoned Cold Mountain Institute. Dana Bass Solomon joined in the late 1990s as Board Member, soon as CEO. With Joel Solomon, Board Chair, (whom she later married), together they have led two decades of mission advancement. In 2008 the partner group donated full ownership and Hollyhock Leadership Institute became a registered charity.

Rejected by the military for health reasons, Rainey purchased an ambulance and drove it on the Western Front during World War I. African expedition film leftAfter the war, Rainey hunted big game in Africa. Rainey and his team filmed some of the earliest film footage of African animals in the wild. In 1912, a six-reel documentary film Paul J. Rainey's African Hunt was released. Rainey's silent film grossed over a half-million dollars (), an extraordinary sum for an early motion picture. It was one of the most successful non-fiction films of the decade. Rainey's safari team included a photographer and a taxidermist from the Smithsonian Institution. The success of Rainey's films led to a boom in expedition and nature films. These were silent films, so many of these films were at first presented by a lecturer in a lyceum-like context. The Library of Congress has a copy of the film in its paper print collection. Producer Joseph P. Bickerton, Jr. organized the Jungle Film Corporation to buy and commercialize Rainey's African hunt footage. These films were the first motion pictures to be produced at regular theater prices and were successful in the U.S. and abroad.Meet JP Bickerton, Jr. The New York Times. September 11, 1932 Death and burial He died on his forty-sixth birthday in 1923 of a cerebral hemorrhage. The death occurred while Rainey was en route from England to South Africa, where he had planned to hunt. He was buried at sea.

Shaw (January 20, 1908 ‚Äì September 28, 1992) was a judge, a member of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff during World War II, a representative in the Kansas House of Representatives and the 1956 Republican nominee for Kansas governor. Education Shaw went to Central Park grade school in Topeka. He then attended Topeka High School where he was graduated near the top of his class. He was also class president. He excelled in math and science, making straight A's. He was on the first Topeka High Football team in 1924. He also played in 1925, and in 1926 he played center and was captain of the all-state team. He also met the girl he would later marry, Charlotte Mullinix. Shaw graduated from Topeka High School in 1926 and went on to earn a law degree from Washburn University in 1931. During his time as a student at Washburn, he was captain of the 1929 and 1930 Washburn football teams under coach Ernest Bearg. In 1930 Washburn won the championship in the Central Kansas Conference. He was the all-state center and all-conference center in 1930 and captain of the all-conference team. He was a member of the Kansas Beta chapter of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, was President his senior year, and was also inducted into the school's prestigious Sagamore Society. In his first two years at Washburn he took courses in pre-med, but during the second year, at the suggestion of friends in law school, he enrolled in a class in \\"contracts.\\" He liked it. This was the beginning of a change of mind for Shaw. He had always intended to be a doctor, like his father. As one of six children in the Shaw family, he had to help put himself through college. He had a paper route that took him past the State Capitol building. The huge building loomed over him, a reminder of the vast importance of our government. It was then that he decided to pursue law school. He went home and told his father, Dr. Shaw that he wanted to be a lawyer instead of a doctor. It was a good choice. His successful Topeka practice would span the next 60+ years. He graduated in 1931 with his LL.B. degree and started practicing law shortly after. Military and legal work Shaw started practicing law in the office of Allen Meyers, Topeka attorney. He was with Meyers until the fall of 1935, when he was appointed an Assistant Commissioner of Insurance. This was the depression era and times were tough. For two and a half years, Shaw gained experience in insurance and legal issues. At the time of the United States‚Äô entry into World War II, Shaw was a judge of the Topeka Municipal Court. He left the bench in 1942 to enter the army. After a short time in North Africa, he was assigned to the London base command. Then, when SHAEF was set up (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces) Shaw was assigned as Staff Judge Advocate for this top level group headed by General Ike Eisenhower. \\"I saw a lot of Ike--he was always in and out of headquarters, but I was away down the line--just a major. He was my hero then.\\" Shaw had clear memories of the many bombings on the headquarters at Bushey park, 20 miles west of London. Their headquarters was later moved to Southampton. On June 6, 1944, when the invasion began, he was a witness to sights he would never forget. \\"I can see it yet, the way those planes went over us in solid layers. It was just a continuous wave of roar, roar, roar.\\" After the Normandy beaches were cleared, Shaw's unit moved into the Cherbourg peninsula behind the advancing forces to Versailles, and to Rheims at the time of the signing of the surrender. Then, they were moved to Frankfurt, Germany. As a legal officer, his military practice ranged from court-martials to changing wills and prosecuting black market offenders. On May 24, 1945, Shaw received the Bronze Star Medal for his \\"untiring efforts, efficiency, ingenuity and resourcefulness\\", aiding in the \\"accomplishment of the mission of Headquarters Command, Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces.\\" He served in the European theater for 33 months as a staff judge advocate in the headquarters of fellow Kansan, General Eisenhower. He was discharged January 14, 1946, as a lieutenant colonel and resumed practice with his Topeka law firm.

Page 1, August 19, 1956. Political life After World War II, Shaw served two terms as county attorney of Shawnee County before being elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in 1951. Shaw would go on to serve three terms representing Topeka, Kansas. In 1952, Shaw was a delegate to the Republican National Convention where Dwight Eisenhower was nominated for president. In 1956, Shaw challenged fellow Republican Governor Fred Hall in the primary. Time magazine in August 1956 assessed the situation this way: > Stunned by Hall's ax-wielding and pro-labor actions, they assessed the > situation silently, then began moving Kansas and earth to throw the upstart > out. Hall's right-to-work veto drew the wrath of the powerful Kansas City > Star; his purge of old friends in the State Civil Service Board brought > suspicious frowns; his meddling and muddling in legislative affairs (\\"I am > the governor\\") stirred deep resentment. When Hall called recalcitrant > legislators \\"s.o.b.s\\" to their faces during a bitter legislative rhubarb > early this year, the insulted lawmakers formed an \\"S.O.B. Club\\" to campaign > against him. Kansas did a belly laugh, and thin-skinned Fred Hall was the > victim. \\"Political Notes: Hall's Fall\\", Time magazine, August 20, 1956 Shaw won the 1956 Republican nomination but lost in the general election to Democrat George Docking. Hall's defeat in the primary set in motion the so-called \\"triple play of 1956\\". Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Smith, a strong supporter of Hall, was seriously ill and contemplating retirement. Smith was concerned that if he retired after Docking took office in January 1957, Docking would appoint a Democrat as Chief Justice. Smith and Hall devised a scheme to prevent this from happening. Chief Justice Smith resigned on December 31, 1956. Smith's resignation was quickly followed by Governor Hall's resignation on January 3, 1957. As a result of Hall's resignation, Lieutenant Governor McCuish was sworn in as Kansas Governor. The only official act of McCuish's 11-day tenure as governor was to appoint Hall as chief justice of the Kansas Supreme Court. Shaw had no role in this affair but these events did help usher in a merit system for selecting judges in Kansas. Post-political activities Shaw returned to practicing law with one of his former fraternity brothers, Wendell L. Garlinghouse. Garlinghouse had previously been an assistant attorney general in Kansas. In 1958-1959, he was president of the Topeka Bar Association.List of past presidents In the mid-1970s, Shaw was chairman of the state's American Bicentennial Commission.

Begun in 2006, it is dedicated to increasing stroke recognition and shortening the time between the onset of stroke symptoms and arrival at a hospital‚Äôs emergency department. \\"Time lost is brain lost\\" is a phrase often used in stroke prevention programs. Because quick treatment can help avoid death or permanent physical disability, the FAST campaign stresses the need for immediate action by calling 9-1-1. FAST teaches the signs and symptoms of stroke through its acronym, which stands for: Face, Arm, Speech, and Time. The highlight of the campaign is an award-winning, 3-minute animated video produced by Geovision. Accompanying the video are posters, brochures, wallet-sized cards, and Powerpoints. All of the items are available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese (with Khmer on the way). The PowerPoints are part of an education kit that is meant as a train-the-trainer module, and is also available in the three languages. A paid media campaign has accompanied the distribution of materials, and has included television, radio, print media, and transit cards on public transportation. To date, FAST materials have been used in 48 states and 28 countries, including Canada, Japan, and the Dominican Republic. Evaluation of campaign The Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention and Control Program has evaluated each of the media campaigns to demonstrate knowledge and awareness change concerning stroke signs and symptoms. Prior to running the initial media campaign in a specific language and after each subsequent campaign, a survey was administered to a random sample of Massachusetts adults. The validated survey questionnaire addresses stroke signs and symptoms knowledge, impetus to call 9-1-1 at any sign of a stroke, awareness of stroke advertising, as well as familiarity with the campaign and its terminology. These data have shown a significant increase in awareness and knowledge over time, confirming the effectiveness of the campaigns in Massachusetts. Awards The campaign video won the Silver Award for production at the 27th annual Telly Awards, which recognizes the \\"finest video and film productions\\". In 2008, two Gabriel Awards were given for \\"Community Awareness/PSA\\" for the Spanish-language version of the video. It has also been honoured with the 2009 Media Partnership Award from the Partnership for a Heart-Healthy Stroke-Free Massachusetts (PHHSFM) organization for the campaign's leadership in using the video to increase awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke.

The institute was established by architects in Dundee in 1884, and now represents a much wider geographic area than its name suggests. The current president is Colin Doig of Dunard Design. History The Dundee Institute of Architecture, Science and Art was established in 1884 on the proposal of Charles Ower, a specialist in domestic architecture. He suggested that a local organisation be formed along the lines of London's Architectural Association, \\"to afford facilities for the study of architecture, the applied sciences and the fine arts by means of papers and discussions; sectional meetings, classes for study; prizes; visits to public works and buildings or excursions for sketching; and such other means as the council may determine\\". In 1891 the institute became the second architectural society in Scotland to enter into an alliance with the Royal Institute of British Architects, giving recognition to Dundee as the centre for architectural education north of the River Tay. At the instigation and with the support of the institute, pupilage was initially supplemented by evening classes and by the 1920s, a School of Architecture was established. This was at the local Technical Institute before being moved to the new art college. In the 1930s, the Architect's Institute was involved in discussions concerning the proposed Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art. Once the college was established, the institute provided a representative on the board of governors and also provided teaching staff. The period after 1945 has been marked by the institute's continued interest in architectural education, providing a liaison between local architectural practices and the School of Architecture at the Duncan of Jordanstone College, University of Dundee.University of Dundee archives, http://www.dundee.ac.uk/archives/ms014.htm 2012 The chapter celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2009, when it hosted the 2009 RIAS Convention as part of its anniversary celebrations.The Chartered Architect, Summer 2009, pp.8‚Äì19 Its archives, covering the period 1884 to 1995, are held by Archive Services, University of Dundee. DIA Awards The DIA Awards are now in their third decade and have undergone a rapid growth, which has also seen a dramatic increase in the quality of the overall submissions. The annual Awards (held in November) are a key part of the strategy to promote architecture via education and engagement with the general public.

Early and private life Menthon was born in Montmirey-la-Ville in Jura. He was a son of an old noble family from Menthon-Saint-Bernard. He studied law in Dijon, where he joined Action catholique de la Jeunesse fran√ßaise (ACJF). He also studied in Paris. He was president of ACJF from 1927 to 1930, and was also the founder of the Jeunesse ouvri√®re chr√©tienne (JOC, a Christian working youth movement). He became a professor of political economy at the University of Nancy. He and his wife Nicole had six sons. Second World War He was mobilised at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, becoming a captain in the French Army. He was severely wounded and captured in June 1940. He spent three months in a hospital in Saint-Di√©, but escaped and joined the French Resistance in Haute Savoie in September 1940. Menthon received Jean Moulin several times at his family's seat at the Ch√¢teau de Menthon-Saint-Bernard. He founded the first resistance cell of the Libert√© Resistance movement in Annecy in November 1940, and a second one in Lyons shortly afterwards. He also edited the Libert√© underground newspaper, with the first two editions printed in Annecy and later ones in Marseilles. He was a leader in the Combat Resistance movement, created by the merger of Libert√© with Henri Frenay's Mouvement de Lib√©ration Nationale towards the end of 1941. Menthon was captured returning from a meeting with Frenay, and interrogated at Baumettes prison in Marseilles, but he was released. He left France in July 1943 to join General Charles de Gaulle in London, and followed him to Algiers where Menthon served as Commissioner of Justice in the Comit√© Fran√ßais de Lib√©ration Nationale (CFLNC) from September 1943 to September 1944. He later became a Companion of the Ordre de la Lib√©ration, and was also an Officier of the L√©gion d'Honneur and received the Croix de Guerre. Political career After the Liberation of France, Menthon was Minister of Justice in de Gaulle's Provisional Government of the French Republic from 10 September 1944 to 8 May 1945, and then became Attorney General of France. He led the Commission d'√âpuration to root out collaborators, and oversaw the trials of Marshal Philippe P√©tain and other members of the Vichy regime. He came under attack for the zeal with which the purge was prosecuted, and resigned. De Gaulle nominated him as the French lead prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. He gave his opening speech, defining a crime against humanity as: \\"crime contre le statut d'√™tre humain motiv√© par une id√©ologie qui est un crime contre l'esprit visant √† rejeter l'humanit√© dans la barbarie\\" (\\"crime against human laws, motivated by an ideology that is a crime against the spirit, returning humanity to barbarism\\"). He resigned in January 1946 to take up active politics and was replaced by Auguste Champetier de Ribes. Menthon was a founding member of the Mouvement R√©publicain Populaire (MRP). His political convictions were founded on humanistic and Christian principles. He served as a d√©put√© for Savoy in the French Assembl√©e Nationale from 1946 to 1958. He was Minister for the National Economy in Georges Bidault's first ministry, from 24 June to 16 December 1946. He was also involved in European politics, and was president of Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1952 to 1954 (known as the Consultative Assembly until 1974) and was involved in the discussions to choose the design for the Flag of Europe. His promising political career was shortened by disagreements with de Gaulle and he returned to his university career at the University of Nancy in 1958. He was mayor of Menthon-Saint-Bernard from 1945 to 1977, and served as chairman of the Association des maires et conseiller g√©n√©ral for 22 years. Menthon died in Menthon-Saint-Bernard, in Haute-Savoie.

It lies around north-east of Kirriemuir near the River South Esk. The lands of Inverquharity came to the Ogilvie family around 1420. The castle was first constructed as a rectangular tower in the 1440s, by Alexander Ogilvie, 2nd Lord Inverquharity. In the 16th century a wing was added to form a four-storey L-plan castle. In 1445 a dispute between Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity and the son of the Earl of Crawford from nearby Finavon Castle culminated in the Battle of Arbroath in which Ogilvy and the Earl were killed. In the late 18th century, the tower was sold by the 5th Ogilvy Baronet, and the wing demolished. The castle decayed until the 1960s, when it was restored and the wing rebuilt. The original 15th-century yett, or iron gate, is still in place. In 2014, a BBC documentary followed the sale of the castle from the owners who had restored and lived there for the previous 40 years. It sold in 2012 for ¬£611,000 and this category A listed building remains a private family home.

All of the genes code for cytochrome P450 enzymes in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway (biosynthesis of ecdysone from cholesterol). Ecdysteroids such as 20-hydroxyecdysone and ecdysone influence many of the morphological, physiological, biochemical changes that occur during molting in insects. Steroid hormones control many aspects of reproduction, development, and homeostasis in higher organisms. In arthropods, steroid hormones play equal or even more vital developmental roles, especially in controlling the patterns of gene expression between developmental stages. First elaborated by research groups led by Wieschaus and N√ºsslein-Volhard in the early 1980s, the name was coined to collectively name a series of Drosophila embryonic lethal mutations associated with defective exoskeleton formation. Early research showed that when one of the Halloween genes was mutated, fly embryos would die before the exoskeleton was created. Mutants in the halloween gene series include the spook, spookier, phantom (or phm), disembodied (or dib), shadow (or sad), and shade genes. Descriptions The spook gene (Cyp307a1) is expressed in the prothoracic gland, and in conjunction with the gene product of spookier (Cyp307a2), converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to Œî4-diketol. The phantom gene (Cyp306a1) encodes an encoding the microsomal 25-hydroxylase. Strong expression of phm is restricted to the prothoracic gland cells of the Drosophila larval ring gland. The gene product converts 2,22,25dE-ketodiol to 2,22dE-ketotriol. The disembodied gene (Cyp302a1) codes for a cytochrome P450 enzyme that adds a hydroxyl group to the carbon-22 position of 2,22,dE-ketotriol to make 2-deoxyecdysone. dib mutants are defective in producing their cuticle and have severe defects in morphological processes such as head involution, dorsal closure and gut development. The shadow gene (Cyp315a1) product produces ecdysone from 2-deoxyecdysone. The shade gene (Cyp314a1) codes for an Ecdysone 20-monooxygenase responsible for adding a hydroxyl group to the 20C-position of ecdysone to make 20-hydroxyecdysone, the final step in the biosynthetic pathway.

Roads access the Parador from four different sides of the island, and there is bus service both from the north and from the south. The hike to the summit from the hotel takes up to two hours. The hike from the south the Vilaflor village to the summit takes at least four to five hours.

During the early years of the Interregnum he was a Keeper of the Great Seal. He was also an active judge who presided at several high-profile trials. At the Restoration under a provision in the Indemnity and Oblivion Act he was forbidden from holding further public offices. Life Richard Keble was from Suffolk, of an old family settled at Old Newton. He was admitted a member of Gray's Inn, 7 August 1609. He called to the bar 14 July 1614, and became an ancient of the inn in 1632 and Lent Reader in 1639. He is first mentioned in George Croke's \\"Reports\\" in 1636. Parliament appointed him a judge in Wales in March 1647, and he became a serjeant-at-law in 1648. Cites: Life of Dr. Join Barwick, p. 153. During 1648 Keble was sent to Norwich to handle a mutiny. After the execution of Charles I in 1649 he was appointed the junior of the three Lord Commissioners (along with Bulstrode Whitelocke and John Lisle) who had the custody of the Great Seal, they each having a salary of ¬£1000 per annum.\\"A sharp discussion arose whether they should be called \\"Lords\\" Commissioners, the word \\"Lord\\" having become distasteful to some; but the opinion of the great majority [in Parliament] was, that to drop it would be derogatory to the authority of the parliament.!\\" With William Lenthall, acting as the Master of the Rolls, Keble and Whitelocke issued a set of working rules for the Court of Chancery, while further reform was being deliberated. Keble presided at two significant trials: that of John Lilburne the Leveller in October 1649, and that of the Presbyterian plotter Christopher Love in 1651. At Love's trial he declared that \\"whatsoever is not consonant to Scripture in the Law of England, is not the Law of England\\". Thomas Widdrington replaced him as Lord Commissioner in April 1654. The reasons were largely political, Keble having made enemies as a high court justice. Keble's salary was irregularly paid, and his petition for payment of what was owing, was presented in 1655, and still disregarded in 1658. Cites: Whitelock Memorials, pp. 240, 342, 380; Blomefield, Norfolk, i. 396; Public Record Commission, 5th Rep. App. ii. 271; Green, Cal. State Papers Dom. 1655-1668. At the Restoration Keble was excepted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act (under Section XLIII which forbade him from accepting a public office). His will, dated April 1673, was proved August 1684. Reputation In 1660 at the restoration of the monarchy it was alleged that, during the Interregnum, Keble had acted arbitrarily against Royalists and this was the reason he was excepted from the general pardon under the Indemnity and Oblivion Act. Hilkiah Bedford, a political opponent, called him \\"an insolent, mercenary pettifogger,\\" who without jury or evidence sent to the gallows any he suspected of royalism. The Lilburne and Love trials were typical of common law procedure. On the other hand, the Love trial, where Christopher Love's guilt was not seriously in doubt, has been described as a \\"demonstration of the republic's brute power dressed up as legal sovereignty\\". Edward Foss wrote that Keble apparently acted \\"with less unfairness and severity\\" than colleagues. A near contemporary and historian, Laurence Echard, in his History of England speaks of Keble as being then a man of \\"little practical experience\\".

The term Ispah might derive from the Persian word \\"ÿ≥ŸæÿßŸá\\" (sep√¢h), meaning \\"army\\" or \\"Sepoy\\". Thus, the rebellion is also known as the Persian Sepoy rebellion (Ê≥¢ÊñØÊàçÂÖµ‰πã‰∫Ç; B≈çsƒ´ Sh√πbƒ´ng zhƒ´ Lu√†n) in Chinese documents. Situation in Xinghua in 1362, during the rebellion Under Mongol Empire Yuan rule, more Semu people (Arab and Persian Muslims) migrated to the Chinese port city of Quanzhou. In 1357, a predominantly Muslim army led by two Quanzhou Muslims, Sayf ad-Din () and Amir ad-Din (), revolted against the Yuan. The rebel army seized control of Quanzhou, Putian, and even reached the provincial capital Fuzhou. In 1362, the Ispah army collapsed into internal conflict. In 1366, it was eventually crushed by the Han Chinese commander Chen Youding (ÈôàÂèãÂÆö) who was loyal to the Yuan dynasty., additional text. Historical background From the 13th century to the early 14th century in the Yuan dynasty, overseas trade was extremely prosperous in Fujian. As the starting point of the Maritime Silk Road, Quanzhou was the largest port in China's largest and possibly the world as well.‰ºäÊú¨„ÉªÁôΩÂõæÊ≥∞ÔºàËëóÔºâ„ÄÅÈ©¨ÈáëÈπèÔºàËØëÔºâÔºå„Ää‰ºäÊú¨„ÉªÁôΩÂõæÊ≥∞Ê∏∏ËÆ∞„ÄãÔºåÂÆÅÂ§è‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå2005Âπ¥ It was also the largest city in Fujian, with a population exceeding that of Fuzhou, Fujian's administrative center.ÂæêÊôìÊúõÔºåÁ¶èÂª∫ÈÄöÂè≤ÔºåÁ¶èÂª∫‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå2006Âπ¥ The Arabs called it \\"Tiger's claw\\", which has been used by merchants in Europe and elsewhere. At the time, Quanzhou's population exceeded 2 million, with a wall as long as 30 miles. Jinjiang's river and its harbor, with highly developed trade, had 10,000 ships docked.ÔºàÊÑèÔºâÈõÖÂêÑ„ÉªÂæ∑ÂÆâÁßëÁ∫≥ ÂéüËëó„ÄÅÔºàËã±ÔºâÂ°ûÂ∞îÊú¨ ÁºñËØë„ÄÅÔºàÊ≥âÂ∑ûÊµ∑‰∫§È¶ÜÔºâÊùéÁéâÊòÜ„ÄÅÈôà‰∏ΩÂçé„ÄÅÂè∂ÊÅ©ÂÖ∏ Áº©ÂÜôÔºå„ÄäÂÖâÊòé‰πãÂüé„ÄãÁº©ÂÜôÊú¨Ôºå‰∏≠ÂõΩÊ≥âÂ∑ûÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ Quanzhou exported luxuries such as silk, ceramics, copper, and iron, as well as satin, while imports include pearls, ivory, rhino horns, frankincense, etc. The most important imports were spices and herbs. Quanzhou had many foreign residents, such as Arabs, Persians, Europeans, Jews, Indians etc. Around 100 different languages were used. The Quanzhou people labeled these foreigners as Fan (Áï™). Due to the massive number of foreigners coming in, authorities initially did not want foreigners to stay and interfere with the locals' lifestyles. Quanzhou had large ethnic enclaves (\\"ËïÉÂùä\\", \\"ËïÉ‰∫∫Â∑∑\\"), with foreigners and natives often intermarrying and giving birth to mixed children (often labeled Half Southern Fan or \\"ÂçäÂçóËïÉ\\").ÁéãÂõõËææÔºåÂÆãÂÖÉÊ≥âÂ∑ûÂ§ñ‰æ®Á§æÂå∫ÁöÑÂÖ¥Ë°∞ÂèäÂÖ∂ÂêØÁ§∫Ôºå„Ää‰∏úÂçóÊñáÂåñ„Äã2008Âπ¥Á¨¨1Êúü Although foreigners and natives had some cultural intermingling, the foreigners still practiced and spread their own religions, such as Islam, Christianity, Manichaeism, Hinduism, etc. This religious and ethnic diversity made governance a challenging task.Ê≥âÂ∑ûÂ∏ÇÂú∞ÊñπÂøóÁºñÁ∫ÇÂßîÂëò‰ºöÔºå„ÄäÊ≥âÂ∑ûÂ∏ÇÂøó„ÄãÔºå‰∏≠ÂõΩÁ§æ‰ºöÁßëÂ≠¶Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå2000.5 The origin of the name \\"Ispah\\" There are multiple theories about the origin of the word \\"Ispah\\". Some think that \\"Ispah\\" originated from the Persian word \\"ÿ≥ŸæÿßŸá\\"(sep√¢h), which means militia, cavalry, or some derived version. It could also be the Persian equivalent of \\"mercenaries\\" or borrowed from the name of a city, Isfahan, given that most of the people came from that city. Others believe that Ispah is used for designating troops, instead of as an actual name. Sunni-Shiite tension In the early Yuan dynasty, the Mongols gave the Islamic Sunni Semu Pu Shougeng () family public support, since they helped rebel against the Song dynasty and establish the Yuan dynasty. As a result, this family became stronger and had more influence over politics and the economy. Sunni Muslims became more dominant in Quanzhou and excluded the Shiites, causing growing resentment among them. In 1282 (the 19th year of the Yuan dynasty), the Yuan dynasty stationed 3000 Shiite forces in Quanzhou, but even then there were still too few Shiites in Quanzhou.Âº†Âø†Âêõ„ÄÅÂÖ∞ÈôàÂ¶çÔºå‰πüËÆ∫ÂÖÉÊú´‰∫¶ÊÄùÂ∑¥Â•öÊàò‰π±ÁöÑÊÄßË¥®Ôºå„ÄäÈªî‰∏úÂçóÊ∞ëÊóèÂ∏àËåÉÈ´òÁ≠â‰∏ìÁßëÂ≠¶Ê†°Â≠¶Êä•„Äã2003Âπ¥Á¨¨21Âç∑Á¨¨5Êúü Near the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the government struggled to deal with various armed rebellions. The Quanzhou Shiite Persians organized the Ispah army to defend their ethnic group, which already had a large Persian population with growing strength. In March 1357, Sayf ad-Din and Amir ad-Din, the commanders of the Ispah army, seized the opportunity to control Quanzhou,„ÄäÂÖÉÂè≤„Äã¬∑Âç∑ÂõõÂçÅ‰∫î and suppressed the formerly dominant Sunni. The Ispah army became one of the strongest forces in Fujian. Massacre The soldiers slaughtered large numbers of Semu merchants. This in turn led to the massacre of all other Semu as it was hard to tell the difference between ethnicities. When the uprising was crushed and their graves desecrated, many were forced to flee Quanzhou. Mosques and other foreign architecture buildings were almost all destroyed. Some of the massacres and grave desecrations were reprisals against the descendants of Pu Shougeng, who had murdered the Emperor's relatives, defected and surrendered the cities to the Mongols during their invasion of the Song dynasty. In vengeance for Pu Shougeng's defection to the Yuan dynasty, the military carried out an extermination campaign that killed most of the descendants of Pu Shougeng with their corpses being horrifically mutilated. The few descendants who escaped changed their surnames to Wu (Âê≥) or Bo (Âçú).  Effects  In Quanzhou, many Han Chinese, Arab, Persian, Semu people intermarried and had mixed kids who practiced a diversity of faiths. However, after the rebellion, xenophobia increased, and mixed marriages started becoming taboo in the Yuan dynasty. Some Chinese men were even disowned for marrying foreign women. One such Chinese was Lin Nu, of the Han Chinese Lin family in Quanzhou.  Lin Nu  Lin Nu, son of Lin Lu, traveled to Hormuz in Persia in 1376, married a Persian or an Arab girl, and brought her back to Quanzhou. Lin Nu and his descendants were erased from the family genealogy. His relatives were angry at him for converting to Islam and marrying a Persian girl. Xenophobia was strong at that time due to Persian Semu atrocities, the Yuan quelling of the in the Ispah Rebellion, and the massacre of Semu. The Chinese Lin family felt ashamed so they changed their surname from Lin to Li to avoid associating with their relatives, Lin Nu and his Persian wife's mixed descendants who practiced Islam.K√ºhner, Hans. ‚Äú‚ÄòThe Barbarians' Writing Is like Worms, and Their Speech Is like the Screeching of Owls‚Äô - Exclusion and Acculturation in the Early Ming Period.‚Äù Zeitschrift Der Deutschen Morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft, vol. 151, no. 2, 2001, pp. 407‚Äì429.

The Foundation thus permanently commemorates the bicentennial of the Constitution and honors James Madison, fourth President of the United States and generally acknowledged \\"Father of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\\" History As part of the bicentennial celebration of the U.S. Constitution, the Education Committee of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, chaired by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, proposed the creation of a fellowship program for the purpose of improving teaching about the Constitution in secondary schools. Senator Kennedy and several other Senate colleagues successfully passed the law which created the Foundation. Public Law 99-591 establishing the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation was signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 30, 1986. Public Law 99-591 The primary function of the Foundation is to administer a fellowship program encouraging graduate study of the U.S. Constitution. The Foundation is governed by a thirteen- member Board of trustees appointed to six year terms by the President. President Reagan appointed the first members of the Board of Trustees in 1988. In November of that same year, the Board of Trustees elected Senator Edward M. Kennedy as the first Chairman of the Board for the Foundation and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Treasurer. In 1990, the Board of Trustees named retired Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, Admiral Paul A. Yost Jr. as the first president of the James Madison Memorial Foundation. The Foundation awarded its inaugural class of 48 James Madison Fellows in 1992. The James Madison Foundation continues to conduct yearly nationwide competitions for the award of James Madison Fellowships. Generally, one Fellowship per state is awarded each year as funding is available. Upon receiving their master's degree, James Madison Fellows complete a teaching obligation to fulfill the requirements of their fellowship. The Foundation operates from an endowment, initially funded by the federal government. The Foundation receives donations from private citizens, corporations, and foundations to expand the fellowship program throughout the nation. Governance The Foundation has a Board of Trustees made up of thirteen members. Twelve members are appointed for six-year terms by the President of the United States. The law specifies that two members of the Senate, two members of the House of Representatives, two members of the federal judiciary, one governor, two members of the general public, and three members from the academic community serve on the board. The Secretary of Education serves as an ex-officio member. With the exception of the federal judges and the Secretary of Education, the board is evenly divided between political parties.Public Law 99-591 Title VIII, Sect. 803 In 2009, Senator John Cornyn, of Texas, was elected Chairman of the Board of Trustees to replace Senator Kennedy who had recently died. Daily operations of the Foundation are directed by a president and a small staff. In 2010, Lewis F. Larsen was appointed President of the Foundation, replacing Paul A. Yost Jr., who retired as President after serving since 1990. The Foundation's office is located in Alexandria, Virginia.

History Baruth Castle in the 19th century, seat of the Solms-Baruth family The House of Solms had its origins at Solms, Hesse, and ruled several of the many minor states of the Holy Roman Empire. These lost their independence in the German Mediatization of 1806. In 1537 Philip, Count of Solms-Lich, ruling count at Lich, purchased the Herrschaft Sonnewalde in Lower Lusatia which he left to his younger son Otto of Solms-Laubach (1496‚Äì1522), together with the county of Laubach. While Lich and Laubach were counties with imperial immediacy, Sonnewalde remained a semi-independent state country within the March of Lusatia (the latter being an immediate state of the Holy Roman Empire). A later Count Otto (1550‚Äì1612) moved to Sonnewalde and built the castle in 1582. In 1596 he also purchased the nearby Herrschaft of Baruth which was also elevated to a state country within the March of Lusatia. The branch then was divided into the twigs of Solms-Laubach, Solms-Sonnewalde and Solms-Baruth. Later the Baruth branch also purchased the estates of Gol√üen and Casel in the March of Lusatia and, in 1767, Kliczk√≥w Castle (Klitschdorf) in Silesia which became their main seat. They owned Baruth and the other estates from 1615 to 1945 (when they were expropriated in communist East Germany), including the manor houses, ten villages and about 15,000 hectares of agriculture and forestry land. In 1635, the March passed from the Kingdom of Bohemia to the Electorate of Saxony which in 1806 became the Kingdom of Saxony, with the counts of Solms-Baruth occupying a hereditary seat in the Saxonian Landtag. In 1815, when Saxony was punished at the Congress of Vienna for its loyalty to Napoleon by the confiscation of a significant part of its territory, the March of Lusatia, including Solms-Baruth, was transferred to the Kingdom of Prussia. The Prussian representative at the Congress was Prince Karl August von Hardenberg and his assistant, Count of Solms-Sonnewalde. The Counts of Solms-Baruth were granted a seat in the Prussian House of Lords, until the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919. Count Friedrich zu Solms-Baruth (1821‚Äì1904) was elevated to the hereditary rank of a F√ºrst (Prince) by the King of Prussia in 1888.

Current designs of seismic metamaterials utilize configurations of boreholes, trees or proposed underground resonators to act as a large scale material. Experiments have observed both reflections and bandgap attenuation from artificially induced seismic waves. These are the first experiments to verify that seismic metamaterials can be measured for frequencies below 100 Hz, where damage from Rayleigh waves is the most harmful to artificial structures. The mechanics of seismic waves More than a million earthquakes are recorded each year, by a worldwide system of earthquake detection stations. The propagation velocity of the seismic waves depends on density and elasticity of the earth materials. In other words, the speeds of the seismic waves vary as they travel through different materials in the earth. The two main components of a seismic event are body waves and surface waves. Both of these have different modes of wave propagation. Towards Seismic Cloaking Computations showed that seismic waves traveling toward a building, could be directed around the building, leaving the building unscathed, by using seismic metamaterials. The very long wavelengths of earthquake waves would be shortened as they interact with the metamaterials; the waves would pass around the building so as to arrive in phase as the earthquake wave proceeded, as if the building was not there. The mathematical models produce the regular pattern provided by Metamaterial cloaking. This method was first understood with electromagnetic cloaking metamaterials - the electromagnetic energy is in effect directed around an object, or hole, and protecting buildings from seismic waves employs this same principle. Giant polymer-made split ring resonators combined with other metamaterials are designed to couple at the seismic wavelength. Concentric layers of this material would be stacked, each layer separated by an elastic medium. The design that worked is ten layers of six different materials, which can be easily deployed in building foundations. As of 2009, the project is still in the design stage. Electromagnetics cloaking principles for seismic metamaterials For seismic metamaterials to protect surface structures, the proposal includes a layered structure of metamaterials, separated by elastic plates in a cylindrical configuration. A prior simulation showed that it is possible to create concealment from electromagnetic radiation with concentric, alternating layers of electromagnetic metamaterials. That study was is in contrast to concealment by inclusions in a split ring resonator designed as an anisotropic metamaterial. The configuration can be viewed as alternating layers of \\"homogeneous isotropic dielectric material\\" A. with \\"homogeneous isotropic dielectric material\\" B. Each dielectric material is much thinner than the radiated wavelength. As a whole, such structure is an anisotropic medium. The layered dielectric materials surround an \\"infinite conducting cylinder\\". The layered dielectric materials radiate outward, in a concentric fashion, and the cylinder is encased in the first layer. The other layers alternate and surround the previous layer all the way to the first layer. Electromagnetic wave scattering was calculated and simulated for the layered (metamaterial) structure and the split-ring resonator anistropic metamaterial, to show the effectiveness of the layered metamaterial. Acoustic cloaking principles for seismic metamaterials The theory and ultimate development for the seismic metamaterial is based on coordinate transformations achieved when concealing a small cylindrical object with electromagnetic waves. This was followed by an analysis of acoustic cloaking, and whether or not coordinate transformations could be applied to artificially fabricated acoustic materials. Applying the concepts used to understand electromagnetic materials to material properties in other systems shows them to be closely analogous. Wave vector, wave impedance, and direction of power flow are universal. By understanding how permittivity and permeability control these components of wave propagation, applicable analogies can be used for other material interactions. In most instances, applying coordinate transformation to engineered artificial elastic media is not possible. However, there is at least one special case where there is a direct equivalence between electromagnetics and elastodynamics. Furthermore, this case appears practically useful. In two dimensions, isotropic acoustic media and isotropic electromagnetic media are exactly equivalent. Under these conditions, the isotropic characteristic works in anisotropic media as well. It has been demonstrated mathematically that the 2D Maxwell equations with normal incidence apply to 2D acoustic equations when replacing the electromagnetic parameters with the following acoustic parameters: pressure, vector fluid velocity, fluid mass density and the fluid bulk modulus. The compressional wave solutions used in the electromagnetic cloaking are transferred to material fluidic solutions where fluid motion is parallel to the wavevector. The computations then show that coordinate transformations can be applied to acoustic media when restricted to normal incidence in two dimensions. Next the electromagnetic cloaking shell is referenced as an exact equivalence for a simulated demonstration of the acoustic cloaking shell. Bulk modulus and mass density determine the spatial dimensions of the cloak, which can bend any incident wave around the center of the shell. In a simulation with perfect conditions, because it is easier to demonstrate the principles involved, there is zero scattering in any direction. The seismic cloak However, it can be demonstrated through computation and visual simulation that the waves are in fact dispersed around the location of the building. The frequency range of this capability is shown to have no limitation regarding the radiated frequency. The cloak itself demonstrates no forward or back scattering, hence, the seismic cloak becomes an effective medium.

As critic and music editor at the Los Angeles Times from 1970 to 2005, his reviews, essays and profiles appeared in publications around the world. Hilburn has since written a memoir and best-selling biographies of Johnny Cash and Paul Simon. He was a member of the nominating committee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for more than 20 years and lives in Los Angeles. Early life Born in Natchitoches, Louisiana, and lived there until he was 5 mostly on his grandfather‚Äôs cotton farm in nearby Campti. During those years and when visiting his grandparents in later summers, he was exposed to the blues and country music styles that eventually gave birth to rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll. After a few years in Dallas, Texas, he moved with his family to Southern California, where he graduated from Reseda High School in 1957 and California State University, Northridge (journalism degree) in 1961. He worked as a news reporter on a suburban Los Angeles newspaper (the Valley Times TODAY) for two years, but tired of journalism and became a public information officer for the Los Angeles Unified School District in the mid-1960s. While there he began to miss writing around the same time he fell in love with the work of Bob Dylan and the Beatles. Eager to write about music, Hilburn did a series of freelance pieces on such figures as Johnny Cash and Janis Joplin for the Los Angeles Times before being hired full-time by the paper. The Los Angeles Times Hilburn began writing at the Los Angeles Times in 1966, replacing Pete Johnson as rock critic in 1970. While at the Times, Hilburn accompanied several artists on landmark tours, including Johnny Cash for his celebrated Folsom Prison concert, Elton John's inaugural visit to Russia, Paul Simon's ‚ÄúGraceland‚Äù tour stop in Zimbabwe, and Bob Dylan's first concert swing through Israel. He spent a week on the road with the Sex Pistols during the British band's first U.S. tour. At the Times, Hilburn wrote about the new pop culture movements of punk, techno and rap. He also wrote extensively about many major figures of pop-rock, including numerous significant interviews with Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, and U2. Hilburn, too, has been widely credited with helping launch or advance the careers of Elton John, John Prine, Patti Smith, The Eagles, Tom Petty, Prince, Elvis Costello, Guns N' Roses, Rage Against the Machine, Nine Inch Nails, Ice Cube, Public Enemy, Eminem, The White Stripes, Arcade Fire, and X. Other work In 1985, Hilburn published a Bruce Springsteen biography as one in a series of Rolling Stone Press books. He released ‚ÄúCorn Flakes with John Lennon‚Äù focusing on the work and influence of John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Phil Spector, Michael Jackson, U2, Kurt Cobain and N.W.A. In 2013, Hilburn published a biography of Johnny Cash titled Johnny Cash: The Life. Michiko Kakutani, the chief book critic of the New York Times, named the biography as one of her 10 favorite books of the year. Kirkus called it, \\"an instant-classic music biography with something to offer all generations of listeners.\\" Five years later, Hilburn published a biography of Paul Simon titled Paul Simon: The Life. . Author Stephen King praised the book as one of the few works that offered insight into \\"the creative development of a gifted artist.\\" Rolling Stone declared the book \\"epic\\" and \\"definitive\\".

Development The FP-505 was designed by Fisher Aircraft in the United States in 1984 and was intended to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, with the category's maximum empty weight. The 505's standard empty weight is when equipped with a two- stroke Rotax 277 engine. The design goal was to provide a nostalgic 1930s-style parasol similar in configuration to the Pietenpol Air Camper or Heath Parasol that would be easy to fly, with a high wing and an open cockpit. The construction of the FP-505 is of wood, with the fuselage built from wood strips arranged in a geodesic form, resulting in a very strong and light aircraft with redundant load paths. The wings, tail and fuselage are covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wings are strut-braced with both jury struts and cabane struts. The aircraft has no flaps. The conventional-configuration landing gear is bungee suspended. The company claims it takes an amateur builder 500 hours to build the FP-505. Early versions of the FP-505 were equipped with the Rotax 277, and the aircraft reportedly flies well on that minimum power. Since the Rotax 277 is no longer in production, the Hirth F-33 is specified along with the Rotax 447 and Rotax 503 engines. By late 2011 over 45 FP-505s were flying.

The rating was introduced by Samuel Pepys in 1676 and the recipient received ¬£24 a year and a letter from the crown which virtually guaranteed him promotion after the spending two years at sea and passing the examination for lieutenant. The letter instructed the admirals and captains that the bearer was to be shown \\"such kindness as you shall judge fit for a gentleman, both in accommodating him in your ship and in furthering his improvement\\". Volunteers-per-order took the place of a midshipman on board the ship, which originally was a post for an experienced seaman. Because of their higher social class and the aforementioned letter, they were nicknamed King's Letter boys to distinguish them from rest of the crew. Another method of entry into the Royal Navy was serving as a servant to one of the officers, and by 1732 the last volunteer- per-order entered the navy to be replaced by service as a servant, or attending the new Royal Naval Academy.

Early Life She was born on August 5th, 1861 in Belleville, Illinois. Her parents died when Mary was 3, along with all three of her siblings due to Tuberculosis, which forced her to live with her grandmother and aunts in Baltimore, Maryland. She was the second oldest daughter of Henry Richmond, a carriage blacksmith, and Lavinia Harris Richmond, the daughter of a prominent Baltimore, Maryland, jeweler and real estate broker. Richmond was then raised by her widowed maternal grandmother, Mehitable Harris, and two aunts. Her grandmother was an active women's suffragist who was well known for being a spiritualist and a radical. She grew up being constantly surrounded by discussions of suffrage, political and social beliefs, and spiritualism. This meant she was handed down good critical thinking skills and a caring attitude toward the poor, needy and disabled. Her grandmother taught the important topics of inequality, suffrage, racial problems, spiritualism, and a variety of liberal, social, and political beliefs. Richmond was home schooled until the age of eleven, and then entered a public school. She had to be home schooled because her grandmother didn't believe in the traditional education system. While home schooled, Mary dedicated herself to reading as much as she could and was mostly self-taught through her dedication to learn. Being around such strong intelligent women, Richmond was actually quite shy and liked to be by herself. She graduated in 1878 from Baltimore Eastern Female High School, at the age of sixteen. She then went to live with one of her aunts in New York City. However, when her aunt became very ill, she left Mary alone in poverty. After living in poverty for two years in New York she returned to Baltimore and worked for several years as a bookkeeper, and became extremely involved with the Unitarian Church. In 1888, she applied for a job as Assistant Treasurer with the Charity Organization Society (COS). This organization was in several cities, and was the first organization to develop a structured social work profession which provided services to the poor, disabled, and needy. Her involvement in this organization led to her contributions in social work. Mary was active in social work until her death in September 1928. Contributions to Social Work Mary Richmond increased the public's awareness of the Charity Organization Society and the philanthropic opportunities to support social work. She was trained to be a \\"friendly visitor,\\" which was the initial term for a caseworker. She visited the homes of people in need and tried to help them improve their life situation. She began to develop many ideas of how casework could best be conducted to help those in need. During the time Richmond was connected to the Charity Organized Society, she demonstrated her qualities as a leader, teacher, and practical theorist. In 1900, she became general secretary of the Philadelphia Society of Organizing Charity. Mary remained in this position for nine years, in that time she advocated for legislation reform concerning compulsory education, child labor, and spousal desertion and nonsupport. In addition, Mary believed the government should create a children's bureau and juvenile court system. In 1909 she helped establish networks of social workers and a method by which they did their work.This all started when she became the director of the Charity Organizational Department of the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City. While director, Mary worked to improve record keeping, improved training for caseworkers, and helped implement new social works programs. Mary believed a firm cooperation between social workers, educators and the health care system was crucial to successfully helping those in need. Her career took off from charity organization leadership in Baltimore and Philadelphia to an executive position with the prestigious Russell Sage Foundation in New York City. The social workers she worked with at the Russell Sage Foundation were among the first enabled to develop methods and systems for helping needy families. Her success and leadership at developing social work and research encouraged many other organizations to continue financial support and development of the practice of social work. Mary believed social welfare was a civic responsibility and many of her theories on social work were adopted for use in Asia, South America and Europe. Some of the most notable contributions Mary Richmond gave was that she fought to obtain legislation for deserted wives and founded the Pennsylvania Child Labor Committee, the Public Charities Associated, the juvenile court, and the Housing Association. A huge part of her work was dedicated to research in the field of social work, which is shown by her instructions on how to gather information, interview methodologies, establishing contact and conducting conversations. By making this, she became a great factor in the profession of social work, Mary Richmond showed the importance of the education of the social work field. Richmond identified six sources of power that are available to clients and their social workers: sources within the household, in the person of the client, in the neighborhood and wider social networks, in civil agencies, in private and public agencies. Mary Richmond never married or had any children, and died in New York City in 1928 due to cancer.  Publications  Some books she published with her ideas: Friendly Visiting among the Poor, Social Diagnosis and What is Social Case Work. Within these books she demonstrated her understanding of social casework. She believed in the relationship between people and their social environment as the major factor of their life situation or status. Her ideas were based on social theory and that social problems for a family or individual should be looked at by first looking at the individual or family, then including their closest social ties such as families, schools, churches, jobs, etc. After looking at these factors the community and government should be looked at. This will dictate the norms for the person to help determine how to help the person make adjustments to improve their situation. Richmond focused on the strengths of the person rather than blaming them for the bad. Her focus was mostly on children, medical social work, and families. All of her ideas are now the basis for social work education today. She also had an influence in the history of social welfare from her research and study Nine Hundred Eighty-five Widows, which looked at families, their work situations, the financial resources of widows and how widows were treated by social welfare systems.

Gleave, Manchester, UK page 31 Narrative In the Gospels of Mark and Luke, this episode takes place after Jesus had been preaching at the synagogue of Capernaum. Jesus goes to Peter's house, where he sees the mother of Peter's wife lying in bed with a high fever. Jesus touches her hand and the fever leaves her, and she gets up and begins to wait on him. In Matthew's gospel the event is the third in a series of healings recorded in chapter 8 which take place following Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. Commentary Peter's wife‚Äôs mother was sick with fever.

He was a student of Haghani Circle and received a master's degree in International law after studying abroad for several years. Career Before Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005, Moslehi served as the representative of Ayatollah Khamenei to the Basij. Then new president Ahmadinejad appointed him as his adviser for clerical affairs. He was later appointed by Khamenei to be the head of the Organization for Islamic Endowments. Moslehi was originally appointed minister of intelligence on 5 August 2009. However, he resigned from his position on 17 April 2011 after being asked to resign by Ahmedinejad. The New York Times reported on speculation that Moslehi's resignation was prompted by a dispute with Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, after Moslehi tried to dismiss an intelligence official. Moslehi was reinstated in his position by the supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei. Ahmadinejad decided to not hold cabinet meetings in protest of Moslehi's presence. As of April 2011, cabinet meetings were being held without Ahmadinejad, with the vice president of Iran, Mohammad-Reza Rahimi, chairing the meetings. On 27 April, the parliament endorsed Moslehi in his position as minister of intelligence. Moslehi was sanctioned by both the United States (on 29 September 2010) and European Union (in October 2011). The US sanctioned him due to his alleged connections in human rights abuses in the Evin prison. The reason for the EU sanctions is his orders of the arbitrary detentions and persecution of opposition figures in the country.

The P.C. has been providing the leading Asian Pacific American (APA) news to the community since its inception in 1929. The newspaper is published by the Japanese American Citizens League, JACL, which is the nation‚Äôs oldest and largest APA civil rights organization. World War II coverage Founded over 80 years ago, the P.C. was initially called , meaning Japanese American Citizen. The publication was based in San Francisco, California. The publication‚Äôs name was officially changed to Pacific Citizen in 1931, chosen in a national contest. When World War II broke out, 120,000 Japanese Americans were interned. To keep the publication running smoothly, the newspaper was moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. In Utah, editor Larry Tajiri was hired to run the then-weekly newspaper. The print newspaper evolved into a reputable news source under the leadership of Tajiri. Coverage during World War II included the chronicling of everyday life at the camps and the heroism of the Nisei (second generation Japanese American) soldiers. The Friends of the American Way nominated the P.C. for a Pulitzer Prize in 1946 for its journalism coverage. At war‚Äôs end in the early 1950s the P.C. returned to the West Coast to Los Angeles, California. On September 27, 1952 Tajiri put together his last P.C. newspaper as editor. Redress coverage Former Shin Nichibei staffer Harry K. Honda became editor when the newspaper moved to Los Angeles. Since its inception, the P.C. has been the meeting place for many well-known Japanese American journalists and community leaders like Bill Hosokawa, Togo Tanaka, Mike Masaoka, Bill Marutani and Saburo Kido. The P.C. also covered the Redress Movement, which sought to give reparations to Japanese Americans, who were interned during World War II. The P.C. was there in the room when President Ronald Reagan signed the Redress bill granting Japanese Americans who were affected by the World War II internment an official apology letter and monetary compensation. Today‚Äôs coverage Today, the P.C. covers national news affecting the Asian Pacific American community. Coverage in the past years included exclusive interviews with 1st Lt. Ehren Watada, who in June 2006, refused to deploy to Iraq for his unit's assigned rotation to Operation Iraqi Freedom citing the legality of the war. The newspaper has also focused on civil rights issues, including same-sex marriages in California and beyond. The P.C. Web site has generated over 450,000 hits per month since its launch in 2005. The P.C.‚Äôs Web site provides exclusive content and articles that are not found in the print edition. Currently, P.C. subscribers and JACL members can access an exclusive section of the PacificCitizen.org through the ‚ÄúMyP.C.‚Äù section.

The Klan was active in the areas of Trenton and Camden and it also had a presence in several of the state's northern counties in the 1920s. It had the most members in Monmouth County, and operated a resort in Wall Township. History The first local chapter of the KKK in New Jersey was organized in 1921, after units had started in New York and Pennsylvania. Arthur Hornbui Bell was the state's first Grand Dragon, and continued serving in that post until the Ku Klux Klan was disbanded in 1944. As early as 1922, the New Jersey Klan protested Paterson, New Jersey's honored burial of the Roman Catholic priest William N. McNulty, which closed schools during his funeral. They argued that it was a breach of the U.S. legal doctrine of separation of church and state. Mayor Frank J. Van Noort ordered the honors for the respected dean of a major church. In 1922 George W. Apgar was the King Kleagle, with state headquarters just outside Newark. In 1923, the Klan provided funding to the Pillar of Fire Church to found Alma White College in Zarephath, New Jersey. It became \\"the second institution in the north avowedly run by the Ku Klux Klan to further its aims and principles.\\" Alma White said that the Klan philosophy \\"will sweep through the intellectual student classes as through the masses of the people.\\" At that time, the Pillar of Fire was publishing the pro-KKK monthly periodical The Good Citizen. On May 3, 1923, around 12,000 people attended a Klan meeting in Bound Brook, New Jersey. The speakers held a meeting at the Pillar of Fire headquarters in nearby Zarephath where a crowd of angry locals surrounded the church to let them know that they were not welcome. On May 10, 1923 the Klan assaulted a boy, accusing him of stealing $50 from his mother, Bessie Titus, in West Belmar, New Jersey. On August 24, 1923 the Klan held a large meeting in a ten- acre field off the Freehold Turnpike in western Farmingdale, New Jersey. The Klan claimed to have drawn members from Monmouth, Middlesex and Ocean counties and inducted 1,700 members. 1,200 cars were said to have parked along roadways, in driveways, and in every available spot. Arthur Hornbui Bell opened the meeting before introducing the principal speaker, dubbed Colonel Sherman of Atlanta, Georgia. Several inductees from Keyport, New Jersey were escorted to the event by Klansmen from that borough. In 1925 Alma White published The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy in Zarephath at the Pillar of Fire Church printing press. She writes: \\"The unrepentant Hebrew is everywhere among us today as the strong ally of Roman Catholicism. ... To think of our Hebrew friends with their millions in gold and silver aiding the Pope in his aspirations for world supremacy, is almost beyond the grasp of ... The Jews in New York City openly boast that they have the money and Rome the power, and that if they decide to rule the city and state, ...\\" In 1926, Arthur Hornbui Bell headed a group that converted the former Marconi Station in Wall Township into a Klan resort. (The property was subsequently acquired by The King's College, a divinity school, and later became Camp Evans.). The resort was open only to officials and members of the New Jersey Realm of the Klan. In May 1926, birth control advocate and Planned Parenthood progenitor Margaret Sanger once spoke to a meeting of the women's chapter of the Klan in Silver Lake, New Jersey. Sanger wrote in her 1938 autobiography that the speech was \\"one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing.\\" The New Jersey Ku Klux Klan held a Fourth of July celebration from July 3‚Äì5, 1926, in Long Branch, New Jersey, that featured a \\"Miss 100% America\\" pageant. In 1926 Alma White published Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty. She writes: \\"I believe in white supremacy.\\" In 1928 Alma White published Heroes of the Fiery Cross. She writes: \\"The Jews are as unrelenting now as they were two thousand years ago.\\" In 1940, James A. Colescott had Bell removed as head of the Klan in New Jersey. Bell was also vice president of the German American Bund. Bell's ouster was ordered after he arranged a joint meeting between the Klan and the German American Bund at the Bund's Camp Nordlund, near Andover, New Jersey. In 1943 Alma White of the Pillar of Fire Church reprinted her pro-Klan essays and sermons as Guardians of Liberty. By 1944 the national organization was closed by a tax lien by the Internal Revenue Service. Local chapters closed over the following years.

Preliminary construction began in 2008 and construction on the dam superstructure and power station began in 2010. The dams first generator was operational in December 2012, the third by May 2013. The fifth and final generator was commissioned on 9 June 2014. Background The dam section is a transverse valley with a water surface 60 to 150 m wide and low water level of 1048 m. The landforms on both banks are basically symmetrical. There is a measurement of about 50 m wide tableland and about 30 degrees above water surface in the left bank, and the slope in the right bank is about 27 degree and the slope above the elevation of 1500 m is about 48 degree. There is poor sand and soil materials and abundant limestone material satisfied with requirement of quality and reserves within 20 km in the dam area, which is qualified for setting up low dam according to existing geological data. In the light of topographic and geological conditions, the Ahai Dam section can be considered as local material dam type with low height of swell, suitable for connection of backwater with Liyuan cascade. The dam has normal water level of 1514 m, total reservoir capacity of 1.08 billion cubic meters and installed capacity of 2,000,000-2,200,000 kW. Now, a low-cost road to Niukexu has been opened to traffic, and there is only an about 5 km long path to the dam section.lijiang.com.cn/english/investment/water Environmental impact This project marked the first time representatives from Chinese environmental groups were invited to participate in the environmental impact assessment for a major hydropower project in China, according to the First Financial Daily.

DNASTAR develops and sells software for sequence analysis in the fields of genomics, molecular biology, and structural biology. Software DNASTAR software (Lasergene) first gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s for its sequence assembly and analysis capabilities of Sanger sequencing data. Lasergene 15.2 was released in June 2018. DNASTAR software is available for desktop computers running Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux as well as for use on Amazon Web Services. In 2007, DNASTAR expanded their offerings to include software for next-generation sequencing and structural biology. DNASTAR's next-gen software supports data from Illumina, Ion Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences and allows the user to assemble, align, analyze and visualize genomic data. Lasergene's use in next- generation sequence assembly and analysis was contributed as a chapter, written by company scientists, to the 2008 book Next Generation Genome Sequencing edited by Michael Janitz. DNASTAR software is utilized by pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, and clinical researchers in more than 90 countries. Reviews Writing in The Scientist, David R. Smith gave positive reviews to several bioinformatics software packages including DNAstar, but said that his bioinformatics skills plateaued and the licensing and upgrading costs were a significant proportion of his lab's operating budget.The Scientist, September 2, 2014 http://www.the- scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40916/title/Opinion--Bioinformatics- Software--A-Buyer-s-Guide/ Accolades In 2007, DNASTAR was awarded a Reader's Choice Gold Award by Scientific Computing Magazine for the Lasergene sequence analysis software. The 2008 book Inventing Entrepreneurs: Technology Innovators and their Entrepreneurial Journey by Gerard George and Adam J. Bock includes DNASTAR as an example of an innovative and entrepreneurial success story. A research study by BMC Genomics in 2010 determined that SeqMan (DNASTAR's next-gen sequence assembly application) assemblies performed best, with more novel sequences and better recapitulation of transcripts. Another BMC Genomics study in 2011 determined that the best overall contig performance resulted from a SeqMan NGen assembly.

Early in development the choroidal fissure is a groove that extends along the ventral aspect of the optic stalk. In effect, it is a continuation of the invagination that forms the optic cup during early development in amniotes. For a period of time this groove extends to the closing lips of the optic cup. During development it is through the choroidal fissure that the retinal vessels enter and leave the eye. While optic neural components (e.g. axons arising from retinal ganglion cells in the sensory retina) do not lie in the groove that is the choroidal fissure, they do extend through the portions of the optic stalk that form the walls of the fissure. These axons will form the optic nerve. The fissure is eventually sealed when the lips of the optic cup, as well as the edges of the groove in the optic stalk, fuse.

Overview The concept of the book as taught by the Dalai Lama is that human beings each possess the ability to achieve happiness and a meaningful life, but the key to attaining that goal is self-knowledge. He teaches how to avoid the common negative notions of self and perspective on life and how to see the world from a more loving, human viewpoint. Using personal experiences and anecdotes, the Dalai Lama explains the idea that combining meditative concentration and love, true enlightenment is attained and is the key to happiness. He concludes the book, saying, \\"Even though it is necessary in the beginning to have a strong will in order to develop love and compassion, will is not sufficient to develop these altruistic attitudes limitlessly. It is important to join the practice of love and compassion with the practice of insight. Even if you seek to help someone out of concern, without insight you cannot be very clear about what benefit will come of your efforts. A combination is needed: a good human heart as well as a good human brain.

It is currently being used on the Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile (NSM) for the Royal Norwegian Navy and the updated MM-40 Exocet Block 3 anti-ship missile. There are several differences between the TRI-40 and the older TRI-60 engines. One is that the -40 uses a 4-stage compressor rather than the 3 stage compressor that the original TRI-60 models use (although several newer variants of the TRI-60 use a 4-stage compressor as well). Another major difference is that the bearing system is lubricated by fuel rather than a separate oil system. Finally, the engine is much more \\"electric\\" than the TRI-60.

He acted as tutor in French and Hebrew to the future Elizabeth I of England. Life He was born on 16 March 1523 at Montchamps, near Vire in Normandy. He studied Hebrew under Francis Vatablus at Paris, and became a Protestant. He came to England in Edward VI's reign, about 1548; and was entertained first by Paul Fagius and Martin Bucer and afterwards by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, with whom he stayed for more than a year. Subsequently he settled at Cambridge, where he gave free lectures in Hebrew, and lodged with Emanuel Tremellius, the Hebrew professor. He was pensioned by Cranmer and Thomas Goodrich, bishop of Ely, and married Elizabeth de Grimecieux, Tremellius's stepdaughter, on 1 December 1550. His eldest child, Emanuel, was born at Cambridge on 8 September 1551. Cranmer recommended Chevallier to the king's notice, and he was granted letters of denization and the reversion to the next vacant prebend at Canterbury. He was the \\"Mr. Anthony\\" who taught the Princess Elizabeth French.http://kaali.linguist.jussieu.fr/HEL_public_domain/HEL_16_2/HEL_16_2_pp095-119.pdf p.7. On Edward VI's death in 1553 Chevallier left for Strasbourg, where he was appointed Hebrew professor in 1559, but moved in the same year to Geneva and confirmed his intimacy with John Calvin, whose acquaintance he had made before 1554 Ultimately he settled at Caen, and in 1568 revisited England to solicit Queen Elizabeth's aid for the French Huguenots. He was in no hurry to return to Normandy, agreed to become Hebrew lecturer at St Paul's Cathedral, and in May 1569 received, at the suggestion of Matthew Parker and Edmund Grindal, the appointment of Regius Professor of Hebrew in the University of Cambridge. He matriculated on 3 August 1569, and on 5 September complained to Parker that his stipend as professor had been reduced. John Drusius and Hugh Broughton were his pupils. Chevallier became a prebendary of Canterbury in 1570, and on 24 March 1572 received leave of absence from Canterbury for two years without prejudice to his emoluments. At the time of the St. Bartholomew's massacre in Paris he escaped to Guernsey, intending to return to England, but died there in October of the same year. Works Chevalier's main writings were first published in Bryan Walton's Polyglot Bible of 1657. In that work appear Chevallier's translation from the Syriac into Latin of the Targum Hierosolmitanum, his Latin version of the Targum of Pseudo-Jonathan on the Pentateuch, and corrections of Jonathan's Targum on Joshua, Judges, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets.

The distinctively patterned, heavy-knit Cowichan sweaters, popular among British Columbians and tourists, are produced using this method. Cowichan knitting is an acculturated art form, a combination of European textile techniques and Salish spinning and weaving methods. From this union, new tools, techniques and designs developed over the years. Cowichan sweaters are also called Siwash Sweaters, Indian Sweaters, Curling Sweaters or sometimes Mary Maxim Sweaters. While \\"Cowichan\\" is the name of a specific First Nations group, the word \\"siwash\\" is borrowed from Chinook jargon, the historic trade language of the Pacific Northwest. It is derived from sauvage () and is felt by some to contain derisive connotations. History Pre-contact Cowichan weaving Before European contact the Coast Salish peoples, including the Cowichan, wove blankets, leggings, and tumplines out of mountain goat wool, dog hair, and other fibres.Meikle 1987, p. 3. The wool was spun with a spindle and whorl, and the blankets were woven on a two-bar loom. There is little information on pre-contact production and use of these weavings, although examples remain in museum collections. No archaeological or ethnographic evidence of knitting or knitting needles exists. Introduction to European knitting techniques Sheep were introduced to Vancouver Island in the 1850s, providing a more plentiful source of wool. Around the same time, the first European settlers arrived in the Cowichan Valley. Knitting by native women probably began in a number of ways shortly thereafter. The most organized instruction in knitting was provided by the Sisters of St. Ann, missionaries who came from Victoria to the Cowichan Valley in 1864 to start a school for the Indians. They taught the Cowichan women to knit such items as socks and mitts. The mission has records of students' knitting and other domestic skills being displayed at local fairs and at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.Meikle 1987, p.4. After learning how to make socks and mitts, Cowichan women began to knit knee-length underwear and sweaters. Like the other garments, sweaters were and are today knit in the round with no seams, using multiple needles in the European style of the period. The earliest Cowichan sweaters were all of one colour, knitted with a turtle-neck. Some knitters used a raised stitch similar to that of a gansey, possibly inspired by the clothing of the many British fishermen who had settled in the area. Development of the Cowichan sweater In time, Cowichan knitters began to embellish sweaters using the Fair Isle technique. The teaching of patterned sweater knitting is generally attributed to a settler from the Shetland Islands, Jerimina Colvin. Mrs. Colvin settled in Cowichan Station in 1885, raised sheep, and hand-spun and dyed her own wool. She probably began to teach knitting by the 1890s, and added patterns as she learned them from other Scottish settlers. Another origin theory is that the Sisters of St. Ann, a Roman Catholic institution founded in Quebec to promote the education of rural children, brought knitting to the West Coast. In 1858, four Sisters of St. Ann traveled from Montreal to Victoria to open a schoolhouse for the local children of all different races. Knitting became part of the instruction of Indigenous girls during the 1860s, both at St. Ann's Academy in Victoria and St. Ann's School for Indian Girls in Duncan. Unlike Fair Isle or Shetland garments, however, Cowichan sweaters are always hand knit of thick, handspun, one-ply natural-coloured yarn in two or three colours (generally cream, black and grey), producing a warm bulky outer garment that is heavier than the multi-coloured Scottish garments made from lightweight two-ply dyed yarn. The classic Cowichan sweater of the 20th century was knitted of white or undyed wool, in coat style, fastened at the front by buttons or a zipper, hip-length, with a shawl collar, and usually ornamented with indigenous or sporting motifs.https://www.marymaxim.ca/indian- totem-pole-cardigan-pattern.html Techniques Drying wool. Koksilah Reserve, 1985. Wool and its preparation Because Cowichan knitting developed shortly after the introduction of sheep to Vancouver Island, Cowichan sweaters have always been knitted exclusively from sheep's wool.Meikle 1987, p.7. Down breeds of sheep, such as Dorset, Hampshire and Suffolk, thrive in the coastal climate. Garments produced from the short lofty fleece of these local breeds are characterized by their uneven texture, their warmth and their lightness relative to overall bulk. The preparation of greasy wool demands several steps, and early procedures have been modified over the years. The oldest wool processing method followed by Cowichan women involved six basic steps: the wool was washed, dried, hand teased, hand carded, drawn out and loosely spun by hand to make a roving, then tightened with a spindle and whorl. Today, many of these steps have been mechanized or eliminated. Some knitters still buy shorn fleeces and go through most of the traditional preparation, but most buy the washed and carded wool directly from a commercial carding mill. Cowichan knitter Mary Harry washes wool. Koksilah Reserve, 1985. When the wool is obtained from fleeces, knitters remove the suint by leaving them out in the rain to soften and then pulling the wool out. Wool from any source must be washed in warm soapy water, rinsed a number of times, and hung on lines or spread out to dry.Meikle 1987, p.8. Yellowish wool is left in the sun to bleach. Washing is done primarily during the warm summer weather. Knitters hand-tease the dry wool to loosen and separate the matted or tangled fibres by pulling them apart. This allows the dirt, hay and twigs to fall out and makes the wool ready for carding.Meikle 1987, p.9. Spinning Cowichan knitters spin wool three different ways: with a Salish spindle and whorl, with a converted sewing machine, and with a home-made spinning machine. The spindle and whorl are rarely used today.Meikle 1987, p.10. There are five known types of Salish spindles.Marr 1979, p.67. The version used exclusively by the Cowichan people was very large and was used for spinning two ply mountain goat wool and dog hair for weaving. The spindle was a tapered shaft approximately four feet long. The whorl, which rested one-half to two-thirds of the way down the shaft, was about eight inches in diameter. Coast Salish spindle whorls were often highly decorated, and many fine examples can be found in museum collections.Meikle 1987, p.11. Homemade spinning machines date from the 1890s.Eells 1976, p.41-42. There are two types of Cowichan wheels: each has a foot treadle and pulley, a flyer assembly with a large-sized orifice, a substantial bobbin and flyer, and large, widely spaced guide hooks. One type of wheel has the wooden flyer assembly mounted horizontally on the table of a treadle sewing machine, and is rotated by means of the foot treadle. The spinner's left hand draws out the wool to her side, and the right hand guides the twisting yarn into the orifice. The second wheel is completely homemade. It also uses a foot treadle, but the spinner faces the spindle orifice instead of the side of the flyer, and feeds the roving in directly. Today most of the spinning machines have been motorized. The First Nations-designed spinner heads were copied by manufacturers in the United States, Canada, and New Zealand due to the renewed popularity of crafts in the 1960s. The specially adapted spinning wheels are now known as Bulky or Indian Head spinners. Knitting Learning to knit sweaters and other items was - and remains - a family process. Children often start by helping out with wool processing, and begin to knit mitts and socks around the age of ten.Meikle 1987, p.13. Today, as in the past, most knitting is done by women. Men often play a role by making or repairing the spinners and carders, helping with the washing or carding of the wool, and helping the women sell their works. Once the preliminary wool preparation steps are completed, knitting can begin. Early materials for needles included whale bone, deer bone, telephone wire, bamboo chopsticks,Lane 1951, p.21. and wood. Today, knitters primarily use readily available and inexpensive plastic or metal needles. No matter which material is used for needles, the sizes vary from 4-7.5mm depending on the weight of the hand spun yarn. Cowichan knitter Mabel Modeste working on a sweater. Koksilah Reserve, 1985. To produce a sweater, the knitter casts on stitches in the usual manner, evenly divided onto at least eight double pointed needles. The number of needles varies according to the size of the sweater, the weight of the yarn, and the length of the needle. There is one extra for the knitting. For sweaters, the knitters always work in the round for a pullover, or back and forth in one piece for a cardigan. After the knitter has divided the stitches on the proper number of needles, she knits a band of ribbing of her chosen design, then increases the number of stitches and continues in stocking or plain stitch. Pockets of the knitter's design are often knit in. Designs are incorporated in one of two ways. The simplest is a complete change of colour for a whole row, used most often in the waistband, the cuff, and the collar. Because there is now a variety of natural-coloured wool for contrasting patterns, contemporary knitters no longer dye their raw material.Meikle 1987, p.14. The larger bands of design are created using the two-colour or Fair Isle knitting technique, in which the unused colour is carried along the back of the work between design units. Just before reaching the armholes, the knitter may add a few stitches for extra room under the arms. At the armholes, the knitting is divided into an equal number of stitches for the back and the front, and about five stitches from the front and five from the back are put onto a safety pin.Meikle 1987, p.15. The knitter then divides the front in two by putting four stitches from the middle on a safety pin to hold for the collar base. The back is worked straight up from the armholes, and the fronts are worked to the same height with some decreasing at the neck edge for shaping. The shoulders are knit together, and the remaining stitches (usually about one-third) at the neck back are held for the collar. Each knitter has her own method of making a shawl collar, using garter stitch, basket stitch, or ribbing, and knitting in one colour or incorporating stripes. A common technique is to pick up two of the four base stitches, start on one side and work up the neck edge to the shoulder by picking up a stitch from the lapel edge on each row and increasing the width of the collar as it is worked.Meikle 1987, p.16. The top ends in line with the shoulder seam. The same is done for the other side. The knitter then picks up stitches from the neck edge and knits back and forth, increasing on each row and picking up stitches form the top of the lapel, then casts off the collar back. Some skilled knitters are able to pick up stitches all around the neckline and knit the collar all at one time by increasing and decreasing for shaping. To knit the sleeves the knitter picks up the front half of the armhole stitches on the safety pin, picks up stitches around the sleeve front and sleeve back and then adds the back half of the held stitches. Sleeves are knit on three to five needles depending on the size of the garment. The shaping of the sleeve depends on the needle sizes and the designs. Knitters decrease as needed, mostly in the elbow area and cuff, and cast off at the wrist. Knitting down the sleeve, rather than attaching on a separate sleeve, produces a better fitting garment. It also easily enables a sleeve to be lengthened or a cuff repaired. The actual knitting process usually takes two to three days. Over the years Cowichan knitters have produced a variety of items in addition to their sweaters. They have responded to market demands by making socks and mitts, and more recently tuques, tams, ponchos, slippers, and baby booties. Design Knitters probably began using Fair Isle patterning in the early 1900s (decade), contrasting shades and colours of wool.Meikle 1987, p.17. As they now use only natural colours, the range is limited to whites, greys, browns and blacks, or a combination produced during the carding process. Most knitwear includes only two or three colours. In sweaters, the colours form either geometric or representational designs. Characteristically they are placed horizontally on the mid-portion of the body of the sweater. If the design in this centre portion is geometric, it is laid out in a broad band and repeated on the sleeves. If the main design is representational, it is usually centred on the back, with the same design on the front of a pullover, or two smaller versions of the same representation on either side of the front on a cardigan. There are usually geometric motif bands above and below the representational figure, which are also repeated on the sleeves. Most knitters collect designs, some of which are passed on through families and friends. Some families have proprietary designs, although this is relatively rare. Designs are incorporated only for their artistic appeal; there is no meaning or implication to them. The popularity of Indian-patterned sweaters prompted the Mary Maxim Company, then headquartered in Sifton, Manitoba, to produce graphed commercial patterns, beginning in the 1940s.Meikle 1987, p.18. Ironically, the knitters soon began to collect and use these charts themselves. They continue to retain favourite designs and to make modifications of them. There are, for example, many variations on the eagle theme. Knitters will also create custom patterns, often with no traditional associations. Despite the diversity of patterns, however, experienced knitters and dealers can often identify the maker of a sweater through the particular qualities of design and knitting style that form a kind of personal signature. Spread in Popularity By the 1920s, when interest in the sweaters came from outside the Coast Salish community, both companies and private individuals began to imitate the sweater. One of the more famous imitations came from Mary Maxim, a company that begun in the 1940s by Willard S. McPhedrain. At first, Mary Maxim started as a woolen mill, but the business soon expanded after McPhedrian traveled to British Columbia on a sales trip and came across a Cowichan sweater. Today, companies such as Pendleton Woolen Mills, Ralph Lauren, and Aritzia all have their own version of the Cowichan sweater design. In October 2009, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) revealed their clothing line for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, including the Olympic sweater that looked like a Cowichan design. Chief Linda Hwitsum, the chief of the Cowichan Tribes, called for redress from the HBC on October 21, 2009. Because of the sweater's registered trademark, the Cowichan Tribes began seeking legal advice to determine if it will launch legal action against HBC. Meanwhile, individual Cowichan knitters began to plan a silent protest where demonstrators would wear Cowichan sweaters to the torch relays in Victoria, B.C. and Duncan, B.C. that would take place on October 30 and October 31 respectively. Eventually, a compromise was made between the parties; knitters would have an opportunity to sell their sweaters at the downtown Vancouver HBC store, alongside the imitations.

It takes its name from the former Allerton station that South Parkway replaced. The junction is where the Liverpool to Manchester line branches off the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line. Services operating over the junction are East Midlands Railway (to Nottingham & Norwich), TransPennine Express (Leeds & Scarborough), West Midlands Trains (Birmingham New Street), Northern (stopping services to Manchester Victoria) and Avanti West Coast (London Euston). History It has only existed in current form since 1966, as prior to this the former Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) main line from Manchester Central passed beneath the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) main line and continued on to Liverpool Central High Level. However the 1963 Beeching Report recommended that all mainline rail services into Liverpool be concentrated at the ex-LNWR Liverpool Lime Street station and that the CLC Central High Level station be closed. Accordingly, a new connection to Hunts Cross West Junction (known as the Hunts Cross chord) was built by British Rail in 1965/66 to link the two routes and allow services from the Warrington and Manchester direction to join the LNWR line from Crewe and so reach Liverpool Lime Street. This re-routeing took effect from 5 September 1966 - thereafter the former CLC line west of here was only used by local trains between Central and . These were withdrawn in 1972, but the line was later reopened as part of the Merseyrail network in January 1978 as far as and then extended to in May 1983. Operation Though there are two pairs of lines through South Parkway station on the main line, only the fast (eastern) ones are linked to the Hunts Cross route - any on the western (slow) pair must be crossed over to the fast lines north of the station if heading towards Manchester.

Originally built in 1823 as Hope Park Chapel, it was converted to its current role in 1979 and was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 6 July 1979. It now plays host to all types of live music, and presents approximately 200 performances every year. It is the year-round Edinburgh performance home of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and also plays an important role for the Edinburgh International Festival, Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival.  History  The inside of the auditorium of The Queen's Hall, Edinburgh 1822‚Äì1873 The Kirk Session of St Cuthbert investigated the southern districts of the parish and found that for a population of 20,250 people, there were only 6,274 seats at places of worship. An appeal was launched, the site was located and the Edinburgh architect Robert Brown (d.1832) was appointed to design the new church. He was responsible for laying out some of Edinburgh's urban extension and designing buildings such as the Easter Coates development, including Melville Street, Coates Crescent and Manor Place.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. (Yale University Press) 1995, s.v. \\"Brown, Robert\\", gives an extended list. The original cost of the building was ¬£6,111, and in 1834 it was renamed the Newington Parish Church. The Forster and Andrews organ was installed in 1873 and was only the second organ introduced into an established church in Edinburgh. 1874‚Äì1928 Towards the end of the century, Victorian modifications were made to the interior of the building. Tinted glass was put in the windows, the pulpit was lowered, the high box pews were replaced with more comfortable seating, and the overall number of seats was reduced. During this time, Newington Parish Church became a fashionable kirk for owners of the new villas in the southside of Edinburgh. 1929‚Äì1976 The reunification of the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church meant that there were now 13 congregations between the Meadows and the Queen's Park, south of the old city wall. In 1932 the General Assembly reunited the parishes of Newington and St Leonard's. The original St Leonard's was sold to the Church of Christ for ¬£3,000 (it is now St. Margaret's and St. Leonard's Catholic Church) and the money used to create a new development which is now the bar area. It was designed by J. Jeffrey Wardell and opened on 8 December 1934. A declining congregation led to the closure of Newington and St Leonard's Church on 31 July 1976. 1977‚Äìpresent The closure of the church coincided with a search by the Scottish Baroque Ensemble (now the Scottish Ensemble), Scottish Philharmonic Singers and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra for performance and rehearsal premises. An appeal was launched in 1977. The architect was Larry Rolland of Robert Hurd and Partners, and the main contractor was Melville, Dundas and Whitson. The total costs amounted to ¬£850,000 and The Queen's Hall was officially opened on 6 July 1979. Further development of the backstage areas took place in 1982 with the opening of the Canada Room (now named the Tunnell Room, in honour of John Tunnell, the former leader of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra). In 1991, a new mezzanine level - called the Hope Scott Room - was created above the bar area. The Hall was further improved in 1996 with the installation of the piano lift, refurbishment of the pews, lighting and carpeting at a cost of ¬£700,000. In June 2017 a 3-year strategy of refurbishment to reposition the Hall and brand to ensure its future financial and artistic success under new CEO Evan Henderson was announced.http://www.thequeenshall.net/news/articles/post-of- marketing-manager The view from the stage inside The Queen's Hall, Edinburgh  Fixtures and Fittings The clock in the clock tower was provided by subscriptions in 1827 and its original workings were replaced in 1883. These workings were stolen - probably for scrap - during the refurbishment in the late 1970s. The two high plaques located in the stairways to the balconies ('The Creed' and '10 Commandments') were not part of the original fabric of the building. They were gifted by the Kirk Session in June 1949 from Buccleuch Parish Church. The 1873 Forster and Andrews organ was relocated to Nicholson Square Methodist Church. The William Gray chamber organ was built in 1810 for the Jerningham family in Norfolk. It was purchased for ¬£6000 from Christopher Dickens (Organ Builder) and relocated to The Queen's Hall. Its inaugural concert was 13 July 1979. It was sold at Phillips Auction in November 1991. The pulpit was removed and placed in storage by the Church of Scotland until it was gifted and installed in St Giles Church, Elgin in 1981.

It is most commonly referred to as the \\"Debs\\" (from \\"debutante\\") but some schools (mainly boys' or coeducational) call it the \\"Grad\\" or \\"Grads\\" (from graduation). Each ball is associated with a specific school, which may take place during the school year, immediately after the Leaving Certificate examinations in June, or after the results are announced in August. Some schools have a smaller \\"pre-Debs\\" some months before the Debs. Other schools, including in Tralee, hold their Debs in January.  Organisation  A Debs or Grads is often organised by someone other than the school itself. In some cases, a student committee is created within the school to organise the event in collaboration with selected teachers or parents. Some organisers pay an events company to assist with the event-planning activities. The events are typically held at a hotel or other large function room. A Debs is usually, though not always, a formal dinner, followed by music. Alcohol is almost always served. Traditionally there is a photographer present, who will take individual shots of each couple and throughout the event. It is not uncommon for the event to last all night, with some attendees returning home the following morning, or going for breakfast together. Some hotels provide breakfast.  Participation  Corsage given by date Some students may worry about being invited or finding a date, but many attend with friends or in a group. People are usually dressed in formal black tie, gowns or dresses. These are often adorned with a corsage. While formal attire is traditional, it is not required for entrance. It is customary for men to purchase a corsage, flowers or a box of chocolates for their dates if they are women.  Controversy  In 1998, at a hearing between Judge Desmond Windle and a school solicitor from Newpark Comprehensive about a late night bar extension, the judge stated that the term \\"Debs ball\\" should not be used to describe a school leavers dance because its origins were in \\"archaic\\" practices associated with royal courts, and \\"nothing to do with a Republic\\". Describing the term as \\"nonsensical\\" and \\"absurd\\", the judge showed particular disdain for the term as he believed that its use in Ireland derived from the English royal court, despite the word \\"debutante\\" being French in origin. News outlets in 2012 and 2013 published articles featuring the money spent by attendees, on average ‚Ç¨695-‚Ç¨825 on the night, including spend on dresses. The events also face criticism as the nights often have a heavy focus on alcohol, and associated by some with \\"drunkenness and rowdy behaviour\\".

A heated tool is placed against or near the two surfaces to be joined in order to melt them. Then, the heat source is removed, and the surfaces are brought together under pressure. Hot plate welding has relatively long cycle times, ranging from 10 seconds to minutes, compared to vibration or ultrasonic welding. However, its simplicity and ability to produce strong joints in almost all thermoplastics make it widely used in mass production and for large structures, like large-diameter plastic pipes. Different inspection techniques are implemented in order to identify various discontinuities or cracks. History Hot plate welding was first used in the early 1930s for joining PVC. It gained in popularity with the prevalence of polyolefins, which are difficult to adhesively bond. By the 1960s, it was among the most widely used plastic welding methods. Hot plate welding was used for pipelines and appliances as well as injection moldings. Numerous national and international associations for welding have specifications and guidelines for hot plate welding, including the Deutscher Verband fuer Schweissen (DVS) in Germany, the American Welding Society (AWS) in the United States, and the Comit√© Europ√©en de Normalisation (CEN) in Europe. Process Conventional hot plate welding Pressure versus time for the phases of hot plate welding The hot plate welding process can be divided into four phases: matching, heating, change-over, and welding/forging. The matching phase serves to match the geometry of the weld surfaces to the theoretical welding plane. The weld surfaces are heated through conduction by physical contact with the hot plate. The hot plate temperature range is 30 to 100 ¬∞C above the melting temperature of the material, and a constant pressure between 0.2 and 0.5 MPa is applied against the hot plate. This causes the weld surfaces to conform to the hot plate, which has the desired weld geometry. This also removes surface irregularities that would increase thermal contact resistance. After the parts are in full contact with the hot plate, the heating phase starts and pressure is reduced to a minimum. During the heating phase, the weld region is heated conductively until melted, without substantial displacement of the material. Pressure is maintained either at a minimum to keep the parts and the hot plate in contact or at zero with a preset displacement. The melt surface reaches approximately 20 ¬∞C below the temperature of the hot plate. The viscosity of the melted material can be controlled through the temperature of the hot plate and the heating time. The surface of hot plate is often coated with PTFE to stop the molten plastic from sticking, which limits the hot plate temperature to 270 ¬∞C. The temperature of the parts during this phase can be modeled by assuming a constant temperature boundary condition and using the one-dimensional heat equation: :\\\\theta(x,t) = \\\\theta_i + (\\\\theta_s - \\\\theta_i) \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{erfc} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa t}}\\\\right) where Œ∏ is the temperature, x is the position, t is the time, Œ∏i is the initial temperature, Œ∏s is the constant surface temperature, Œ∫ is the thermal diffusivity, and erfc is the complementary error function. This model is valid for most cases, since the thermal contact resistance is low and the thermal mass of the hot tool is large compared to the plastic parts. For more precise predictions of the heat flow, the thermal contact resistance and the temperature dependence of the thermal properties of the plastic also need to be considered. After sufficient heating time, the change-over phase begins. During this phase, the parts are retracted from the hot plate, the plate is quickly moved away, and the parts are brought together. The change-over should be as short as possible, because the melted region cools off during this time. The welding/forging phase begins when the two molten surfaces are pressed together. This creates intermolecular diffusion of the plastic molecules according to reptation theory. Weld strength is provided by entanglement of the diffused plastic molecules. The necessary welding pressure depends on the melt viscosity and wall thickness of the parts and usually ranges between 0.025 and 0.05 MPa. This pressure is maintained while the melted material cools and resolidifies. During this, some plasticized material in the weld zone is squeezed out, forming flash. Mechanical stops may be used to limit the amount of squeezed out material in order to prevent a cold weld. Variants Common variants of conventional hot plate welding include high-temperature and non-contact versions. Both of these variants help with the problem of material sticking to the hot plate between weld cycles; the stuck material can degrade and transfer to subsequent welds, resulting in poor quality and aesthetically unappealing welds. With high-temperature hot plate welding, an uncoated hot plate is heated to between 300 and 400 ¬∞C, as the PTFE coating degrades at high temperatures. The high temperature decreases the viscosity of the melt, so it can peel off from the hot plate when removing the parts. This can be accompanied during the change- over phase by rapid movement of the parts from the hot plate; this prevents stringing of the melted plastic due to its viscoelastic properties. Any residual material on the hot plate's surface is usually either oxidized away or mechanically removed. With some thermoplastics, the residual material cannot be easily removed and accumulates over time. The hot plates may need to be removed and cleaned between cycles. With the higher temperatures, the matching and heating phases are shortened from those of conventional hot plate welding. However, reduced weld strength from thermal degradation of the plastic can still occur, though most of the degraded material is forced out by the flow of melted material. High-temperature hot plate welding is known to perform well for: * PP and PP copolymers * ABS and PMMA With non-contact hot plate welding, the weld surfaces are melted without physical contact with the hot plate through convection and radiation heating. The hot plate temperature is between 400 and 550 ¬∞C, and the weld surfaces are placed about 1 to 3 millimeters from the hot plate. Heat input needs to be controlled to prevent thermal degradation while plasticizing the material. This variant has no matching phase, so part fit must be good prior to welding, with part deviation not exceeding 0.2 millimeters. In practice, non-contact hot plate welding is only used for small parts whose dimensions do not exceed 100 by 100 millimeters. An additional consideration is the stack effect when the hot plate is oriented vertically, which can cause uneven heating of the weld surfaces. Another variant is hot wedge or hot shoe welding for joining thin sheets with lap seams. A heated wedge travels between the two sheets and melts the weld surfaces while wedge rollers apply light pressure to force intimate contact; drive rollers apply pressure at the tip of the wedge where the sheets converge to form a continuous seam. Hot wedge welding can produce either single or dual seam joints. For dual seam joints, a split wedge that is unheated in the middle is used. This leaves an unwelded air pocket between the seams that can be pressurized to nondestructively test the joint integrity. With hot wedge welding, the speed of travel is an added parameter as the wedge unit is self-propelled by the rollers. The typical temperature range when welding high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is 220 to 400 ¬∞C; the travel speed is typically 0.7 to 4 meters per second. Parameters Parameters used in hot plate welding are the hot plate temperature, the pressure (or displacement) during matching, the pressure during heating, the pressure and displacement during the weld phase, and the times for matching, heating, change-over and cooling. These parameters have an interdependent effect on the weld quality and cannot be set individually. The hot plate temperature is taken at the surface of the plate. It is set based on the hot plate welding variant along with the properties of the material, including melting temperature, melt viscosity, and thermal degradation limits. Conventional hot plate welding uses temperatures 30 to 100 ¬∞C above the melting temperature. The high-temperature variant uses temperatures above the material's degradation temperature, about 100 to 200 ¬∞C above the melting point. The non-contact variant uses temperatures 300 to 400 ¬∞C above the melting point. With non-contact welding, the radiation heating depends not only on the temperature but also on the emissivity of the hot plate material. The pressure during the matching phase removes warpage of the weld surfaces to ensure full contact with the hot plate without causing the parts to deform. During the heating phase, a minimum pressure is maintained to keep the parts in contact with the hot plate, as a larger pressure would squeeze out material. The welding pressure brings the molten weld surfaces into intimate contact and squeezes out entrapped air. Too high a pressure would squeeze out most of the hot material from the joint, leaving cooler material to form a cold weld. Too low a pressure limits intermolecular diffusion and produces a weak weld. A mechanical stop may be used in the welding phase to limit the amount of material squeeze out by varying the welding pressure. The matching and heating times control the amount of heat input during those phases. The matching time is set so that surface irregularities are melted and removed. The heating time determines the melt layer thickness. Too thick a melt results in excess flash and unfavorable molecular orientation at the joint interface. Too thin a melt produces a brittle weld. The change-over time determines the temperature of the melted material as welding begins and, therefore, should be as short as possible to minimize surface cooling. Typical change-over times are around 2 to 3 seconds, even for large parts. Cooling time refers to the time until the joined parts have solidified (when the molten material has cooled below its melting temperature) and can be removed from the machine. The welded part should not be stressed until it has further cooled until room temperature.  Equipment  Hot plate welding equipment consists of two main components, a clamping fixture and one or multiple hot plates. The primary function of the fixture is to provide support during the welding process to prevent deformation under welding pressure. Conventional machines have fixtures that fully conform to the parts being welded and allow for flexibility in production by accepting different fixture configurations. Custom machines may be configured to weld a specific component and do not provide as much flexibility as standard machines. Hot plates are generally designed for specific working temperatures. Hot plates for conventional hot plate welding have a working temperature of at least 270 ¬∞C and are made from aluminum alloys. The hot plates may also be coated in Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to prevent sticking of the polymer to the hot plate. Caution should be taken as the PTFE coatings degrade over time and sets of interchangeable fixtures should be available during continuous operation. Hot plates for high-temperature hot plate welding have a maximum working temperature of 430 ¬∞C and are made from aluminum bronze alloys. Due to the lower thermal conductivity of these alloys precaution must be taken to ensure that there is uniform heating along the hot plate surface. PTFE has a maximum working temperature of 270 ¬∞C therefore, non-stick coatings cannot be used for this type of operation. Lastly, hot plates for non-contact hot plate welding are used for temperatures up to 550 ¬∞C are made from either aluminum bronze or stainless steels. Thermoplastic Joint Designs Hot plate welding machines are generally operated by pneumatic, hydraulic or electromechanical controls. Machines can be configured to perform welds with the faying surface in either the horizontal or vertical position. Longer components such as pipes are more commonly welded in the horizontal position whereas moldings with internal fittings such as a starter battery are welded in the vertical position. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller also assists in maintaining desired temperatures during each process.  Joint Types  While there are various joint configurations, a butt joint in which the two joining materials are aligned along the same plane is one of the most common joint designs for thermoplastics. There are various modifications of this joint that are implemented for different applications which include the following listed below. * Enlarged Joining Surface - Using filler materials in welds lowers the overall strength and this can be compensated for by enlarging the joint surface. * Butt Joint Flash Trap (Internal) - The bead is covered by a rib or flash trap. * Butt Joint Flash Trap (External) - This type of joint hides flash on the outside surface and is generally used to reduce noise in surrounding areas. * Butt Joint Flash Trap (Double) - Makes the surface more visually appealing by hiding the flash on both sides of the weld. Material weldability Hot plate welding can be used for joining all thermoplastics and thermoplastic elastomers whose melting temperature range lies below their decomposition temperature. Since only the plastic itself can be joined, additives, used to improve material properties or reduce cost, can reduce weldability. Additives can also reduce weld strength by acting as stress concentrators. Examples of additives include stabilizers, lubricants, processing aids, coloring agents, reinforcing materials (talcum, glass fibers, carbon fibers, etc.). The water content of the plastic also affects weldability. This affects thermoplastics that absorb water from the surrounding air, mainly amorphous thermoplastics. High water content can lead to the formation of bubbles during heating and joining, reducing weld strength. Therefore, parts should be welded shortly after injection molding, stored in a dry environment, or welded with adjusted parameters. Hot plate welding can be used to join some combinations of dissimilar thermoplastics. Typically, semi-crystalline plastics are only compatible with semi-crystalline plastics, and amorphous plastics are only compatible with amorphous plastics. If the plastics have the same melting point and melt viscosity, conventional or high-temperature hot plate welding can be used. With different melting points or different viscosities, dual hot plates should be used, with each hot plate set to a different temperature. Common thermoplastic combinations include: * ABS ‚Äì PMMA * ABS ‚Äì PC * ABS ‚Äì SAN * PMMA ‚Äì PC + ABS * PC ‚Äì PC + ABS Applications Hot plate welding is used for joining parts ranging from a few centimeters up to 1.6 meters. It is also used for making continuous welds in lining membranes. Its usage can be divided into two main categories, namely production applications and pipe welding. These differ in their equipment and joint designs. Production applications One major industry using hot plate welding is the automotive sector. Tail light housings made of ABS are joined with lenses made of either PMMA or PC using a modified butt joint. ABS and PMMA have similar melting temperatures and can be welded using a single hot plate, while ABS and PC requires dual hot plates due to PC's higher melting temperature. Vacuum suction cups are used to move the parts to prevent scuffing. Both conventional and high-temperature variants are used. A typical cycle time is 60 seconds with a hot plate temperature of 370 ¬∞C. Fuel tanks made of blow-molded HDPE need as many as 34 parts welded to it, including clips, filler necks, vent lines and brackets. The parts are welded individually using groove butt joints. Each component needs a different matching time, and cycle times are less than a minute per component. The cases and lids of automotive batteries are made of thin PP copolymers, which have low melt viscosity. High-temperature hot plate welding is used on butt joints with flash covers. A typical machine can weld two batteries in a time of less than 30 seconds. Other automotive components welded by hot plate are carburetor floats, coolant and washer fluid reservoirs, and ventilation ducts. Non-automotive items include dishwasher spray arms, laundry detergent boxes, steam iron reservoirs, HDPE barrels, PP transport pallets, medical needle disposal boxes, and PVC window frames. Pipe welding Hot plate welding, referred to as fusion welding in many industries, is commonly used to join plastic pipes. These pipes, as opposed to steel ones, are less likely to rupture during an earthquake. Pipe welding uses special joint configurations, namely butt, socket and saddle/sidewall, each with its own welding procedures. Butt fusion welding has similar process phases as conventional hot plate welding. Before welding, the pipe ends are faced and the profiles are rounded and aligned with each other. The remaining phases proceed as normal, though sometimes the matching phase can be skipped. When welding dissimilar plastics, in lieu of dual hot plates, the pipe with the lower melt flow index can be heated earlier than the other, such that both pipe ends have the same melt viscosity at the end of the heating phase. After cooling, the flash bead is sometimes removed to leave smooth surfaces on the interior and exterior. Problems with the weld can be determined by inspecting this bead. Socket fusion welding uses male and female heating tools attached to a hot plate to heat the exterior of the pipe and the interior of the socket simultaneously. This is typically used for pipes ranging from 40 to 125 millimeters. With this joint, the welding pressure is supplied by the interference fit of the pipe and socket, so these parts as well as the heating tools need to be within tolerance. Saddle/sidewall fusion welding is used for joining saddle fittings onto the sidewall of a pipe to create branches. The exterior of the pipe and the matching surface of the saddle fitting are heated using concave and convex heating tools. The saddle fusion machine applies welding force through the centerline of the pipe. Prior to welding, the exterior of the pipe needs to be cleaned of all contaminants, because the melt layer of the pipe is not displaced from the joint.  Non-destructive Testing (NDT)  There are two methods of testing including non-destructive and destructive testing. While the quality of a weld can only be determined through destructive means, NDT allows for the determination of defects in the welded region. The following section will highlight some of the non-destructive methods used in welding of thermoplastics.  Visual inspection  Visual inspection testing can only be used to detect flaws on the surface of the weld but is the least expensive method of NDT. This method of inspection may be performed both during and post welding. During welding the operator is inspecting for discoloration, misalignment, notches and other surface discontinuities. Post welding inspection allows the operator to inspect for microstructural features which may be detrimental to the welded part.  X-ray testing  X-ray testing is a costly method of inspection; therefore, it is generally limited to pressure vessels and pipelines carrying hazardous materials. This method is most effective when the densities of the imperfection and the plastic have a substantial difference and is used for detection of voids, inclusions and other imperfections. A disadvantage to this method is that microstructural defects cannot be determined through this method of testing.  Leak- tightness test  This method of testing is most often used for welded pipes and other closed containers. There are different variations of this test which are dependent on the type of medium (water,air,gas) used to pressurize the sample. It is common to conduct this test in vacuum conditions.  High- voltage test  High voltage testing known as ‚Äúspark test‚Äù is an alternative to the leak-tightness test. This test in performed by coating the weld with an electrically conductive substance such as a wire, fibers or coils. When a voltage is applied an arc will form, showing the presence of a leak. This test is not well suited for polar thermoplastics such as PVC as they will generate heat leading to potential degradation of the weld.  Ultrasonic testing  Ultrasonic testing uses high frequency waves that travel through the welded regions. These waves are able to detect defects based on the different densities between the imperfection and plastic part. There are two primary methods of conducting ultrasonic testing and that is by using a transmitter and receiver in conjunction or by using an ultrasonic transducer. These conventional methods similar to X-ray testing are not able to detect microstructural changes in the weld. Advanced ultrasonic testing such as phased array ultrasonics (PAUT) is currently being developed for inspection of hot plate and electrofusion joints.F. Hagglund, , M. A. Spicer, M.J. Troughton, Phased array ultrasonic testing of welded joints in plastic (PE) pipes, 6th Middle East Nondestructive Testing Conference, 7-10 October 2012, Kingdom of Bahrain Polyethylene (PE) pipes are desirable over other materials such as metals for the transportation of fluids due to their resistance to corrosion leading longer lifespans. They are however, limited from being used in nuclear power plants due unreliable NDT methods. Current methods involve using practices that do not provide a complete analysis of a welded PE pipe.M. Troughton and F. Hagglund ‚ÄúOn-site Volumetric Inspection of Butt Fusion and Electrofusion Joints in Polyethylene Pipes‚Äù Joining Plastics Journal 10 (2016) No.1 Using a butt joint configuration produces a small fusion zone and inspection is further complicated due to the high attenuation of PE.Hagglund F, Robson M, Troughton M J, et al. A novel phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) system for on-site inspection of welded joints in plastic pipes. In: Proceedings of National Seminar & Exhibition on Non-Destructive Evaluation. Pune, 2014 Proper probe placement is also limited during inspection due to interference with the weld bead. The PAUT system has five primary components. These components are the phased array probe, probe wedge, probe holder, scanner and flaw detector. A minimum of four phased array probes are required for the ultrasonic signal to detect a flaw. The membrane water wedge transmits the ultrasound from the probes into the pipe while minimizing energy loss and the probe holder ensures proper contact between the wedge and pipe. The scanning system made specifically for this testing method carries the probe around the joint of the pipe during inspection. Lastly, the flaw detector analyzes the signal from the probe. This method is specifically designed for inspection of electrofusion and butt fusion welds of various sized pipes ranging from a thickness of 8-65mm and a diameter of 90-800mm. PAUT is well suited for the detection of: * Planar flaws- This may be caused by the welding surface being covered in moisture. * Contaminants - Arid and windy environments may lead to particles attaching to the surface of the pipe. * Cold welds - This is caused by incomplete or partial intermolecular diffusion which results in a brittle failure. Induced by cold temperatures or if there is a large gap between the pipe and fitting. * Under penetration - This type of defect is caused by clamps not being properly secured during the welding process. Two ISO reports are under development and being reviewed by technical committee (TC) 138 (Plastic pipes, fittings and valves for the transport of fluids) to include PAUT as a method of volumetric NDT of PE pipes. A procedure has also been made for UT of butt fusion joints including but not limited to HDPE and medium-density polyethylene (MDPE).

Two of his companions, aged 10 and 12, were also seriously wounded. This incident took place during the Second Intifada. The Israeli Army said immediately that their forces had been attacked and that they had returned fire. Palestinian sources and a friend of Khalil said they were part of group throwing stones at Israeli troops when al- Mugrahbi was killed. A later investigation by the chief military prosecutor found that the clashes that had involved Palestinians throwing stones and grenades at Israeli soldiers had broken up at noon, and that al-Mughrabi was killed at 7 P.M, seven hours after the clashes. The investigation found that, later in the evening, Palestinian adults and children had attempted to seal a road with debris and barbed wire, drawing warning shots from an Israeli tank, with one shot evidently killing al-Mughrabi, who had been playing football in a field a half mile away. Despite having determined that the circumstances \\"must dictate a military police investigation\\", the military prosecutor cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing on the grounds of the violence that had taken place earlier in the day. An independent investigation by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said that the Israeli army's investigation of the incident amounted to a whitewash, calling the investigation \\"shallow and superficial\\" and that the actions by the Judge Advocate General \\"raises a serious concern that lying is considered legitimate practice in the office of the Judge Advocate General.\\" Human Rights Watch, commenting on the army's failure to investigate the al-Mughrabi case further, noted that in international law, the governing principle where there is credible or prima facie evidence of a possible violation of international humanitarian law is that an investigation is required.Human Rights Watch, Promoting Impunity, Human Rights Watch, vol.17, No 7 (E), June 2005 p.51.  Incident  The incident occurred on 7 July 2001, in the Yubneh refugee camp, located on the outskirts of the city of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip near the Egyptian border. At the time a ceasefire agreement, drawn up by George J. Tenet, the American director of the C.I.A., was supposed to have been in effect from the preceding June 13. In the interim 9 Israelis had died, and al-Mughrabi was the 17th Palestinian victim. The Israeli army reported that Palestinians had thrown 26 grenades and four gasoline bombs at troops in Rafah over the course of the day. The spokesman for the Israeli army said that the troops had fired back following these attacks. In another incident, two Israeli soldiers were lightly injured when a roadside bomb exploded near the village of Asira ash- Shamaliya.Palestinian boy shot dead in Gaza BBC News. 8 July 2001Fighting in Gaza Kills a Boy and Clashes in West Bank Wound 4. The New York Times. 8 July 2001 The IDF spokesman said \\"dozens of Palestinians were rioting next to Rafah and endangering the lives of the soldiers... The soldiers acted with restraint and moderation and dispersed the rioters by using means for dispersing demonstrations, and by means of live gunfire into an open area distant from the rioters.\\"Hass, Amira. What do an outpost, a Palestinian child and a pacifist have in common? Ha'aretz. 10 May 2010 A friend of al-Mughrabi reported that the two of them had been among the group of stone throwers at Israeli troops. Palestinian sources he had been throwing stones when he was killed. The army reported that to disperse the attacking crowd, \\"live gunfire into an open area distant from the rioters\\" and that the army had no evidence that anyone had been injured. None of the essential facts in the army's initial account were true. A later internal investigation by the Israeli army determined that no attacks had taken place during the time range that al- Mughrabi was shot and killed. Colonel Einat Ron, the military's chief prosecutor, found that at 7 P.M, when al-Mughrabi had been playing soccer with his friends in a field, no grenades or stones had been thrown at Israeli troops. Nonetheless, Israeli troops opened fire from a heavy tank-mounted machine gun.Are Israelis off hook in slaying? Associated Press. 13 November 2011 The report found these shots were in response to an attempt by Palestinians to block a road while an Israeli army vehicle was leaving the town. Soldiers on an Israeli tank fired warning shots at this group. Ron's report determined that these shots violated army regulations due to their having been fired from a long-range heavy weapon and because the shots had been aimed near children. Her report stated that the shots were fired at a time \\"when no grenades were thrown, and it is doubtful that the force felt its life was in danger.\\" One of the bullets from the tank fire struck al- Mughrabi's head and killed him.Greenburg, Joel. Death of a Child: How Israel's Army Responds The New York Times. 13 November 2001 The Israeli report offered three conflicting options. The first was to begin a military investigation into the suspected unlawful fire, the second to clear the soldiers on account of violence that had taken place earlier in the day, and the third to issue disciplinary measures without a criminal investigation. Col. Ron chose the second option, clearing the soldiers of any wrong doing. In a letter to B'Tselem, Ron stated that \\"Under the circumstances we did not find that there is suspicion of criminal behavior by soldiers, nor justification for starting a criminal investigation.\\" B'Tselem's research director said of the letter that \\"it indicates that lying is legitimate in the military prosecutor's office in order to protect the troops.\\" The report by Ron discussed why it would be difficult to clear the soldiers of wrong-doing. Among the reasons the report gives for why it would be is the \\"gravity of the deviation\\" and the \\"results of the event\\". The report says that a \\"serious deviation from obligatory norms of behaviour\\" occurred. Ron's report stated that \\"An 11-year- old boy who was innocently playing football was killed\\", adding that \\"even if this is a 'slight' deviation, the consequences make it imperative that a military police investigation be conducted\\", though the letter sent by Ron to B'Tselem said that she did not believe that an investigation was warranted. She provided no reason for the contradicting views expressed.Barzak, Ibrahim. Army decides not to carry out inquiry in boy's death, semissourian.com, 14 November 2001 B'Tselem investigation B'Tselem, requested that the Israeli army provide information regarding the investigation. Col. Ron sent B'Tselem a letter in which she stated that the circumstances merited no criminal investigation. However, the letter was, apparently inadvertently, accompanied by the military's records of the internal investigation. B'Tselem released the internal documents along with its report on the incident, titled Whitewash: The Office of the Judge Advocate General's Examination of the Death of Khalil al-Mughrabi, 11, on 7 July 2001. According to B'Tselem's report, twenty to thirty children were playing in the Yubneh Refugee Camp that afternoon. The children reportedly saw an Israeli tank moving towards the Gitrit military encampment around 5PM. al-Mughrabi arrived at the site at 5:30 PM with a friend, 13-year-old Suleiman al-Akhras. The two of them played soccer in the field until 6:45 PM. After the children had finished playing many sat near mounds of sand near the border fence, among them al-Mughrabi. At 7:10 PM, al- Mughrabi was shot in the head. The children reported that the shots had come from the observation tower of the Gitrit encampment, approximately one kilometer from where the children had been playing. More shots were fired at the children, wounding another two children. Ibrahim Kamel Abu Susin, 10, was shot in the stomach and Suleiman Turki Abu Rijal, 12, was shot in the left leg. al-Mughrabi was evacuated by the civilians who had arrived on the scene. An ambulance took the two wounded children to the hospital. The following testimonies were collected by B'Tselem: Suleiman Abu Rijal had to have his left testicle amputated as a consequence of the thigh wound. The B'Tselem field investigator, Nabil Mukhairez, added that the bullet entered the top of Khalil‚Äôs head and came out the bottom, and was fired at a distance of roughly 1 kilometre from the Tel Zu‚Äôarub tower. De-briefings by IDF The incident occurred within the military designation zone of the 424 infantry battalion of the 84th \\"Giv'ati\\" Infantry Brigade, IDF's 366th (Reserve) Armor Division, Israeli Southern Command. According to Holi Moshe, Major Operations Directorate Officer of Division 6643 and the Summary of battalion and brigade commanders' de-briefings dated 14 July 2001: \\"It is impossible to unequivocally determine that the child was killed by our forces' gunfire.\\" According to the Opinion of the Israeli Southern Command Judge Advocate, Baruch Y. Mani, Lt. Colonel, dated 29 August 2001: > (A) It appears that tank fire was used as warning shots, which the > regulations prohibit. The de-briefing itself specifies that the tank fire > was a mistake (for reasons unrelated to the regulations).

Einat Ron, Colonel Israel's Chief Military Prosecutor wrote to B'Tselem stating: \\"...we have not found any suspicion of criminal behavior on the part of the IDF soldiers, or that there is a just cause to open an investigation.\\"Whitewash: The Office of the Judge Advocate General's Examination of the Death of Khalil al-Mughrabi, 11, on 7 July 2001, B'Tselem.org, 13 November 2011. Chris McGreal‚Äôs investigation Chris McGreal used the Khalil al-Mughrabi case to illustrate an article which tried to address the phenomenon, widely attested, of many Palestinian children being shot by Israeli snipers over a brief period. Half of the estimated 408 Palestinian minors who had been killed since the second IntifadaUsing figures supplied by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) ) three years earlier had died in the Gaza Strip, and most of those, according to McGreal, were shot at just two refugee camps, Khan Yunis and at Rafah, where Khalil died. In just ten weeks in 2003 McGreal instanced six similar cases in that area: Haneen Suliaman, an 8 year-old girl, had been killed by an IDF sniper‚Äôs headshot while strolling out to buy a packet of crisps; soon after Huda Darwish, a 12 years old girl, was shot in the head while at her desk at school and left blind for life; a boy Abdul Rahman Jadallah, who attended Suliaman's funeral, was then shot under the eye after attending the funeral of a Palestinian fighter the next day - among a group of kids, he stood forth and hung a Palestinian flag on a fence, and was shot in the face; Ali Ghureiz, 7 years old, was shot in the head, below his left eye, outside his house in Rafah; Haneen Abu Sitta, aged 12, was killed while walking home from school near a Jewish settlement fence in southern Gaza; Nada Madhi, aged 12, took a bullet in the stomach and died, after leaning from her bedroom window in Rafah to watch a funeral procession for another child that had just been killed. Khalil al-Mughrabi‚Äôs death, he noted, had been investigated by B'Tselem, whose study documented a discrepancy between the IDF's public pronouncements and what their internal investigations had uncovered. The chief military prosecutor, according to McGreal, covered various false scenarios that might be passed on to B‚ÄôTselem. He therefore sought an interview with an IDF source in the area concerned in order to go over all these episodes and find, even if from an anonymous source speaking off the record, an explanation of why these incidents were recurrent under that command. An Israeli officer subsequently did discuss these cases with McGreal and in the end conceded that some degree of fault existed in most of these cases of children being shot. He concluded however that, 'I remember the Holocaust. We have a choice to fight the terrorists or to face being consumed by the flames again.'McGreal Chris. 'I can't imagine anyone who considers himself a human being can do this,' The Guardian, 28 July 2003 Aftermath Immediately following the shooting of al- Mughrabi, Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi was quoted in The Guardian as vowing to send ten suicide bombers against Israel to avenge the Israeli army‚Äôs killing of Khalil Mughrabi in Rafah.Harel, Amos. Mine kills soldier in unarmored jeep Ha'aretz. 17 July 2001Hamas Threatens 10 Suicide Bombs After Boy's Death Associated Press. 9 July 2001 In an essay on sacred violence, Jan Willem van Henten cited Rantisi's declaration, and argued that, while calls or justifications for acts of revenge often use Islamic religious language, more often than not the real purpose is political, and that the evidence he has examined shows that 'retaliation for Israeli killings of Palestinians is a prime motive for launching suicide attacks celebrated as martyrdom.' Abdel Razek Majaidie, then head of Palestinian Security in Gaza, called the killing \\"another crime\\" by Israel, adding that it violated Israel's declared ceasefire. Al-Mughrabi was the 17th Palestinian killed following a United States brokered truce between the Israelis and Palestinians. Nine Israelis had been killed in that same time period. A panel led by George Mitchell urged Israel to resume military investigations into fatal shootings by soldiers, which had no longer been standard procedure. B'Tselem, upon releasing the Israeli Army's records of the internal investigation, said that \\"the military cleared the soldiers who caused the death of an 11-year-old Palestinian boy, covered up the incident, refrained from opening an investigation by the military police, and issued a false statement regarding the circumstances of the death\\". B'Tselem further stated that the actions by the military prosecutor's office in clearing the soldiers \\"raise grave concern that cover- ups and falsifications are considered acceptable practice by the Military Advocate General's (prosecutor's) office\\". B'Tselem spokeswoman said that \\"We have a very clear feeling that the military is trying to avoid opening an investigation of Palestinian civilians killed by soldiers.\\" The Israeli army responded to the accusations from B'Tselem by saying that the army investigates soldiers accused of violations and that \\"The fact that legal documents have reached the public is proof that the army is investigating such cases all the time.\\"Assadi, Mohammed. \\"Israeli rights group blasts army over boy's death\\", Reuters News, 14 November 2001. On 5 August 2003 one refusnik, Shimri Tzameret, explained to a military court why he had declined to perform his duties in the IDF. His defense consisted in recounting the impact which the B'tselem account of the incident and the following cover-up had made on him. Early in the following year, Sara Leibovich-Dar wrote of a string of cases like the al-Mughrabi episode where initial IDF reports denying that well-verified incidents ever took place turn out to be false. She cited the southern district prosecutor, Brigadier General Baruch Mani's determination that the army's statement to the press regarding al-Mughrabi, claiming that no heavy weaponry was used, was incorrect.Sara Leibovich-Dar \\"Half-truths and double-talk continued\\", Haaretz, 23 January 2002.

Episode 29 served as the final episode of Twin Peaks for over 25 years, until Twin Peaks: The Return was aired in 2017. Upon its original airing in 1991, the episode was paired with episode 28 to form the second hour of what was then billed as a two-part series finale. The episode was written by the series co-creator Mark Frost, producer Harley Peyton and regular writer Robert Engels and was directed by series co-creator David Lynch, who rewrote parts of the script. It features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, Richard Beymer and Kenneth Welsh; and guest stars Frank Silva as Killer Bob, Michael J. Anderson as The Man from Another Place, Carel Struycken as The Giant, and Heather Graham as Annie Blackburn. Twin Peaks centers on the investigation into the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the small rural town in Washington state after which the series is named. In this episode, after the kidnap of Annie Blackburn, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) and Sheriff Truman (Ontkean) pursue Windom Earle (Welsh) to a portal leading to The Black Lodge‚Äîa strange, frightening place which exists on an alternate plane of reality. Cooper enters, whereupon his courage is tested by The Man from Another Place, Earle, a number of doppelg√§ngers, and Killer Bob. \\"Episode 29\\" was broadcast on June 10, 1991 on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and was watched by an audience of 10.4 million households in the United States, about 12 percent of the available audience. The episode was well received and has been the subject of vast critical and academic commentary. Several of the episode's cliffhangers were expanded upon in the 2016 tie-in book The Secret History of Twin Peaks, and also touched upon less directly in Lynch's 1992 movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, in Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces, and Twin Peaks: The Return. Plot  Background  The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has been sent to the town to investigate, and has discovered the murderer, a demonic spirit named Killer BOB (Frank Silva), had possessed the body of Laura's father, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise). Cooper's departure from Twin Peaks is halted by the arrival of his former FBI partner, Windom Earle (Kenneth Welsh), who engages Cooper in a dangerous chess match. Earle's true goal is to use the power of the supernatural Black Lodge, whose entrance is somewhere in the woods surrounding Twin Peaks. Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham), a former convent resident and sister of Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton), arrives in Twin Peaks. Cooper falls in love with her, and convinces her to join the Miss Twin Peaks pageant. Meanwhile, Earle begins his plan, knowing the whereabouts of the Black Lodge's entrance. Concluding he requires fear to enter, he interrupts the Miss Twin Peaks pageant and kidnaps its winner, Annie. In the pandemonium, Nadine Hurley (Wendy Robie), a 35-year old woman believing herself to be an eighteen-year-old high school senior, sustains a head injury. Meanwhile, Deputy Sheriff Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) discovers a map hidden in a cave marking. High school student Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) attempts to find connections between her mother, Eileen Hayward (Mary Jo Deschanel) and local businessman Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer). Donna has found details of an affair between them, and has now learned that Benjamin is her biological father. Sawmill owner Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) discovers a puzzle box left by his brother's business enemy, Thomas Eckhardt (David Warner). Catherine and her brother, Andrew Packard (Dan O'Herlihy) find a security deposit key inside the box.  Events  Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean), Deputy Sheriff Hawk (Michael Horse), Andy, and Cooper stand in the sheriff's office, pondering on the disappearance of Earle and Annie. Local logger Pete Martell (Jack Nance) enters, telling the Sheriff that the Log Lady (Catherine E. Coulson) stole his car. Cooper concludes it was a disguised Earle escaping with Annie, and the real Log Lady enters, holding a jar of engine oil. Ronette Pulaski is brought in, and recognizes the oil's smell from the night of Laura's death. Meanwhile, Truman recalls a circle of twelve sycamore trees in the woods, which match up with the markings on the cave map. Nadine recovers from her head injury with her senior boyfriend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger), estranged husband Ed Hurley (Everett McGill), doctor Will Hayward (Warren Frost), and Norma. Nadine recovers her memory, and becomes horrified when she sees Ed and Norma together. She bursts into tears, abandoning Mike. Windom arrives at the circle of sycamores, with Annie captive. A small pool of oil lies at the center of the trees; Annie becomes catatonic upon approaching it. A ghostly red curtain appears behind the pool. They pass through it and vanish. Cooper and Truman find Pete's car, and Cooper follows alone. Hearing an owl, Cooper finds the pool at the center of the sycamore trees, and sees red curtains appear. He goes through them, and the curtains disappear. Now in the Black Lodge, Cooper passes through red-curtained hallways, finding himself in the Red Room. The Man from Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) dances into the room and sits in a velvet chair. A strobe light flickers as Jimmy Scott sings a jazz ballad. Outside the Black Lodge, Andy and Harry wait for Cooper. At the Hayward house, Donna remains distraught. Ben and Donna's mother attempt to console her. Doctor Hayward arrives, enraged. He attacks Ben, knocking him unconscious. Meanwhile, Andrew steals the safe deposit box key. He is seen by Pete, who accompanies him to the bank. Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) walks into the Twin Peaks bank and chains herself to the bank vault to protest a local housing development. Andrew and Pete arrive with the safe deposit key, and they open the box left by Thomas Eckhardt. The box is opened, revealing a bomb and a note from Eckhardt. The bomb explodes, blowing out the bank's windows. At the Double R Diner, Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) proposes marriage to Shelly Johnson (M√§dchen Amick). Nearby, Major Briggs receives a message Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie), Laura's mother, in a distorted and different voice: \\"I'm in the Black Lodge with Dale Cooper. I'm waiting for you.\\" In the Black Lodge, Cooper encounters mysterious figures. The Man from Another Place offers him coffee, and tells Cooper that \\"when you see me again, it won't be me.\\" Cooper sees Laura Palmer, who tells him that she will see him again in 25 years. Laura holds a mysterious pose, then disappears. An elderly waiter from the Great Northern Hotel (Hank Worden) gives Cooper a coffee that changes consistency. The waiter is replaced by The Giant (Carel Struycken), who sits down and says, \\"One and the same.\\" The Man from Another Place says, \\"Fire, walk with me.\\" Cooper sees an explosion of flames, and the waiting room turns dark. He leaves the room, and passes through several more rooms. In one, he finds Maddy Ferguson (Lee), who says \\"Watch out for my cousin.\\" Cooper finds the Man from Another Place twitching and grimacing, saying \\"doppelg√§nger\\". A doppelg√§nger of Laura appears, holding the same pose as before. She shrieks and charges Cooper. Cooper briefly sees the face of Windom Earle over Laura's and flees. In a different room, Cooper finds a fresh stab wound in his stomach. He stumbles back to a new room, following a trail of his own blood, and sees Caroline, Earle's wife, lying on the floor beside his own bloodied body. He calls for her, and the woman turns into Annie. Annie sits up, covered in blood. Cooper calls out to her, but the room turns dark, and the bodies disappear. Cooper walks into a room with a black marble table. Annie appears and tells Cooper that the man who killed her was her husband. Cooper is baffled. Annie turns into Caroline, and she turns into a doppelg√§nger of Laura. She shrieks and turns into Windom Earle. Windom tells Cooper he will let Annie live if Cooper gives him his soul. Cooper agrees without hesitation, and Windom stabs Cooper. The stabbing suddenly reverses, and Killer BOB appears, holding Earle like a puppet. BOB extracts Earle's soul, and Cooper leaves. A doppelg√§nger of Cooper enters the room and laughs with BOB A doppelg√§nger of Leland Palmer appears in the hall and says to Cooper, \\"I did not kill anybody.\\" Meanwhile, doppelg√§nger Cooper comes into the hall and snickers with Leland, then chases Cooper. Cooper flees but is caught by his doppelg√§nger just before he can escape. It is nightfall again. The gateway to the Black Lodge glows for a moment and disappears. Harry finds Cooper and Annie lying in the circle of trees. Cooper wakes the next morning at the Great Northern, with Harry and Doc Hayward watching over him. Cooper asks, \\"How's Annie?\\" Harry replies that Annie will recover. Cooper gets up out of bed, announcing he needs to brush his teeth. In the bathroom, Cooper lunges his head towards the mirror, with BOB looking back: revealing it was Cooper's doppelg√§nger that arrived from the Black Lodge. As Truman and Hayward begin to worry, Cooper's doppelg√§nger menacingly smiles and mockingly repeats, \\"How's Annie?\\" Production The officially credited writers for this episode are Mark Frost, Harley Peyton, and Robert Engels. However, David Lynch revised their script significantly sans credit; he maintained the episode's general structure but altered much of the dialogue and many scenes, most notably in the Red Room/Black Lodge sequences, making them more akin to the dream sequences in the first season. Lynch also expanded the cast, adding characters that were not in the original script like Ronette Pulaski, Maddy Ferguson, the Palmer family, and The Log Lady, some of whom hadn't been seen in the series for some time. James Marshall, Joan Chen and Piper Laurie do not appear in this episode. Ray Wise returns to the regular cast. In an interview with Chris Rodley, Lynch said that the last episode \\"was written, but when it came to the Red Room, it was, in my opinion, completely and totally wrong. Completely and totally wrong. And so I changed that part. A lot of the other parts were things that had been started and were on a certain route, so they had to continue. But you can still direct them in a certain way. But I really like that last episode.\\"David Lynch, cited in Lynch on Lynch (Revised Edition) , edited by Chris Rodley. (2005, Faber and Faber), p.182 The major differences between the episode as originally scriptedhttp://www.lynchnet.com/tp/tp29.html and as actually filmed are as follows: * The Log Lady and Ronette Pulaski, both of whom appear in the actual episode, do not appear in the original script. * The confrontation between Benjamin Horne and the Haywards is generally the same, although there is more dialogue in the original script. Also, in the original script, Doc Hayward shoves Ben, who strikes his head against a coffee table; a distraught Doc Hayward rushes to Ben's aid and apologises to him. In the filmed episode, Doc Hayward punches Ben, who splits his head against the fireplace; Doc Hayward reacts with terror and does not rush to Ben's aid. * In the original script, Hawk and Major Briggs find Leo Johnson in Windom Earle's cabin. Leo instinctively begins to speak when he sees them, setting off the spider-trap set by Earle. Lynch replaced this with the scene in the Double R Diner featuring Bobby, Shelly, Major Briggs, Mrs Briggs, Dr Jacoby, Sarah Palmer, and Heidi the German waitress. With the exception of Major Briggs, none of these characters appear in the original script. In the filmed episode, Leo is only seen very briefly, via footage from the previous episode; his ultimate fate is left unresolved. * In the original script, Pete Martell does not accompany Andrew Packard into the bank. Instead, Catherine Martell rushes into the bank just before Andrew accidentally sets off the bomb. Catherine does not appear at all in the filmed episode, and in the original script, Pete's only appearance is in the Sheriff's station at the beginning of the episode. * In the original script, Sheriff Truman sees a vision of a dark woman wearing chain mail, holding a sword and a shield. * The sequences in the Black Lodge are almost totally different in the original script: a ghostly version of The Great Northern appears; Windom Earle has much more dialogue; there is no backwards-talking; Laura Palmer appears only for an instant and does not speak; The Black Lodge Singer, The Man from Another Place, the Giant, the Elderly Bellhop, Maddy Ferguson, and Leland Palmer do not appear. Windom Earle's fate is less abrupt - he ends up shackled to a dentist's chair with Bob as the torturer. * The revelation at episode's end that Cooper's doppelg√§nger is now inhabited by Bob is more subtle in the original script. In the bathroom scene, Cooper squeezes toothpaste onto his toothbrush, looks to the mirror and smiles, with Bob's reflection smiling back; the episode ends at this point. In the filmed episode, Cooper squeezes the toothpaste into the sink, sees Bob's reflection in the mirror, smashes his head into the mirror, says \\"How‚Äôs Annie?\\" repeatedly, and laughs uncontrollably. The Secret History of Twin Peaks The 2016 tie-in book for the 2017 relaunch of the series elaborates on some of the events that transpire in \\"Beyond Life and Death.\\" The book takes the form of a dossier that has been compiled by an initially unidentified former resident of Twin Peaks. It is revealed in The Secret History of Twin Peaks that Audrey Horne survived the bomb blast at the bank, but that both Pete Martell and Andrew Packard died. We also learn that Benjamin Horne survived his run in with Doc Hayward and later purchased all of Catherine Martell's land in Twin Peaks retaining his stranglehold on the town. Catherine later became a recluse. Agent Cooper's fate is elaborated on slightly when it is revealed that the dossier was compiled by Major Garland Briggs, who, after the immediate events of the finale, discovered that Cooper was the \\"key\\" to unlocking the mystery of Project Blue Book and the Black Lodge. Upon hearing that Cooper was resting at the Great Northern following his experience in the Lodge, Briggs requested that Cooper join him at his house to discuss his experiences. Later that evening Cooper joined Briggs at the family house, but what happened at the house is not specified. Major Briggs's final entry in the dossier states that Cooper left the house later that evening and that Briggs realized that something was wrong with him; he then writes that he realized what he had to do and signed off with the message \\"M*A*Y*D*A*Y\\". It is here that the dossier ends.

Through his pioneering studies of watermarks, Stevenson solved \\"the most fascinating, and perhaps the most notorious, bibliographical problem of our time,\\"The Problem of the Missale Speciale, p. 1. the dating of the Missale Speciale or Constance Missal, an undated incunable (book printed before 1501) believed by many to pre-date the Gutenberg Bible (c. 1455), and possibly to have been the first printed European book. Stevenson proved that the book in fact had been printed nearly twenty years later, in 1473. Through similar analysis of watermarks, he also established that most block books, small religious books in which the text and images were printed from a single woodcut block and which many believed dated from the early 15th century, had in fact been printed after 1460. Overview Stevenson was born on June 20, 1903, in Merlin, Ontario, Canada. His family moved to Texas where he attended the Rice Institute in Houston, graduating in 1924, and obtaining an M.A. two years later. After teaching at Rice, he moved to the University of Chicago where he ultimately obtained his doctorate degree in 1949.\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper\\", p. 25. He taught English at both schools.New York Times obituary, Apr. 3, 1970. Stevenson married Rachel Waples.\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper\\", p. 25. He died in Chicago on March 31, 1970.New York Times obituary, Apr. 3, 1970.\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper\\", p. 61. Bibliographical studies Watermarks are twins Handmade paper is manufactured using a metal screen held in a wood frame which is dipped into a paper slurry, after which the frame is shaken in a particular manner to set the fibers of the paper and form a sheet, which is then removed to dry. The screen would usually have attached a design made of copper or brass wire which would leave a slight impression or watermark in the sheet of paper. In his 1952 article \\"Watermarks are Twins\\", Stevenson discussed a fact that few bibliographers then understood, that handmade paper in earlier periods was ordinarily manufactured using twin moulds, the screens of which bore a near duplicate wire image producing almost identical, but nevertheless distinguishable, watermarks. Two workers would use a pair of frames acting in tandem, one using a frame to dip into the paper slurry while the second (the \\"coucher\\") would shake the other frame to set the fibers and would then remove the paper to dry. He also observed that, as the screens were used repeatedly to make paper, the wire figures would suffer distortion, pieces of them sometimes breaking loose and having to be retied to the screen. A stock of paper manufactured by hand thus would contain two closely similar watermarks which define the stock for bibliographic purposes, or as Stevenson said, \\"watermarks like wrens go in pairs.\\"Watermarks are Twins, p. 88. A particular watermark could be uniquely identified by its position with respect to the \\"chainlines\\" formed by the metal screen, its state of freshness or deterioration, and the precise locations where it was tied or retied to the screen, which show up as dots in the watermark.The Problem of the Missale Speciale, pp. 32-35. He would later use these basic observations to date the manufacture of paper used in early printed books. The Missale Speciale In early 1954, the Pierpont Morgan Library (now the Morgan Library & Museum) announced the acquisition of a copy of the Missale Speciale, or the Constance Missal, a rare undated incunable printed from the same type used in the 1457 Psalter printed by Johann Fust and Peter Sch√∂ffer, but seemingly in a more primitive and unfinished state.\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper,\\", p. 45.In fact, the type may have essentially the same type which were manually altered during the printing of the Missal to achieve a more consistent fit between \\"abutting\\" letters. The Problem of the Missale Speciale pp. 8-10. The Morgan Library and many bibliographers believed the Missale Speciale pre-dated the Gutenberg Bible and was the first European book printed using movable type,Review of The Problem of the Missale Speciale, p. 202. basing the belief on the work of Otto Hupp around 1895. The Morgan had purchased the book from the famous rare book dealer Hans P. Kraus, paying him $58,000 in cash and trading four extremely rare books, including two incunables printed by William Caxton.Hans P. Kraus, A Rare Book Saga, G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York (1978), pp. 231-233. Hearing of the Morgan's acquisition, Stevenson began an analysis of its watermarks, and initial work quickly led him to conclude that the paper dated from the 1470s.The Problem of the Missale Speciale p. 31. In 1960, as Stevenson learned that two German bibliographers were reaching the same conclusion, he announced his discovery. In 1962, he published two articles on the Missale Speciale and in 1966 he published his full length study on it, The Problem of the Missale Speciale.\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper,\\", pp. 47-48. In his Problem of the Missale Speciale, Stevenson analyzed the four then known copies of the missal, along with a fifth shorter version. He reported that surviving copies of the book contained several \\"runs\\", i.e., a number of consecutive gatherings of paper, with the same three watermarks (including their twins), a cross on mounts and two different bull's heads under a Tau cross. Stevenson identified several states of these watermarks in the book, reflecting the aging of the watermark as stress was repeatedly applied to the screen in making the paper. He identified the same watermarks in other books which included their dates of printing or were otherwise firmly datable. In fact, some of those books contained both the identical cross on mounts and identical bull's head watermarks. Moreover, he traced the deteriorating states of the bull's head watermarks through a number of dated or datable books, thereby determining the relationship between a particular state of the watermark with the date of the book, and through that analysis, to identify the date of the watermark on the basis of its condition. Through this information, Stevenson precisely dated the printing of the Missale Speciale to the fall of 1473.The Problem of the Missale Speciale, pp. 152-175. Bibliographers now accept this proof that the missal was printed in 1473 as \\"conclusive.\\"\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper,\\", p. 57. Runs and remnants In his works on the Missale Speciale, Stevenson addressed the relationship between the presence of specific watermarked paper and the date of printing, and developed the principle of \\"runs and remnants\\". Many bibliographers had argued that the fact that a watermark in a book whose date is in question also appears in a book with a specific date gives no indication (other than a terminal date) for the printing of the undated book because the printer of the dated book could have used old paper which he or someone else had held for many years. Stevenson observed that, while an individual might hold on to a supply of writing paper for a number of years, a printer, for whom the cost of paper for books was his largest capital investment, would ordinarily use paper soon after it was purchased. In fact, \\"As a rule a particular lot of paper seems to have been obtained and set out for a particular job.\\"The Problem of the Missiale Speciale, p. 55. Where there is a run of paper with a specific watermark, as opposed to an isolated sheet or two, that should indicate that the book was printed shortly after the paper was manufactured and purchased. In contrast, the presence of a single or few sheets with a particular watermark (a \\"remnant\\") might reflect an older paper used, and not be indicative of the actual printing date of a book. Stevenson confirmed this principle by identifying numerous examples of the same watermarks in the Missale Speciale in other dated or datable incunables, the deteriorating states of which fit the chronology of the known dates of the books.The Problem of the Missale Speciale, pp. 48-99. Block books Block books are undated short religious books in which both the text and illustrations were printed from a single woodcut block. In part because of their sometimes crude appearance, it was widely believed that block books dated to the first half of the 15th century and were precursors to printing by movable metal type, invented by Gutenberg in the early 1450s. Written notations of purchase and rubrication dates, however, led some scholars to believe that the books had been printed later.\\"The Quincentennial of Netherlandish Blockbooks\\", p. 83. In the mid-1960s, Stevenson began an extensive study of block books.\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper\\", pp.59-60. Stevenson, however, suffered illness in his later years and never completed that project. In 1967, he published an introduction to his study,\\"The Quincentennial of Netherlandish Blockbooks\\" and years after his death, a draft of his work was published as \\"The Problem of the Blockbooks,\\"\\"The Problem of the Blockbooks\\", in Sabine Mertens et al., Blockb√ºcher des Mittelalters, Mainz (1991), pp. 229-262. based on an unfinished typescript from 1965-66. By comparing the watermarks in the paper used in block books with watermarks in dated documents, he concluded that the \\"heyday\\" of block books was the 1460s, but that at least one dated from about 1451.\\"The Quincentennial of Netherlandish Blockbooks\\".\\"The Problem of the Blockbooks\\". He also determined that block books were frequently reprinted, and that the different reprints or \\"impressions\\" may be distinguished, and dated, by the different paper used to print them.\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper\\", pp. 59-60. Appreciation During his life, Stevenson achieved little formal academic recognition, taking twenty years to get his doctorate and never obtaining tenure as a professor. His teaching career ended in 1952, and he was thereafter \\"unaffiliated.\\"\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper\\", p. 25. He is seen, however, as a major figure in the history of bibliography for his groundbreaking work on watermarks and their uses, and his Problem of the Missale Speciale has been called a \\"bibliographical masterpiece.\\"Review of The Problem of the Missale Speciale,, p. 202. Stevenson's writing style has been highly praised for its \\"sheer pleasure and vitality\\" and he has been called \\"a lord of language.\\"\\"Allan H. Stevenson and the Bibliographical Uses of Paper\\", p. 62. Stevenson also is known for his sense of humor.Review of The Problem of the Missale Speciale, p. 202. In a highly technical study of early printing, for example, he gives the twin bull's head watermarks names like \\"Wideface\\" and \\"Squareface,\\" using \\"Dick Tracy lingo,\\"Allan Stevenson, \\"Paper as Bibliographical Evidence,\\" The Library, 5th ser. 17, p. __ (1962). and then playfully traces them through various incunables as they deteriorate and \\"age:\\" :\\"Wideface and his brother gaze blandly forth from the 16-mm. window between [the type columns] ... finally I come upon these amiable oxen in a dated book. ... [In a late state of the stock,] These old fellows, full of agues and distempers, have been pressed into service long after they should have laid down their burdens....\\"Paul Needham in \\"Allan H.

Consequently, the search for new analgesic agents is being intensively studied by the pharmaceutical industry. The TRPV1 receptor is an ion channel that has been implicated in mediation of many types of pain and therefore studied most extensively. The first competitive antagonist, capsazepine, was first described in 1990, since then development of novel TRPV1 antagonists has come a long way. This effort has led to the identification of several TRPV1 antagonists that have entered clinical trials as analgesic agents. Should these new chemical entities relieve symptoms of chronic pain then this class of compounds may offer one of the first novel mechanisms for the treatment of pain, in many years. History Figure 1. Chili pepper Capsaicin, the active ingredient in chilli pepper was first isolated over a century ago. In 1919 the exact chemical structure of capsaicin was determined and the complete synthesis of the compound was achieved a decade later. Capsaicin has been used as an analgesic for decades, but the therapeutic potential of capsaicin was first recognized as early as 1850. The effects of the pungent chemical, capsaicin, is mediated through the ligand gated ion channel TRPV1. This knowledge set the stage for further research of the function of the TRPV1 receptor and preclinical studies showed evidence of its importance in numerous human diseases. These are the first agents acting by this mechanism that made their way into clinic for evaluation of their use as possible analgesics and therefore important targets for drug development. Many discoveries are yet to be made, both in terms of the range of potential therapeutic applications in addition to analgesia for TRPV1 antagonists and it was only in the last decade where there has been a full understanding of the molecular mechanism. In the years to come it will be clearer if TRPV1 antagonists can fulfill their potential. Vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1/TRPV1 receptor) The vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) is one of six sub-members that belong to the transient receptor potential channel (TRP) superfamily. TRPV1 was the first mammalian member to be discovered and is a non-selective cation channel permeable for calcium. The receptor is made of four identical subunits each with six transmembrane segments, S1-S6, with an aqueous pore between the fifth and sixth segments. This region forms the channel conductive pore and contains the N- and C-termini on the cytosolic side of the cell membrane. Capsaicin and RTX, elicit burning pain by activating a non-selective cation channel expressed on sensory nerve endings. When capsaicin was found to have analgesic effects in preclinical studies much emphasis was put into the research of the receptor/channel that capsaicin binds to and activates. Besides being activated by capsaicin, TRPV1 also responds to a wide range of exogenous and endogenous chemical ligands as well as physical stimuli such as heat over 42 ¬∞C and changes in more diverse activators such as protons (acid, pH<6). TRPV1 is also subject to regulation by changes in membrane potential and this intrinsic voltage-dependence is thought to underlie the gating mechanism of this non-selective cation channel which leads to the influx of sodium and calcium ions. Importantly, TRPV1 activity is also subject to regulation by a host of intracellular signaling cascades such as G-protein coupled receptor signaling, that are implicated in the responses to algogenic agents, inflammatory mediators and injury. Mechanism of action TRPV1 is primarily expressed on, small myelinated and unmyelinated medium size, sensory neurons in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, where sensory neurons cluster. TRPV1 receptors are also found in muscles, joints, the urinary bladder and kidneys. The functional activity of TRPV1 has been demonstrated, within the central nervous system, in the spinal cord and specific sites in the brain including the hypothalamus, cerebellum, locus coeruleus, periaqueductal grey and cortex. Activation of TRPV1 sets off an influx of calcium and sodium ions which in turn initiates a cascade of events that result in membrane depolarization, neuronal firing and transduction of neural impulses. TRPV1 phosphorylates as a response to several algesic agents, resulting in a lower threshold of channel activation. Some substances such as bradykinin, nerve growth factor and protons have been reported to sensitize the TRPV1 receptor. Activation of TRPV1 results in the release of pro-nociceptive peptides, which decreases when treated with TRPV1 antagonists. In general, most channel antagonists bind in the pore region, interacting with residues from all four monomers of the tetrameric channel. Binding Ligands of the TRPV1 receptor seem to act from the intracellular side. This is an unusual property of TRPV1, where ligands of most other ligand-gated channels bind from the extracellular space. Capsaicin is highly lipophilic and can pass the plasma membrane easily. It is generally accepted that capsaicin acts on and binds to the TRPV1 receptor from the intracellular side prior to activation. The critical sites for capsaicin binding are Arg 114 and Glu 761 at the N- and C-termini of the receptor, respectively. Because these two amino acids are charged and located in the cytosolic part of TRPV1 receptor, the two regions are likely to be implicated in hydrophilic interaction of TRPV1 with vanilloids such as capsaicin and RTX. In addition to these sites in N- and C-termini of TRPV1, a region in the intracellular linker sited in the transmembrane domain, called ‚Äòthe TM3 region‚Äô, has been shown to be critical for hydrophobic interaction with vanilloids. The TM3 region is considered to be necessary for binding to vanilloids. It is surrounded by the hydrophobic environment because of its placement in the plasma membrane. Now it is recognized as an important link in hydrophobic interaction with capsaicin. The binding sites Arg 114 and Glu 761 and the TM3 region in TRPV1, together consist of a binding pocket to vanilloids. Drug design Agonists Figure 2. Chemical structure of capsaicin Capsaicin (fig. 2), a naturally occurring vanilloid, is the best known TRPV1 agonist. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is another naturally occurring vanilloid that exhibits TRPV1 agonistic activity. It is more potent than capsaicin and is currently in development as a sensory neuron desensitizing agent. Initially, agonists were the major focus of the TRPV1 ligand development due to the analgesic effect resulting from desensitization of the receptor. However, because of an initial burning effect of all natural vanilloid receptor agonists, including capsaicin, therapy becomes complicated and perhaps ineffective. Attempts to make synthetic agonists with good separation between excitatory effects and the analgesic effects have not been successful. To avoid this persisting side effects of TRPV1 agonists, a focused consideration has been given to competitive antagonists as novel analgesic drugs. Antagonists Intense efforts have been carried out to design both competitive and non-competitive TRPV1 antagonists. Antagonists that bind to the agonist binding site, and lock the channel in the closed, nonconductive state are competitive antagonists. In contrast, antagonists that interact with additional binding sites on the receptor structure preventing receptor opening by the agonist or blocking its aqueous pore are non-competitive antagonists. Non-competitive antagonists acting as open channel blockers are therapeutically attractive because of their recognition of over-activated TRPV1 channels, which can reduce the potential of unwanted side effects. Pharmacophore The pharmacophore model for TRPV1 antagonists consists of three essential features: a hydrogen- bond acceptor, a hydrogen-bond donor, and a ring feature. In addition, the TRPV1 antagonists have been superimposed in such a way that they could fit in the volume of the TRPV1 pore. When the homology model is considered, appropriate interaction sites are found in the receptor pore. The hydrogen- bond acceptor on the ligand is proposed to interact with Tyr 667 (helix S6) on the receptor as a hydrogen-bond donor, and the hydrogen-bond donor on the ligand is proposed to interact with Tyr 667 on the opposite monomer of the tetramer on the receptor as a hydrogen-bond acceptor. The ring feature of the pharmacophore is proposed to fit in the hydrophobic space formed by the aromatic rings of the four Tyr 667 residues of the four monomers. Consistent with the critical role played by Tyr 667 in the interaction with key elements of the TPRV1 antagonist pharmacophore, site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that exchanging this tyrosine for alanine in the rat TRPV1 receptor abolishes functional activity of TRPV1. The lipophilic end in antagonist is varied in character and volume and interacts with the lower end of transmembrane helices S5 and S6. Because the intracellular ends of these helices extend past the membrane, they are likely to be flexible and may be part of the channel opening and closing process. The combined use of a pharmacophore model, assembled from highly optimized TRPV1 antagonists, with a homology model of the protein has enhanced understanding of the observed structure‚Äìactivity relationships of many series of current TRPV1 antagonists, and should be useful in the discovery of new classes of antagonists. Structure activity relationship Figure 3. Structure activity relationship of the capsaicin related compounds oleovanillamine and phenylacetylrivanyl.Capsaicin (fig. 2) has three functional regions: an aromatic A region where a parent homovanillyl (3-methoxy 4-hydroxybenzyl) group is optimal, a B region known as the ester or amide linker and the aliphatic C region where a lipophilic octanyl moiety is associated with the highest potency. The homovanillyl motif and amide bond regions contain dipolar groups which are implicated in hydrogen bonding interactions. Phenolic hydroxide and amide moieties appear to be vital for inducing capsaicin responses. Removal of the phenolic hydroxide or amide bond in capsaicin analogues leads to reduction of potency. The phenolic hydroxide and amide moieties in capsaicin share potential multiple hydrogen bond interactions with the TRPV1 receptor. Capsaicinoids and capsinoids are characterized by an oxygenated aromatic moiety bound via an amide(capsaicinoids) or ester (capsinoids) linker to a lipophilic acyl group. The vanillyl and carbonyl linker contain polar groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds essential for activity, whereas the lipophilic moiety interacts with a corresponding cleft of the vanilloid binding site on TRPV1. Replacement of the medium-sized branched fatty acid of capsaicin with longer fatty acids is damaging for activity, but the presence of unsaturations restores and potentiates activity e.g. oleoylvanillamine (olvanil)(fig. 3a), is 10-fold more potent than capsaicin in TRPV1 activation assays. 1,3-Di(arylalkyl)thioureas Figure 4. Structure-activity relationship of thiourea derivatives Capsazepine (fig. 4a), the first competitive vanilloid antagonist, reported by Novartis group, was aimed at assessing the effect of conformational constraint on the lipophilic C-region of capsaicin. In capsazepine the amide bond of the capsaicin is replaced by a thiourea moiety and a propylidene linker between the aromatic vanillyl 2-carbon A ring and the B-linker amide nitrogen forces the aromatic ring in an orthogonal orientation with respect to the thiourea bond. This constraint has long been considered as the distinctive characteristic of vanilloid antagonism. Capsazepine competes for the capsaicin-binding site on TRPV1 however, due to low metabolic stability and poor pharmacokinetic properties the compound did not reach into clinical development. It was observed later on that this tether was not critical for activity as powerful antagonists free from this structural feature were developed, with 1,3-di(arylalkyl)thioureas emerging as one of the most promising non-vanilloid class of TRPV1 antagonist showing excellent therapeutical potential in pain regulation. Within these compounds, the replacement of the guaiacyl moiety of capsaicinoids with a 3-fluoro-4-sulfonylamido group found critical to revert activity. This led to the design of C-region moiety mimicked on RTX, led to compound seen in figure 4b, that showed excellent analgesic activity in mice. An alternative optimization of the lipophilic C region led to JYL1421 (fig. 4c), another promising clinical candidate. Di(arylalkyl)- and aryl(arylakyl)ureas Figure 5. Structure-activity relationship of urea derivatives Several capsaicin analogs of the urea type were developed by acylation of homovanillylamine and related amines with different 4-(Œ±-pyridyl)piperidine-1-acyl chlorides. The presence of a polar amino moiety in the hydrophobic C region of capsacinoids was crucial to couple potency and hydrophilicity, mimicking similar observations that led to the discovery of phenylacetylrinvanil (fig. 3b) from olvanil (fig. 3a). Phenylacetylrinvanil is the most potent capsaicinoid reported to date, ~500-fold more potent than capsaicin. Several other ureas emerged as remarkably active TRPV1 antagonists. Compared with capsazepine, the piperazinyl urea (fig. 5a and 5b) showed a higher selectivity profile against a wide variety of enzymes and channels whereas the related very potent and specific TRPV1 antagonist A-425619 (fig. 5c) could reduce pain associated with inflammation and tissue injury in rats. Further research has led to a variety of small-molecule antagonists of TRPV1, including the ureas SB-705498 (fig. 5d), SB-452533 (fig. 5e)[16,17] and ABT-102(fig. 5f), compounds that have entered clinical trials. Cinnamides Figure 6. Structure-activity relationship of urea derivatives N-Arylcinnamides have emerged as potent and important class of TRPV1 antagonists, Compound SB-366791, (fig. 6a) shows competitive and specific activity in both human and rat TRPV1 receptors overall profile of receptor selectivity much better than that of capsazepine. Within this series of compounds, AMG-9810 (fig. 6b) exhibited high antagonist potency showing good oral bio-availability in rats and a promising pharmacokinetic profile, boding well for clinical efficacy. Another potent blocker from this group is AMG0347(fig. 6c)that was shown in a postoperative pain trial to be able to decrease capsaicin-induced heat and mechanical hyperalgesia and to block central TRPV1 receptors. Carboxamides Figure 7. Structure-activity relationship of carboxamide derivatives Several TRPV1 antagonists of the carboxamide type have been discovered. They are structurally quite heterogenous, as exemplified by comparison of the nicotinamide derivative SB-782443 (fig. 7a), the thiazolylcarboxamide (fig. 7b), and the tetrahydropyridylcarboxamide (fig. 7c). SB-782443 (fig. 7a) showed excellent potency at human, guinea pig, and rat TRPV1, a favorable in vitro drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics profile, and remarkable in vivo activity in an inflammatory pain model. Based on their in vitro profile, several compounds of this class qualified for preclinical development. Other derivatives Figure 8. Structure-activity relationship of unclassified derivatives Nonclassic antagonists lack the urea, thiourea, or amide groups typical of the classic TRPV1 ligands. Two major structural types of nonclassic antagonists have been discovered. First there are the imidazole derivatives. Starting from a 4,6-disubstituted benzimidazole lead structure, a series of 4,5-biarylimidazoles capable to block both capsaicin and acid-induced calcium influx in TRPV1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. Imidazole (fig. 8a) was identified as a highly potent and orally bioavailable TRPV1. Another class are the diaryl ethers and amines. Compounds from a quinazoline series can be considered as conformationally restricted analogs of a biarylamide series. In terms of activity 5-isoquinoline was found the most active among and ranked in the order of 5-isoquinoline > 8-quinoline > 8-quinazoline > 8-isoquinoline ‚â• cinnoline > phthalazine > quinoxaline > 5-quinoline e.g. AMG517 (fig. 8b), although it lacks any recognizable carbonyl motif it still potently blocks capsaicin, proton, and heat activation of TRPV1 in vitro and shows a good tolerability profile. Also, the clinical candidates from Janssen, Abbott and Merck pharmaceuticals (fig. 8c) having a 5-aminoisoquinoline group as a common feature suggesting that there is a key interaction of this group at the receptor site for TRPV1 antagonist activity. Current status In November 2009, the FDA approved Qutenza (capsaicin, 8% topical patch) for postherpetic neuralgia.https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm191003.htm Clinical trials Figure 9. TRPV1 antagonists in clinical development as of 2009 As of late 2009, available public information suggests that quite a few are in clinical trials. Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing TRPV1 ligands and the emphasis seems to be on both agonists and antagonists. Although the agonists appear to be further along in clinical development. Agonists NeurogesX has successfully completed three Phase III clinical studies of Qutenza (NGX-4010) that met studies primary endpoints. Qutenza is a synthetic trans-capsaicin and drug delivery is by a rapid- delivery patch application system NeurogesX plans to launch Qutenza in the United States in the first half of November 2010.http://www.bio-medicine.org Anesiva, another biotechnology company, has completed two Phase III trials of Adlea (ALGRX 4975), an injectable capsaicin. Adlea is promising as a pain reliever and both trials showed that Adlea's safety profile of adverse events, wound healing, and wound sensory function were similar to placebo over the study duration.http://www.anesiva.com Antagonists At least seven orally active TRPV1 antagonist substances have progressed into clinical development and several more are in preclinical development. The ligand GRC-6211, by Eli Lilly and Company-Glenmark is the most advanced and is currently in phase IIb clinical trials. GlaxoSmithKline, Merck-Neurogen, Amgen and AstraZeneca are all developing TRPV1 antagonist and all are developing substances that have completed phase I trials successfully.

More than 200 different projects with environmental aspects were carried out. And at IOC's 100 years celebration in Paris in 1994, environment was added as the Third Dimension to the Olympics in addition to Sport and Culture. The legacy from Lillehammer has, in a global perspective, followed two paths: \\\\- World Conferences on sport and environment, the first in Lillehammer in 1996 \\\\- Environmental requirements which have to be met by future bidders and organisers of Olympic Games.  Green sports venues  Target Center :The Target Center home of the Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA) has the 5th largest green roof, and if the first arena to have a green roof. It collects rain water and regulates temperatures in both the summer and the winter. It has collected nearly 1 million gallons of rain water and it has diverted it into the Mississippi River. Also on the top of the roof there are different kinds of plants such as prairie coreopsis, wild strawberry, dotted blazing-star, and lupine. Tokyo 2016 Olympics bid :Tokyo is not going to be the host of the 2016 olympics but the city was a candidate. They had said that if they were going to host it they would have the first carbon-minus games. A man-made island called Sea Forest off the Tokyo was going to be the place for the Olympic Cross-Country, Rowing, Canoe, Kayak and mountain bike and BMX competitions. Also they were going to have half a million trees planted on this island by 2016. U2's lead singer Bono was one of the first people to plant a tree on this island. During this major planning stage was also the Vice Governor of Tokyo, Hideo Sugawara, Beijing 2008 swimming medallist, Junichi Miyashita, and thousands of Tokyo 2016 green supporters.

Dancers \\"ride\\" horses made from woven bamboo and decorated with colorful paints and cloth. Generally, the dance portrays troops riding horses, but another type of Kuda Lumping performance also incorporates trances and magic tricks. When the \\"possessed\\" dancer is performing the dance in trance conditions, he can display unusual abilities, such as eating glass and resistance to the effects of whipping or hot coals. Although the dance is native to Java, Indonesia, it also performed by Javanese communities in Suriname, Malaysia and Singapore which is more commonly called Kuda Kepang. Origin Mataram, Lombok (1922) The origin of Kuda Lumping is uncertain. Two main hypotheses have been proposed. The first suggests that Kuda Lumping may have arisen out of Diponegoro's war against the Dutch colonial forces, as a ritual reenactment of battles. The second argues that it is based on Mataram-era troops riding against the Dutch. Kuda Lumping is known under different names in different areas. While Kuda Lumping is the most common name in West Java, in Central Java it is known as Jaran Kepang or Jathilan in East Java; in Bali, it is known as Sang Hyang Jaran. In Bali Sanghyang dance refer to the type of dance involving trance by spirit identified as hyang. Performance Kuda Lumping may be performed in celebration of a special event, such as a boy's circumcision or rite of passage. It may also be performed as entertainment, in a busker style. It is generally performed in a cordoned-off area, with the audience separated from the dancers. Kuda Lumping is traditionally performed by a group of men drawn from the local community; this group can number from two to eight. The performers mount rattan horses and dance while traditional instruments such as the angklung, gongs, and dog-dog drums are played. This portion of the performance ends when a dancer enters a trance, which is traditionally said to be caused by spirit possession. In Sang Hyang Jaran, the audience may participate by forming a chorus and singing. During their trances, the dancers may pretend to eat grass or drink water, while another performer or shaman uses a whip to direct them. In some performances, dancers may walk on coals or eat glass or fire, which can cause various injuries. The dancers also interact with the audience; in busker performances they may ask for money. In some areas the dancers serve as oracles to deliver prophecies. After awakening from their trances, performers claim not to remember anything done while performing. In East Java, the similar dance is called Jathilan, and is a part of Reog Ponorogo performance. A Jathil is the youthful handsome horsemen riding horses made of weaved bamboo. Unlike common jaran kepang however, jathil never performed trance dances and stunts such as eating glass or walk on fiery charcoal. Traditionally jathilan dance was performed by gemblakan, today Jathil usually performed by female dancers. Equipment A female dancer showing her rattan horse Dancers perform using rattan horses, generally colourful and decorated with beads and sequins. Adults use larger horses than children. Children's horses may also be cut from bamboo mats. Performers wear colorful clothes and may occasionally dress as soldiers. The costume may also include small bells strung around the ankle. In comparison to the shaman, the dancers' costumes are more feminized. Symbolism Henry Spiller suggests that Kuda Lumping represents spiritual power and masculine virility, which is \\"wild and uncontrolled ... yet ultimately a good thing\\". Max Richter notes that the erratic movements of the \\"feminized\\" dancers may \\"draw on ideas about the subordinate 'irrational' female\\", while the slower, more deliberate movements of the shaman \\"may be seen as masculine and potent\\". However, he considers this secondary to the conflicts of science versus magic, and good versus bad. He also notes that it serves as a way for young boys to release energy in a non-violent manner. These, of course, are the interpretations of Western academics and do not reflect the views and intentions of the native dancers. Reception Kuda Lumping is widely popular. But, individual observer opinions vary. Some view it as being related to Satan and thus evil, while others see it as being a good influence. A shift in meaning, from a mainly spiritual ritual to entertainment, has been noted. Kuda Lumping has been used as the basis for a dangdut song of the same name.

A scientific myth is a myth about science, or a myth or factoid that is commonly thought to be scientific. Scientific discoveries are often presented in a mythological way with a theory being presented as a dramatic flash of insight by a heroic individual, rather than as the result of sustained experiment and reasoning. For example, Newton's law of universal gravitation is commonly presented as the result of an apple falling upon his head. Newton's observation of an apple falling indeed played a part in starting him thinking about the problem, but it took him about twenty years to develop the theory fully and so the story of the apple has been described as a myth. Other scientific misconceptions include the idea that bats are blind. The extent to which it occurs and is problematic is debatable. The scientific historian Douglas Allchin suggests that mythical accounts are misleading because they present the results as handed down by authority figures and understate the importance of error and its resolution by the scientific method. In responding to this, Westerlund and Fairbanks agreed that romantic accounts of science tend to distort its nature but, in the case of Mendel's discovery of the rules of inheritance, they argue that Allchin's criticism of Mendel's role and reasoning is over-stated.

The first manufactured lunch wagons with seating appeared throughout the Northeastern US in the late 19th century, serving busy downtown locations without the need to buy expensive real estate. It is generally accepted that the name \\"diner\\" as opposed to \\"lunch wagon\\" was not widely used before 1925. The company produced 651 diners between 1906 and 1957, when manufacturing ceased.

There are, in addition to the home, a granary, ice house, chicken house, and work shed. A barn, also built in 1898, burned down in 1973. Together, this complex of buildings, along with the fences, trees, stream, ice ponds, roads, constitutes one of the few complete and operating historic farmsteads in the county. It is currently operated as the Wheeler Historic Farm by the Salt Lake County Parks and Recreation Department.Wheeler Historic Farm website The farm was established by Henry J. Wheeler, the third son of English Mormon converts, who came to Utah in 1852. Born February 18, 1866, Henry grew up on his father's farm in the South Cottonwood (now Murray) area. In 1886, at the age of twenty, he married Sariah Pixton and established his own farm in the vicinity of his father's farm.Beverly Wheeler Mastrim, ‚ÄúHistory of the Henry J, Wheeler Farm, Manuscript, Utah State Historical Society, Salt Lake City,, Utah The present brick home and several outbuildings were constructed in 1898 by Sid Gills and Hans Yorgensen.

The home, according to the 1902 publication, Biographical Record of Salt Lake City and Vicinity, \\"...was planned by Mrs. Wheeler and reflects great credit upon her knowledge of architecture, as it is not only homelike and convenient, but one of the prettiest little farm houses to be found in the county.Biographical Record of Salt Lake City and Vicinity; Containing Biographies of Well-Known Citizens of the Past and Present, National Historical Record Company Chicago, 1902.‚Äù Wheeler farm house, March 2016 The house was built upon a granite foundation, the interior walls were made of adobe, much of which was taken from a previous residence, while the exterior walls were of ochre brick, later painted white. The Wheeler home is Victorian in style. The building is roughly \\"L\\" shaped and has an entry tower at the nexus of the L, there were eleven rooms in the house. The bottom floor had a pantry, kitchen-dining area, and formal dining room, bathroom, living room, parlor, large staircase and hall. Upstairs were four bedrooms with walk-in closets and one large central storage closet. The interior was distinguished by its fine fireplaces, high ceilings, cherry and oak woodworking and staircase. In 1969 Salt Lake County purchased the which comprise today's farm. Wheeler Historic Farm was placed on both the Utah State and National register of Historic Places in 1976. Originally started as a 1976 project of the United States Bicentennial of the American Revolution, the restored museum farm evolved into several buildings including a blacksmith shop, store, and reconstructed barn. An amphitheatre was installed in the 1980s, followed by a large \\"activity barn\\" in the 1990s that would function as a multi-purpose center. In the 2000s, Salt Lake County purchased remaining farmland south of the farm to create South Cottonwood Regional Park.

This predatory prokaryote was first described in 1983 by Esteve et al. as small, anaerobic microbe about 0.6 Œºm wide before being given the name of Vampirococcus in 1986 by Guerrero et al. This prokaryote is a freshwater obligate predator that preys specifically on various species of the photosynthetic purple sulfur bacterium, Chromatium. As an epibiont, Vampirococcus attaches to the cell surface of their prey and \\"sucks\\" out the cytoplasm using a specialized cytoplasmic bridge. They are commonly mentioned as an example of epibionts when discussing strategies employed by bacterial predators. This microbe still has yet to be classified based on genomic sequencing or 16S rRNA because it cannot be sustained long enough outside its natural environment to isolate a pure culture.  Characterization  Vampirococcus is a predatory prokaryotic genus that lives in anaerobic, aquatic conditions. This bacterium is distinguished from other predatory prokaryotes because it feeds upon its prey using epibiosis (also see epibiont). Vampirococcus cells are small and ovoid, being only 0.6Œºm wide. This small size is characteristic of prokaryotes - as they are smaller than eukaryotic cells - and is beneficial for predatory species, as discussed in the Prey and Predation section below. In addition, Vampirococcus specifically preys upon various species within the bacterial genus, Chromatium, a freshwater purple sulfur bacteria. Because Chromatium is a primary producer as a phototroph, it has been suggested that Vampirococcus could be considered a primary consumer as a predator of photosynthetic bacteria. There is some disagreement in the scientific community regarding Vampirococcus's motility. Many papers have stated that this specific predatory prokaryote does not have cilia or flagella, rendering the prokaryote immotile. However, recent scientific papers have begun to describe Vampirococcus specifically with a single polar flagellum that allows it to interact with potential prey in its environment. Other recent articles have referred to Vampirococcus as part of a group of similar organisms known as BALOs (Bdellovibrio And Like Organisms) which are known to be very motile predatory microbes. It is difficult to find recent research specifically about Vampirococcus that elaborates on this topic, so the motility of this organism should be addressed with caution until further research clarifies the matter.  Genomics and phylogeny  As of now, the genome of Vampirococcus has not been sequenced, and the phylogeny and taxonomy of the microbe have not been determined. Despite this fact, Vampirococcus has now been included in a group of microbes known as BALOs, or Bdellovibrio And Like Organisms. These organisms are Gram-negative, obligate predators that exhibit either epibiotic predation or intracellular periplasmic predation. Although these microbes are similar in function, grouping them together does not indicate any close phylogenetic or evolutionary relationships. Only a small portion of the microbes included in BALO have been genetically sequenced. Because Vampirococcus is difficult to culture and sustain in a laboratory outside of its natural environment. Without a pure, isolated culture of this organism, more information regarding its genome, genes, evolutionary relationships with other microbes, cellular functions, and behavior cannot be attained.  Habitat  Currently, Vampirococcus has only been found in two freshwater lakes in northeastern Spain: Lake Estanya and Lake Cis√≥. These lakes were formed in karst areas where rocks underground have been dissolved by groundwater. High concentrations of calcium sulfate and hydrogen sulfide make the lakes anoxic, providing an anaerobic environment to sustain both Vampirococcus and its prey, Chromatium. Cell concentrations of Vampirococcus are highest during the fall months and are indirectly proportional to the cell concentrations of Chromatium, an indication of Vampirococcus's predation.  Prey and predation  Predatory microbes attack and feed off of prey through extracellular or intracellular methods. Since predatory prokaryotes are smaller than their prey, they cannot engulf, or phagocytize, the larger bacteria. This difference in ability and size may have led to the evolution of different predation methods. Vampirococcus utilizes epibiotic predation to feed on specifically on various species of Chromatium. Epibiosis is an extracellular method of predation and requires cell to cell contact between predator and prey. This is the only way in which this predatory acquires nutrients to grow. The steps of Vampirococcus's predation are as follows: # When the predator cell finds its prey ‚Äì through chemotaxis or quorum sensing ‚Äì it attaches to the prey's cell membrane via a cytoplasmic bridge structure. At first, this attachment is reversible but soon becomes permanent. # Vampirococcus then secretes hydrolytic enzymes into the Chromatium bacterium to digest and degrade the cytoplasm. # The nutrients are directly transported into the predator cell. According to observations, Vampirococcus appears to \\"suck\\" out the contents like a vampire. # Once the prokaryote has used all the prey's nutrients and reproduced, Vampirococcus leaves the Chromatium cell dead. All that remains of the prey are the cell membrane and a few intercellular components. As stated previously, Vampirococcus solely preys upon species of Chromatium, a phototrophic purple sulfur bacterium that lives in freshwater. As a bacterium, Chromatium is much larger than Vampirococcus. The benefit of preying on larger microbes is the sheer abundance of nutrients and resources from one individual. In 1986, Guerrero et al. observed that a single Chromatium could sustain up to six Vampirococcus simultaneously. In contrast, predators larger than their prey must phagocytize multiple microbes in order to receive sufficient nutrition.  Reproduction  Vampirococcus can exist freely in its aquatic environment without being attached to another microbe. However, this prokaryote only reproduces when it is attached to a prey bacterium which makes it an obligate predator. Reproduction occurs via binary fission to produce two daughter cells. Vampirococcus does not use Chromatium's cellular machinery to reproduce like a virus. It only uses the bacterium as a source of nutrition, and attachment is merely a requirement for reproduction.  Future research  Currently, research is being conducted to evaluate whether or not predatory prokaryotes can be used in other ways to degrade biofilms and cancerous tumor cells. It has been suggested that if predatory microbes attack and kill a certain type of microbe, then they may exhibit the same behavior toward a cell with characteristics similar to their normal prey. Certain BALOs are already being considered for these specific tasks, particularly Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. Once Vampirococcus is more thoroughly researched and understood, it too could potentially be used to treat cancer or biofilms.

Each year approximately 500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags are used worldwide. Distinguishing \\"biodegradable\\" from \\"compostable\\" In typical parlance, the word biodegradable is distinct in meaning from compostable. While biodegradable simply means an object is capable of being decomposed by bacteria or other living organisms, \\"compostable\\" in the plastic industry is defined as able to decompose in aerobic environments that are maintained under specific controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Compostable means capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials. (ref: ASTM International D 6002) The inclusion of \\"inorganic materials\\" precludes the end product from being considered as compost, or humus, which is purely organic material. Indeed, under the ASTM definition, the only criterion needed for a plastic to be called compostable is that it has to appear to go away at the same rate as something else that one already knows is compostable under the traditional definition. Plastic bags can be made \\"oxo-biodegradable\\" by being manufactured from a normal plastic polymer (i.e. polyethylene) or polypropylene incorporating an additive which causes degradation and then biodegradation of the polymer (polyethylene) due to oxidation. Trade associations The trade association for the oxo- biodegradable plastics industry is the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association, which will certify products tested according to ASTM D6954 or (starting 1 January 2010) UAE 5009:2009 The trade associations for the compostable plastics industry are the Biodegradable Products Institute, \\"European Bioplastics,\\" and SPIBioplastics Council. Money is certified as compostable for industrial composting conditions in the United States if they comply with ASTM D6400, and in Europe with the EN13432. Materials Most bags that are manufactured from plastic are made from corn-based materials, like polylactic acid blends. Biodegradable plastic bags are nowadays as strong and reliable as traditional (mostly polyethylene)-bags. Many bags are also made from paper, organic materials, or polycaprolactone.\\"Store offers biodegradable bags.\\" Aiken Standard (Aiken, SC) (Feb 17, 2009)Wilder, Sam. \\"Festival food recycling: Sun, fun and diversion.\\" BioCycle 47.6 (June 2006): 30(3).Opposing Viewpoints: Pollution. Tamara L. Roleff. San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 2000. Opposing Viewpoints Resource \\"The public looks at biodegradable as something magical,\\" even though the term is broadly used, according to Ramani Narayan, a chemical engineer at Michigan State University in East Lansing, and science consultant to the Biodegradable Plastics Institute. \\"This is the most used and abused and misused word in our dictionary right now. In the Great Pacific garbage patch, biodegradable plastics break up into small pieces that can more easily enter the food chain by being consumed.\\" Recycling In-plant scrap can often be recycled but post-consumer sorting and recycling is difficult. Bio-based polymers will contaminate the recycling of other more common polymers. While oxo-biodegradable plastic manufacturers claim that their bags are recyclable, many plastic film recyclers will not accept them, as there have been no long-term studies on the viability of recycled-content products with these additives. Further, the Biodegradable Plastics Institute (BPI) says that the formulation of additives in oxo films varies greatly, which introduces even more variability in the recycling process. SPI Resin identification code 7 is applicable. Marketing qualification and legal issues Since many of these plastics require access to sunlight, oxygen, or lengthy periods of time to achieve degradation or biodegradation, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, commonly called the \\"green guide,\\" require proper marking of these products to show their performance limits. The Federal Trade Commission provides an example: > Example 1: A trash bag is marketed as \\"degradable,\\" with no qualification or > other disclosure. The marketer relies on soil burial tests to show that the > product will decompose in the presence of water and oxygen. The trash bags > are customarily disposed of in incineration facilities or at sanitary > landfills that are managed in a way that inhibits degradation by minimizing > moisture and oxygen. Degradation will be irrelevant for those trash bags > that are incinerated and, for those disposed of in landfills, the marketer > does not possess adequate substantiation that the bags will degrade in a > reasonably short period of time in a landfill. The claim is therefore > deceptive. Since there are no pass-fail tests for \\"biodegradable\\" plastic bags, manufacturers must print on the product the environmental requirements for biodegradation to take place, time frame and end results in order to be within US Trade Requirements. In 2007, the State of California essentially made the term \\"biodegradable bags\\" illegal, unless such terms are \\"substantiated by competent and reliable evidence to prevent deceiving or misleading consumers about environmental impact of degradable, compostable, and biodegradable plastic bags, food service ware, and packaging.\\" In 2010, an Australian manufacturer of plastic bags who made unsubstantiated or unqualified claims about biodegradability was fined by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which is the Australian equivalent of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In recent years, the Biodegradable Products Institute and related companies have claimed products compost in available compost facilities at 60 ¬∞C (140 ¬∞F). The Vermont attorney general found these claims to be misleading and sued compostable plastic companies for false claims.

She was a pedagogical innovator who was specifically interested in caring people with mental challenges as well as organic horticulture. In 1930, when Sesselja moved to Iceland, she kept in contact with other pioneers in organic farming and anthroposophy around Europe as the preparation to create a physical space where childcare could be achieved in a self-sustained community in a land with streams, hot springs and other natural surroundings.

After World War II, besides Sesselja's foster children and the summer children, nearly all the children in S√≥lheimar had disabilities. Today all activities in S√≥lheimar are based on Sesselja's lifework and visions: what started out as an isolated and primitive settlement in 1930 with around ten small children has now become a modern, self-supporting eco-village with organic farming, thermal and solar energy and with a thriving cultural life.S√≥lheimar, a place in the sun, Bertine Krol, http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/documentaries/051012doc- redirected Inspired by the theories of Rudolf Steiner, Sesselja‚Äôs focus was the interaction between the individual and the environment.

She made a home for children in S√≥lheimar and focused her work on organic horticulture (the first in the Nordic countriesOrganic gardening and forestry activities in the S√≥lheimar Ecovillage http://www.volunteerabroad.com/listingsp3.cfm/listing/26306), healthy food and artistic expression. Many of these ideas sparked controversy with the authorities because at the time, it was perceived that ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù children should not play with those with special needs. It was also viewed that the high-vegetable diet promoted by Sesselja was, in fact, not healthy for the children. Although Sesselja's proactive ideas were hard to be accepted, such disagreements have faded into history and the S√≥lheimar community continues to support a healthy lifestyle for everyone in the village. Ideology The heart of the S√≥lheimar ideology is to give all individuals a fair chance and to maximise their potential. By focusing on individuals' possibility instead of their limitations, S√≥lheimar aims to create the space for each resident to take every opportunity that arises for each person to grow and develop. Versatility is the strength of S√≥lheimar so people with special needs that reside here will always be the centre of the community. This works through the idea of reverse integration: those without special needs adapt to the abilities of those who do thus they can work together to make their community one of an equal and sustainable one. The foundation of the ideology of S√≥lheimar derives from the visions and lifework of Sesselja herself. Her life was strongly influenced by Icelandic reality in the beginning of the 20th century, the anthroposophical theories of Rudolf Steiner and Christian values.  Sesseljuh√∫s  On the 70-year anniversary of S√≥lheimar, July 5, 2000, Siv Fri√∞leifsd√≥ttir broke ground for the construction of Sesseljuh√∫s, and announced the government's decision to provide 75 million ISK for the construction of the building. The project was completed on July 5, 2002, 100 years after the birth of Sesselja Sigmundsd√≥ttur. The Sesseljuh√∫s Environmental Centre acts as an example for sustainable buildings. It was designed and constructed with the goal of environmental sustainability, which took into account the origin, the production, and the recovery of any materials, specifically to Icelandic conditions. Nowadays, Sesseljuh√∫s is wooden with a turf roof. Sesseljuh√∫s is working in collaboration with national and international groups for environmental education and employment. In addition, the house is used as a community space (i.e. watch films) for the residents of S√≥lheimar. The founder of S√≥lheimar, Sesselja H. Sigmundsd√≥ttir, was far ahead of her times in sustainability. Even day, S√≥lheimar is built to work on her ideals. The community emphasis is placed on organic farming and the use of natural and recyclable materials in work places. Sesseljuh√∫s has an auditorium that could bear 100 people. It holds educational meetings, conferences and seminars on environmental issues for the public, schools, businesses, institutions, and unions. Sesseljuh√∫s may also be rented out for public meetings and workshops.

A year later, he made his second Pro Tour appearance, again at the World Championship. It was not until 2005 that he began to attract attention, when he reached the top 8 of Grand Prix Porto Alegre, his hometown. The following season da Rosa had his breakthrough. Alongside teammates Willy Edel and Celso Zampere, he made the finals of Pro Tour Charleston, before losing to Tomohiro Kaji, Tomoharu Saitou, and Shouta Yasooka. Just two events later, da Rosa made the top eight again. At Worlds in Paris, he lost in the quarterfinals to the eventual champion, Makihito Mihara, who drew exactly the right card at the last possible moment to win the match. Da Rosa also captained the Brazilian national team to a fourth-place finish. This finish earned him level six, then the highest level in the pro players club, qualified Carlos Rom√£o for all Pro Tour events the following season, and earned invitations to Pro Tour Geneva for the other two members of the team. 2007 was a slower year for da Rosa. He failed to make the top eight of any Pro Tour, and failed to earn money at a Pro Tour for the first time at Pro Tour Yokohama. In 2008 he returned to the top eight. At Pro Tour Hollywood he reached the quarterfinal, losing to eventual player of the year Shuhei Nakamura. Playing almost the same deck, he repeated this feat at the World Championship in Memphis. Despite being considered a heavy favourite, he lost his quarterfinal match to American player Jamie Parke. 2009 started weakly for da Rosa, with day one exits at Pro Tours Kyoto, and Honolulu. However, da Rosa excelled off the Pro Tour, with two Grand Prix top eights and a win at the Brazilian national championship. At Pro Tour Austin, da Rosa made the top eight again, making him the first South American to reach the top eight of five Pro Tours. He made yet another quarterfinal exit, losing to Tsuyoshi Ikeda. In the 2010 season, da Rosa became only the seventh player to reach six Pro Tour top eights when he won Pro Tour San Juan. At the World Championship that year, da Rosa reached his seventh top eight, losing to the eventual champion, Guillaume Matignon, in the semifinals. Another Grand Prix top eight followed in Providence in the 2011 season, and just a week later he won Grand Prix Singapore. Da Rosa went on to make his eighth Pro Tour Top 8 at the 2011 World Championship. Paulo made a strong start to the 2012 season, placing 3rd at Grand Prix Orlando and reaching the finals of his ninth Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour Dark Ascension in Honolulu. Da Rosa was invited to the first Players Championship as the highest ranked South American player, where he finished 3rd. The same year, da Rosa was voted into the Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame, receiving 85.65% of the votes. His induction was conducted at Pro Tour Return to Ravnica in October 2012. The following seasons were less successful for da Rosa. He made no further Pro Tour top 8s, and at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 Pro Tour season he only had 28 points, resulting in Silver level status in the Pro Players Club, where he previously had Platinum status or the equivalent of Platinum since 2006. He maintained his Silver status after the 2013‚Äì14 Pro Tour season, collecting 33 points. He did put up three Grand Prix top 8 finishes in 2014, however, after none in 2013, and qualified for the 2014 World Championships, where he finished 23rd. After two disappointing seasons, the 2014‚Äì15 season was a successful one for da Rosa. Although he didn't finish in the top 8 of any Pro Tours, he made the top 8 of three Grand Prix events, winning one, and put up a strong 13th-place finish at Pro Tour Dragons of Tarkir. Most of his top finishes during this season were with the deck called 'Esper Dragons'. By the season's end, da Rosa had amassed 51 Pro Points, good enough for Platinum status in the Pro Players Club, captainship of the Brazilian National team, and an invitation to the 2015 World Championship. The 2015‚Äì16 season, Paulo took 11th place at 2015 World Championship. He would go on to make his tenth Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour Battle For Zendikar, the first Pro Tour of the season. As such, Paulo was at that point in joint second for the most Pro Tour Top 8s of all time alongside Kai Budde. Paulo would also be joined in the Top 8 by the man with the most Pro Tour Top 8s, Jon Finkel, who extended his own record to 16 Pro Tour Top 8s. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, Paulo gained two more Grand Prix placements (Top 4 at Team GP Rotterdam, and finalist at GP Prague), before breaking from Kai Budde's record to gain his eleventh Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour Aether Revolt. In the final Pro Tour of the season (Pro Tour Hour of Devastation) he gained his twelfth Pro Tour Top 8 and second Pro Tour win, with this last accomplishment also making him the Player of the Year.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 855. Lookingglass is considered a suburb of Roseburg. History The valley was named in 1846 by surveyor Hoy Flournoy, who said the beautiful green grass of the valley reflected light almost as well as a mirror. Flournoy later returned to settle in the area. The Lookingglass Store, built in 1852, was once the terminus for the Oakland to Lookingglass stage and freight road. It was also the beginning of the Coos Bay Wagon Road. Today the store continues to serve as the hub of the community and is the oldest business in Douglas County. Lookingglass also has a school, a grange hall, a church and a fire station. Lookingglass post office closed in 1942. In the 1970s, Lookingglass, population 40 at the time, received national media attention for installing a two-horse parking meter, a telephone booth, and a fire hydrant. Lookingglass became a minor tourist attraction. When the fire hydrant was dedicated in 1971, it was accompanied by two manhole covers, which covered nothing, donated by a Eugene, Oregon iron company and the mayor of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. David Brinkley anchored his segment of the NBC Nightly News from the steps of the Lookingglass Store in 1974, while passing through Oregon to do a series of short news stories. Chet Huntley, David Brinkley's co-anchor of the Huntley-Brinkley Report, was the great-grandson of the Lookingglass area's first settler, Daniel Huntley, who arrived in 1851. The James Wimer Octagonal Barn near Lookingglass was built in 1892 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Lookingglass is located in west-central Douglas County in the valley of Lookingglass Creek, a tributary of the South Umpqua River. The community is southwest of Roseburg, the county seat, via Lookingglass Road. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Lookingglass CDP has an area of , all of it land. Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 ¬∞F. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Lookingglass has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Lookingglass, Oregon Education Lookingglass Elementary School is part of the Winston-Dillard School District.

Groundwater is water that has seeped down beneath Earth's surface and has come to reside within the pore spaces in soil and fractures in rock, this process can create water tables and aquifers, which are large storehouses for groundwater. An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with the nonliving aspects of their environment (such as air, soil, water, and even groundwater). With a few exceptions, the interaction between various ecosystems and their respective groundwater is a vital yet poorly understood relationship, and their management is not nearly as advanced as in-stream ecosystems.  Methods of identification   Isotopes  Examining the composition of stable isotopes in the water found in soil, rivers, groundwater, and xylem (or vein systems) of vegetation, using mass spectroscopy, which measures and sort the masses in a sample, along with data on the changes in groundwater depth coupled with the time and vegetative rooting patterns, shows spatial changes over time in the use of groundwater by the vegetation in its respective ecosystem.  Plants  A groundwater- dependent ecosystem can also be inferred through plant water use and growth. In areas with high rainfall groundwater reliance can be seen by monitoring the water use made by the plants of the ecosystem in relation to the water storage in the soil of the area. If the use of water in the vegetation exceeds that of the water being stored in the soil it is a strong indication of groundwater utilization. In areas of prolonged drought the continuation of water flow and plant growth are highly indicative of a groundwater reliant area.  Remote sensing/Geographical Information Systems (GIS)  Remote Sensing is the scanning of Earth by satellite or aircraft to obtain information. GIS is a system designed to capture, store, analyze and manage geographic data. Together the data collected (such as elevation and bore holes measuring groundwater levels) can very accurately predict where groundwater-dependent ecosystems are, how extensive they are, and can guide field expeditions to the right areas for further confirmation and data collection on the GDEs.  Classification  Due to the high variety of ecosystems and their individual fluctuation in dependency on groundwater there is some uncertainty when it comes to defining an ecosystem strictly as groundwater-dependent or merely groundwater-using. Each ecosystem expresses a varying degree of dependency. An ecosystem can be directly or indirectly dependent, as well as have a variation in groundwater use throughout the seasons. There are a variety of methods for classifying types of groundwater-dependent ecosystems either by their geomorphological setting and/or by their respective groundwater flow mechanism (deep or shallow).  Terrestrial   Arid to humid environments  Arid to humid terrestrial environments with no standing water but deeply rooted vegetation relies upon groundwater to support the producers of their ecosystem. The deeply rooted vegetation requires the groundwater to maintain a consistent or semi-consistent level to allow for their continued health and survival.  Aquatic   Springs  Springs, arguably, rely the most heavily on the continued contribution of groundwater because they are a natural discharge from relatively deep groundwater flows rising to the surface. Springs are often in association with uniquely adapted plants and animals. Wetlands in Donana  Wetlands  Wetlands require a shallow discharge of groundwater, it flows as a seepage into depressions in the land surface, in some instances wetlands feed off of perched groundwater which is groundwater separated from the regular water table by an impermeable layer. Marshes are a type of wetland and though not directly reliant on groundwater they use it as an area of recharge. Bogs, are also a type of wetland that is not directly reliant on groundwater but uses the presence of groundwater to provide the area with recharge as well as buoyancy.  Rivers  Venice lagoon Rivers collect groundwater discharge from aquifers. This can happen seasonally, intermittently or constantly, and can keep an area's water needs stable during a dry season.  Coastal   Lagoons/estuaries  Lagoons and estuaries use groundwater flow to help dilute the salinity in the water and helps support their distinctly unique coastal ecosystems.  Threats   Extraction  The extraction of groundwater in both large and smaller amounts lowers the areas water table, and in too large of quantities can even collapse parts of the aquifer and permanently damage the quantity of water the aquifer can store.  Urbanization   Pollution  Due to the increase in populated areas estuaries and other aquatic ecosystems face a greater threat of pollution. In many cases groundwater can become polluted through toxins, or even just excessive amounts of certain nutrients seeping down to the water table. This polluting of the groundwater can have many different effects on the related ecosystems in the case of an estuary in Cape Cod it was noted that an influx of new nitrogen had come from septic tank fields in the groundwater's flow path. Increased levels of nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems can cause eutrophication which is the process of excessive introduction of nutrients causing an abundance of plant growth which can result in the death of a variety of aquatic life.  Recharge  Urbanization of land has significant effects on groundwater recharge, deforestation and urbanizing limits the amount of surface area viable for water to actually infiltrate and contribute to the groundwater.

The key strategies used in reef protection include defining measurable goals and introducing active management and community involvement to reduce stressors that damage reef health. One management technique is to create Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that directly limit human activities such as fishing. Recreational scuba diving can have a measurable adverse impact on tropical coral reefs, mostly due to contact damage of brittle and fragile branched stony corals. This can be reduced by improving diver buoyancy and trim skills, and by educating divers on the consequences of clumsy behaviour on the reef ecosystem. It takes approximately 10 thousand years for coral polyps to form a reef, and between 100,000 and 30 million years for a fully mature reef to form.  Coral reefs  Coral reefs are among the most productive and biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth. Differences in exposure to wave patterns create a variety of habitat types. The coral need a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae algae in order to build a reef. The single celled algae derive their nutrients by using photosynthesis, and the coral provide shelter to the algae in return for some of the nutrients. Zooxanthellae populations can die with changing environmental conditions, causing the coral to lose color, known as coral bleaching. Coral receive their vibrant colors from the different species of zooxanthellae that inhabit them.  Ecosystem services  Corals provide millions of people with ecosystem services such as fisheries, medicine, tourism and recreation, coastal protection as well as aesthetic and cultural benefits, yet they constitute a mere 0.2% of the world's marine ecosystems.  Biodiversity  Also known as the \\"rainforests of the sea,\\" coral reefs cover 1% of the ocean yet provide a habitat to over 9 million species, approximately one fourth of all marine life, for food, shelter, and even hunting grounds for predators. Species found on coral reefs include fish, invertebrates, birds, and megafauna such as sharks, sea turtles, and marine mammals. Finally, they serve as essential spawning, nursing, and breeding grounds for numerous organisms.  Coastal Protection  Coral reefs provide complex structures that buffer the ocean's waves, protecting coastlines from strong currents and nasty storms. Approximately 500 million people live within 100 km of coral reefs and rely on them for this protection. Not only are they critical in preventing the loss of lives, property damage, and erosion, but they also serve as a barrier for harbors and ports that depend on them economically.  Fisheries  Over a billion people globally depend on the fish that live among coral reefs as a major food source. It is estimated that half of all US commercial and recreational fisheries depend on coral reefs to provide them over $100 million annually. Globally, fisheries account for $5.7 billion of the net income provided by coral reefs.  Medicine  Species found in coral ecosystems produce chemical compounds that are used to develop new medicines to treat cancer, arthritis, asthma, heart disease, ulcers, bacterial infections, and viruses. As early as the 14th century, the medicinal properties of coral reef dwelling species were utilized. Antiviral extracts and tonics continue to be studied and toxic compounds such as neurotoxins discovered in coral reefs have proven beneficial as painkillers. The limestone skeleton of coral has been tested and used for human bone grafts, due to its porous nature and has a lower rate of rejection than artificial bone graft materials.  Tourism & Recreation  Millions of scuba divers and snorkelers visit coral reefs every year to observe their incredible beauty, as well as beachgoers who are protected by the reefs. Local economies rely heavily on coral reefs, receiving about $9.6 billion through diving tours, recreational fishing trips, hotels, and restaurants.  General interests  There are four main categories of interest the public should have for the preservation of coral reefs: the preservation of natural beauty and value, the promotion of the local economy, potential source of new biological products, and preservation of the world ecosystems of which they are a part. Over one- third of marine species live in coral reef ecosystems. These provide a beautiful underwater experience for snorkelers and divers with a significant tourism value. This great genetic biodiversity has a lot of potential for industries like pharmaceutics, biochemistry, and cosmetics. This biodiversity also boosts the economy through an increase in marine tourism and commercial fisheries. Long-term, coral reefs have been recognized as large contributors to the absorption of carbon dioxide emissions which has been an important part of the mitigation of climate change.  Stressors  Two types of stressors are associated with reef systems: natural and human-induced. The effects of these stressors can range from negligible to catastrophic. Debris on the coast of Hawaii.The warming waters, ocean pH changes and sea level rise associated with climate change operate on a global basis. Localized examples include residential, developmental, agricultural and industrial runoff, sedimentation from land clearing, human sewage and toxic discharges. Acute stressors can inflict other damage, via unsustainable fishing practices, boat anchors or accidental groundings. Some fishing practices are destructive to reef habitats, such as bottom trawling, dynamite fishing and cyanide fishing. Ghost fishing (unintended damage from abandoned fishing equipment) harms many coral reefs. Even small-scale fishing can damage reefs if herbivores are removed and thereby not allowed to protect reefs from encroachment by algae. Boaters can damage coral by dropping their anchors on reefs instead of sand.Bartels, Paul. \\"Fragile reefs: handle with care.\\" Cruising World 22.n1 (Jan 1996). 15 Oct. 2009 . Accidental boat groundings can obliterate areas of coral reef. Lettuce corals and branching corals such as elkhorn and finger coral are fragile, but even massive boulder corals can be crushed or broken and turned upside down to die by a sailboat keel. Groundings in sand, or even the churning action of propellers, can cause major localized siltation, indirectly killing adjacent corals. During the 20th century recreational scuba diving was considered to have generally low environmental impact, and was consequently one of the activities permitted in most marine protected areas. Basic diver training has concentrated on an acceptable risk to the diver, and paid less attention to the environment. The increase in the popularity of diving and in tourist access to sensitive ecological systems has led to the recognition that the activity can have significant environmental consequences. Scuba diving has grown in popularity during the 21st century, as is shown by the number of certifications issued worldwide. Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. Tropical coral reefs are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than reefs where the environment is more robust. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way.  Sediment  Sediment pollution from land has severe consequences for coral reef ecosystems. However, even along one coastline, separate reefs can experience different water flow conditions that affect sediment distribution. A 2015 study assessed sediment from two streambeds less than a mile apart on the island of LƒÅna ªi, Hawaii. One site experienced quick- moving currents that efficiently flushed away sediment, protecting the reef, while the other was subjected to currents and wave conditions that allowed sediment to be continuously re-suspended in the water, starving the reef of light.  Overfishing  The vast biodiversity of coral reefs consequently create an abundant fishing area for locals. This leads to overfishing of reef herbivore organisms which makes the coral reefs more vulnerable and unable to recover from large environmental disturbances. Unfortunately, most marine ecologists expect future oceans to be more overfished than now.  Other  See Environmental issues with coral reefs#Issues  Restoration  Coral growing in an aquaculture tank It is difficult to create a substantial plan for the protection of coral reefs due to their location out in open water; there is no distinct ownership over certain parts of the ocean, which creates difficulty in delegating responsibility. But private and government groups whose purpose is to help the environment have made steps towards the restoration of coral reefs. The aim of coral restoration is to help coral adapt to stressors and changing environments. NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program and Damage Assessment, Remediation and Restoration Program approaches restoration by responding to and restoring physically damaged reefs, preventing the loss of habitat, implementing coral conservation projects, focusing on restoring endangered coral species and controlling invasive species. The Coral Restoration Foundation has restored over 100 genotypes of staghorn corals (Acropora cervicornis) using coral nurseries, and also has research goals of determining ecological success, ideal restoration locations and how surrounding organisms affect restoration. Laboratories located near reefs, such as Elizabeth Moore International Center for Coral Reef Research & Restoration ‚Äî which has planted more than 43,000 corals in the Florida Keys ‚Äî play a crucial role in maintaining these nurseries.  Managing stream flow  Sediment flux can be reduced in steep watersheds on montane tropical islands in the Hawaiian archipelago by restoring vegetation and controlling invasive species. Gabions ‚Äî check dams ‚Äî created by planting normally invasive kiawe trees by a local community group, stopped 77 tons of sediment from flowing into the ocean that would have needed about five weeks of natural water flow to flush from the reef.  Coral nurseries  Coral aquaculture, the process of using coral nurseries to restore the world's reefs is a project that is capable of improving biodiversity, structural integrity and coral cover. Coral nurseries can provide young corals for transplantation to rehabilitate areas of reef decline or physical damaged. Direct transplantation is a common process where corals from coral nurseries or salvaged coral that has been dislodged is transplanted and attached in a new area.Bayraktarov E, Banaszak AT, Montoya Maya P, Kleypas J, Arias-Gonza¬¥lez JE, Blanco M, et al. (2020) Coral reef restoration efforts in Latin American countries and territories. PLoS ONE 15 (8): e0228477. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal. pone.0228477 In this process, coral gametes are harvested from spawning grounds and grown in a laboratory environment, then replanted when they grow larger. This allows the coral to grow safely in controlled amounts under lab conditions. Nurseries can begin as small patches of rescued coral colonies, and may be salvaged and restored before transplantation. In 2009, The Nature Conservancy began to grow over 30,000 young coral in underwater nurseries in Florida and the Caribbean for transplantation. Marine protected areas This map shows all the marine reserve areas around the Santa Barbara Channel islands, where fishing is not permitted. Also labeled are marine conservation areas and visitor centers on the mainland. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become an increasingly prominent tool for reef management. MPAs promote responsible fishery management and habitat protection. Much like national parks and wildlife refuges, and to varying degrees, MPAs restrict potentially damaging activities. MPAs encompass both social and biological objectives, including reef restoration, aesthetics, biodiversity and economic activity. MPAs have not been universally accepted. Conflicts relate to lack of participation, clashing views, effectiveness and funding. Many MPAs offer inadequate protection for coral reefs. Only 27% of coral reefs are in MPAs globally. Only 15% of MPA sites were considered effective, with 38% partially effective and 47% ineffective. This leaves only 6% of coral reefs in effectively managed MPAs. In some situations, as in Kiribati's Phoenix Islands Protected Area, MPAs provide revenue that is potentially equal to the income they would have generated without controls. Biosphere reserve, marine park, national monument and world heritage status can protect reefs. For example, Belize's Barrier reef, Chagos archipelago, Sian Ka'an, the Galapagos islands, Great Barrier Reef, Henderson Island, Palau and PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument are world heritage sites. The Parcel de Manuel Lu√≠s Marine State Park protects the largest coral reef in the South Atlantic. This became a Ramsar Site in February 2000. In Australia, the Great Barrier Reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and is the subject of much legislation, including a biodiversity action plan. Inhabitants of Ahus Island, Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, have followed a generations-old practice of restricting fishing in six areas of their reef lagoon. Their cultural traditions allow line fishing, but not net or spear fishing. The result is both the biomass and individual fish sizes are significantly larger than in places where fishing is unrestricted.

He later organised the fight against the revolutionaries in Dresden and in Baden, and the suppression of the Palatinate revolt. In 1850 he submitted his resignation, due to differences of opinion between him and King Frederick William IV. His resignation was also caused by power disputes between the King and his minister. The King had made appointments without the minister's counter-signature that was usual in other ministries. After his resignation as minister, Strotha was made a Lieutenant General in 1850, as well as commander of the 2nd Artillery inspection, and chairman of the artillery examination board, before retiring in 1854.

The castle is located on the Lake Le≈õnia, near the Kwisa river, in what is now the Polish part of Upper Lusatia. Czocha castle was built on gneiss rock, and its oldest part is the keep, to which housing structures were later added. History Czocha Castle began as a stronghold, on the Czech- Lusatian border. Its construction was ordered by Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, in the middle of the 13th century (1241-1247). In 1253 castle was handed over to Konrad von Wallhausen, Bishop of Meissen. In 1319 the complex became part of the dukedom of Henry I of Jawor, and after his death, it was taken over by another Silesian prince, Bolko II the Small, and his wife Agnieszka (see Duchy of Silesia). Origin of the stone castle dates back to 1329. Overview of the castle Czocha Castle, view from the Kwisa river In the mid-14th century, Czocha Castle was annexed by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia. Then, between 1389 and 1453, it belonged to the noble families of von Dohn and von Kluks. Reinforced, the complex was besieged by the Hussites in the early 15th century, who captured it in 1427, and remained in the castle for unknown time (see Hussite Wars). In 1453, the castle was purchased by the family of von Nostitz, who owned it for 250 years, making several changes through remodelling projects in 1525 and 1611. Czocha's walls were strengthened and reinforced, which thwarted a Swedish siege of the complex during the Thirty Years War. In 1703, the castle was purchased by Jan Hartwig von Uechtritz, influential courtier of Augustus II the Strong. On August 17, 1793, the whole complex burned in a fire. In 1909, Czocha was bought by a cigar manufacturer from Dresden, Ernst Gutschow, who ordered major remodelling, carried out by Berlin architect Bodo Ebhardt, based on a 1703 painting of the castle. Gutschow, who was close to the Russian Imperial Court and hosted several White emigres in Czocha, lived in the castle until March 1945. Upon leaving, he packed up the most valuable possessions and moved them out. After World War II, the castle was ransacked several times, both by soldiers of the Red Army, and Polish thieves, who came to the so-called Recovered Territories from central and eastern part of the country. Pieces of furniture and other goods were stolen, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the castle was home to refugees from Greece (see Greek Civil War). In 1952, Czocha was taken over by the Polish Army. Used as a military vacation resort, it was erased from official maps. The castle has been open to the public since September 1996 as a hotel and conference centre. The complex was featured in several movies and television series, including a popular 1963 comedy, Gdzie jest genera≈Ç? (Where is the General?), Legenda, Wied≈∫min, Beyond Sherwood Forest, Spellbinder and serial The Secret of the Cipher Fortress. From 2014 to 2019, the castle was used as the setting of the College of Wizardry, a live action role-playing game (LARP) that takes place in their own universe and can be compared to Harry Potter.

He is a full professor of Drama and African American studies at the University of California, Irvine. He received his BA in government and philosophy from Dartmouth College, his Masters in Fine Arts from Columbia University and his PhD in Rhetoric and Film Studies from the University of California, Berkeley. Life Wilderson was born in New Orleans, and grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Minneapolis, Minnesota during the U.S. civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. In his youth, Wilderson lived around or near colleges or universities as his father was a university professor. He began engaging in activism at a young age. In middle school in Chicago, where his family lived when his father was on sabbatical, he organized a civil disobedience campaign to make the \\"Pledge of Allegiance\\" non-mandatory at his school. When Wilderson's family moved to Berkeley, California he joined the civil rights riots there. Student activists and intellectuals were regulars in his parents' home throughout his early life, and his family was supportive of the Black Panthers.Wilderson, Frank B. Incognegro : A Memoir of Exile & Apartheid / Frank B. Wilderson III. Cambridge, Mass.: South End, 2008. Print. Wilderson moved across the country to study European Philosophy and Comparative Government at Dartmouth College in September 1974 to begin his undergraduate education. Wilderson's sister Fawn Wilderson-Legos also attended the school. He continued to organize protests and engage in civil disobedience while in university and was suspended for two years after being arrested in relation to a protest against the poor conditions of immigrant construction workers there. While suspended, Wilderson worked as a labourer, freelance writer, and garbage man, hitchhiking around the U.S. Back at Dartmouth, he participated in work at the Afro- American Society house there, was president of the Black Student Union, and a member of the historically black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha. At Dartmouth, Wilderson also played football for the first two seasons he was there, in the position of outside linebacker. After graduating, he worked for several years as a stockbroker in Minneapolis until returning to school to get an MFA in Creative Writing at Columbia University. In the 1990s, he lived in Johannesburg, South Africa, for five years, teaching at University of Witwatersrand, Vista University, and Khanya College. There, he was one of two Americans elected to the African National Congress (ANC) in 1992 led by Nelson Mandela, and was a member of the paramilitary guerrilla group Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) led by Nelson Mandela. During his time in South Africa he taught regularly at universities and helped the ANC to develop anti-apartheid propaganda. Wilderson received an MA, and then Ph.D. in the Rhetoric Department, Film Studies Program at UC Berkeley. In Berkeley, he helped organized a protest against the arrest and trial members of the Third World Liberation Front. However, Wilderson was arrested and charged for felonies related to his actions in the protest. Critical work Wilderson has been described as one of the first writers in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. In \\"Grammar and Ghosts: The Performative Limits of African Freedom,\\" Wilderson, the emergence of the nation(ality) is the violent grammar that originates in slavery. He writes, ‚ÄúNo other place-names depend on such violence. No other nouns owe their integrity to this semiotics of death.‚Äù This violence gives way to a mark (‚Äúlet‚Äôs face it‚Äù), where to be African, to be African American, to be Caribbean, is to be ‚Äúshaped and comprised by slavery.‚Äù African descended ‚Äúpeoples,‚Äù share a history and a violence in every gesture and thus, Wilderson‚Äôs tracing of history begins with slavery and thus, the violence that configures the ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù does not only misstep in attempting to cohere around a nationality but also fails in attempting a coherence of the identity at all. Wilderson's writing has appeared in Social Identities; Social Justice, Les Temps Modernes, O Magazine Konch, Callaloo Obsidian II, and Paris Transcontinental. His political memoir Incognegro: a Memoir of Exile and Apartheid chronicles his time in Johannesburg when he participated in the African National Congress (ANC) and worked as a university professor there. The book ends after he returned to the US and began his graduate program at UC Berkeley. Wilderson describes the complex relationship he had to the US coming back.

Ramnoth, based on a story by R. K. Narayan. Subbu also starred in the film alongside Pushpavalli and M. S. Sundari Bai. Javar Seetharaman and Gemini Ganesan made their acting debuts in the film appearing in minor supporting roles. The film focuses on Malini (Pushpavalli), an impoverished woman who joins her actress friend Sundari's (M. S. Sundari Bai) theatre company Kala Mandhiram and becomes a success. Things take a turn for the worse when she befriends a charlatan named Sampath (Kothamangalam Subbu). Miss Malini ridiculed aspects of life in Madras (now Chennai) during the World War II period, and was the only story written by Narayan for the screen that came to fruition. It was released on 26 September 1947, and was accompanied in theatres by Cinema Kadhambam, the first animated film produced in South Indian cinema. Miss Malini was praised by intellectuals; Subbu's performance as Sampath was widely appreciated. The songs composed by S. Rajeswara Rao and Parur S. Anantharaman became popular, and the film gained cult status in Tamil cinema. Miss Malini marked Narayan's earliest use of story elements that would recur in some of his later novels. It was later rewritten by him as the 1949 novel Mr. Sampath ‚Äì The Printer of Malgudi, which in turn was adapted into the Hindi film Mr. Sampat (1952) directed by S. S. Vasan, and a 1972 Tamil film directed by Cho Ramaswamy. Although no print of Miss Malini is known to survive, thereby making it a lost film, surviving artefacts include its songs, along with a few stills and newspaper advertisements.  Plot  Malini is an indigent woman whose father is in poor health. She is persuaded by her friend Sundari, an actress, to join her theatre company, Kala Mandhiram. Malini soon becomes very successful and popular. She is later befriended by Sampath, a charlatan, who is regularly involved in dodging creditors. Deaf to all advice, Malini allows herself to be led astray in professional, financial and moral terms. She is put out of Kala Mandhiram and sets up a theatre company of her own where Sampath appoints himself as general manager. Malini severs ties with those who previously helped her, including Sundari. At first, the new company prospers, but its resources are soon squandered by Sampath and it falls under a weight of debt and disgrace. Sampath abandons Malini, who falls back to her previous poor condition. However, with Sundari's help, she returns to Kala Mandhiram and begins her life anew.  Cast  * Kothamangalam Subbu as Sampath * Pushpavalli as Malini * M. S. Sundari Bai as Sundari * Suryaprabha as Nirmala * N. Seetharaman as the director * R. G. as the assistant director * Gopalakrishnan as the office boy * L. Narayana Rao as the sari merchant * P. A. Subbiah Pillai as Malini's father * S. Varalakshmi as Ponnamma  Production  Miss Malini was an original story written by novelist R. K. Narayan for the screen, not based on any of his past works. It was also his only one that came to fruition. Soon after the story developed, Narayan's friend, Gemini Studios' owner S. S. Vasan launched it as a film. K. Ramnoth, then the controller of productions at Gemini, produced the film under the studio's banner. M. Natarajan worked as the cinematographer, N. K. Gopal was the main editor, and the art director was A. K. Sekhar. Besides directing the film and writing the screenplay, Kothamangalam Subbu starred in a leading role as Sampath the charlatan, also known as \\"Bit Notice\\". It was his second directorial venture, after Kannamma En Kadhali (1945), also produced by Gemini Studios. Narayan's brother, R. K. Ramachandran, who did some editing on the film (marking his cinematic debut), believed that the character of Sampath was inspired by Sathashivayya, a man in Mysore who \\"exploited young women singers and artistes under the guise of promoting them\\". The film featured Pushpavalli in the title role, and M. S. Sundari Bai as her friend Sundari. It was the former's second appearance in a Tamil film, after Gemini's Dasi Aparanji (1944). N. Seetharaman, who later became known as Javar Seetharaman, made his acting debut in a minor role with this film, portraying the director of Kala Mandhiram. The film also marked the cinematic debut of Ramaswamy Ganesan, who later became known as Gemini Ganesan. He was then working in Gemini's casting department, and Ramnoth, who had faith in Ganesan's acting prowess, cast him in the minor role of an assistant director employed by Seetharaman's character. In his only scene in the film, the assistant director tells the director, \\"Sir, Collection ‚Äì Record Break\\", referring to the tickets having been sold out, to which the director replies that while the collection is \\"record break\\", in some time the theatre too would be \\"break\\" (broken) due to Malini having gone missing. Ganesan was credited onscreen as \\"R.G.\\", standing for \\"Ramaswamy Ganesan\\". This was the film where he met his future wife Pushpavalli. V. Gopalakrishnan, in one of his earliest film roles, appeared as Sampath's office boy. L. Narayana Rao was cast as a sari merchant who Sampath tells in English, \\"In this age of publicity, be wise and advertise!\\" and when the impressed merchant asks in Tamil who said it, Sampath simply replies \\"Shakespeare\\", duping the merchant in the process. According to the 1996 book R.K. Narayan: The Early Years by N. Ram and his wife Susan, the film was made on a shoestring budget of approximately 2,50,000. Its final length was .  Themes  Miss Malini subtly ridiculed aspects of life in Madras (now Chennai) during the World War II period when there was a shortage of commodities and high prices. It included depictions of social mores, a love story, and the moral dilemmas its characters face pursuing business and personal interests. Film historian Randor Guy called the film a satire on South Indian society, it's wolves in sheep's clothing, frauds, social climbers and so on. According to the 2006 book Performing Pasts: Reinventing the Arts in Modern South India, the name \\"Bit Notice\\" was resonant of Subbu's own interests in the fields of theatre and cinema. Guy felt that the dialogue \\"Be wise and advertise!\\" reflected Vasan's personal beliefs. R.K. Narayan: The Early Years stated that the film marked Narayan's earliest use of story elements that would recur in his later novels such as The Financial Expert, The Man-Eater of Malgudi and The Guide. These include the protagonist having humble beginnings before being lifted into a \\"totally new and unexpected situation,\\" which brings fame and prosperity, the rise being invariably associated with an external player, who is a plausible person, of considerable force and no integrity. At the instigation of this character, the protagonist rises even higher, then engages in immoral actions causing their fall, and eventual return to their original position, but with a new philosophical perspective.  Soundtrack  S. Rajeswara Rao and Carnatic musician Parur S. Anantharaman composed the film's soundtrack. Subbu was the lyricist for all of the songs except \\"Kaalaiyiley Ezhunthiruntha Kattayodey Azhuganam\\", which was written by Surabhi. T. V. Rathnam sang all of the songs except \\"Kulikkanum Kalikkanum\\" (sung by P. Leela), and \\"Kaalaiyiley\\" (sung by Sundari Bai). \\"Mylapore Vakkeelathu\\" explores a young woman's ambition to marry a lawyer from the Mylapore district of Chennai ‚Äì \\"Mylapore vakeelaathu mattupennaaven\\" (\\"I shall be a Mylapore lawyer's daughter-in-law\\"). It also reflects the trend that popular and wealthy people of that period lived in Mylapore, and highlights the association between Mylapore and lawyers. \\"Kaalaiyiley\\" ridicules India's ration system through the lyrics \\"Sarkaraikku queuevil poi saanjukittu nikkanum, sanda pottu patthu balam sakkata mann vaanganum\\" (\\"I have to stand in the queue for sugar, and after a lot of fighting, buy ten measures of gutter mud\\"). \\"Sri Saraswathi\\" is a partial variant of the Muthuswami Dikshitar composition of the same name. S. S. Vasan initially hired D. K. Pattammal to sing the song, picturised on Malini. However, Pattammal's recording was excluded from the final cut in favour of a version recorded by Rathnam. Vasan later told Randor Guy that Malini is an impoverished woman with no training in music when the song takes place, and cannot be expected to sing with the \\"class, perfection and brilliance\\" of Pattammal. As a result, he chose \\"a regular singer\\" to sing the song. \\"Paadum Radio\\" outlines the comfort of life in Madras with its electricity, radio and so on, but there is \\"counter in the same song which [emphasises] what city life is devoid of.\\" The songs attained popularity, particularly \\"Mylapore Vakkeelathu\\", and \\"Kaalaiyiley\\". R.K. Narayan: The Early Years states that the songs \\"would be remembered long after the film ceased showing\\".  Release  A scene from Cinema Kadambam, an animated short screened alongside Miss Malini. It was the first animated film produced in South India. Miss Malini was released on 26 September 1947. An animated film of roughly 10 minutes, developed by cartoonist N. Thanu, titled Cinema Kadhambam, was screened after the interval of Miss Malini. Cinema Kadhambam, which featured caricatures of popular South Indian actors like Ranjan, Vasundhara, T. R. Ramachandran and P. Kannamba, was the first animated film produced in South Indian cinema.  Critical reception  Miss Malini was well received by intellectuals; critics praised Subbu's performance as Sampath. On 26 September 1947, the reviewer from The Hindu believed the technical aspects had made Miss Malini \\"Gemini's most outstanding achievement\\", concluding that the film was \\"of immense significance for the Indian screen.\\" The Free Press Journals review the same day similarly opined, \\"[Miss] Malini with its technical perfection, good photography and high level acting splashed by good music, and untainted by vulgarity will provide good entertainment.\\" The following day, a review of Miss Malini from The Indian Express noted that it presented \\"a sort of skit on modern life\\" and termed it as \\"fine entertainment.\\" The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran review described it as a \\"sample of the high production values Gemini is capable of introducing in a picture\\". The critic from the Telugu newspaper Andhra Prabha said on 28 September, \\"Evidence of skillful expression of art is profusely manifest in this picture.\\" On 3 October, the critic from The Mail praised the cast performances, the film's music, \\"enchanting pageantry\\" and Subbu's direction. A reviewer from another Tamil newspaper, Dinamani, believed the film to be \\"a pointer to social pictures in future\\" in their review dated 5 October. The critic from The Indian Review called Miss Malini an \\"attempt at a new kind of filmmaking with new technique. Eschewing cheap love-scenes and lewd expressions and gestures, the film yet keeps our interest intact.\\"  Box office  According to Randor Guy, Miss Malini was not successful at the box- office, and it took a few years to recover its cost. He attributed the film's failure to its lack of commercial elements that would have helped it reach out to average filmgoers, the fact that it was ahead of its time, and wrote that Vasan lamented that \\"making films for intellectuals would not bring money\\"; Guy considered this a \\"lesson\\" he learnt from making the film. Guy also stated that Vasan would later often tell his friends that the film proved that Indian audiences \\"did not appreciate movies that tickled their intellect\\". Novelist and historian Venkatesh Ramakrishnan supported Guy's claim, saying the film \\"bombed at the box office\\". In contrast, the 1985 book 70 Years of Indian Cinema, 1913‚Äì1983 says Miss Malini not only created box office records, but was also a trendsetter in Tamil cinema. V. Balakrishnan, writing for the magazine Ananda Vikatan in 2015, also stated that the film was a success. R.K. Narayan: The Early Years says that the film \\"paid for itself at the box office\\". Vasan's son S. S. Balan said the film \\"fared reasonably well\\". In April 1954, the magazine Gundoosi column \\"Nunippul\\" () said that Ramnoth, not Subbu, was the main reason for the film's success.  Legacy  Miss Malini attained cult status in Tamil cinema, and the character of Sampath became iconic. Sundari Bai's \\"nippy delivery\\" of her lines also attained popularity. Subbu became popularly known by his character's nickname \\"Bit Notice\\" after the film's release; children around Kapaleeshwarar Temple would scream \\"Bit Notice\\" when he passed by that area. Subbu's dialogue \\"Be wise and advertise!\\" also attained popularity. Music historian Vamanan noted in 2013 that politician M. P. Sivagnanam's enthusiasm for popularising the life of the Polygar chieftain Veerapandiya Kattabomman as a resistance fighter was derived initially from a line written by Subbu in a song from Miss Malini, which mentions Kattabomman along with Mahatma Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose (\\"Gandhi Mahaan, Netaji, Kattabomman kathai koori\\"). According to Ganesan's journalist daughter Narayani, his role in Miss Malini won him acclaim, and he soon received more acting offers. Guy noted that he went on to \\"blossom as one of the top stars of South Indian cinema\\". The film was later rewritten by Narayan as the 1949 novel Mr. Sampath ‚Äì The Printer of Malgudi, which in turn was adapted into the Hindi film Mr. Sampat (1952) directed by Vasan and starring Motilal Rajvansh, and a 1972 Tamil film directed by and starring Cho Ramaswamy. Although no print of Miss Malini is known to survive, which makes it a lost film, surviving artifacts include its songs, along with a few stills and newspaper advertisements.

It has campuses in Earl's Court, Chelmsford, Liverpool, and Plymouth, with growing links with other churches, colleges and dioceses throughout the UK and beyond. The president is Graham Tomlin, Bishop of Kensington, and the dean is Andy Emerton. St Mellitus College is a wholly non-residential college and has pioneered context-based training within the Church of England, integrating academic theological study with ministry placements throughout the course of study.  History  Named after the very first Bishop of London, whose territory covered London and Essex, the college was founded in 2007 by the bishops of London and Chelmsford to serve the church‚Äôs mission in those regions and beyond. It has grown significantly since being founded, and moved into its own premises at St Jude's Church, Kensington in 2012, a building renovated specifically for this purpose. The centre houses a range of teaching space, rooms for pastoral care, academic and administrative offices, a growing academic library, space for hospitality and college worship. In 2013, St Mellitus North West was established at Liverpool Cathedral, reestablishing full-time Anglican ordination training in that area for the first time in more than 40 years. This venture was directed by Jill Duff (now Bishop of Lancaster), in partnership with five dioceses in that area (Blackburn, Carlisle, Chester, Liverpool and Manchester). Since May 2018, the Revd Dr Michael Leyden has been Director of St Mellitus College North West. In September 2017, St Mellitus South West was launched, based in St Matthias Plymouth under the direction of the Revd Dr Donna Lazenby.

It is in the tradition of Black Forest clockmakers. Hauser, the son of a teacher, was born on 21 August 1825 and gained experience of making music boxes with Johann George Schopperle. During this same period he gained a knowledge of metalworking, precision work and the design of musical instruments, as well as a proficiency in the composing of music. The firm acquired a reputation for building particularly fine regulators. Up to the 1920s it still produced regulators with compensated pendulums and precision movements. The firm was later taken over by Junghans and the factory closed down in 1932, at which period the market for wall regulators had collapsed. Bibliography *Lenzkircher Uhren 1851-2001\\\\.

The episode premiered on the Fox network on October 21, 2009. It was written by series co-creator Ian Brennan and directed by Elodie Keene. The episode sees glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) attempt to create a wedding medley in the style of a mash-up for his colleagues Emma (Jayma Mays) and Ken (Patrick Gallagher). Students Finn (Cory Monteith) and Quinn (Dianna Agron) find that they are no longer considered popular, while glee club members Rachel (Lea Michele) and Puck (Mark Salling) become romantically involved, as do cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) and local news anchor Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones). The episode features covers of five songs. Studio recordings of three of the songs were released as singles, available for digital download, and three are included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1. Neil Diamond was hesitant about licensing his song \\"Sweet Caroline\\" to the show, but was convinced by series music producer P.J. Bloom and ultimately enjoyed the performance given by Salling. The episode was watched by 7.24 million US viewers. Musical performances received mixed reviews from critics. The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez described \\"Mash- Up\\" as a \\"turning point\\" for Glee, praising the episode for its character development. Plot Football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) ask glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to create a mash-up for their wedding, using \\"Thong Song\\" and \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" from My Fair Lady. Ken senses that Emma would rather be with Will instead of him, so he gives the football- playing glee club members an ultimatum by scheduling an extra football practice on the same day as glee rehearsals. Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) have slushies thrown in their faces by other students, who want to take them down now that their high social status as football quarterback and head cheerleader has slipped because of Quinn's pregnancy and their membership in the glee club. Puck's (Mark Salling) mother (Gina Hecht) encourages him to date a Jewish girl, and he decides to court Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). At first she excuses herself by saying she needs a strong male who can perform a solo. As a result, Puck sings \\"Sweet Caroline\\" as his first solo for the glee club, dedicating it to Rachel and sealing the relationship. The two ultimately break up as a result of Rachel's feelings for Finn and Puck's feelings for Quinn. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) falls in love with Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones), a television news anchor on the program where she has an opinion segment, and makes amends with Will. However, her relationship fails when she discovers that Rod is cheating on her and, returning to form, Sue removes Quinn from the cheerleading squad because of her pregnancy. Although Finn has chosen to stay on the football team, all the other dual members instead quit to remain in the glee club. Ken reverses his ultimatum after a conversation with a dismayed Finn and cancels the extra practice, allowing the football players to again do both activities. Meanwhile, Will and Emma spend more time together while Will prepares the mash-up, and soon realize they have strong feelings for one another. Will decides to remove himself from the equation and later tells Emma and Ken that he will not be able to create their mash-up. Production \\"Mash-Up\\" was written by series creator Ian Brennan and directed by Elodie Keene. Recurring characters who appear in the episode are glee club members Brittany (Heather Morris), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton), athletes Lipoff (Zack Lively), Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and Azimio (James Earl, III), football coach Ken Tanaka (Gallagher), and local news anchors Rod Remington (Jones) and Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis). Gina Hecht guest-stars as Puck's mother. The episode features covers of \\"Bust a Move\\" by Young MC, Sisq√≥'s \\"Thong Song\\", Neil Diamond's \\"Sweet Caroline\\", \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" from the musical My Fair Lady, and \\"What a Girl Wants\\" by Christina Aguilera. An instrumental version of \\"Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)\\" by Louis Prima is used in the scene which sees Will teach Sue how to swing dance. Diamond had some reluctance over licensing \\"Sweet Caroline\\" to the show, and retracted clearance after the performance had already been recorded. Glee music supervisor P.J. Bloom was able to convince him to reverse his decision, and Diamond went on to also license his song \\"Hello Again\\" for use on the show at a later date. Following the episode's broadcast, Diamond posted his approval on the social networking website Twitter, writing: \\"Hey, so who's this guy Puck singing \\"Sweet Caroline\\" so good, so good, so good on #Glee? Loved it!!\\" Studio recordings of \\"Bust a Move\\", \\"Thong Song\\" and \\"Sweet Caroline\\" were released as singles, available for digital download. \\"Bust a Move\\" charted at number 93 in the US and 78 in Canada, while \\"Sweet Caroline\\" charted at number 34 in the US, 22 in Canada and 37 in Australia. \\"Bust a Move\\" and \\"Sweet Caroline\\" are included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1, with a studio recording of \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" included as a bonus track on discs purchased from Target. Reception Cory Monteith's vocal performance in the episode was criticized by Joal Ryan of E! Online, who felt that \\"Monteith was so Auto-Tuned he sounded like Cher.\\" \\"Mash-Up\\" was watched by 7.24 million US viewers, and attained a 3.2/8 rating/share in the 18-49 demographic. It was the nineteenth most watched show in Canada for the week, with 1.52 million viewers. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.053 million viewers (1.601 million on E4, and 452,000 on E4 +1), becoming the most-watched show on E4 and E4 +1 for the week, and one of the most-watched shows on cable for the week. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal described the episode as \\"a turning point for Glee\\", commenting that although there had previously been criticism of many of the characters for being \\"one note\\", this episode demonstrated that was not the case, showing that Will has a playful side, Sue has feelings, and Puck is able to \\"emerge from his bonehead-punk exterior\\". Andrea Reiher of Zap2it was glad that Will's wife Terri did not appear in the episode, commenting: \\"I like Jessalyn Gilsig but that character drives me outhouse-rat crazy.\\" Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 8.2/10, writing that he wished Sue's relationship with Rod could have lasted more than one episode, as: \\"it would have been amusing to see happy, in love Sue a bit longer, before her inevitable return to evil.\\" Musical performances in \\"Mash-Up\\" received mixed reviews. Joal Ryan for E! Online criticized the show's \\"overproduced soundtrack\\", writing that Monteith was being edited to sound like Cher, and that when Morrison sang \\"The Thong Song\\" and \\"Bust a Move\\", \\"he sounded like he was in a music video, not a suburban high school.\\" He enjoyed Michele's \\"What a Girl Wants\\", calling her singing \\"raw and lovely\\". Entertainment Weekly Michael Slezak criticized the \\"Bust A Move\\" performance, writing that Morrison gave a \\"pale imitation\\" of the Young M.C. original. He was slightly more positive regarding the \\"Thong Song\\" performance, feeling that Morrison had \\"a slightly less overwrought vocal than Sisq√≥\\", and observed that Salling did \\"more than a serviceable job\\" on \\"Sweet Caroline\\". Fellow Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson called Morrison's performances \\"pretty impressive\\", and MTV's Aly Semigran also enjoyed them, writing: \\"We want more!\\". Goldman too was positive regarding Morrison's performances, noting: \\"There is of course something completely dorky about seeing this guy perform these songs, but Morrison infuses Will with such enjoyment in what he's doing, he completely sells it.\\" Glee's writers have also been praised for the episode's comedic content; one particular joke (performed by Lynch as Sue) was called an \\"instant classic\\" by television writer/producer Jane Espenson.

Unusually for a UK-based circus company it included wild animals such as tigers, camels and lions in its acts. Martin Lacey, was the company's owner and Circus Director, and in 2012, at the age of 70, he announced he would retire, and the Great British Circus would not return for a 2013 season. Use of wild animals Martin Lacey defends the company's approach as follows: \\"The Circus takes veterinary advice from world-respected experts, not from campaign groups who too often seek to excite public sympathy in their quest for donations and support.\\". Martin Lacey has bred tigers for many years and provided most of the tigers used in the Esso oil television advertisements up until the 1970s. In April 2007 the Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom) upheld a complaint against the company's claim that it was \\"Voted No.1 for Animal Care\\". In February 2009 The Independent reported that the company brought performing elephants to a UK circus for the first time in ten years. Early Day Motions On 3 March 2009 an Early Day Motion was tabled by John Austin, referring to the introduction of elephants into the circus as follows: > That this House shares the RSPCA's deep concern at the recent introduction > of elephants into a circus in Nottinghamshire; hopes that the public will > boycott the circus in protest; believes that the Government should intervene > in this case and state categorically that it opposes the use of wild species > in circuses; and urges the Government to bring forward proposals to ban the > use of wild animals in circuses without further delay. This motion was signed by 110 MPs. On the following day, another EDM was tabled, by Mark Pritchard, specifically naming the Great British Circus, as follows: > That this House notes with concern the continuing use of non-domesticated > animals in circuses and more recently the re-introduction of elephants by > the Great British Circus; is increasingly concerned by the delay of the > Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in reporting on > increasing amounts of evidence surrounding poor animal welfare standards in > circuses; believes that the report of the Chair of the Circus Working Group > fails to provide reliable information on this subject; supports the work of > the Captive Animals Protection Society and others in achieving an end to > animal use in circuses; and urges the Government to maintain its commitment > to ban the use of non-domesticated animals in travelling circuses and to > limit the use of domesticated species under a strict, accountable and open > licensing system. This motion was signed by 78 MPs. Protest and Investigations The company's circus performances have attracted animals rights demonstrations at locations throughout the UK.http://www.veggies.org.uk/page.php?ref=332#gbc In August 2009 an undercover investigation secretly filmed a member of the circus staff hitting an elephant with a metal hook.

Noah's Ark Zoo Farm On 19 October 2009 the company was referred to in allegations in a BBC documentary that visitor attraction Noah's Ark Zoo Farm secretly looked after animals on its behalf.Retrieved 2009-10-19. Noah's Ark Zoo Farm was subsequently expelled from the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) in December 2009: BIAZA noted in a statement that 'The reasons for termination are due to a refusal to provide BIAZA with information when requested and entering into an arrangement with the Great British Circus, which contravenes the Animal Transaction Policy, despite having been warned of possible consequences' and that 'the behaviour of NAZF has brought the association into disrepute' . Purchase In 2014 Great British Circus was acquired by the Kirilov family. With over 20 years experience in Circus throughout Europe they redesigned and modernised the show without the inclusion of any animals. Great British Circus is now a blend of the most exciting traditional Circus performers, hi-tech acts and music and dance perhaps more associated with live theatre shows. Great British Circus is currently touring Indonesia. The Kirilovs, originating from Bulgaria, are the third generation of showmen and also own other entertainment ventures including Big Kid Circus and Billi Smiles Circus which operate throughout the References https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/10/circuses-remove- big-cats External links * http://www.greatbritishcircus.co.uk/ Category:Circuses Category:Companies based in Lincolnshire *http://www.greatbritishcircusmalaysia.com ","title":"Great British Circus"},{"id":"24764292","text":"Darel may refer to: *Darel Carrier (born 1940), former professional basketball player *Darel Dieringer (1926‚Äì1989), former NASCAR Grand National and Winston Cup driver *Darel Hancock, better known as Bomani Armah, American hip-hop poet *Darel Hart (born 1964), former Australian rules footballer *Darel McKinney, early 20th-century US marine *Darel Russell (born 1980), English footballer, currently playing for Norwich City *Dominique Darel (1950‚Äì1978), French model and actress, mainly active in Italian cinema *Florence Darel (born 1968), French actress * (born 1944), French actress See also * Darrel * Darrell * Darryl ","title":"Darel"},{"id":"24764319","text":"Gonzalo Soriano (March 14, 1913April 14, 1972) was one of Spain's most distinguished classical pianists of the twentieth century. Born in Alicante, Soriano began studying music at an early age, but soon began to concentrate on piano. Graduating from the Royal Conservatory in Madrid in 1929, he went on to study piano and composition with Amzel in Lisbon. Back in Madrid, as a prot√©g√© of Manuel de Falla, whose work he played on numerous occasions, Soriano's talent soon began to be recognized. He enjoyed the company of Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna and a group of like-minded artists and writers. The Spanish Civil War interrupted his career and it was only after the end of the Second World War that he began to acquire a reputation in Europe, impressing the public and critics alike for his versatility, technique and musical sensitivity. He began to give concerts in Europe in 1947 and made his first U.S. tour in 1954 to considerable critical and commercial success. From this tour came the first American recording containing Alb√©niz's Suite espa√±ola (Boston Records: B302). With the same company he recorded the Variations s√©rieuses by Mendelssohn, Schumann's Three Romances, Op 27 and Schubert's Sonata in A minor Op 164, all on a single LP (BR, B303). In 1955 he made his first tour of the Far East and in December 1959 visited the Scandinavian countries, which included a concert given before the King of Sweden on the occasion of the award of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to Dr. Severo Ochoa. Soriano recorded with the best performers and conductors. Among others, he worked with Rafael Fr√ºhbeck de Burgos on more than one occasion, recording with him the Nights in the Gardens of Spain and Concerto in D major for harpsichord, both by de Falla (Angel Records, 36131). Two other memorable recordings of the first work were done under the direction of Ata√∫lfo Argenta (Alhambra, MCC 30008). Victoria de los Angeles, outstanding soprano and a big admirer of Soriano's talent, was a keen collaborator for both concerts and recordings. It is said that the dialogue between voice and piano achieved a perfect balance when these two artists performed together in works by Frederic Mompou, Xavier Montsalvatge or Joaquin Turina. (20th Century Spanish Songs, Angel (S) 35775). Soriano is thought to have been one of the pianists best able to appreciate the talent of Montsalvatge and accept the challenge of interpreting some of his more difficult pieces. The composer wrote expressly for him, Sonatine pour Yvette being dedicated to the composer's daughter and premiered by Soriano (recorded by EMI / His Master's Voice, FALP 874). Other great composers like Mompou and Rodolfo Halffter also wrote works for Soriano - in Mompou's case, No. 9 of Can√ßons i Danses was dedicated to him. Soriano died suddenly from a stroke on 14 April 1972 at home in Madrid, with his latest recording, Granados' Twelve Dances (EMI-Odeon, J 063-10913) still in production - a work that had already won the Grand Prix du Disque de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Soriano left a large collection of performances and recordings, including de Falla's complete works for keyboard (His Master's Voice, 053-00731 and 063-01289). He was survived by his mother, Consuelo Sim√≥ and his partner, John Ross who, after Soriano's death, joined a religious order of Benedictine Monks, remaining in retreat for 20 years before returning to his birthplace on the Big Island of Hawaii, where he resided in the city of Hilo until his death in 2013.

(September 11, 1932 - ) is an American physician specializing in cardiac pathology. He is a Master of the American College of Cardiology, a leading cardiovascular pathologist, and the current editor of both the American Journal of Cardiology and the Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings. Background and Early Education William C. Roberts was born in Atlanta, Georgia on September 11, 1932, the second of three sons to Stewart Ralph Roberts and Ruby Viola Holbrook. His father Stewart was a prominent faculty physician for Emory University Medical Center, attending patients alongside his mother who served as his nurse. The children were raised in the city until 1935 when the family moved to a rural farm 12 miles outside Atlanta where they would remain for the next six years. Roberts attended public schools in Avendale, Georgia, and then Atlanta, Georgia from the 5th grade onward. Roberts describes himself as a below- average student until 9th grade when an algebra teacher motivated him to pursue greater academic achievement. In 1937, Stewart Roberts suffered a heart attack which disabled him until his death in 1941. Though this event would later come to cast great influence on Roberts' career, his initial undergraduate studies at Southern Methodist University were in English with aims toward a career in business. During this time, Roberts also joined the fraternity Phi Delta Theta. By junior year, Roberts' ambitions had shifted to medicine in earnest. In 1954, Roberts graduated early from Southern Methodist University with a bachelor's degree in the arts, having been accepted to Emory University's School of Medicine. To earn money, Roberts worked for the National Forest Service for the three months between college and medical school. Early in his medical school training, Roberts proved to be a gifted anatomist and earned a prestigious thoracic surgery externship at Walter Reed Army Medical Center before graduating Emory in 1958 with his medical doctorate. Medical career Postgraduate Training After graduating from Emory, and despite his previous experiences in anatomy and surgery, Roberts served as an intern in medicine at Boston City Hospital before pursuing a 3-year residency in anatomic pathology at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. It was here, working with attending physicians such as Glenn Morrow and Eugene Braunwald that his career began to focus on cardiovascular pathology, and he focused his training exclusively on autopsies and surgical pathology. He also began reading the works of Jesse Edwards, which he credits with helping to develop both his style of writing and strong interests in medical authorship and publications. He next served as a resident on the Osler Medical Service at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore before spending an additional year as a fellow in cardiovascular disease at the National Institutes of Health. This extensive training conferred upon Roberts unique credentials both as an anatomic pathologist and a clinically trained cardiologist. National Institutes of Health From July, 1964 to March, 1993, Roberts served as the first head of the newly created pathology section at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health. Here, he continued to work with notable cardiac physicians including Eugene Braunwald, Willis Hurst, and Glenn Morrow. Federal money for cardiovascular research, a national priority since the conclusion of World War II allowed for rapid expansion of the program. Roberts soon had 3 pathology fellows per year working with him, and he worked long hours alongside them - usually six nights per week. The pathology section of the NHLBI was substantial but in Roberts' first year only 25 cardiac specimens were available for study. Determined to catalog the largest possible collection of anatomic cardiac pathology, Roberts personally canvassed more than a dozen institutions each month to collect heart specimens which he would examine and return with completed autopsy results to their parent institutions. Among those hospitals contributing to his collections were Georgetown, George Washington University, Children's National Medical Center and Johns Hopkins Hospital as well as the Washington, D.C. Veteran's Affairs hospital and National Naval Medical Center. Collectively, Roberts was soon studying more than 50 hearts per month, a twenty-fivefold increase over those available from the NIH alone. Despite major achievements by the institution in the understanding of cardiovascular diseases, Roberts was frustrated by growing difficulties attracting pathologists interested in cardiovascular disease. These difficulties were compounded by the closure of the NIH cardiac surgery program in 1987, greatly limiting the quantity and diversity of pathology available for study. Baylor University Medical Center In March 1993, 32 years after starting at the NIH, Roberts left the National Institutes of Health to join the faculty of Baylor University Medical Center, the flagship of a large hospital network located in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. Working in a laboratory built for him by the hospital, he continues to study cardiac pathology and has published more than 300 articles since. He is also an active participant in the ongoing training of cardiovascular disease and pathology fellows. Individual Academic Contributions Journal Articles Roberts has published over 1600 articles to date, almost all of them in peer-reviewed publications. The majority of his original scientific publications focus on anatomic aspects of cardiovascular disease. In addition, Roberts has written or co-authored a number of articles discussing risk factors and risk-factor management in cardiovascular disease. As editor for both the Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings and The American Journal of Cardiology, Roberts has also published a number of editorials discussing current trends in cardiovascular medicine. Books Roberts has written or co-written 11 individual titles. In chronological order, these are: #Classification of Heart Disease in Childhood (1970, 70pp.) #A Manual of Nomenclature and Coding of Cardiovascular Disease in Children: a Supplement to the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology (1970, 69pp.) #Congenital Heart Disease in Adults (1979, 574pp.) #Facts and Ideas from Anywhere 2000 #Facts and Ideas from Anywhere 2000‚Äì2006 #Facts and Ideas from Anywhere 2011 to 2015 #Collected Interviews of Baylor University Medical Center Physicians and Administrators Published in Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings (1995-2015, 956pp.) #Interviews: Published in The American Journal of Cardiology 1982-2015 Volume 1: A-K (2016, 69pp.) #Interviews: Published in The American Journal of Cardiology 1982-2015 Volume 1: L-Z (2016, 584pp.) #From-the-Editor Columns: Published in The American Journal of Cardiology 1982-2015 (2016, 632pp.) Roberts was also editor of a series of books entitled Cardiology which were published in annual editions continuously from 1982-1999. Each of these books summarized the major achievements and discoveries in cardiology for their respective years.

Attendees are drawn from across the country and attend three days of sessions on varying current topics in cardiology, each led by a noted expert in the relevant field. Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings In April, 1994, Roberts was appointed as editor of the Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings, a peer-reviewed and PubMed-indexed periodical of primarily regional interest in Northwest Texas. Roberts himself contributes a column to each issue entitled \\"Facts and Ideas from Anywhere\\", an homage to one of the guiding principles he ascribes to his colleague Eugene Braunwald. American Journal of Cardiology Roberts was appointed to chair the publications committee of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) in 1976 by then-president Dean Mason, and continued to serve in this position for the next six years. In 1982, the publisher of the American Journal of Cardiology and the ACC, the organization which had founded it, parted ways. The ACC went on to form the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (\\"JACC\\") and took with it editor Simon Dack, leaving the AJC without an editor. Roberts was tapped to fill this position and readily accepted. He has held the editor-in- chief position continuously ever since. Roberts has stated that his goals as editor-in-chief are to increase the \\"fun\\" of authorship and help encourage authors to contribute meaningful information to the sphere of cardiology while minimizing the political complexities he considers frequently associated with the process of academic publication. In addition, Roberts has published an extensive collection of more than 125 oral histories of prominent figures in the history and present of medicine, with a special focus on those contributing to the understanding and treatment of cardiovascular disease.

It took an active part in the Belgian and French Resistance. History Allied to the Front de l'Ind√©pendance, a resistance network with a strong communist component, the main mission of the √ñsterreichische Freiheitsfront was publishing and spreading leaflets in German. Among these was the periodical Die Wahrheit (The Truth), which contained messages from the British and Free Polish radios, inciting the German soldiers to desert. A member of the organization, R√©gine Krochmal, explained that the approaching technique was to ask a soldier for time in German, then begin to chat with him. If he was found open to criticism of the Nazi r√©gime, an appointment was fixed in order to give him leaflets to spread. Such an act could lead to the death penalty for those caught. According to another survivor, Jakob Zanger, the weekly circulation of Die Wahrheit, √ñsterreichische Freiheitsfront, and from 1943 Freies √ñsterreich surpassed 12,000, of which 9,000 were distributed outside Brussels. Copies were left in airports, movie theaters and other places frequented by German soldiers, to ensure a maximal circulation. The newspaper of the Austrian Communist Party, Rote Fahne (Red Flag), was clandestinely printed in Belgium on cigarette paper and transported to Austria., Alfred Klahr Gesellschaft, Verein zur Erforschung der Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung Among the members of the √ñsterreichische Freiheitsfront was Jean Am√©ry (pseudonym of Hans Mayer, 1912‚Äì1978), an Austrian Catholic writer of Jewish origin. He was arrested in 1943 and deported to Auschwitz-Monowitz. Toward the end of 1943 or beginning of 1944, a company of Austrian partisans was created, under the aegis of which Erich Ungar, a teacher and physical chemist, made bombs and explosives. Arms and munitions were obtained by attacking German soldiers, since, according to Zanger, the British only armed \\"white\\" partisans, who in practice hardly fought at all, and not \\"red\\" (communist) partisans. In 1944, the √ñsterreichische Freiheitsfront counted 750 members, and the president of the executive committee was Karl Przibram (b. 21 December 1878, Vienna, d. 10 August 1973, Vienna), who had arrived in Belgium with his wife at the beginning of 1939 with the intention of emigrating to England but was prevented by the German invasion of 1940. After the liberation, Przibram's prestige was so great that he performed the duties of charg√© d'affaires for Austrian citizens in anticipation of reestablishment of consular and diplomatic authorities.Friedrich Stadler, Vertriebene Vernunft: Emigration und Exil √∂sterreichischer Wissenschaft, 1930-1940, publication du Ludwig Boltzmann-Institut f√ºr Geschichte der Gesellschaftswissenschaften, Austria Institut f√ºr Wissenschaft und Kunst (Wien), editor LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg- M√ºnster, 2004, p. 716 Irma Schwager, an Austrian antifascist militant from France, writes that she returned to Belgium after the liberation of Paris to help the Austrian antifascist raise the √ñsterreichische Freiheitsfront, whose leadership derived from diverse affiliations: social democrats, communists, monarchists and apoliticals.Irma Schwager, ‚ÄûM√§delarbeit‚Äú in Frankreich: Im Kampf um √ñsterreichs Freiheit, Alfred Klahr Gesellschaft, Verein zur Erforschung der Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung After the liberation of Belgium, some of the Austrian resistance fighters joined their comrades who had fought in France and who had fled to Switzerland to form a battalion of Austrian partisans in Yugoslavia under the leadership of Max Bair.
