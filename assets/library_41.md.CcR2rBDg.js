The principal idol of Hanuman is 32-feet tall and sculpted from a single piece of granite, which the second tallest Hanuman after Panchavatee near Puducherry. History The idol was installed in 1989 and consecrated in 1995. Sri Maruthi Bhaktha Samajam Trust, consisting of people with high spiritual beliefs, wished for this temple. The Kanchi Paramacharyar entrenched the 32-foot idol of Anjaneyar in 1989 and consummated the Kumbabishekam in 1995. The distinguished factor of the 32-feet idol is that it was molded out of a single rock. The temple The main shrine houses Anjaneya inside a Temple Tower 90 feet tall. Anjaneya is facing west, and thus the main entrance is on the west. There is an auxiliary entrance on the southern side used during temple festivals. The main temple building has path-ways all around the sanctum sanctorum and also a large covered space (Mandapam) for devotees to assemble in front of the deity for offering worship. On the northwest corner, a full-fledged Sannidhi for Lord Rama has been built and here He has taken abode with Seetha and Lakshmana with Anjaneya in attendance. The gods are facing east. Rama's role as the protector and ruler is signified here as Rama is seen carrying his bow, hence the name \\"Kodanda Rama\\" for the lord here. On the southwest, a Sannidhi for Lord Krishna with Rukmani and Satyabhama, all facing east has been built. Even though a Sannidhi for Lord Rama is normally built in Anjaneya temples, rarely a Sannidhi for Lord Krishna is built. In this temple, Krishna Sannidhi is built to remind the devotees that among the gods it was only Anjaneya who was present in both the Indian epics‚Äîin Ramayana as a direct disciple of Rama, and in Mahabaratha in the flag of Arjuna's Chariot as ordained by Lord Krishna to save it from destruction by the opponents. In the northeast part of the temple, on a small platform, \\"Vinayaka\\" is housed facing east and to his left on a yet another platform 'Naga' has been installed. Saint Raghavendra has taken his abode facing Lord Krishna. The temple was run by a private trust - Sri maruthi bhaktha samajam trust - since consecration on 1995. However, widespread allegations of financial irregularities in the administration of the temple and the trust resulted in several complaints and petitions to the Government of Tamil Nadu. This prompted a review and enquiry by the government and upon unsatisfactory response and evidence from the trust, the Hindu Religious and Charity Endowment Department (HR&CE;) declined exemption and took over the administration of the temple since July 2013. Predictably, this action was severely criticized by Sri Maruthi Bhaktha Samajam Trust, the former management, which was accused of the financial irregularities.

Willem Labeij influenced abstract expressionism in Iceland where he lived for a number of years, especially in the rural countryside and smaller towns where he stayed from 1990‚Äì1994. Willem is known for a very personal, strong and poetic style in his abstract painting. As a highly educated Dutch artist living in rural communities in Iceland, his presence was noted and felt by the locals and the art community in Iceland. Willem held several exhibitions in Iceland that were noted by the press and the artist communities. Local municipalities supported his work by buying paintings from him. Early life and education Labeij was born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. From an early age he was profoundly interested in art and painting, especially abstract art. As a young boy, Willem wanted to be an artist and a painter but his parents did not agree. They put pressure on him to enter a maritime school in Rotterdam in 1963 and he graduated from there. For five years he sailed the oceans as a ship's mate on commercial cargo ships that sailed from the Netherlands. At the end of this period, in 1968, Willem felt that a life as an artist was what he most wanted, so he left the sea. During the time he was a sailor, Willem had his art gear with him and painted in his time off duty.Egill H. Bragason, √âg er frj√°ls listama√∞ur, Interview with Willem Labeij in the Dagur newspaper, 7. July 1991. Retrieved 2011-01-24. After he gave up his career in the merchant marine, Willem enrolled in the Design Academy in Eindhoven. He graduated from there, specializing in advertisement design. At this point, he planned to work as a designer in the future and use his free time for artistic painting. He worked as a designer for a while but then enrolled in the Willem De Kooning Academie in Rotterdam where he studied drawing and painting from 1968 to 1969. Later he went to the Jan Van Eyck Academy in Maastricht, where he studied oil painting, watercolors and graphic art from 1972 to 1975. Willem lived just outside the city of Maastricht for seventeen years. For eight months he lived in Paris. Later career In 1990 Willem moved to Iceland. At first he lived in Stykkish√≥lmur, then in Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, Selfoss, Stokkseyri and finally in Neskaupsta√∞ur., Interview with Willem Labeij in the DV Newspaper on 26 June 1993, p. 13. Willem left Iceland in 1994. Two municipalities in Iceland bought paintings from Willem, the towns of Siglufj√∂r√∞ur and Neskaupsta√∞ur. The media in Iceland interviewed him on several occasions and he was noted for his unique style of painting. He lived in Germany and Ireland for a number of years, and then went back to the Netherlands. He had been suffering from cancer for the last two years of his life, and died at Dokkum in Friesland. Willem's art developed over the years but he adhered to abstract expressionism, taking in the impressions of the environment and then putting them down on paper and canvas as they affected him by memory. Mountains, valleys, rock formations and the sky often supplied him with motives of this kind. As a rule he did not travel with his painting gear but went walking on long treks, gathering impressions. Then, after he returned home, he created his artwork. Willem was noted by the artistic community and the media in Iceland where his exhibitions were portrayed as showing a strong, unique and very personal style. The nature of Iceland was a primary influence in his work. His influence on other artists in Iceland is difficult to judge, though, as this is very subjective. However, it is not a question that Willem contributed to Icelandic art. His exhibitions were noted among the general public as well as by other artists and the media. In a newspaper article on Willem's paintings from 1993 one leading Icelandic art critic stated: \\"It is obvious that Willem is a well educated artist with long experience in handling colors and color shades and has a great feeling for form-play. The small paintings are poetic and can be likened to short poems that get their depth and harmony from the artist's automatic responses to nature. Willem is sailing on an ocean of endless colors and form changes and is therefore not unlike the Flying Dutchman.\\" In the same article it also says that \\"The paintings are obviously made under impressions from nature and the environment, and this is the way that earthbound artists work, even those who paint in the most abstract way. External impressions can namely be shown in pure, geometrical and abstract form, most clearly manifest by Piet Mondrian\\"., Art critic writes about Willem Labeij in Morgunbla√∞i√∞ newspaper 31 January 1993. Willem held numerous art exhibitions during his life in the Netherlands, France, Iceland, Germany, Morocco and Ireland. His painting style was mostly abstract expressionism, although he experimented with several other styles. He used oil on canvas and watercolors on paper for his work. During his later years Willem used compositions of sea shells, flowers, stones and other natural objects as motives for digital photography. He had been using photography to assist in the artistic process since he lived in Maastricht. Personal life Willem did not take on outside work and lived off his art most of his life. He was married to Magdalena Labeij, a physical therapist, who greatly supported her husband in his art., Photo of Willem and Magdalena Labeij and a news article about one of his exhibitions. Willem was an easy going man, friendly and humorous. His friends knew that his whole life revolved around his art, which kept him busy from morning to late at night. His artistic output was immense.

Questions over location of death Two days after his death, the U.S.-based global intelligence company Stratfor questioned the official version of Sergun's death citing an unattributed report that alleged he had died on New Year's Day in Lebanon. In early March 2016, a similar theory was suggested by the Lebanese daily Al Akhbar that alleged Sergun was killed when on a visit to Beirut in a \\"complicated secret mission\\" carried out by unnamed Arab and Middle Eastern intelligence agencies. His death was cited as one in a series of \\"dozens of high-profile\\" Russian officials' (as well as Putin critics') sudden deaths, such as Vitaly Churkin's (February 2017), in \\"the past three years in Russia and abroad in suspicious circumstances\\" in a publication by USA Today of 2 May 2017.\\"Suspicious Russian deaths: Sacrificial pawns or coincidence?\\", USA Today, 2 May 2017.

Overview For this film Lina Sastri was awarded with a David di Donatello for Best Actress and a Silver Ribbon in the same category. The actors Giancarlo Giannini and Leo Gullotta instead won a David di Donatello for Best Actor and a Silver Ribbon for Best supporting Actor. Furthermore, the producer Gianni Minervini was awarded with a David di Donatello and a Silver Ribbon for best producer, and Nanny Loy and Elvio Porta won the Nastro d'Argento for Best screenplay. The film was also selected as the Italian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 57th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot During a debate in Naples' town hall during the early 80s Pasquale Picone, a former Italsider (Italy's then state- owned steel company) worker who had recently lost his job pulls out a jerrycan of gasoline and sets himself alight in front of the Municipal Council, his wife and her three kids are unable to find out where he has been taken after an ambulance arrives with unusual haste and disappears with him on board. Desperate for news about her husband, the woman hires an unlikely kind of 'private eye' (Giancarlo Giannini), in the form of Salvatore Cannavacciuolo, a man who ekes out a living giving informations to people visiting the morgue for one thousand lire apiece. During his investigations Salvatore (who had his less than noble motivations to accept the task) finds out that Pasquale never worked for Italsider, he merely pretended to so; that way he could hide from his own family the fact that he was involved into a veritable web of deals ranging from contraband, to gambling and to outright criminal enterprises linked to the 'Camorra' (the Neapolitan version of the Mob) and its underground. Hoping to profit from this knowledge Salvatore delves deeper and deeper into Picone's secret life with results ranging from the farcical to the dangerous in a movie which can be seen as one of the very last examples of the Commedia all'Italiana genre (here hybridized with the detective story).

She is a former one-time Wave Single Champion and a three-time Wave Tag Team Champion. She also works behind the scenes as Zabun's human resources director. She also made regular appearances for Michinoku Pro Wrestling, where she performed under a mask and the ring name . In the past, she has also made appearances for American promotion Shimmer Women Athletes, where she is a former Shimmer Tag Team Champion. Professional wrestling career JDStar and Ibuki (2006‚Äì2010) In January 2006, Ohata relocated from her hometown of Sendai to Tokyo, in order to begin training professional wrestling under Mariko Yoshida at the dojo of the JDStar promotion. On October 25, 2006, Ohata passed an audition held in front of Yoshida, JDStar owner Rossy Ogawa and booker Daisuke Kobayashi and graduated from the dojo, eventually becoming the dojo's final graduate. She made her professional wrestling debut on December 10, 2006, facing Hiroyo Matsumoto in a losing effort. Ohata's career started with a losing streak, typical for a rookie in Japanese professional wrestling, which ended on April 30, 2007, when she defeated Kaori Ohki. On June 18, JDStar, which had recently been battling financial difficulties, announced that Ohata would be transferring over to Mariko Yoshida's Ibuki promotion following the July 16 event, which would also turn out to be JDStar's final event. In Ibuki, which had the goal of introducing the next generation of joshi stars to the world of professional wrestling, Ohata underwent further training under Yoshida alongside the likes of Hiroyo Matsumoto, Ray and Tomoka Nakagawa, while also forming the tag team Seven Star Sisters (3S) with Matsumoto. During late 2007 and early 2008, Ohata also began making appearances for various independent promotions, including Ice Ribbon, JWP Joshi Puroresu, Oz Academy, Pro Wrestling Wave and Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling. In July 2008, Ohata represented Ibuki at the Japan Expo in France. On May 31, 2009, Ohata defeated Dash Chisako at Ibuki #29 to become the number one contender to the JWP Junior and Princess of Pro-Wrestling Championships. Later that same day, Ohata defeated Hiroyo Matsumoto to win the titles. On July 12, Ohata made her first successful title defense, defeating Io Shirai at Ibuki #30. On November 8 at Ibuki #32, Ohata unsuccessfully challenged Emi Sakura for Ice Ribbon's ICE√ó60 Championship. On December 20, Ohata lost the JWP Junior and Princess of Pro- Wrestling Championships to Ryo Mizunami at a Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling event. In early 2010, Ibuki ceased its operations, after which Ohara began working as a freelancer on the Japanese independent circuit. However, until August 2012 she remained affiliated with Ibuki's production company, S Ovation, through which she, Hiroyo Matsumoto and Tomoka Nakagawa produced their own independent events under the banner of \\"Joshi 4 Hope\\". Pro Wrestling Wave (2007‚Äìpresent) Ohata in August 2010 After only making few appearances per year for Pro Wrestling Wave since 2007, Ohata began working for the promotion more regularly in late 2009. On December 23, 2009, Ohata teamed with Moeka Haruhi to defeat Io and Mio, the Shirai sisters, for the TLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championship. They would hold the title for six months, before losing it to Bambi and Basara on July 4, 2010. Having worked her entire career as a cute babyface, January 2011 saw Ohata undergo a character overhaul, when she turned heel and came together with Bambi, Hiren and Yumi Ohka to form the Black Wave stable. On February 14, the group was renamed Black Dahlia, after the 1947 murder case, with Ohata positioned as the de facto leader. In July, Ohata made it to the finals of the Catch the Wave tournament, before losing to Kana. During the next few months, Black Dahlia was joined by Ayako Hamada, Cherry, and Hanako Nakamori, with Apple Miyuki, A‚òÖYU‚òÖMI, Kyoko Kimura, Moeka Haruhi, and Nagisa Nozaki making one-time appearances as members of the stable. On September 4, Ohata teamed with Mio Shirai in the Dual Shock Wave 2011 tournament, which was used to determine the first ever Wave Tag Team Champions, but the team, billed as \\"Plus Minus 0\\", was eliminated in their first round match by Gami and Tomoka Nakagawa. After the conclusion of the tournament, Ohata and Shirai received the first shot at the new champions, Ayumi Kurihara and Kana, but were defeated in their title match on December 11. On April 30, 2012, Ohata and Black Dahlia stablemate Hanako Nakamori were put in a match to determine the new Wave Tag Team Champions, there they were, however, defeated by the team of Gami and Tomoka Nakagawa. On May 4, Ohata entered the 2012 Catch the Wave tournament, where she wrestled in a round-robin block made up of members of Black Dahlia. After wins over Hanako Nakamori and Cherry and a loss against Tsukasa Fujimoto, Ohata was defeated by Yumi Ohka on June 17 and, as a result, failed to advance from her block. However, on July 1, Ohata defeated eleven other eliminated competitors in a battle royal to earn her way back into the semifinals of the tournament. On July 16, Ohata was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by Ryo Mizunami. On July 27, Black Dahlia and rival group White Tails wrestled to a draw in a five-on-five gauntlet match, from which Ohata was eliminated after wrestling Mio Shirai to a ten-minute time limit draw. Afterwards, Ohata blamed her stablemates in the match, specifically Yumi Ohka, for Black Dahlia not winning the match, noting that they were all in their thirties. She then recruited the 24-year-old Mio Shirai to the stable; Shirai, however, announced that she would also remain a member of White Tails. The two groups then agreed that the stable which would manage to draw fewer people to their self-produced Wave event, which would take place August 7 and 8, would disband. The Black Dahlia event was headlined by an eight-woman tag team match between the stable's two generations. In the match, Ohata teamed with Apple Miyuki, Hanako Nakamori and Mio Shirai against Ohka, Ayako Hamada, Bambi and Cherry, pinning Ohka for the win after hitting her with the stable's signature whip. White Tails ended up winning the battle for attendance 201-191, forcing Black Dahlia to disband. Ohata and Yumi Ohka faced off on August 26 at Wave's fifth anniversary event in a singles match, which was won by Ohata. Following the win, Ohata announced that she had signed with the Zabun production company, effectively making Pro Wrestling Wave her new home promotion and officially ending her freelancing days. On September 25, Ohata entered the 2012 Dual Shock Wave tournament with her handpicked partner Tsukasa Fujimoto, with the two wrestling Ayako Hamada and Kana to a draw in their opening round- robin match. After wins over Apple Miyuki and Kyusei Ninja Ranmaru and Wave Tag Team Champions Gami and Tomoka Nakagawa, Ohata and Fujimoto finished their round-robin block with five points, winning their block and advancing to the finals of the tournament.

On November 27, Ohata and Fujimoto defeated Gami and Tomoka Nakagawa to win the Wave Tag Team Championship. Ohata and Fujimoto made their first successful title defense on December 16 against 1st Impact (Makoto and Moeka Haruhi). Later that same day, Ohata earned the fourth and final spot in the upcoming Wave Single Championship tournament, after finishing two points ahead of Mio Shirai at the end of the Zan-1 tournament, a three-round tournament, which included a battle royal, a rock-paper-scissors round and a fan vote. Ohata's and Fujimoto's second successful title defense took place on December 23, when they defeated Naniwa‚òÜBonjo Venus (Apple Miyuki and Kyusei Ninja Ranmaru). Ohata and Fujimoto made their third successful title defense on January 4, 2013, when they wrestled Shidarezakura (Hikaru Shida and Yumi Ohka) to a thirty-minute time limit draw. On February 17, Ohata was eliminated from the Wave Single Championship tournament in her first round match by Yumi Ohka. On April 21, Ohata and Fujimoto lost the Wave Tag Team Championship to Kana and Mio Shirai in their fourth title defense. From May 6 to June 19, Ohata took part in the round-robin portion of the 2013 Catch the Wave, finishing with a record of two wins, two draws and two losses. On June 28, Ohata defeated Kagetsu and Ryo Mizunami in a three-way playoff match to claim third place in her block and advance to the knockout stage of the tournament. On July 15, Ohata first defeated Tomoka Nakagawa in the first round, then Yuu Yamagata in the semifinals and finally JWP Joshi Puroresu representative and JWP Openweight Champion Arisa Nakajima in the finals to win the 2013 Catch the Wave. As a result of the win, Ohata became the number one contender to the Wave Single Championship, held by rival Yumi Ohka. Ohata received her title shot on August 25, but was defeated by Ohka. Also in August, Ohata was promoted to the backstage role of a human resources director within Zabun. Afterwards, Ohata reunited with Mio Shirai under the team name \\"Plus Minus Zero 2013\\" for the 2013 Dual Shock Wave. However, after the team lost three of their first four matches, they were, per pre-tournament stipulations, instantly eliminated and not allowed to finish the tournament. Despite their quick elimination, Ohata and Shirai were placed in a number one contenders match to determine who would get to challenge for the Wave Tag Team Championship after the tournament winners, and on October 30, defeated Muscle Venus (Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto) to earn the title shot. Ohata and Shirai received their title shot on November 9, but were defeated by the defending champions, Las Aventureras (Ayako Hamada and Yuu Yamagata). On November 20, Ohata combined her two tag teams with Misaki Ohata and Tsukasa Fujimoto to form a trio named Kuros for a 6-Person Tag Tournament. In their first round 20-minute Point Dash match, the three defeated Meat Tech (Hiroyo Matsumoto, Ryo Mizunami and Sawako Shimono) 5‚Äì4, following a sudden death round. On November 27, Kuros defeated Classic Gohan (Cherry, Mika Iida and Shuu Shibutani) to advance to the finals of the tournament, a captain's fall match, where they were defeated by Revolucion Yoko Hatanaka (Gami, Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa). Following the tournament, Kuros remained together as a three-woman stable. On December 15, Ohata won her second Zan1 tournament, earning another shot at the Wave Single Championship. Ohata received her title shot on January 26, 2014, but her match with Yumi Ohka ended in a thirty- minute time limit draw. From May 11 to July 4, Ohata took part in the round- robin portion of the 2014 Catch the Wave tournament, finishing with a record of three wins, two draws and one loss, advancing to the knockout stage after a win over Mio Shirai in their final round-robin match. On July 27, Ohata first defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto in the first round and then Yumi Ohka in the semifinals to advance to the finals of the 2014 Catch the Wave, where she was defeated by Hikaru Shida. On September 15, Ohata and Mio Shirai unsuccessfully challenged Sakuragohan (Mika Iida and Kyusei Sakura Hirota) for the Wave Tag Team Championship, which also forced them to start the upcoming 2014 Dual Shock Wave from the first round. On September 23, Ohata and Shirai defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto and Yumi Ohka in the first round of the tournament. On October 1, Ohata and Shirai defeated Dynamite Kansai and Fairy Nipponbashi to advance to the semifinals of the tournament, where, later that same event, they wrestled Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. Ohata was then defeated by Kimura in an overtime singles match and, as a result, both she and Shirai were eliminated from the tournament. On November 26, Kuros won the second annual One Day 6-Person Tag Tournament, defeating Cherry, Meari Naito and Shuu Shibutani in the finals and, as a result, earned the right to produce the December 14 Wave event. In early 2015, Ohata and Shirai received two shots at the Wave Tag Team Championship, but were both times defeated by the defending champions, Ayako Hamada and Yuu Yamagata. Finally, in the third title match between the two teams, Ohata and Shirai defeated Hamada and Yamagata on March 15 to become the new Wave Tag Team Champions. They made their first successful title defense on April 19 against Kaho Kobayashi and Tsukasa Fujimoto.

The supporting cast includes Eve Arden and Joyce Compton. Plot Jane Drake (Loretta Young) wants to retire from the stage to a Connecticut farm. Her husband Luke (Fredric March) feels differently and continues working on his latest play, which is being written for her. Fed up, Jane takes off for Reno to get a divorce. Reading an article in the newspaper that Luke is not well and has given up working, she rushes back to his side, only to find that it is not true. She sees through his charade and in a fit of anger, she leaves. Jane goes back to Reno to get the divorce and she begins dating William Dudley. Luke gets her to agree to go out with him and they accidentally cross the border into California, where they run out of gas. They get a hotel room so that they can have someplace to sit down. She gives him advice on how to fix the script of this new play and then tells him to cast someone else in it. She pays for the room and for the gas, telling Luke her owes her $4.40 for his share of the gas and lodging. She comes home to find an article in the paper that Luke has cast Virginia Cole (Eve Arden) as the lead in his play. Luke explains to Virginia that the story in the paper was a fake to upset Jane. Virginia agrees to fool Jane by pretending to be cast in the new play. Jane and Luke agree to auction off all of their furniture. A man named Dingelhoff buys everything, including the desk Jane bought for Luke, except for a vase that Luke gave Jane, which Jane buys. Pretty soon rehearsals for the play are underway ‚Äì with Virginia playing Jane's part. Luke finds out that Jane is engaged to William. Luke tricks Jane into coming to a rehearsal for the play. She gives Virginia some tips and Virginia pretends to be upset and \\"storms off\\". With the prospect of Luke losing all the money he's sunk into the play being lost without a leading lady, Jane reluctantly agrees to fill in, but only until Luke can find someone else. Then she learns that Luke and Eddie have tricked William into getting arrested. Jane leaves to bail William out of jail. The next morning Luke and Eddie come around with flowers to apologize, and find out from the servants that Jane has run off and married William. Luke hires two men to act as inspectors, questioning Jane on the validity of her marriage. The fake inspectors insist that she had to have stayed in Reno for six weeks straight without leaving the hotel room. She hands William all of her Reno receipts, and then comes across the one from California, that has one night's lodgings listed on it. She refuses to give Luke the satisfaction of showing him that receipt, so he admits the inspectors are fake. They all leave. Their friend Emma comes over to tell Jane that the production has shut down for good and that Luke paid them off with the last of his money. Realizing how much he loves her, Jane hands Emma the receipt and tells her that she wants the money Luke owes her. Luke, Emma, and Eddie sit around drinking, saddened by the end of the production and about Jane's marriage. It takes Luke a while to realize that with the receipt he can prove that Jane's marriage is not legal. At the hotel, Luke sends a whole host of people ‚Äì from plumbers to electricians to maids ‚Äì to interrupt Jane and William on their wedding night. William gets fed up with all of the interruptions, but Jane is merely amused. A fight breaks out in their hotel room and Jane leaves with Luke. They reconcile when Luke takes them back to their old apartment where she learns that he hired Dinglehoff to buy all of their furniture.

Their latest album, The Lost Pages, was released on February 14, 2018.Odd Crew‚Äôs Biography ‚Äì Discover music, videos, concerts, stats, & pictures at Last.fm History Formation  Sofia, Bulgaria, 1989. Two 3-year-olds riding bicycles in their neighborhood accidentally bumped into each other. Both named Vasil, they became friends and together discovered bands such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Their shared passion for music and sound inspired them and soon Vasil Parvanovski started playing the guitar and Vasil Raykov began singing and playing the piano. In 1995, the 8-year-old Parvanovski‚Äôs classmate, Martin Stoyanov, joined them. His initial desire was to be the drummer of the band, but this idea quickly vanished as he received a bass guitar as a present from his neighbor. So Martin became and remained the bassist of the band to present day. In 1998, the parents of Vasil Parvanovski took him to visit a family friend, one of the most famous blues performers in Bulgaria, Vasko ‚ÄòKrupkata‚Äô (the ‚ÄòPatch‚Äô). 12-year-old Parvanovski heard hard drumming coming from the basement of the house they were visiting, and that turned out to be the young son of ‚ÄòKrupkata‚Äô, the then 8-year-old Boyan ‚ÄòBonzy‚Äô Georgiev. Parvanovski was immediately impressed by Bonzy and proposed him to jam with the band. And it's Rock Again (1998‚Äì2000) 1 August 1998 is the date of the first rehearsal for the four band members which remain unchanged as of today. The band was originally called Kaskadiori (\\"Stuntmen\\").–ö–∞—Å–∫–∞–¥—å–æ—Ä–∏ videos, music, lyrics and photos Planet Lyrics They chose the name because they had a car accident on the way to the studio.

They gradually adopted music as a lifestyle and started using it as way to express themselves and talk to society. At that time the members of the band decided to substitute their present name (Kaskadiori) with another one which better reflected their new ideas about making music. On 1 August 2008 the band had a concert to celebrate their birthday and announced their new name - Odd Crew. Later that year Odd Crew released the album We Are What We Are. Suddenly the band attracted a lot of fans who shared their ideas and vision about united society having music as lifestyle.Odd Crew biography, history, discography Planet Lyrics European tour and A Bottle of Friends (2009‚Äì2011) In 2009 Odd Crew had already played on every club stage in Bulgaria and went on the 11 Years of Brotherhood tour in various countries around Europe, including Hungary, Germany, Switzerland and England.

They are known for producing vodka, absinthe, whiskey, rum, gin, brandy, liqueurs, and a range of exotic spirits. History St. George Spirits was founded in 1982 by Jorg Rupf, a pioneer in what has become the craft distilling movement. Founded as an eau de vie distillery, St. George Spirits has steadily expanded their portfolio to include about a dozen spirits. In 1996, Jorg Rupf hired Lance Winters, a brewer and former nuclear scientist. One year later, Jorg and Lance began distilling and aging their single malt whiskey, which was first released in 2000. In 2004, St. George Spirits moved into its current location, a airplane hangar on the former Alameda naval air station. In December 2007, the company produced the first commercially available American Absinthe, St. George Absinthe Verte, since the lifting of the 1912 ban on making the spirit. Since then, St. George has continued to experiment with a number of spirits. Some of them, such as California Agricole Rum, have entered regular production while other \\"flights of fancy\\" like their oyster, Dungeness crab, kombu seaweed, and Christmas tree spirits have remained experiments. In 2010, Jorg Rupf retired from his 28-year career as master distiller of St. George Spirits. That same year, St. George sold their popular Hangar One Vodka line to Proximo Spirits so that they could focus their attention on new projects, including: gin, liqueurs, malt whisky, agricole rum, and Breaking & Entering Whiskies.

It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The church is located in between Lawshall Hall and All Saints CEVCP Primary School. The church is part of the St Edmund Way Benefice, whose Rector is Revd Jeremy Parsons. History The tiled nave of All Saints' Church In the Domesday Book of 1086, Lawshall is recorded as having \\"a church with 30 acres of free land\\", and probably long before that time people were worshipping on the site of the present church. As in many churches throughout the country, the building has undergone many changes over the centuries. The two biggest changes took place in the 1440s and 1850s. The earliest part of the church that can be dated is in the Early English period c.1166‚Äì1266, the chancel and possibly the east windows being of this period. The predominant style of construction which can be identified in the aisle window of the nave is known as perpendicular and dates from c.1366‚Äì1566. The church was almost completely rebuilt in the mid-15th century on the profits of the cloth industry. A great deal of rebuilding work took place in the 1440s following a bequeathal in 1426 by William Hanningfield \\"to the building of Lawshall Church ‚Äì ¬£40 ‚Äì for my ancestors to be prayed for\\". This was a huge amount and would represent millions in today's terms. Before the violent fracture of the Reformation, All Saints' was where the Catholic priests of the parish ministered. After the Reformation the church became a vast preaching house. For much of the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern period records are scant but in the 18th century there is greater availability of parish records. Stephen Cambourne, the rector, in his will dated 1704 gave his library of mostly theological books to his successors at Lawshall. About 137 survive and can be viewed at the Records Office library in Bury St Edmunds. In 1735 the church bells were restored to the tower after being silent for 90 years. The first bells were in place as early as 1553 but were removed about 1650 during the English Civil War. In 1740 the church received the gift of the vicarage house from Baptist Lee, the Lord of the Manor and patron of the church. The vicarage house was on the site of All Saints Primary School. The house was used by assistant clergy until 1820 when Mrs Barrington Purvis gave ¬£500 for its reconstruction as a school. During the prosperous high farming period of the 19th century the most important restoration for over 100 years were undertaken by William Butterfield in the Anglo-catholic style. The rector, Evan Baillie, spent ¬£3,000 of his own money in rebuilding the chancel and putting in new windows. Just 9 months after the completion of this restoration work Baillie resigned his post and became a teacher at the Church of Our Lady and St Joseph, the Roman Catholic Chapel on Bury Road. His successor was Barrington Mills who proved a strong influence on the village. In the 1850s the church was completely re-floored with wooden boarding and very fine Minton tiles in the sanctuary. The present high quality organ was installed by Wordsworth & Co in 1907, in memory of Barrington Mills. There are very few memorials or monuments in the church. Some were removed in the 1857 restoration, and some were covered by Minton tiles in the sanctuary. On the south side, near the font, is a memorial plaque to a Dutch airman, Flight Sergeant Johannes Bartholomeus Jat Van Mesdag, whose plane crashed at Bury Road. On the opposite wall is a list of incumbents from the year 1306. The churchyard contains the war grave of a British airman of World War II. CWGC Casualty Record. The Register of Baptisms, Marriages and Burials dates from December 1558. Architecture All Saints Church, Lawshall This fifteenth flint church is a Grade 1 Listed Building with stone dressings comprising a tall west tower, nave, aisles and a 19th-century chancel. The west tower has 4 stages with a castellated parapet and diagonal buttresses. The nave mid aisles have castellated parapets. The interior has good roofs to the nave and aisles with moulded beams and puffins and there is a carved cornice to the nave. Interior fittings include a 14th-century font and, a 16th-century carved chest. It has been recorded as a Grade 1 Listed Building in recognition of its architectural, historical and topographical value. The Porch to the South door was re-built in 1856‚Äì57 in the 15th-century architectural style with some re- used medieval timbers in the roof. The carving on the ribs and new rafters is of high quality, as is the stone doorway surround to the entrance of the church. The Tower houses 5 bells, the earliest dated 1755. The high quality, flower decorated Font dates from the 1440s, the font cover from 1856. The North doorway is of the Decorated period (1300‚Äì1380). The Nave, Clerestory and Aisles. The high quality arcade arches of the nave with aisles either side and clerestory above date from the 1440s as the result of funding by William Hanningfield. The Chancel An early illustration of the church exists by the artist Isaac Johnson who travelled Suffolk between 1810‚Äì18. His illustration (now in the Ipswich Record Office) shows a low chancel with a round-headed Norman doorway on the south side ‚Äì part of the Domesday church. The chancel was demolished and rebuilt in the mid 19th century, following a gift by the rector, Evan Baillie. The organ and gallery moved nearer to the east of the church, the font was moved to the present site, a new oak pulpit and pews installed and an Early English style window installed at the east end. St Edmund Way Benefice The Church of All Saints' Lawshall is part of a united Benefice which includes the Anglican congregations of six parishes and six places of worship covering Bradfield Combust, Great Whelnetham, Hawstead, Lawshall, Nowton and Stanningfield. Details of services can be viewed in the monthly St Edmund Way magazine or the St Edmund Way website. The incumbent is Jayne Buckles who lives at Lawshall Rectory. The Benefice was named after the St Edmund Way Long Distance Path that goes through the parishes making its way to Bury St Edmunds. In centuries past, Pilgrims would walk this path to the Bury St Edmunds Abbey.

Incumbents Records are available of the incumbents of All Saints Church from 1306. The first was Jo Gossyl who was appointed by the Bishop of Norwich and served the parish from 1306 to 1310. Evan Baillie In 1856 the Lawshall rector, Evan Baillie, received a substantial legacy and spent over ¬£3,000 on the restoration of the church. This enabled the chancel to be demolished and rebuilt. However, only nine months after the church was restored Baillie resigned his post and became a teacher at the Roman Catholic Chapel on the Bury Road. This apparent change in religious affinities has not been explained, but he did publish a collection of twelve sermons which he claimed were not contrary to the doctrines of the Church of England. They were dedicated to Thomas Sargeant, one of his churchwardens, who had stood by him in his \\"time of trial\\". Barrington Mills Baillie's successor in 1858 was Barrington Mills who proved a strong influence on the village. His habit of visiting every parishioner who failed to attend Sunday service would certainly have helped increase attendance. With the aid of Mr and Mrs Frost he started daily services in the church. Mrs Frost was head-mistress of the school and Mr Frost the organist. The school provided the choir and any boys failing to attend had a fine docked from their annual retainer of ¬£1. Mills did have a generous side to his nature, and when on a seaside holiday he would arrange for a cartload of fish to be delivered to the village for his parishioners. Canon Algernon Ogle Wintle In 1923 Canon Algernon Ogle Wintle became rector of Lawshall. He played street pianos for charity in Bury St Edmunds and became well known to shoppers in the town. A radio broadcast led to a succession of small barrel organs being sent to him for repair. Canon Wintle set up a piano organ works and provided employment to many local people in the village in the depression years of the 1930s. The barrel pianos and organs represented a resourceful business for Canon Wintle who bought the used organs, renovated them and resold them under his name. He is recalled as a rotund, grumpy man with a workshop full of barrel pianos. Ladies of the village used to trundle them up to his house, with the pins pulled out ready for him to put in the latest tunes. He gave talks on BBC Radio and in 1954 met the Queen and Queen Mother at Sandringham House.

It competes in the BUCS Rugby Union Premier South A division as of the 2011/2012 season. The club has experienced major success, winning the UAU Championship six times and the BUSA Championship twice. The club was founded in 1920. They play at Sketty Lane, also known as Sketty, in the city of Swansea.  History   Formation and early history  University College Swansea was formed in 1920 and the rugby playing students soon organised themselves into an active club. Although other Welsh University Colleges at Aberystwyth, Cardiff and Bangor had been well established for many years previous, Swansea soon proved, during the first twenty years of its existence, that it was one of the most successful and leading rugby playing universities in Wales and England. By 1930 the relatively small and tight knit campus of approximately 400 students was benefiting from the influx of players produced by local rugby playing schools. Young student players came from such areas as Carmarthen, Llanelli, Gwendraeth Valley, Amman Valley, Gowerton, Neath and Port Talbot as well as Swansea. Rugby fixtures were played against neighbouring \\"second class\\" clubs but the 'bread and butter' competitions were provided by the University of Wales Championship. This progressed through to the University Athletic Association (U.A.U.) competition which included the best of the English Universities. Until the establishment of the Sketty Lane playing fields around 1936, facilities were provided on the Singleton Campus and at St. Helens, the home of Swansea RFC.  1930s  The 1930s proved to be a \\"golden era\\" with a number of student players and university teams gaining unprecedented success. In 1929 the College XV include three players who would later achieve great distinction by captaining Wales at senior level ‚Äì Watcyn Thomas, Claude Davy and Idwal Rees. Later, student Haydn Tanner (1936‚Äì1939) also captained his country in the post World War II period. He became a British Lion (1938) and one of the few players to represent his country before and after the war. When Swansea RFC (the \\"All Whites\\") defeated New Zealand in 1935, six Swansea University students (past and present) played in the \\"All Whites\\" three- quarter line ‚Äì Granville Davies, Ronnie Williams, Gwyn Griffiths, Clause Davey, W TH Davies and Haydn Tanner. Not surprisingly, with such playing talent available, Swansea University proved to be an exceptionally successful team in the U.A.U. Championship. They were winners in 1933, 34, 35, 36, 37 ‚Äì losing finalists in 1938 and champions again in 1939 after defeating Loughborough by six points to three at Cheltenham, under the captaincy of Sid Harris. By the outbreak of World War II Swansea had deservedly gained a reputation for being one of the foremost colleges in England and Wales ‚Äì a reputation achieved in a short period of time and with comparatively few students. The U.A.U. Championship was cancelled at the outbreak of hostilities but the College still continued to field a XV with students who were allowed to continue their studies and supplemented by those evacuated to Swansea from the University of London. Post-war In the immediate post-war period returning service men soon helped to re-establish the College's reputation on the rugby field whilst also creating a strong social ethos. The University of Wales Championship was again won in 1946/47 and 1947/48. Viv Davies captained the side in 1948/49 and later went on to give stalwart service to Swansea RFC as a player and administrator. However, in the 1940s and 50s the U.A.U. Championship trophy eluded Swansea until 1965 when, captained by Glyn Morgan, they shared the title with Durham University. During this period three former students, Alun Thomas (Wales and British Lions), Ken Richards and Brian Davies were \\"capped\\" for their country.  1970s  By the 1970s the venue of the U.A.U. Final had been established at Twickenham, the headquarters of the RFU. This helped the Championship gain extra kudos and it was not long before Swansea made its first appearance there in 1973, losing to a strong Loughborough side. In 1976 the 1st XV again reached the Final, along with 2nd and 3rd XV, indicating the strength in depth that was developing in Swansea.  1980s and 1990s  During the 1980s and 90s there was a hint of another \\"golden era\\" when Swansea University 1st XV appeared in four consecutive Finals from 1988 to 1991, but with no victory. In 1995 Swansea again reached the Final of the now newly named British Universities Sports Association (BUSA) championship, which included an increased number of \\"newer\\" universities. In a magnificent game against West London Institute (now Brunel University), and in spite of scoring four tries to one against the opposition, Swansea were pipped by 31 points to 30. As if not to be deterred, there were successful returns to the BUSA Twickenham finals in 1998 and 1999 when Swansea carried off the trophy in two successive years under the captaincy of Ben Williams (1998) and Ben Martin (1999). The 2nds XV also won their BUSA Final in 1999. It is not surprising that during the successful times of the 1980s and 90s, when Swansea was again regarded as one of the best university teams in England and Wales, some outstanding players were attracted to study at Swansea. There were excellent opportunities for development. Mark Wyatt progressed from 3rd XV Captain to 1st XV Captain and on to play full back for Swansea RFC and Wales. Over twenty students went on to represent Wales and England. Also, Mark Schieffler and English born Mark Williams played for Canada whilst Ed Macedo played for Portugal. Paul Throrburn and Robert Howley both captained Wales, whilst in addition to Robert Howley, Gwyn Evans, Dafydd James, Dwayne Peel, Stephen Jones and Alun-Wyn Jones became British and Irish Lions. At a lower, but no means insignificant level, Swansea students regularly gained selection for leading Welsh clubs, Wales U21, Wales Students and Wales Universities., while a considerable number continued their studies at Oxford or Cambridge and won \\"blues\\". Regular fixtures were played against \\"Oxbridge\\" teams. In the early days of the WRU Challenge Cup competition the University side played Llanelli and Glamorgan Wanderers at Sketty Lane and Newport at Rodney Parade. These games added colour to the fixture list. In 2002 the University reached the final of the Heineken Students European Championship, and played against French side, University of Pau at St. Helen's.  2000s  Since the turn of the new millennium Swansea has again laid down markers indicating its strength and depth as a rugby playing university. With the 1st XV competing at the highest level of BUCS rugby and the ever growing Welsh Varsity being the highlight of the season against local neighbours Cardiff the Club is striving to develop to the highest levels in the post professionalisation era. With internationals Alun-Wyn Jones (2006), Jonathan Spratt (2009) and U20s Ciaran Ruddock (2009) all hailing from Swansea University, great successes in the Welsh Varsity and the continuing high levels of play found throughout all teams at the university, it seems that new life has been breathed into the Club and a new era in Swansea proud history is beginning. It is not only on the playing side of Swansea students have excelled for many have reached the top echelons of rugby officiating and administration. Chris White is a former international referee who officiated at three Rugby World Cups and has been in charge of three Heineken Cup Finals. Former 1930s and 40s students Gwyn Roblin, Hermas Evans and Alun Thomas became presidents of the Welsh Rugby Union. Hermas and Raynor Jones also both chaired the International Rugby Football Board (IRB). Ex Wales international Mark Bennet also went on to become the fitness coach of the Wales national team. Richard Lancaster, Head coach of the team during one of its most successful periods in recent times has gone on to coach the Ospreys Under 20s and is currently Head Coach at Swansea RFC Over the years the University Rugby Football Club has been well served and supported by students and staff. Amongst the latter, the contributions of Vernon Jones, I G Evans, Professor Bryn Gravenor, Professor David Herbert, Dr David Treharne, Roger Elias, Gei Lewis, Richard Lancaster, Stan Addicott and Professor Steve Mellalieu have made valuable contributions to the Club, alongside those committee member David Matthews has also been a bastion of great support. The constant interest of the Athletic Union is very much appreciated. Nowadays, with excellent sporting facilities at Sketty Lane, a growing student population of over 10,000 and with four teams regularly representing the University in university championships, the Rugby Club continues to thrive and provide both competitive and social opportunities for students.

The inaugural match was played in 1997 at the Cardiff Arms Park, the home of Cardiff RFC. In its early years of the Varsity, the match was held alternately between St Helen's Rugby Ground and the Cardiff Arms Park, until 2003, where the match was moved to the neutral venue Brewery Field, the home of Bridgend RFC. The match was then held at the home of Cardiff RFC for 3 seasons between 2007 and 2009. After outgrowing the Arms Park, the match was moved to Swansea's Liberty Stadium. Swansea have dominated the event, winning 9 out of the 14 previous matches, drawing only once in 2001. The Rugby Club can boast to have had some of Wales' most talented young players donning the Green and White of Swansea, ranging from the British & Irish Lion Alun-Wyn Jones who helped Swansea gain victory in the 2005, to Welsh International Jonathan Spratt helping Swansea to victory in the 2007 match as well as Professional players such as the Ospreys' Ben Lewis, the Scarlets' Rhys Lawrence and Wales 7s player David Evans. The Varsity match has become the highlight to the University sporting calendar year, with the match regularly attracting over 10,000 supporters, that include students, university staff, parents and officials. Due to its popularity among students and rugby fans alike, the latest Varsity, the 15th annual match, took place at the home of Welsh Rugby, the Millennium Stadium. The 2011 Match was also broadcast live on S4C, while also featuring on BBC Wales' Scrum V programme. After the success of the 2011 event, it was announced that the Varsity Match will once again be held in the Millennium Stadium on Wednesday 2 May 2012.

It could be entered through the garden of the fundatiehuis, the former home of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst. The building has an oval shape built around its centerpiece, a mineralogical cabinet. The Oval Room consists of two floors; the ground floor with its display cabinets and a gallery of books that connects to the Teylers Library. On top of the room, on the roof, the astronomical observatory used to be a landmark that could be seen for miles along the river Spaarne. The gallery and observatory are longer accessible to the public, though the gallery can be seen from the ground floor.  History  design by Viervant View from the Fundatiehuis of the observatory on the top of the Oval room In 1779 the board of the Teylers Foundation (Teylers Stichting) commissioned Leendert Viervant, the Amsterdam- based architect of amongst others the church of Ouderkerk aan den Amstel Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek on Leendert Viervant and the town hall of Weesp to build a \\"book and hobby room\\" or \\"book and art room\\" (boek- en liefhebberyzaal or Boek en Konstzael) in the garden of the former house of Pieter Teyler.Architectur of the Oval Room. After his death, Teyler bequeathed a fortune for the pursuit of science, religion, and the arts. His house had been renamed the fundatiehuis to house this fundatie or foundation. The collections of Pieter Teyler himself, but also of the foundation, was growing and space was needed to show the collections in an appropriate way, while also affording space to hold lectures for teaching and to conduct lab experiments with the expensive instruments that had been purchased. Viervant designed both the mineralogical cabinet and the room around it in the neoclassicist style that was popular in the Netherlands at that time. For example, the Ionic order was chosen by Viervant for the columns in the room because it was regarded as the \\"ideal order for the dignified control and moderation associated with the arts and sciences\\". The Oval Room walls have been timbered with pine wood on the floors and oak wood on the walls. In the walls there are alcoves both on the ground floor and on the gallery, which contain parts of the collections. Along the gallery, books have been stored in the alcoves, and on the ground floor mainly scientific instruments. The books could be accessed via the staircase. The cast iron gallery railing included fold-out supports which were the most expensive part of the room and comprised 15% of the total building costs. Every bookcase alcove is topped by the name and a stucco profile of a classical Greek writer or philosopher. In the middle of the room an extensive mineralogical collection is housed in a special cabinet that is set up along the same principles as the Fersman Mineralogical Museum built in 1716. This is the second such cabinet designed by Viervant. The first had a display surface that could double as a library table. That table was on rails, so that it could be moved out of the room when necessary, such as for electricity or other lab experiments.  Function  Model of a Thomas Newcomen steam engine built by Edward Nairne in 1770 - one example of the many instruments in the room that was formerly used for experiments The Teylers Museum, and with that the Oval Room, was the first museum open to the public in the Netherlands.Magazine: \\"Teylers Ovale Zaal, Het oudste en eerste museum van Nederland\\" Though the Oval room included a library, observatory, and lab to show experiments to the public, the concept of a museum did not really exist yet when it was completed in 1781. At the time, the Teylers Oval room was seen more as a very large version of a curiosity cabinet with room to show large demonstrations of technological innovations, such as were done with the electrostatic generator. Some of the directors felt it should really contain a museum-like collection. In the first years the central piece was not a cabinet, but a table on which experiments would be done. The central table would be moved out of the way when the electrostatic generator was going to be used. The drawings and minerals in the collection were stored in this central piece The instruments were stored in cabinets on the first floor.  Exposition  The ground floor is still open for visitors, though they now enter and exit from a new door on the east side that was built in 1878. The old door to Teyler's fundatiehuis is closed off. The way the contents are displayed in the room has barely changed since 1800. In the central exhibition cabinets minerals have been showcased, as well as the Top of the Mont Blanc, separated from the mountain in 1787 by one of the first climbers of that mountain, Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure. In the cabinets on the sides and outside cabinets, instruments are showcased. For example a world and celestial globe by George and Dudley Adams from London.

Biography A son of Iba≈°≈°i-ili and grandson of Nabu-le'i, he celebrated his eponym year towards the end of Adad-nƒÅrƒÅrƒ´‚Äôs reign as attested in a single textBi 37. relating the activities of Assur-kasid son of Sin-apla-eris at Billa. His sons, Putanu and Ina-p√Æ-A≈°≈°ur-li≈°lim, were to have their eponym years during the early to mid period of the reign of ≈†ulmanu-a≈°aredu or perhaps early in that of Tukulti-Ninurta, in Ina-p√Æ-A≈°≈°ur-li≈°lim‚Äôs case. His female relatives included Marat-ili and Mushallimat-Ishtar.

It included records of international trade in raw materials, including ivory and a shipment of textiles to the Levant. 15 eponyms occur in this archive covering a period of over 35 years. Amongst the letters are found a group of tablets,A. 307; A. 778; A. 1438 + 1559; A. 1514; A. 1577; A. 1587; A. 1598; A. 1720. which he sent to the staff of his own household in Assur as he was presumably away on business. His correspondence with his subordinates includes instructions to protect wool and other textiles stored in sealed chests from the ravages of moths. His letterKAV 99, DeZ 3434+. dated to the eponym of Ittabsiden-Assur, was one of two instructions addressed to the sa muhhi biti, or majordomo, Assur-zuquppanni, ordering him to air them. A third administrative text describes the outcome, the discovery of moth eaten (lapittu, \\"attacked\\") clothing, its separation and a fourthKAV 195 KAV 203. assigned to this correspondence instructs them to have an artisan patch them. The length of the archive is confirmed by a letter referring to an eponym Abi- ilu and a prince Tukulti-Ninurta. Assur-damiq, son of Abi-ilu, is referred to on an Assur stela. He was an eponym under ≈†ulmanu-a≈°aredu. A letterTablet VAT 18003, Ass. 16308 I, published as MARV 39, VS 19: no. 39. to the governor of Amasaki, a city in ·∏™ƒÅb≈´r region, in the month of Kazullu, the eponym year of I≈°tar-eris, son of Sulmanu-qarrad, commands him to provide ‚Äúincome of the temple‚Äù in donkey loads of cereal, ‚Äùaccording to the small sutu-measure.‚Äù A tabletAfO 19 T7.1. records garments manufactured over two preceding years, the eponym years of I≈°tar-eris and that of Assur-da‚Äôissunu, which \\"are given to Siqi-ilani for the caravan-trade to the country Kinahhi (Canaan)‚Äù in the eponym year of Usat-marduk. Hittite correspondence In ·∏™attu≈°a, near modern Boƒüazkale, drafts of lettersTablets Bo 2151, Bo 3089 and Bo 718, published as KUB 23:103. have been found that may have been written by the Hittite king ·∏™attu≈°ili III or possibly his son Tudhaliya IV to BƒÅbu-a·∏´a- iddina. Written to mark the accession of Tukulti-Ninurta to the Assyrian throne, it includes a warning of the hazards of a projected Assyrian expedition into the land of Papan·∏´i, whose \\"mountains are impassable.‚Äù The Hittite king recommended, ‚ÄúBecause his father died, and he has just seated himself upon the throne of his father, the campaign on which he goes for the first time should be one on which he enjoys a three- or fourfold numerical superiority.‚Äù This was exactly the same advice that ·∏™attu≈°ili gave to the young Babylonian king, Kada≈°man-Enlil II, which was perhaps a ploy to embroil Babylon in a war with Assyria. A still-sealed burial chamber, number 45, contained the richest of more than a thousand private middle Assyrian burials. It was associated with a large house uncovered during excavations in 1908 in A≈°≈°ur and consisted of a shaft leading to an 8 foot by 5 foot chamber containing the remains of nine adults and a child. Most skeletal remains were heaped against a wall or in an urn, making space for the two most recent arrivals who were thought at the time to be a male and female by contemporary archeologists. The male may well have been BƒÅbu-a·∏´a-iddina himself as his archive was found nearby. Unfortunately the bones were discarded after excavation preventing further analysis and doubts have subsequently been raised as to whether there was a male at all, based on the grave goods which included gold, lapis lazuli, carnelian and banded agate jewelry, elaborately carved ivory combs, pins and vessels and pottery articles comprising a pyxis with a lid and a cosmetic dish.

The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.

College remediation According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 15% of Mifflin County School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment Mifflin County High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are home schooled are eligible to participate in this program. Graduation requirements Students must earn the following 21.5 credits to receive a diploma from the Mifflin County School District: English 4 credits, Mathematics 4 credits, Science 2 credits, Biology 1 credit, Social Studies 3 credits, Computer 0.5 credit, Physical education 2 credits, Health 0.5 credit, and Electives 5 credits. When a student successfully completes course work at the Career and Technology Center in 10th, 11th and 12th grades, he/she is exempted from taking the senior year social studies and senior year math courses. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams.

During the same period, 28 percent of 11th and 12th graders in rural school districts took the exam, compared to 32 percent of urban students in the same grades. The average math and verbal scores were 495 and 497, respectively, for rural students, while urban test- takers averaged 499 and 507, respectively. Pennsylvania's SAT composite score ranked low on the national scale in 2004. The composite SAT score of 1,003 left Pennsylvania ranking 44 out of the 50 states and Washington, DC. The Pennsylvania Department of Education reported that 71 percent of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania chose to continue their education after high school in 2003, whereas 79 percent of urban high school graduates opted to continue their education. AP Courses In 2014, Mifflin County High School offered 8 Advanced Placement (AP) courses at a higher cost than regular courses. Mifflin County High School requires students to take the AP exam if they take an AP course. The fee for each AP Exam is $91 (2014). The school normally retains $9 of that fee as a rebate to help with administrative costs. In 2012, the fee was $89 per test per pupil. Students have the option of taking College Board approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Mifflin County High School 34.94% of students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - High School, December 2014 In 2013, Mifflin County School District provided 4 AP courses with just 13.86% achieving a 3 or better on the exam. Tuition Students who live in the district's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Mifflin County School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates were High School - $7,835. School safety and bullying The Mifflin County HIgh School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the school in the 2013‚Äì14 school year. Additionally, there was an assault on a student and 7 sexual incidents involving students, including 5 sexual assaults on students. The local law enforcement was involved in fourteen (14) incidents at the schools. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Mifflin County School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online.Mifflin County School Board, Bullying Policy 249, 2006 All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti- bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness policy Mifflin County School Board established a district-wide Student Wellness Policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Mifflin County HIgh School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Mifflin County HIgh School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. ;Health eTools program: Mifflin County School District and the Mifflin County HIgh School participated in Highmark Foundation's Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools grant which enabled mobile data collection of pertinent health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013. Extracurriculars Mifflin County School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private non-public school, cyber charter school, charter school, or homeschool, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 Athletics MCHS participates in PIAA District VI. However, due to the lack of Class AAAA schools in District VI, Mifflin County is part of the Mid-Penn Conference. In April 2012, the Mifflin County School Board approved raising the extracurricular fee from $75 to $135 per athlete per year. The decision saved four sports (junior high girls and boys soccer, junior high softball and varsity indoor winter track) which were to be eliminated due to a funding shortfall. The district spends over $500,000 a year providing sports in the junior high and high school.Cannon, Joe., Activity fee soars in order to save 4 athletic teams, Lewistown Sentinel, April 27, 2012 A joint Pennsylvania School Board Association and Pennsylvania State Athletic Directors Association survey, conducted in 2012, found nearly one third (30%) of public school respondents indicated charging individual students $10 to $250, with a statewide average of $65 per-sport.Pennsylvania School Board Association Education Research & Policy Center, More PA school districts charging student participation fees, May 7, 2012Pennsylvania School Board Association, Special Report on Pay-to-Play: Fees for Participation in Extracurricular Activities, August 2010 Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract.

There are about 800 bearers of the surname in England. Retrieved 21 January 2014 It now occurs in other parts of the world through migration. It is distinct from the similar name Gott, though there appear to be common sources around the 14th century. There are earlier occurrences of the name in 12th and 13th centuries, but no direct linkage has been established from these records to known holders of the name. Etymology and history (pre 1538) There are a small number of early records in Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire which have been included in references on surname origins, though there are no known family trees showing any linkage back to these references. These references generally confuse the name Gott and Gotts/Gottes into single sources. Bardsley's Dictionary of English & Welsh surnames describes the name Gott as a locative name referring to a water channel or drain as per goyt. Earliest reference quoted is in 1379 in Yorkshire. Reaney's Dictionary of English Surnames suggests its origin as Gott, Gotts from the name Gotte, quoting references of Gotte filius Wulfrici 1188 in York, and Geoffrey Gottes in Norfolk 1348. The name Gocelin (pronounced Gotselin) is suggested as the origin with petforms Gosse and Got. In Yorkshire & Lincolnshire he suggests this could be Breton origin. A second origin is proposed as deriving from the Middle English words gotte, gut meaning gut, guts, a corpulent or greedy person. Hanks & Hodges Dictionary of Surnames propose it derives from Gott as Norman English & German, a shortform of Germanic compound names with the first element meaning God. Gotts would therefore be a patronymic of these. The name ‚ÄòRichard Gotts‚Äô is inscribed on the font cover at St George‚Äôs church in South Acre in Norfolk. His will in 1535 shows him as Rector of South Lynn. A small number of wills for Gottes and Gotts in North Norfolk through the 1700s are contained in the Norfolk Register Office. It appears that the majority of people with the name Gott/Gotts were not wealthy enough to leave records in the typical sources for ownership of land and taxes. Given that surnames were not known to be in common use outside land owners prior to the 15th century the linkages from some of these references to modern families have not been substantiated.  Gotts Coat of Arms  A coat of arms was granted during the Visitation of the Heralds to Cambridge in 1585 and 1614 (as the applicant was living in Cambridge) and referenced in Fairbairn. One of the descendants Richard was admitted to the Inner Temple in London on 30 June 1578, however this line appears to have died out.

In 1892, he was appointed minister of internal affairs for Guadeloupe and appointed to the same position in Senegal in 1894. Becoming acting Governor of Senegal in 1895, he oversaw the amalgamation of Senegal, French Sudan, Guinea and the Ivory Coast into the union of French West Africa.\\"The Last Days of St.Pierre,\\" Zebrowski, 2002, pp. 21-25 Mouttet was promoted acting governor of Ivory Coast in 1896 and promoted to governor, fourth class (roughly equivalent to the British commissioner) of Cote d'Ivoire in 1897. During his brief tenure, he organized the local educational authority for the colony. Highly rated by his superiors, he received a promotion to governor, third class (roughly equivalent to chief commissioner) of French Guiana in late 1898. Although he disliked the climate and poor infrastructure of the penal colony, his tenure there was noteworthy in itself, as he supervised the release of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, implicated for treason in the controversial Dreyfus Affair. Owing in part to his actions in the case, Mouttet was appointed governor, second class (lieutenant-governor) of Martinique in October 1900. Since his assignment to Guadeloupe in 1892, Mouttet and his family had long held an affection for the Caribbean, and Mouttet saw his new appointment as the culmination of a distinguished civil service career.\\"The Last Days of St.Pierre,\\" Zebrowski, 2002, pp. 21-25  Personal life  Mouttet married Marie Henriette H√©l√®ne de Coppet (born 27 January 1867), a minister's daughter, on 27 September 1897, in √âtretat, Normandy. They went on to have three children, daughters Lucie Alice on 19 November 1891 and H√©l√®ne Ren√©e Louise on 5 October 1895, and son Jacques Louis Jean Henri on 9 June 1901. Prelude to disaster After taking up his appointment in June 1901 and settling with his family in Fort-de-France, Mouttet was immediately caught up in the turmoil of local politics. Although the white colonial oligarchy had managed to retain their economic power after the abolition of slavery in 1848 and the subsequent extension of voting rights to all French citizens in 1871, tensions between them and the middle-class coloured bourgeoisie yet remained. An election to the French Chamber of Deputies was due to be held on 11 May, and the campaigning leading up to the election demanded much of the new governor's attention. However, awareness of a more serious problem was slowly beginning to arise.\\"The Last Days of St.Pierre,\\" Zebrowski, 2002, pp. 21-25 The 2,500-foot volcanic peak of Mount Pelee had dominated the north island of Martinique for thousands of years. Although the early colonists were made aware that it was a volcano, previous eruptions in 1792 and 1851 had been minor. However, in 1900 and 1901, sulphurous fumes were observed issuing from vents near the mountain. In early 1902, the volcano reawakened, sending plumes of smoke and steam into the skies. Earth tremors began in February, becoming more frequent over the next two months. In April, hosts of insects, snakes and rodents left the slopes of the rumbling volcano, causing a nuisance in the villages below. Dogs barked continually; cattle became skittish. On 23 April, Mount Pelee sent up great clouds of dark ash and smoke, causing the ground to rumble for miles. Ash began to fall in St. Pierre and its environs. Tremendous detonations began on 24 April. On 5 May, a lahar broke loose, destroying a rum refinery and killing some 150 people. Already, hundreds of residents in the area had abandoned their homes, taking refuge in St. Pierre. The previous day, Mouttet, watching the eruption from Fort-de-France, had decided to appoint a commission to discuss whether or not it was advisable to evacuate St. Pierre. As volcanology and seismology were still in their infancy in 1902, he felt it advisable to get other opinions. As well, evacuating nearly 30,000 people was not a simple task. On 7 May, Mouttet handed over his authority to Georges L'Heurre, secretary-general of the colony and acting governor in the governor's absence. He expected to be gone for but a few days. Around 4 p.m. he and his wife kissed their three children good-bye, leaving them in the care of their nurses, and boarded the SS Topaze for St. Pierre. Upon their arrival in St. Pierre, around 5 that afternoon, Marie settled into their suite at the Hotel Intendance, while Mouttet met the members of the scientific commission in the hotel dining room. Apart from Mouttet himself, the commission included Gaston Landes and Eugene Doze, professors of natural science at the local Lyc√©e (high school), Lieutenant-Colonel Jules Gerbault of the artillery and William Leonce, a civil engineer of St. Pierre. Paul Mirville, chief chemist and pharmacist for the colonial garrison in Fort-de-France, was also a member of the commission; however, he did not attend the meeting. After deliberating for some time, the commission decided that any danger from Mount Pelee was negligible.\\"The Last Days of St.Pierre,\\" Zebrowski, 2002, pp. 104-123 Catastrophe At 7:15 the following morning, 8 May, Ascension Day, Mouttet boarded a steam launch along with three other members of his commission, excepting Gaston Landes. He set off at 7:40 for Precheur, a small town a mile south of St. Pierre, where he and the other members of the commission would decide if it needed to be evacuated. Around the same time, witnesses observed a strange hiccuping sound from the volcano and a drifting cloud of ash; one observer noted that the summit of the volcano was glowing bright red. At 8:02, Mount Pelee exploded. Two simultaneous eruptions issued from the volcano; a cloud of ash and steam billowed seven miles into the sky. At the same instant, a tremendous pyroclastic surge exploded down the southwestern flanks of the mountain, obliterating two villages in its path, but just missing Precheur. At a speed of 120 miles per hour and at temperatures of 700 F, the surge struck St. Pierre with devastating force. All buildings in its path, as well as the city walls, were instantly demolished. In an instant, some 30,000 people were crushed, burned or asphyxiated to death by the superheated clouds of gases and steam. Gaston Landes, who had remained at his home just outside the surge cloud, was badly burnt and died a few hours later. The cloud spread through the ruins of the city for three minutes, engulfing it in a sea of fire.\\"The Last Days of St.Pierre,\\" Zebrowski, 2002, pp. 127-131 The cloud then struck the waterfront with terrific force, setting several ships afire. According to eyewitness accounts, the steam launch carrying Mouttet and the commission members, which was just about to leave the waterfront, was crushed and set afire, sinking instantly. None on board survived. It is likely that Mouttet was drowned in the water. His wife, 35-year-old H√©l√®ne, still at the hotel, had been killed a few moments earlier when the pyroclastic surge demolished the building. Mouttet was 44. Legacy Mouttet's legacy suffered after the disaster. Many blamed him for his poor handling of the situation. Some historians have criticised his refusal to evacuate the city in order not to alarm public opinion or give arguments to the local opposition, who were calling for urgent measures. Today, the analysis is more nuanced. Firstly, Louis Mouttet had rather limited means to anticipate the severity of an eruption that scientists now term \\"Pel√©an\\" ‚Äî named after the mountain itself, due to the lack of historical precedents. Secondly, the rapid evacuation of the entire population of St. Pierre ‚Äî 30,000 people ‚Äî was beyond the capabilities of the authorities, and the willingness of the residents might have been a stumbling block. Finally, the Governor believed what he said and fully owned the choices that he made, laying down his own life and that of his wife as proof of his sincerity.

It was founded (and the erection of its building financed) in 1971 by Paula Zundel and Dr. Margarethe Fischer-Bosch, daughters of the industrialist Robert Bosch (founder of Robert Bosch GmbH) in memory of painter Georg Friedrich Zundel, Paula Zundel's late husband. The building was erected during the big northern expansion of T√ºbingen in the 1960s and early 1970s, when the Wanne district (a.o.) was built almost from scratch as a residential area on the town's (formerly) rural northern hills. For the first eleven years of its existence, it hosted mainly exhibitions of modern art and contemporary art. From 1982, it could also frequently present the works of painters of the classical modernity, e.g. C√©zanne, Degas, Picasso, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec or Henri Rousseau, while keeping up the focus on modern art and contemporary art. The first director of the Kunsthalle and, so far, for most of its existence, was G√∂tz Adriani, from 1971 to 2005. His main theme was the leading role of the 19th century and early 20th-century French art for international modernity. Adriani managed to organize the first exhibitions in Germany of the works many of the French painters of the period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries at the Kunsthalle T√ºbingen. As for contemporary art, he was helpful in promoting the careers of artists such as George Segal (1972), Richard Hamilton (1974), and Claes Oldenburg (1975). From 2006 to 2009, Martin Hellmond was the director at Kunsthalle. The current director (curator) is Dr. Nicole Fritz. Since 2003, the museum is financed by a charitable non-profit foundation (before, it had been an institution of the city of T√ºbingen), consisting of private donations and the money of the Zundel family.

Technology and products  Basho was the developer of Riak, an open source distributed database that offers high availability, fault tolerance, operation simplicity and scalability. Riak Enterprise was a commercial version of the database offered by Basho, the project's sponsor, with advanced multi-data center replication and enterprise support. Riak is a key value store system that can collect unstructured data and store it as objects in buckets that can then be queried. It's also highly scalable, able to distribute itself over a server cluster and add new servers as needed, while maintaining its own high availability. Riak is written in Erlang, a language that gives a system built-in support for distribution across a server cluster, fault tolerance, and an ability to absorb new hardware being added to the cluster without disrupting operations. Following the demise of Basho, the company assets were purchased by Bet365 and previously closed source components such as riak_repl (multi-data-centre replication) were released as open-source on github.com. Basho also offered Riak Cloud Storage (CS), an open source multi-tenant cloud storage database, built on the Riak platform, which integrated with private clouds and public clouds such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). It can be used by enterprises to power internal private clouds and by startups with an Amazon-compatible API for their own download service. Riak CS includes large object support, S3-compatible API and authentication, multi-tenancy and per-user reporting, an operational model for adding capacity, and a visual interface for monitoring and metrics. Riak 1.0 was released in September 2011 and featured secondary indexes, Riak Pipe, Riak Search integration, Lager, and LevelDB support. Riak 1.1 was released in early 2012 and included numerous changes to Riak Core, a new ownership claim algorithm, Riak KV improvements and MapReduce improvements. In August 2012, Riak 1.2 was released. Riak Enterprise 1.2 added SSL encryption, better balancing and more granular control of replication across multiple data centers. In March 2013, Basho released portions of Riak CS code to open source. Basho also announced the commercial version of Riak CS Enterprise, adding multi-datacenter replication, monitoring tools, and 24x7 support.

Riak 2.1 was released in April 2015 and focused on further performance and simplification for both developers and system administrators History Basho Technologies was founded in January 2008 by Earl Galleher, former executive vice president at Akamai Technologies and Antony Falco, former VP of product management and technical services at Akamai. In 2011, Donald J. Rippert, long time CTO of Accenture joined Basho as president and CEO, and Bobby Patrick, former CMO of GXS and Digex, joined as CMO. In late 2012, Rippert left Basho and Gregory Collins took over as CEO of Basho. In March 2014, Collins stepped down and Adam Wray, former CEO of Tier 3, became the new CEO of Basho. At this time Basho's then CTO, Justin Sheehy, and Chief Architect and original Riak author, Andy Gross, left the company and Dave McCrory, former SVP of engineering at Warner Music Group took over as CTO. McCrory is well known for creating the concept of data gravity, a theory that describes the difficulty of relocating large volumes of data due to the physical restrictions of bandwidth. In 2012, Basho announced RICON, a two-day distributed systems conference for developers. Basho has hosted RICON West and RICON East in both 2012 and 2013, and hosted a single RICON conference in 2014 and 2015. Basho was recognized in the DBTA 100, in the companies that matter most in data, and the CRN Big Data 100 for data management. In 2017, Basho was put into receivership.

The compound has long been known as a powerful emetic, and was used in the treatment of schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis. Emetic 500 mg tartar emetic Antimony potassium tartrate's potential as an emetic was known since the Middle Ages. The compound itself was considered toxic and therefore a different way to administer it was found. Cups made from pure antimony were used to store wine for 24 hours and then the resulting solution of antimony potassium tartrate in wine was consumed in small portions until the wanted emetic effect was reached. Today, the compound is still used to induce vomiting in captured animals to study their diet. Medical The first treatment application against trypanosomiasis was tested in 1906, and the compound's use to treat other tropical diseases was researched. The treatment of leishmania with antimony potassium tartrate started in 1913. After the introduction of antimony(V) containing complexes like sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate, the use of antimony potassium tartrate was phased out. After British physician John Brian Christopherson's discovery in 1918 that antimony potassium tartrate could cure schistosomiasis, the antimonial drugs became widely used. However, the injection of antimony potassium tartrate had severe side effects such as Adams‚ÄìStokes syndrome and therefore alternative substances were under investigation. With the introduction and subsequent larger use of praziquantel in the 1970s, antimony-based treatments fell out of use. Tartar emetic was used in the late 19th and early 20th century in patent medicine as a remedy for alcohol intoxication, and was first ruled ineffective in the United States in 1941, in United States v. 11 1/4 Dozen Packages of Articles Labeled in Part Mrs. Moffat's Shoo-Fly Powders for Drunkenness. The New England Journal of Medicine reported a case study of a patient whose wife secretly gave him a dose of a product called \\"tartaro emetico\\" which contained trivalent antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and is sold in Central America as an aversive treatment for alcohol abuse. The patient, who had been out drinking the night before, developed persistent vomiting shortly after being given orange juice with the drug. When admitted to the hospital, and later in the intensive care unit, he experienced severe chest pains, cardiac abnormalities, renal and hepatic toxicity, and nearly died. The Journal reports that \\"Two years later, he [the patient] reports complete abstinence from alcohol.\\" Preparation Antimony potassium tartrate can be prepared by refluxing a solution of potassium hydrogen tartrate and antimony trioxide for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then filtered and antimony potassium tartrate precipitates out as colourless crystals.

The AAGPBL expanded in its second year of existence by adding two franchises to the original four-team format. At this point, the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes joined the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The number of games in the schedule also increased to 118, while the final Scholarship Series faced first-half winner Kenosha against Milwaukee, second-half champ, in a Best of Seven Series. In that season the ball was decreased in size from 12 inches to 11¬Ω inches. In addition, the base paths were lengthened to 68 feet.AAGPBL Rules of Play As a result, batting averages decreased to low .200 as pitching continued to dominate for second straight season. No batters surpassed the .300 mark, with South Bend's Betsy Jochum collecting the highest average at .296. Once again Kenosha's Helen Nicol led all pitchers in earned run average, turning in a minuscule 0.98 mark, while Minneapolis' Annabelle Lee hurled the first perfect game in league history against Kenosha. Among pitchers who threw no-hitters were Rockford's Carolyn Morris (two) and Mary Pratt, and Kenosha' Elise Harney and Nicol.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Softcover, 294pp. Language: English. The final series was extended from three to seven games. The series went to the limit of seven games and Milwaukee clinched the championship, four to three. Despite losing Game 1, Connie Wisniewski earned the four wins to set a series record, pitching a four-hit shutout in decisive Game 7 to give the Chicks the title.Connie Wisniewsi biography by Joyce M. Smith Although the Chicks won the championship, they had no local financial backing and could not compete with the American Association Milwaukee Brewers. In fact, the Chicks were forced to play all seven games of the series at Kenosha's Lake Front Stadium because the Brewers were using the Borchert Field in Milwaukee. In addition, the high ticket prices charged for AAGPBL games failed to encourage significant fan support. Due to lack of community support and skepticism of journalists, the Chicks moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan prior to the 1945 season. The AAGPBL drew 260,000 fans during the 1944 season, which represented a 49 percent raise over the previous year.

She has previously been a Labour councillor for the London Borough of Southwark and contested the parliamentary seat of Southampton Itchen in the 2015 general election. She is currently a teacher at Harris Invictus Academy Croydon. She has written numerous articles for publications such as the New Statesman, The Guardian, and The Economist. In 2011, Davis authored Tangled Up in Blue, an examination of the rise of the Blue Labour movement. Early life and education Davis was born in Lewisham and spent her early years in Portsmouth and Catford before her family moved to North London, where she attended the comprehensive Hampstead School. At the age of fourteen, she organised a protest against the quality of the school meals provided by Serco. Home-cooked, healthy food was offered in a rival, all-you-can-eat tuck shop and the students boycotted the official canteen, forcing them to change their menu within two weeks. In 2003 she and two schoolfriends organised 'Hands Up For Peace' in response to the war in Iraq. This led to thousands of other students making a hand-print bearing their name and a message of peace. These were then printed out, attached to sticks and planted in Parliament Square to make a protest with the intention of influencing Prime Minister Tony Blair. After leaving school, she read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Balliol College, Oxford. In 2005, while still an undergraduate, she won the Oxford Leadership Prize which is a contest requiring an essay on a contemporary issue of political leadership. Her winning essay, \\"Invisible Leaders\\", was presented in a novel audio format and won her the prize of ¬£4,000. Her leadership models were those that \\"create space and opportunity for action\\". She subsequently undertook a postgraduate MA degree in journalism from City University London.BA Journalism, History & Context of Journalism, 26 February 2014 Journalism Since graduating from Oxford University, Davis has worked as an intern at Bloomberg News and as a freelance journalist, writing for publications such as The Guardian, The Independent, the New Statesman, the Mail on Sunday, The Economist, The Times, the Times Higher Education and the Financial Times. Davis has appeared as a political commentator for a variety of current affairs television and radio programmes such as Daily Politics, The Politics Show, Newsnight, Sunday Politics and Sky News. In September 2011, she published the book Tangled Up in Blue, which is an account of the development of Blue Labour, a movement within the Labour Party founded by Lord Glasman. Political career In 2010, Davis stood as the Labour candidate for the Cathedrals ward of Southwark, but lost to a Liberal Democrat candidate. She entered a Microsoft contest of ideas for the 18‚Äì25 age group and won ¬£10,000 of sponsorship for her plan to engage unemployed, young people in local government, encouraging them to become councillors. In May 2011, she was herself elected to Southwark Council as councillor in the Lane ward of Peckham which she won with a swing from the Lib Dems of 12%. As a councillor, she campaigned against the proliferation of betting shops in the borough. She is an active member and supporter of several charitable, political and trade union organisations including Blackfriars Settlement, Crisis over Christmas, Headliners, Make Justice Work, National Union of Journalists and Unite. Davis also supports Envision, and was one of the first Envision Graduates; Davis explained how this experience had influenced her work for the community. On 13 July 2013, Davis was selected as the Labour Parliamentary Candidate for Southampton Itchen, in the 2015 general election, to succeed John Denham. Although Davis was criticised for her lack of connections to Southampton, Denham endorsed his successor, saying \\"I know that Rowenna Davis has the drive and vision to represent Southampton superbly in the years ahead...\\" In February 2015, Iain Dale predicted that she would increase the Labour majority, but an unpredicted swing to the Conservatives confounded this prediction and she lost to Royston Smith by 2,316 votes (5.2%). In 2019, Davis put herself forward for selection as Labour's candidate for Croydon and Sutton in the 2020 London Assembly election. After politics In June 2015, Davis announced via Twitter that she was training to become a teacher and subsequently began working at Oasis Academy Mayfield in Southampton. She is now an English teacher at Harris Invictus Academy Croydon. Email hacking Davis' email account was hacked in 2011 and the hacker tried to extort ¬£500 from her for its return. The hacker also impersonated her in fraudulent emails to her five thousand contacts, friends and relatives, trying to persuade them to send money to a Western Union account. The email account was provided by Google who Davis felt were unhelpful initially. After several days, she regained control of the account, following the intervention of a contact who worked at Google.

They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the specific purpose or specific insect it is catered to. Most consist of several different sections that provide insects with nesting facilities ‚Äì particularly during winter, offering shelter or refuge for many types of insects. Their purposes include hosting pollinators.  Purpose  Many insect hotels are used as nest sites by insects including solitary bees and solitary wasps. These insects drag prey to the nest where an egg is deposited. Other insects hotels are specifically designed to allow the insects to hibernate, notable examples include ladybirds (ladybugs) and, arguably, butterflies. Insect hotels are popular amongst gardeners and fruit and vegetable growers due to their role encouraging insect pollination. Some elaborately designed insect hotels may also be attractions in their own right and, increasingly, can be found in pub gardens and various tourist locations.  Different hotels for different insects  Ladybird hotel Bee hotel in Grimbergen, Belgium Bee hotel and Insect hotel in La CasaRoja Farm, Asturias, Spain. Good materials to build insect hotels with can include using dry stone walls or old tiles. Drilled holes in the hotel materials also encourage insects to leave larvae to gestate. Therefore, different materials, such as stones and woods are recommended for a wide range and diversity of insect life. Logs and bark, and bound reeds and bamboo are also often used. The various components or sizes of holes to use as entry of an insect hotel attract different species. Ready-made insect hotels are also found at garden centers, and particularly ecological and educational conservational centers and organisations.  Solitary bees and wasps  Solitary bees, and solitary wasps do not live within a hive with a queen. There are males and females. A fertilized female makes a nest in wood or stone and bored into the wood in order to construct a nursery. The most common bee hotel is created from a sawn wooden log or portion of a cut tree trunk in which holes are drilled of different sizes (e.g. 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm), about a few centimeters apart. They attract many bees. The holes have to be tilted slightly so that no rainwater can get in. Stone blocks are also used for this purpose. The holes are drilled quite lengthily into the material but not so far as to create a tunnel to the other side of the wood. Furthermore, the entrances to these access burrows must be smooth enough so that the delicate bodies of the insects are not damaged. Often, with wooden hotels, the exterior is sanded. The best location for a hotel is a warm and sheltered place, such as a southern-facing (in the northern hemisphere) wall or hedge. The first insects are already active towards the end of winter and would be actively seeking for such a place to settle. Other species like to furnish their nests with clay, stone and sand, or in between bricks. Even a simple bundle of bamboo or reeds, tied or put in an old tin can and hung in a warm place, is very suitable for solitary bees. The bamboo must be cut in a specific way to allow entry for the insects. Often people may add stems of elderberry, rose or blackberry shoots whose marrow can serve as a food source as well.  Butterflies  Butterflies that hibernate like to find sheltered places such as crevices in houses and sheds, or enclosed spaces such as those in bundles of leaves. Some insect hotels incorporate special butterfly enclosures with vertical slits that take into account the animals' sensitive wings, however the suitability of these enclosures for butterflies is disputed.  Parasitic insects  By using an insect hotel, parasitic insects are also attracted to make use of the facilities. Cuckoo bees and wasps will lay their eggs within the nests of others in order to provide them with readily available food upon hatching without the parent insect having to provide for them. Hotels also attract predatory insects which help control unwanted bugs. For example, earwigs are good to have present in and near fruit trees as they eat the plant lice that may settle on the tree and disturb fruit growth. A terracotta flower pot hung upside-down, filled with bundles of straw or wood wool is an ideal house for earwigs. Ladybirds are easy to cater for by placing many twigs within an open wooden box on its side to provide many small cavities. Ladybirds prefer to hibernate in larger groups so this will encourage many to settle in one specific place. Isopods have their usefulness as scavengers in the garden. These animals like large gaps between stacked bricks and roof tiles to shelter from rain and to hide from predators.

The local population is predominantly Irish nationalist and republican. Parts of the road form an interface area with the neighbouring Ulster loyalist areas of the Greater Shankill and it was the site of much activity during the Troubles. The Springfield Road includes the Ballymurphy and New Barnsley districts and is overlooked by Black Mountain and Divis. History Much of what now forms the housing estates of the Springfield Road was formerly rural land near the base of the mountains. The area around what became New Barnsley was known as Brown's Fields and was formerly used for grazing cattle.Belfast History From Joe Graham The Belfast History Man The area would later become industrialised with James Mackie & Sons establishing a textile factory on the road in the late nineteenth century. It became a leading employer and produced large quantities of munitions during the Second World War.The Industrial Heritage of West Belfast The area experienced growth in the 1940s when a series of housing estates were built. The pattern of segregation in Northern Ireland was maintained as the new estates were partitioned along religious lines, with the Highfield and New Barnsley estates on the northern side of the road predominantly Protestant and the Ballymurphy estate earmarked for a mainly Catholic population.Gary MacEoin, Northern Ireland: Captive of History, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1974, p. 240 The area saw an influx of temporary residents in the 1960s when the inhabitants of the Pound Loney area of the lower Falls were temporarily rehoused in Ballymurphy whilst the new Divis flats complex was built. A young Gerry Adams, who had been involved in agitation against the redevelopment of the Pound Loney, was amongst those to be rehoused in this manner.Brian Feeney, Sinn F√©in: A Hundred Turbulent Years, O'Brien Press, 2002, p. 258 The Troubles Whiterock Orange Hall, where the riots began Streets leading off the Springfield Road were at the centre of the 1969 riots which were among the earliest incidents to occur during the Troubles. Kashmir Road, which leads directly off the lower Springfield Road, was the site of a series of arson attacks on homes, along with Cupar Street and Bombay Street, both of which are between the Springfield, Falls and Shankill Roads.Eamon Mallie, Patrick Bishop, The Provisional IRA, Corgi, Ailesbury, 1988, pp. 116‚Äì117Tim Pat Coogan, The Troubles. p. 104 Rioting returned the following year with fierce fighting occurring at the interface between Catholic Ballymurphy and the then Protestant New Barnsley areas. The trouble began on 31 March 1970 when junior Orange Order bands heading to Bangor, County Down began to play their tunes on the Springfield Road early in the morning before travelling to the North Down coast. Although the bands left without incident crowds of angry residents gathered in Ballymurphy and a unit of the Scots Guards was deployed in preparation for trouble later that night. When the bands returned sectarian clashes broke out and soon developed into a full-scale riot as the soldiers struggled to maintain order. A heavier, more forceful, army presence was deployed in Ballymurphy the following night and in anger the residents attacked the soldiers. Three nights of rioting followed, with the army make heavy use of CS gas canisters and grenades in a largely unsuccessful attempt to break up the crowds.Peter Taylor, Provos: The IRA and Sinn F√©in, Bloomsbury, 1998, pp. 73‚Äì74 The Protestant population of New Barnsley moved out of the area soon after this event.Pat Walsh, Irish Republicanism and Socialism, Athol Books, 1994, pp. 115‚Äì116 Some individuals who would go on to become leading figures within the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) lived on the Springfield Road until the outbreak of the Troubles, notably Ballymurphy native John WhiteIan S.

The road continues north-west before turning sharply in a more south-westerly direction. It eventually merges into the Monagh by-pass which links the area with Kennedy Way and ultimately the M1 motorway. From the Grosvenor Road to the junction with the West Circular Road it forms part of the B38 whilst from there after it is part of the A55. Lower Springfield Lanark Way, which permits access between the Springfield and Shankill roads The areas at the start of the Springfield Road are made up largely of social housing with some shops on the main road itself. These form part of the Edenderry and Clonard districts that are also part of the Falls Road. As this area is close to neighbouring loyalist estates a number of peace lines are in existence due to continuing low level violence and vandalism. Ainsworth Avenue, which formerly linked the Springfield Road to the Woodvale Road is closed off as are the points at which Kirk Street and Workman Avenue in the Woodvale area touch Springfield and the parts of the Highfield estate that border the Springfield Road Limited access is still possible through Lanark Way with the street linking the Springfield and Shankill roads, albeit with gates that can be locked. The street was favoured by hitmen associated with the UDA West Belfast Brigade to gain access to the republican districts of the west of the city, notably Stephen McKeag who nicknamed the street the Yellow Brick Road.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 1‚Äì2 Other features of the area include Springvale Industrial Estate and Business Park as well as Springfield Park, a small facility maintained by Belfast City Council.Springfield Park The Farset International budget accommodation and conference facility is contained within Springfield Park.Farset International Clonard Monastery is also located close to the Springfield Road.

History Fettercairn Distillery was founded in 1824 by Alexander Ramsay, owner of the Fasque estate, who converted a corn mill at Nethermill into a distillery. After losing his fortune, Alexander was forced to sell the estate to the Gladstone family in 1829.

The unicorn is said to stand for purity and strength and has been a symbol of Scotland since the reign of King Robert III. It is also used within the Ramsay clan crest, of which the founder Alexander Ramsay brought with him to the distillery.

Mashav is responsible for the design, coordination and implementation of the State of Israel's worldwide development and cooperation programs in developing countries. MASHAV believes that its greatest possible contribution to developing countries can be made in fields where Israel has relevant expertise accumulated during its own development experience as a young country facing similar challenges.http://www.mashav.mfa.gov.il/MFA/mashav/AboutMASHAV/Pages/Guiding_Principles.aspx MASHAV's development programs are conducted through workshops and training in the fields of agriculture, education and medicine and are funded jointly with multinational organizations such as the OAS, the Inter-American Development Bank, the UN development plan, UNESCO and the Food and Agriculture Organization. Background Mashav was set up in the wake of the Bandung Conference of 1955,Edith Bruder, Tudor Parfitt, African Zion: Studies in Black Judaism, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012 p.113 n.93. from which Israel had been excluded at the demand of Arab countries who threatened a boycott of the conference if Israel was invited.Anti-israel Resolution Adopted at Bandung; Red China Supports Arabs It was established on Golda Meir's initiative, in 1958, after her visit to Africa. Meir stated that it was the expression of an empathy with victims of oppression, discrimination and slavery, but the project also blended other goals, such as escaping ‚Äòthe Arab noose‚Äô by overcoming the boycott imposed on it by Arab nations.Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman, 'The Sincerest Form of Flattery:the Peace Corps, the Helsinki Accords, and the Internationalization of Social Values,‚Äô in Bruce J. Schulman (ed.), Making the American Century: Essays on the Political Culture of Twentieth Century America, Oxford University Press, 2014 pp.124-140 p.130. In the 1960s it was also very active in assistance to agricultural development projects in South America.Hugo Harvey Parada, Las relaciones entre Chile e Israel, 1973-1990: la conexci√≥n oculta, RIL Editores,2011 p.138 Since its inception in late 1957, Mashav has striven to share with the rest of the developing world the know-how and technologies which provided the basis for Israel's own rapid development. Mashav started as a modest program, focused on grassroots-level human capacity building at a time when Israel itself was still very much a developing country. It has since blossomed into an extensive program of cooperation throughout the developing world, with the aim of promoting sustainable development and social equity. MASHAV grew gradually and organically in response to repeated requests on the part of the peoples that freed themselves from the yoke of colonialism and were seeking practical and political means of ridding themselves of poverty, hunger and disease that was the heritage of that era. Since its establishment, over 270,000 professionals from more than 132 countries have participated in Mashav's training programs. Mashav promotes the centrality of human resource enrichment and institutional capacity building in the development process ‚Äì an approach which has attained global consensus, and implements this principle by offering professional training courses in Israel and in host countries and short and long-term professional consultations. By 2010, Mashav had trained a quarter of a million students, predominantly African, from the developing world in education, health, science and agriculture.Eytan Gilboa, Nachman Shai, ‚ÄòRebuilding Public Diplomacy: The Case of Israel‚Äô, in Ali Fisher,Scott Lucas (eds.), Trials of Engagement: The Future of US Public Diplomacy, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2010 pp.33-53. p.39 cooperating with over 140 countries.Fred Skolnik, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe State of Israel (1948-2000),‚Äô in Michael Avi-Yonah (ed.), https://books.google.it/books?id=AhasMr2F3i8C&pg;=PA340 A History of Israel and the Holy Land, A&C; Black, 2003 p.340. The expertise and technology acquired in cultivating areas such as deserts affected by water scarcity has underwritten many projects. Philosophy Mashav's philosophy is to encourage professionals from the developing world to find their own solutions to development issues and adapt them to the reality of their countries own specific needs and potential, guided by the international agreed principles of aid effectiveness such as demand driven programs, country ownership, improved coordination and more. Mashav operates according to the needs and demands originating from the partner countries, as opposed to supply driven programs initiated by Israel that might not be relevant and effective elsewhere. Methodology Mashav updates its professional training programs in face of current global challenges such as adaptation to climate change and food security, concentrating on human capacity building in developing countries by imparting know-how and transferring innovative technologies and tested methodologies adaptable to developing country needs. In events of natural disasters Mashav provides humanitarian assistance and participates in reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. Mashav's approach is to ensure social, economic and environmental sustainable development, joining the international community efforts of implementing the Millennium Development Goals. Since its inception, Mashav's activities in the developing world have been guided by the basic approach that development work is organic in nature. It is impossible to concentrate efforts in one area, such as food security, without providing proper attention to health care, community building and education. Only through a sustainable and comprehensive development program can measured results be obtained and the desired impact felt by those who need assistance the most.

History and architecture St John's Cathedral Calcutta 1851 Foundation Plaques, St. John's Church, Kolkata The land for the St. John's Church was donated by the Maharaja Nabo Kishen Bahadur, the founder of the Shovabazar Raj Family. The foundation stone was laid by Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India on 6 April 1784. Two marble plaques at the entrance mark the two historic events. Built by architect James Agg, the St John's church is built with a combination of brick and stone and was commonly known as the \\"Pathure Girja\\" (Stone Church). Stone was a rare material in the late 18th century Kolkata. The stones came from the medieval ruins of Gour, and were shipped down the Hooghly River. The minutes book in the church office tell in detail the story of how the ruins of Gaur were robbed to build St John's church. St John's Church Kolkata The church is a large square structure in the Neoclassical architectural style. A stone spire 174 ft tall is its most distinctive feature. The spire holds a giant clock, which is wound every day. One of the driving forces behind the construction of the cathedral was Chaplain William Johnson, the husband of Begum Johnson. Interior Tall columns frame the church building on all sides and the entrance is through a stately portico. The floor is a rare hue of blue-grey marble, brought from Gaur. Large windows allow the sunlight to filter through the coloured glass. Interior of St. John's Church, Kolkata The Pipe Organ of St John's Church in Kolkata The main altar is of a simple design. Behind the altar is a semi-circular dome and the floor is of dark blue, almost black, stone. To the left of the altar hangs a painting of The Last Supper by the British artist of German origin, Johann Zoffany. On the right is a beautiful stained glass window. The walls of the church contain memorial tablets, statues and plaques, mostly of British army officers and civil servants. The pipe organ was installed in the early nineteenth century and remains the grandest in Calcutta. It was manufactured by William Hill & Son & Norman & Beard Ltd. in England. This company was famous for manufacturing of pipe organs for movie theaters in the silent era. Memorial of James Achilles Kirkpatrick \\"White Mughal\\" James Achilles Kirkpatrick, popularly known as the White Mughal was the central character of William Dalrymple best selling work of history White Mughals died in Calcutta on 15 October 1805 at the age of 41. He was buried at the North Park Street Cemetery, but neither his grave nor the cemetery exists today. James Achilles Kirkpatrick's father James Kirkpatrick, popularly known as the Handsome Colonel, along with his brothers erected a memorial in memory of James Achilles Kirkpatrick on the southern wall of the St. John's Church. The overblown and oddly inappropriate epitaph, erected still stands to this day. Memorial of James Pattle Memorial of James Pattle, St. John's Church, Kolkata The memorial of James Pattle, the great-great-grandfather of William Dalrymple is also located on the south walls of St. John's Church. According to Dalrample: Johann Zoffany's Last Supper Last Supper by Johann Zoffany after its restoration, completed in 2010 On the walls of the St. John's Church hangs a painting modeled after Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper. Painted by Johann Zoffany, the painting is not, however, an exact replica of Leonardo's masterpiece. The top left-hand corner of the painting shows a sword, which represents a common peon's tulwar. A water ewer standing near the table is a copy of Hindustani spittoon and next to it lies a water-filled beesty bag (a goatskin bag used for storing water). The most unusual feature of Zoffany's Last Supper lies in the selection of models used to represent Jesus and his twelve disciples. Jesus was portrayed as the Greek priest Father Constantinos Parthenios.Father Constantinos Parthenios and the Last Supper by Johann Zoffany in the St. John‚Äôs Church, Kolkata, ELINEPA, 2017 while John is represented by W.C. Blacquiere, the police magistrate of Calcutta during the 1780s. Judas was portrayed as the auctioneer William Tulloh In short, these are all people of power at the time, including people from the East India Trading Company. Zoffany's Last Supper has been restored as the result of a co-operation between the INTACH Art Conservation Centre and the Goethe Institut, both of Calcutta. They sponsored the German painting conservator Renate Kant (based in Singapore) to supervise the restoration and train the restorers of the INTACH Centre. The restoration of Zoffany's Last Supper was completed on 3 July 2010. Compound The St John's Church was constructed on an old graveyard, so the compound houses a number of tombs and memorials, but only a few dates back to the date of construction of the church. The compound also serves as a parking lot for the nearby offices. Job Charnock's Mausoleum Job Charnock's Tomb & Epitaph On 24 August 1690 an ambitious trader, Job Charnock, of the British East India Company landed in the village of Sutanuti (present day North Calcutta) never to return. Although Charnock died two years later, but he combined the three villages of Sutanuti, Govindopur & Kolikata to form the city of Calcutta. The octagonal Moorish style tomb was erected by Charnock's son in law Charles Ayer. Built of stones brought all the way from Pallavaram near Chennai, which later came out to be known as Charnockite.Roy, Nishitranjan,Swasato Kolkata Ingrej Amaler Sthapathya, , pp. 18, 1st edition, 1988, Prtikhan Press Pvt.

The English translation is: \\"In the hands of God Almighty, Job Charnock, English knight and recently the most worthy agent of the English in this Kingdom of Bengal, left his mortal remains under this marble so that he might sleep in the hope of a blessed resurrection at the coming of Christ the Judge. After he had journeyed onto foreign soil he returned after a little while to his eternal home on the 10th day of January 1692.

She died on 19 February AD 1696‚Äì7.Das, Soumitra,Jay Walkers Guide to Calcutta,Jan 2007, Eminence Designs.\\" Black Hole of Calcutta Monument Memorial of Black Hole of Calcutta For some, the Black Hole of Calcutta event is a controversial part of Indian history; for others it was an atrocity that befell its victims. According to one British survivor (John Holwell), during the siege of Calcutta Siraj ‚Äì ud ‚Äì Daulah took 146 prisoners and confined them in a room measuring 14 feet by 8 feet and locked them up overnight. Only 23 survived: the remaining 123 perished of suffocation and heat stroke. John Holwell later became the Governor of Bengal and went on to build a memorial at the site of the Black Hole (present day GPO). However, some historians have objected to Holwell's account, claiming that the British escaped through a secret tunnel to the banks of the Hooghly, from where they were carried to Madras by an awaiting ship. One such historian, R. C. Majumdar, claims without evidence to support his assertion that the \\"Holwell story is completely baseless and can not be considered reliable historical information.\\" In this regard, although it is possible that Holwell exaggerated the number of persons who were confined and died, his account was an eye-witness version of the events that befell the hapless victims and therefore represents direct evidence of the atrocity itself. The story of the Black Hole Monument is no less interesting. Holwell erected a monument at the site of the Black Hole tragedy but it disappeared in 1822 to be rebuilt by Curzon in 1901 at the SouthWest corner of the Writers' Building. During the height of the Indian independence movement in 1940, the British removed the monument to its present location at the compound of St. John's Church. Second Rohilla War Memorial Second Rohilla War Memorial First and Second Rohilla War (1772‚Äì74) was fought between the Rohillas and the Nawab of Oudh, with the British backing the later. Rohillas are a branch of the Pashtun tribe of the Pakistan and Afghanistan border. Some of the Rohillas settled in the Oudah region and soon a conflict began between the Rohillas and the Nawab of Oudh, Shuja ‚Äì ud ‚Äì Daula. This resulted in Rohilla War. The British backed the Nawab of Oudh and in January 1774 the Rohilla chief Hafez Ruhmet was killed resulting in the defeat of the Rohillas. A treaty in October 1774 brought the dispute to a close. With their power somewhat restricted the Rohillas continued to live in their territory of Rohilkhand, which still exists in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The Rohilla Memorial at the St. John's Church compound consists of a circular dome supported by 12 pillars. The memorial contains a plaque with the names of several British Military Officers, killed in the Rohilla War. Charlotte Canning, Countess Canning Memorial Lady Canning's Memorial Charlotte Canning (1817‚Äì1861) was the wife of Charles Canning the Governor General and Viceroy of India. She died of malaria and was buried in Barrackpore (Barrackpurthe)a memorial was also constructed in the St. John's Church graveyard. Lady Canning's name has been immortalised by the famous sweet maker Bhim Nag, who specially designed the sweet Pantua in her honour and named it Ladykeni. Lady Canning's elaborately decorated memorial lies on the Northern corridor of the St. John's Church. Frances (Begum) Johnson's grave Frances (Begum) Johnson's grave Located at the far end of the St. John's Church complex and next to Job Chranok's tomb lies the circular temple-like tomb of Frances Johnson (1725‚Äì1812). The grave stone inside the grave is no less interesting than the grave itself. Frances Johnson (popularly known as Begum Johnson), the grand old lady of Calcutta, lived up to an age of 89 and married four times.

Its length measures 2.5 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are large, deeply immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which the tilted edge of the last volution only projects, which is marked by five slender spiral threads. The five whorls of the teleoconch are rounded on all but the first whorl. They are marked by very broad, strong, retractive axial ribs, of which 16 occur upon the second and third and 20 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the axial ribs the whorls are marked by four very broad, low spiral cords, which are separated by mere incised lines between the sutures. This renders their junction with the axial ribs very strongly nodulous. The sutures are constricted, showing a portion of the peripheral cord. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a strong, well rounded spiral cord. The base of the body whorl is decidedly attenuated. It is marked by seven subequal spiral cords, the spaces between which are marked by numerous slender, axial threads. The aperture is elongate- ovate, and decidedly effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. It is rendered sinuous by the spiral cords. The columella is long, moderately strong, somewhat sinuous, reflected, reinforced by the base, and provided with a fold at its insertion.Dall & Bartsch, A Monograph of West American Pyramidellid Mollusks, United States National Museum Bulletin 68, 1 p. 153-154; 1909 Distribution The type species was found in the Pacific Ocean off San Pedro Bay, California.

The candidates included six delegates declaring for Paul, three for Romney, two for Gingrich, two for Santorum, and nine that had not declared for any candidate. Even though Romney had only three delegates on the ballot, they received more votes than most of the other pledged delegates, and all three were elected, whereas only one of Paul's delegates got enough votes to place in the top six. Two uncommitted delegates were elected along with the four pledged ones; one of these switched to Romney after the vote was conducted, giving the Massachusetts governor four total elected delegates, plus three super delegates from the territory that had already pledged to him before the caucus. This yielded a total of seven delegates for Romney, one for Paul and two uncommitted. Popular vote Raw vote totals showed that even though only one of Paul's delegates was elected, the combined showing for all six Paul pledges on the ballot exceeded that of the delegates for the other candidates. In all, 112 votes were cast for Paul's pledges, 104 for Romney's, 23 for Santorum's, 19 for Gingrich's. Uncommitted delegates got the highest combined vote total, however, at 132. At first it appeared Romney had received the most popular votes, since the votes for the uncommitted delegate who switched to Romney afterward were mistakenly added to Romney's column by some media Web sites; this was soon corrected. As each caucus voter was entitled to six votes for all delegates at large (as opposed to voting separately for each delegate), it is not known just how many individual voters cast their ballots for which candidate's pledges; the popular vote totals only reflect the amount of raw votes each delegate received in the final tally.

UDC is working with many other companies, including Sony, DuPont and Novaled. Back in 2009 UDC claimed that \\"virtually all AMOLEDs on the market use our technology\\". Based in Ewing, New Jersey, with international offices in Ireland, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan, Universal Display works with a network of organizations, including Princeton University, the University of Southern California, the University of Michigan, and PPG Industries.http://www.oled- info.com/universal_display_udc Technological advantages The different manufacturing process of OLEDs lends itself to several advantages over flat panel displays made with current LCD technology. ; Lower cost in the future: OLEDs can be printed onto any suitable substrate by an inkjet printer or even by screen printing, theoretically making them cheaper to produce than LCD or plasma displays. However, fabrication of the OLED substrate is more costly than that of a TFT LCD, until mass production methods lower cost through scalability. Roll-to-roll vapour-deposition methods for organic devices do allow mass production of thousands of devices per minute for minimal cost, although this technique also induces problems in that devices with multiple layers can be challenging to make because of registration, lining up the different printed layers to the required degree of accuracy. flexible display from Sony ; Lightweight and flexible plastic substrates: OLED displays can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates leading to the possible fabrication of flexible organic light-emitting diodes for other new applications, such as roll-up displays embedded in fabrics or clothing. As the substrate used can be flexible such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the displays may be produced inexpensively. ; Wider viewing angles and improved brightness: OLEDs can enable a greater artificial contrast ratio (both dynamic range and static, measured in purely dark conditions) and a wider viewing angle compared to LCDs because OLED pixels emit light directly. OLED pixel colors appear correct and unshifted, even as the viewing angle approaches 90¬∞ from normal. ; Better power efficiency and thickness: LCDs filter the light emitted from a backlight, allowing a small fraction of light through. So, they cannot show true black. However, an inactive OLED element does not produce light or consume power, thus allowing true blacks. Dismissing the backlight also makes OLEDs lighter because some substrates are not needed. This allows electronics potentially to be manufactured more cheaply, but, first, a larger production scale is needed, because OLEDs still somewhat are niche products. When looking at top-emitting OLEDs, thickness also plays a role when talking about index match layers (IMLs). Emission intensity is enhanced when the IML thickness is 1.3‚Äì2.5 nm. The refractive value and the matching of the optical IMLs property, including the device structure parameters, also enhance the emission intensity at these thicknesses. ; Response time: OLEDs also can have a faster response time than standard LCD screens. Whereas LCD displays are capable of between 1 and 16 ms response time offering a refresh rate of 60 to 480 Hz, an OLED theoretically can have a response time less than 0.01 ms, enabling a refresh rate up to 100,000 Hz . OLEDs also can be run as a flicker display, similar to a CRT, in order to eliminate the sample-and-hold effect that creates motion blur on OLEDs. Some disadvantages include: ; Power consumption: While an OLED will consume around 40% of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black, for the majority of images it will consume 60‚Äì80% of the power of an LCD. However, an OLED can use more than three times as much power to display an image with a white background, such as a document or web site.Stokes, Jon. (2009-08-11) This September, OLED no longer \\"three to five years away\\". Arstechnica.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-04.

Plastic is porous and oxygen with moisture causes OLEDs to degrade. [However]...These kind of displays are unbreakable, flexible on stainless steel foil. It would result in a thinner device because you don‚Äôt have the pieces of glass. It could conform around the sides, so you can show information on the sides. It would be lighter. So you can either make it smaller or thinner or you can make a larger battery so that it lasts longer. The challenges are encapsulation, so you need an encapsulation process. The temperature is too high to deposit them directly to the plastic, so they do is they literally deposit them on glass.\\" Further SID Rosenblatt thinks that flexible OLEDs will be initially a niche market for the high end.http://www.oled-display.net/universal-display-sid-rosenblatt- about-the-future-of-oled-technology/ iSuppli, a market research firm, sees the flexible OLED display market growing significantly from 2013 to 2020.

The six whorls of the teleoconch are flattened, strongly contracted at the periphery, and well shouldered at the summit. They are marked by strong, somewhat retractive axial ribs, which terminate at the posterior edge of the first supraperipheral keel, which is smooth. Of these ribs, 18 occur upon the second, 20 upon the third, 22 upon the fourth, and 27 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the axial ribs the whorls are marked by four spiral keels, which equal the ribs in strength and render their junction nodulous. The spaces enclosed by the axial ribs and spiral cords are well impressed round pits. The sutures are strongly channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a strong groove. The base of the body whorl is well rounded. It is marked by five spiral cords, which grow successively a little weaker from the periphery to the umbilical area. The spaces between these cords are marked by slender spiral threads, which correspond to the ribs on the spire. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, rendered wavy by the spiral cords. The columella is moderately strong, decidedly curved, reflected, and reinforced by the base.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1996. It is part of the Towards a Greater Des Moines MPS. Description The historic district is a part of the larger Bates Addition that forms a part of the River Bend Neighborhood. The focal point of the neighborhood is a park that is surrounded by a residential area. The historic district is situated on a plateau. The area west of the district rises gently toward Sixth Street while the land to the east drops into the Des Moines River floodplain. The buildings in the historic district were constructed in the late 19th and early 20th century. The district contains 23 resources of which 17 are contributing properties . with Bates Park is one of the resources, as are 14 single-family homes and two stables that were built originally to house horses and possibly carriages. Some of the houses are moderately expensive and are located facing the park and overlooking the river valley. The more modest homes face one another south of the park. History The property where the historic district is located is in a large tract of land that was acquired by Des Moines lawyer and journalist Curtis Bates in 1860. He spent the last part of his life managing his real estate holdings. Bates dies in 1879 and the property was largely undeveloped. His widow Sophia had the land platted as the Bates Addition in 1883 and set aside parkland, which state law at the time prevented the Des Moines park commissioners from accepting. It was not until 1900 that she was able to donate the land to the city and Bates Park was dedicated on August 14, 1900. Over the years the park has been improved. A pavilion, wading pool and playground equipment have been added. A grove of elm trees were destroyed in the 1960s by Dutch Elm disease. Architecture Houses in the Bates Park Historic District were built starting in the 1890s and construction was completed in the area by 1920. They are single-family homes that are constructed primarily in the Colonial Revival and American Four Square styles. The middle-class homes on the west side of the park were built first and the more modest dwellings south of the park started to be built soon after. Most of the houses feature little by way of architectural detailing.

There are also two or three white patches on the parapodia, the fleshy protrusions on either side of the body. Distribution Elysia catulus feeds on the seagrass Zostera and is found in seagrass meadows on the eastern seaboard of North America from Nova Scotia south to South Carolina. Biology Elysia catulus has a short life cycle, living for less than a year. Spawning takes place in June and July and the adults die soon afterwards. The larvae that hatch from the eggs form part of the zooplankton and disperse widely. After settling, the juveniles grow rapidly. This may be linked to the fact that they develop cerata (hornlike outgrowths). These provide an increase in digestive and respiratory surface area which allows increased rates of metabolism and consequently growth. There are considerable fluctuations in population size and a sudden increase may be due to the arrival of larvae that have originated elsewhere. Juveniles are found in the safety of the inrolled margins of the Zostera leaf whereas adults feed on the flat leaf blades. Feeding is done by puncturing the plant's tissue with the radular tooth and sucking out the cell sap.Elysia serca Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce. Retrieved-2012-01-28.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1990. It is part of the Suburban Development in Des Moines Between the World Wars, 1918--1941 MPS. History The name Chautauqua Park refers to the Chautauqua assembly grounds that occupied the property from 1896 to around the turn of the 20th century. The assembly hall, which was said to hold 3,000 people, was located at the present intersection of Nash Drive and Chautauqua Parkway. with Senators Robert La Follette and Jonathan P. Dolliver as well as Booker T. Washington lectured in the pavilion. Des Moines University acquired the property after it was no longer used for Chautauqua gatherings. They planned to build a new campus on the site, but financial problems prevented them carrying out their plans. The school merged with Highland Park College in 1918 and later ceased its operations. In 1923 they decided to develop the roughly site as a residential subdivision. Original plans for the subdivision included Douglas Park. The park is and features a heavily wooded hillside. The creek that ran through the park is now mostly dry. Architecture Des Moines landscape architect L. Earl Foglesong, who was responsible for the Iowa State Capitol grounds and the Iowa State Fairgrounds, designed Chautauqua Park. Chautauqua Park's plat features narrow curved roadways that follow the topography of the land. There are no sidewalks in the neighborhood. The district contains 166 properties, of which 118 are houses, 45 are garages and an object (entry posts). Seventy-five houses, 24 garages and the entry posts are contributing properties. The properties that are not contributing were either built after 1941 or have been significantly altered in the years since they were built. Twenty-nine houses were built in the subdivision between 1925 and 1930. Building slowed during the Great Depression when 12 houses were built. Between 1938 and 1941 another 51 houses were built. The houses are generally 1¬Ω stories, constructed of brick and feature intersecting gables. They are primarily Tudor Revival in style. There are also some in a local style of based on the Tudor style known as ‚ÄúBeaverdale Brick.‚Äù Because Chautauqua Park was built as a commuter suburb, many of the houses were built with attached garages. There are two entry posts at 13th Street and Chautauqua Parkway that were constructed around 1929. They were constructed of brick with stone trim and concrete gabled tops. Neighborhood donations paid for their construction.

The almost straight line runs from Wolfsbarge to the Huis ter Haar at Musselkanaal. The border is slightly bent at Stadskanaal. The slightly bent line between Musselkanaal and Stadskanaal is sometimes called Koningsraai. The Semslinie is named after Johan Sems. History On August 3, 1614, the provinces of Groningen and Drenthe asked Johan Sems (asked by Groningen) and Johan de la Haye (asked by Drenthe) to determine the border between the two provinces. Determining the exact border was necessary because both provinces wanted to get peat from the bog (Bourtanger Moor) between them. Before the 17th century, there was no large-scale peat harvesting and the provinces never bothered about the exact location of the border. Another reason for determining the exact border was that Groningen and Drenthe both claimed Ter Apel. On March 2, 1615, the map with the new border was presented. Ter Apel was allocated to Drenthe. Groningen argued that the Ter Apel Monastery used to be owned by the diocese of M√ºnster and was never owned by the Bishopric of Utrecht of which Drenthe was once part. In October 1615, a new map was made, on which Ter Apel would become part of Groningen. This time Drenthe had objections. In 1630, stadtholder Ernst Casimir determined that the disputed area near Ter Apel would become a communal area (Latin: compascuum). This brought a temporary end to the conflict. In 1756, Groningen began digging a canal from the village of Bareveld to Ter Apel, parallel to the Semslinie. It is called the Stadskanaal (Cities canal, not to be confused with the town Stadskanaal) and was used to transport peat. This canal became a very important waterway in the area. This led to tensions once again.Encyclopedie Drenthe Online: Semslinie On October 14, 1815, king William I of the Netherlands, argued that Groningen and Drenthe should sign an agreement about the border and the use of the Stadskanaal. On April 5, 1817, a Royal Order concluded that the border would follow the Semslinie between Bareveld and the border between Gasselternijveenschemond and Drouwenermond (near Stadskanaal). From there on another line was drawn, called the Koningsraai. Because of the Koningsraai, Ter Apel became part of Groningen.Encyclopedie Drenthe Online: Semslinie It is sometimes said that if the Semslinie would be extended to the northwest, it would cross the Martinitoren in the city of Groningen, just as Sems's intention was. In reality the line would miss the Martinitoren by 532 meters.Cultuurhistorisch beheer: Een projectleider aan het woord References Category:Geography of Drenthe Category:Geography of Groningen (province) Category:Subdivisions of the Netherlands Category:Borders of the Netherlands ","title":"Semslinie"},{"id":"34460255","text":"GWR Siphon G, built by British Railways in 1955 The GWR Siphon was a series of enclosed milk churn transport wagons built by the Great Western Railway and continued by British Railways. Background The GWR, being a railway system which served the rural and highly agricultural West of England and South Wales, had a resultant large requirement to transport milk in volume. Post grouping in 1923, of the 282 million gallons of milk transported by rail by all four national railways companies, the GWR had the largest share of milk traffic, followed by the LMS, the Southern particularly from the Somerset and Dorset Railway, and finally the LNER from East Anglia.http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/gansg/7-fops/fo-milk.htm Often, the milk was delivered direct from the farmer to the local railway station in milk churns. So to remove the need for moving unprocessed milk from one container to another, and hence potential cross contamination or need for the GWR to install hygienic washing facilities, the decision was taken to transport the milk churns. Versions The first Siphons - named after the GWR's Telegraphic code for a milk wagon - appeared from Swindon Works in the 1870s, later given diagram O.1. 75 wagons were built to this diagram under lot numbers 180 and 217, able to carry 17 gallon milk churns stacked two high. This first design was removed from traffic by the outbreak of World War I.http://www.highworth.freeuk.com/mstsstock.htm These early Siphons set the key design precedents for their later larger successors: *All wooden body construction, keeping construction costs low and repairs simple *Ventilated to some extent, with additional flaps *Canvas roof The first design, like many later Siphons, was constructed on recycled chassis from earlier passenger carriage designs, and hence all Siphon variants were not designated goods wagons, but carriages. The Siphon C was a development introduced from 1906. This had more enclosure, but also bigger vents at higher level. The Siphon E was the first vehicle to use a tri-axle arrangement, introduced from post World War I they were withdrawn from the late 1930s as train speeds increased. The most populous version was the Siphon G, which sat on a classic passenger carriage double-bogied chassis of in length, derived from a strengthened passenger carriage variant. 130 vehicles were built to Diagram 0.21 between 1913 and 1927. All survived into British Railways ownership, the first withdrawn in 1954, the last in 1962.http://www.barrettengineering.co.uk/wagons.html The first to diagram O.22 were built from 1927. The last version was the Siphon J. By the 1930s, the milk companies wanted to be able to assure better quality, and so had requested chilled delivery vehicles. Having experimented with a chilled MICA van using frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice), the 1930s introduced Siphon J was a fully enclosed and chilled by dry ice milk churn transport wagon. Usage Siphons were most commonly attached to the rear of passenger trains, due to the need to quickly transport the enclosed milk from farmer to the milk processing facility in the shortest possible timescale. Often Siphons travelled singly, although on the most used routes from Devon and West Wales to Paddington railway station, express milk trains were scheduled. After World War II, the milk companies began to use road transport to move milk direct from the farm to their dairy processing units. This resulted in the earlier Siphons being fully withdrawn, and the later dual-bogie versions being used to transport parcels, after they had been fully sealed and their vents closed. After the introduction of specialised parcels vehicles, the Siphons were often used by the engineers department, with ENPARTS in large letters on the side transporting spares around the system. Preservation Many preserved version of the later Siphon G can be found on many preserved railways in the United Kingdom.

It became a contributing property in the Civic Center Historic District in 1988, and was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 15, 1998 as a part of the Highway Bridges of Iowa MPS. History The first bridge across the Des Moines River at Court Avenue was a toll bridge that was built from 1857 to 1858 under the direction of architect Uriah Burr White. It was the first permanent bridge over the river in the city of Des Moines. Legislators using the bridge in order to get to the capitol building were given passes. The bridge was composed of four spans with double trusses and double arches. It was replaced in 1870 by a post truss bridge and lasted until at least 1898. The current bridge is believed to be its replacement when it built from 1917 to 1918. The present Court Avenue Bridge is the third of the six current bridges in the Civic Center district to be constructed. The Walnut Street Bridge was built in 1911 and the Locust Street Bridge was built in 1907. Both of the earlier bridges were reconstructed in the 1960s and their original ornamentation was removed at the time. The Court Avenue Bridge was designed by architect James B. Marsh. During a renovation of the bridge in 1982, the bridge deck was replaced and the supporting spans were preserved and rehabilitated. Repairs were made using existing materials and replacement materials were used only when necessary and were matched with the originals as closely as possible. Street lamps with round globes and metal work that reflected the 1910s were added to the bridge in 1986 as a part of a $1.8 million project to refurbish Court Avenue between the bridge and the Polk County Courthouse.

Oluwabunmi Bakare (born 1 December 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Connah's Quay Nomads. Career Early career After starting his career with Leyton, and spells with Welling United, and Thurrock, Bakare joined Bishop's Stortford in 2010. It was here where he first made a real impact, converting from a full back and midfielder to a forward player. Following an impressive 9 goals in 14 games early in the 2011/12 season, Bakare joined Conference South club Chelmsford City, in a free transfer on 19 October 2011. He continued to impress at his new club, scoring 5 goals in 10 games, which earnt Bakare a move to Football League side, Macclesfield Town on 17 January 2012. Macclesfield Town Bakare signed on a free transfer, and made his first appearance as a substitute against Swindon Town on 21 January 2012. He was however limited to substitute appearances at Macclesfield, not starting a single game, and was released by the club, following their relegation at the end of the 2011/2012 season, making only 9 appearances. His last game was against Southend United on 5 May 2012. Southport Conference National club Southport took Bakare on trial in July 2012. After a single appearance in a friendly against Skelmersdale United it was announced manager Liam Watson had signed the player to a contract for the 2012‚Äì13 season at the club's AGM on 27 July 2012. Droylsden (loan) In October 2012 he joined Droylsden on loan and scored on his club debut on 27 October as the club beat Colwyn Bay. 2013‚Äì2016 From then on he has been somewhat of a journeyman, going on to play for Chelmsford City, Dover Athletic, Tonbridge Angels, Braintree Town, Bury Town, VCD Athletic and Witham Town before rejoining his former club Welling United for the 2015/16 season. Wrexham On 22 June 2016, he joined Wrexham, along with his Welling teammate Nortei Nortey, on a 1-year deal. He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 2016‚Äì17 season, in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Dover Athletic. On 24 November 2016, he joined Billericay Town on loan from Wrexham until January 2017. He made his debut in a league match against Metropolitan Police where he won his side a penalty before converting it himself, in a game that finished 1‚Äì1. Following the end of his loan spell, Bakare returned to Wrexham where his contract was cancelled by mutual consent on 23 January 2017. Warrington Town Bakare signed for Warrington Town on 23 March 2017. Connah's Quay Nomads In August 2017, Bakare joined Welsh Premier League side Connah's Quay Nomads, alongside his brother Mathias, after a successful trial period. In May 2018, he scored in the Welsh Cup final, helping his team to a 4-1 win. In December 2018, Bakare extended his contract with Connah's Quay for a further year.https://www.leaderlive.co.uk/sport/football/17317139.michael-bakare- signs-new-one-year-deal-with-connahs-quay-nomads/ References External links  Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from the London Borough of Hackney Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Leyton F.C. players Category:Welling United F.C. players Category:Thurrock F.C. players Category:Bishop's Stortford F.C. players Category:Chelmsford City F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:Southport F.C. players Category:Droylsden F.C. players Category:Dover Athletic F.C. players Category:Tonbridge Angels F.C. players Category:Braintree Town F.C. players Category:Bury Town F.C. players Category:VCD Athletic F.C. players Category:Witham Town F.C. players Category:Wrexham A.F.C. players Category:Billericay Town F.C. players Category:Warrington Town F.C. players Category:Connah's Quay Nomads F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Isthmian League players Category:English people of Nigerian descent Category:Black English sportspeople ","title":"Michael Bakare"},{"id":"34460459","text":"The Sound of One Hand Clapping is a 1998 Australian drama film directed by Richard Flanagan, based on the novel of the same name.

Plot After a bit of role-play training at home, Bob goes across the street to the bank in order to ask for a loan, despite having fairly low credit scores and several outstanding loans with them already. Upon arriving at the bank, he is rejected by his mean and rude bank teller, who doesn't treat him as a client, and even encourages mocking Bob for his low credit scores. Upon returning to Bob's Burgers, Bob sees several police cars, followed by a SWAT team and a series of news vans, heading back towards the bank. A police detective enters their store, announcing that there is a holdup and hostage situation in progress in the bank, and that he needs Bob's Burgers to act as a headquarters for the police response. The bank robber Mickey (voiced by Bill Hader) requests pizza, and much to Bob's dismay and disgust Jimmy Pesto takes the opportunity to deliver it to them, gaining free publicity in the process. The pizza is delivered by a remote control robot, and Gene asks the operator where he received his training, leading to an extended fantasy about attending Robot College, where he is seen partying and streaking with robots. Bob is overjoyed when Mickey dislikes Pesto's pizza, declaring it the worst Italian pizza, and asks for burgers instead. He speaks to Bob, and requests that he deliver the burgers himself. When Bob does so, the police sniper attempts to shoot Mickey, leading to Bob being taken hostage as well. A series of increasingly complicated group phone calls ensue between the police, the bank and the Belcher family, culminating in Bob being told that he should 'hit the deck' in one hour. Before this can happen, Mickey is able to form the hostages around himself in a human shield and escape to Bob's Burgers, trading place with the police in the process. When an hour passes the bank is flooded by tear gas, incapacitating the police and giving Mickey his chance to escape. He takes it, but is caught in the process. Bob is almost offered a loan from the teller, but an ink packet explodes in his pocket, revealing money was hidden there. Bob tries to say Mickey put the money in his pocket, but no one believes him. The episode ends with Mickey calling the family from jail, and is still on good terms with them all. Reception The episode received a 2.1 rating and was watched by a total of 4.40 million people.

Bob tries to get his loan restructured at the bank across the street, which starts the episode off on a simple, strong emotional core. Then a robber comes in and takes hostages, which builds tension, adds a bunch of stressed out characters, and makes the middle third of the episode about the difficulties of communication, which is traditional comic gold.\\" References External links  * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 2) episodes ","title":"Bob Day Afternoon"},{"id":"34460492","text":"John Browell Charlton (23 March 1908 ‚Äì 1969) was an English footballer who played as a defender for Liverpool during the 1931‚Äì32 season.

Rosemount's design was easily distinguished by its use of the uncommon \\"side- entry\\" method for putting the boot on, which was rare at the time and is no longer used. The boot was introduced by Rosemount Engineering, better known for their aerospace instrumentation. They referred to the boot division as either the Rosemount Consumer Products Division or Sports Technology. Rosemount sold the factory to Bass Sports in 1968, but the boots retained the Rosemount name throughout their production. Many variations of the design were introduced over the next four years, and Bass added ski bindings and ski poles as well. The rest of Rosemount became Rosemount Inc. when they were purchased by Emerson in 1976. Bass Sports was in turn purchased by Raichle in 1972, who ended production of the Rosemount boot in favor of their own designs the next year. Ironically, one of the few other side-entry boot designs was the Raichle Fibre Jet (aka Red and Red Hot), another fiberglass design which was no longer in production. History Leather boots Downhill skiing evolved as a specialization of a previously generic skiing sport. Before the era of ski lifts, skiing always involved cross-country portions, and the downhills tended to be short, slow, and had to be skied back up. Equipment during this era was designed for the cross-country portions. This normally consisted of a wooden ski, a leather winter boot, and a cable binding to keep the two together. This combination of equipment was far from optimal for downhill skiing. During the downhill portions the skis are turned by rotating them onto their edges; in traditional cable bindings, the heel is free to lift from the ski to allow a striding motion, and the system offers little support for edging. The introduction of ski lifts, especially after World War II, led to the specialization of downhill as a separate sport, and new equipment evolved to meet this market. One example was the \\"Kandahar\\" style cable bindings, which added small metal hooks near the heel. When the cable was passed under the clips it was locked in place and offered much better edging control. By the mid-1950s these were joined by a number of new binding systems that allowed the toe of the boot to release during fall. The style of skiing allowed by the new bindings demanded new boots that were much stiffer as well, and a number of designs that were boiled in oil or soaked in glue became common in the 1950s. They were initially so rigid to be extremely uncomfortable, but softened up after a break-in period. The comfortable period was quite short, as the breaking-in (or down) process would continue until it became too soft to offer good control. A typical pair might last a single season ‚Äì or only weeks for racers. The leather was far from ideal in other ways as well; it would soak up water or snow and then freeze, making them very difficult to get on or off while also offering little warmth. Rosemount Engineering Rosemount ski boots, c. 1968\\\\. The boot on the left is open; it closes by pulling the flap across the front of the boot and locking small metal tabs into buckles. The buckles are visible on the closed boot, on the extreme right. The large metal hinges are not visible on either boot, it is under the fabric on the right, and behind the open flap on the left. A number of experiments with composite designs were carried out by a variety of inventors through the 1950s, but all faced what appeared to be a catch-22; a boot stiff enough side-to-side to offer good edge control was too stiff front-to-back to allow the natural flexing motion of the leg that occurs during turns or on bumps. Early examples using plastics or fibreglass invariably proved far too rigid to be skied. Frank Werner, president of Rosemount Engineering, had taken up skiing in the late 1950s when downhill was first becoming a major sport. He took it upon himself to develop a new boot that offered the perfect mix of sideways rigidity and forward flex, handing these twin demands to his engineering staff. They responded with a simple solution that is now universal; the boot is made of two separate pieces, a shoe covering the foot and heel, and a separate section that forms a cuff around the lower leg. The two pieces are joined together with a hinge near the ankle. Their design was unique in the details of its construction; in modern designs the upper and lower portions of the boot overlap in front of the ankle, in the Rosemount design the two were entirely separate and held together with large stainless steel plates. The forward flex was entirely unconstrained, as the two halves did not rub over each other. As long as the hinge was mechanically strong enough, it would provide unlimited lateral stiffness. Rosemount's chosen material was fiberglass reinforced epoxy. This was mechanically strong, lightweight, weatherproof, and could be easily formed into any required shape. It was strong enough that the metal hinges could be riveted directly to it. However, fibreglass thick enough to bear these loads would be essentially rigid, and could not be opened or closed by conventional means ‚Äì splitting it along the top of the boot and pulling it closed with laces. This was a concern, as a fibreglass cuff that fit the lower leg tightly enough for control would not allow the larger sections of the foot and heel to pass through it when putting it on. Rosemount's solution was to build the boot in two halves, one covering the majority of the foot and leg, and a smaller section that hinged along the footbed, rotating out to the side. To put the boot on, the moving section was rotated out, allowing the skier's foot to be inserted through the opened side of the boot. The moving section was then rotated up, back into place, and held there by two buckles, one on the foot and one on the leg cuff. The seam was then sealed from the snow with an elastic material that was stretched over the front of the boot. Forward flex was controlled by three neoprene bands connected to the cuff through a strap running up the back of the boot. The bands were located under the removable sole liner, and could be replaced to change the stiffness. For comfort and fit, the boot was customized by inserting a series of small leather pads in a variety of sizes. The pillows contained one or more plastic bags filled with tiny plastic beads. The bags could be hand-moulded into the required shape, and natural movement of the foot would keep them in the approximate shape needed for comfort. Initial setup was time consuming, and presented a problem in the ski shops. Rosemount's first production run of 900 prototype boots was sent to the ski shops in 1965/66. By this point, Bob Lange had already shipped a number of boots made of \\"Royalite\\" ABS plastic; these were not very successful, but do they pre-date the Rosemount examples as the earliest plastic boots.\\"Bob Lange\\", U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame Improvements  The boot design quickly proved to have a number of problems. The most serious was that seam between the two halves of the boot could not be easily sealed, and water and snow could be forced into the boots through the hinge or the seam where the two halves met in front or behind it. This led to a modification for the 1966/67 season, moving the hinge from the bottom of the foot to the back of the leg, allowing the moving flap to rotate back instead of to the side. The buckles and fabric flap were combined into one system, a larger piece of fabric that wrapped the entire front of the boot and buckled closed at the back of the boot. Two cables, one each at the top and bottom of the flap, fit into grooves on the front of the boot to keep the flap from sliding around. A separate piece of elastic fabric was added at the top of the leg cuff, sealing it around the leg and preventing snow from entering on the top. Separate pieces of neoprene could be inserted between the cuff and foot in order to adjust the forward flex pattern of the boot, and the hinges could be adjusted to modify the \\"cant\\", the lateral angle between the foot and leg. However, even the small amount of flexing that did occur in the shell allowed the joint along the side of the foot to open slightly. The section of the joint along the bottom of the boot, just above the ski where the hinge used to be, was not covered by the fabric flap. A clip was supposed to keep this closed, but was considered to be useless. During turns, snow could be jammed up against the joint and would melt inside the boot; wet feet were a common problem. Bass Sports By 1968, the company had sold their factory to the G. H. Bass shoe company in Maine. Its original owner, George Henry Bass, had been producing conventional leather boots since the 1940s. Now run by his son, Robert \\"Bunny\\" Bass, an avid skier and one of the founders of the Sugarloaf ski resort in Maine. Bass kept the Rosemount brand and continued to improve the design. A further modification followed for the 1969 season, enlarging the metal hinge on the medial side (inside) until it covered most of that side of the boot.\\"Rosemount, The Great Boot‚Ä¶ Run After Run After Run\\", SKI, November 1969 The larger plate was designed to clip into a metal flange running along the side of the boot just below the opening. Closing the boot was a two-step operation, the flap was swung closed and then the metal plate was pushed downward until it clipped into the flange. Judging by contemporary reports, this appears to have solved the leakage problem. Another change, on some models, was the introduction of a separate adjustment for the natural forward lean of the boot. In earlier models this was set through shoe laces on the front of the cuff, in the new \\"Fastback\\" models, a screw jack on the back of the boot allowed lean adjustment at any time. Other products Bass Sports also introduced a number of other products under the Rosemount name. These included a series of fibreglass ski poles,\\"Rosemount Fiberglass Ski Poles\\", SKI, November 1970, advertisement p. 156 which were relatively new at the time, and a new ski binding design. Ski bindings evolved from the cable binding system of the 1950s, which looped around behind the boot and over the back of the sole. Many boots of the 1950s and 60s included a semi-circular indentation in the sole to provide a better fit for the cable. Early releasing bindings were designed to fit into this groove or over the sole, like a cable, often using a metal roller about the same size as the cable, the Look Nevada's \\"Gran Prix\\" release heel being a typical example. When plastic boots were introduced, they too provided similar sole extensions for mounting the bindings. However, as there was no standardization of boot sole shapes, designing a binding that worked with any boot was difficult. Worse, on leather boots the mounting point would change as the leather wore down, or even due to flexing during the day. One solution to this problem was to use small metal fittings screwed into the boot, to provide a known and unchanging mounting point for the bindings. Solutions like these were features of some of the first so-called safety bindings, the Miller and Cubcohttps://www.skiinghistory.org/history/release-history-safety-bindings, while popular \\"plate binding\\" designs of the 1970s used metal plates that extended along the entire sole of the boot.https://books.google.com/books?id=x1gEAAAAMBAJ&lpg;=PA2&dq;=%22plate%20binding%22&pg;=PA39#v=onepage&q;=%22plate%20binding%22&f;=false The bindings clipped onto these plates instead of the boot proper, providing a much more reliable release. Rosemount's solution was something of a blending of these designs. The hard sole of the boot served as the plate, with small metal clips moulded into the toe and heel flanges to provide an attachment point for their bindings. The attachment points were customized for their own SE-1 toe and SE-2 heel, but their position left the flanges free to be used with any conventional binding of the era, even cables. Mechanically, the SE-1 and SE-2 looked and operated like the contemporary designs from Cubco and Gertsch. Advertising for the bindings appeared in 1970,The perfect binding?\\", SKI, November 1970, advertisement and Rosemount boots featured the metal clips that year. However, later designs from 1972 lack the clips and no further advertising can be found. Along with the bindings, the Rosemount LOTORK system was introduced in 1970. This consisted of a metal plate that was affixed with adhesive to the top of the ski under the foot. The plate had bearings inside that allowed it to rotate to the sides. It had been found that friction between the ski and ski boot was much higher than imagined, enough to prevent the toe piece from releasing under certain conditions. The LOTORK was a solution to this, allowing easy rotation under any conditions.\\"Rosemount LOTORK sole plate\\", SKI, November 1970, advertisement p. 150 Similar products from other companies typically used teflon pads in place of the rotating mechanism. End of the Line In 1968 Bass purchased Rosemount, it picked up distribution rights to some European brands, including Hexcel skis, Raichle boots, Splitkein cross country skis, and a skiwear line. The ski-related companies were organized as Bass Sports, or Sports Technology, separate from the shoe company.https://books.google.com/books?id=b1gEAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA13#v=onepage&q;&f;=false In 1972 Raichle set up its own North American distribution company, Raichle- Molitor USA, under the leadership of Heinz Herzog. At that time, \\"Bunny\\" Bass retired and was succeeded by sales manager Butch Wieden. The Rosemount brand was retired, too. See also * Rosemount Inc.

He returned to England in 1853 and was promoted to the rank of captain. Baillie married Hannah Maria Ann Greensill on 11 July 1854 at West Thurrock in Essex. She was the daughter of John Greensill, and a cousin of Frederick Roberts, the latter of whom would make a career with the British army. The Baillies were to have three sons and one daughter. Life in New Zealand Baillie resigned from the army in 1857 and the family came to New Zealand on the Oriental. He initially had a sheep run of in the Wairau Valley but sold the land at settled at Para near Picton. Baillie was first elected to the Marlborough Provincial Council in 1860, when he represented the Wairau electorate. He was the second Superintendent of Marlborough Province (28 August 1861 ‚Äì 18 February 1863) and the longest-serving member of the New Zealand Legislative Council; 61 years, from 8 March 1861 to his death on 24 February 1922. He was the second Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Council. From 1890, Baillie's vision deteriorated and later on, he was totally blind. His wife would bring him into the Legislative Council chamber and put him into his seat. He was last elected as Chairman of Committees in 1901 when he consented to stand in a ballot; the intention was to keep out the government nominee, William Cowper Smith. Once Smith was eliminated from the ballot, Baillie wanted to withdraw, but the Speaker would not allow him to speak over a misunderstanding. When the other remaining candidate, John Rigg, withdrew, Baillie was declared elected. Hannah Baillie died on 12 November 1919 in Wellington. Captain Baillie died aged 95 at his daughter's residence in Maoribank, Upper Hutt, New Zealand on 24 February 1922. His funeral was held at what is now known as Old St. Paul's in Wellington. The Baillies are buried at Karori Cemetery. Two of his sons had died before him.

According to the model, usage of health services (including inpatient care, physician visits, dental care etc.) is determined by three dynamics: predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need. Predisposing factors can be characteristics such as race, age, and health beliefs. For instance, an individual who believes health services are an effective treatment for an ailment is more likely to seek care. Examples of enabling factors could be family support, access to health insurance, one's community etc. Need represents both perceived and actual need for health care services. The original model was developed by Ronald M. Andersen, a health services professor at UCLA, in 1968. The original model was expanded through numerous iterations and its most recent form models past the use of services to end at health outcomes and includes feedback loops.  Access and mutability A major motivation for the development of the model was to offer measures of access. Andersen discusses four concepts within access that can be viewed through the conceptual framework. Potential access is the presence of enabling resources, allowing the individual to seek care if needed. Realized access is the actual use of care, shown as the outcome of interest in the earlier models. The Andersen framework also makes a distinction between equitable and inequitable access. Equitable access is driven by demographic characteristics and need whereas inequitable access is a result of social structure, health beliefs, and enabling resources. Andersen also introduces the concept of mutability of his factors. The idea here being that if a concept has a high degree of mutability (can be easily changed) perhaps policy would be justified in using its resources to do rather than a factor with low mutability. Characteristics that fall under demographics are quite difficult to change, however, enabling resources is assigned a high degree of mutability as the individual, community, or national policy can take steps to alter the level of enabling resources for an individual. For example, if the government decides to expand the Medicaid program an individual may experience an increase in enabling resources, which in turn may beget an increase in health services usage. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) changed a highly mutable factor, out-of-pocket costs, which greatly changed individual rates of health services usage.  Earlier models The initial behavior model was an attempt to study of why a family uses health services. However, due to the heterogeneity of family members the model focused on the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Andersen also states that the model functions both to predict and explain use of health services. A second model was developed in the 1970s in conjunction with Aday and colleagues at the University of Chicago. This iteration includes systematic concepts of health care such as current policy, resources, and organization. The second generation model also extends the outcome of interest beyond utilization to consumer satisfaction. The next generation of the model builds upon this idea by including health status (both perceived and evaluated) as outcomes alongside consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model include personal health practices as an antecedent to outcomes, acknowledging that it not solely use of health services that drives health and satisfaction. This model emphasizes a more public health approach of prevention, as advocated by Evans and Stoddart wherein personal health practices (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise) are included as a driving force towards health outcomes.  Current model  The 6th iteration of Andersen's conceptual framework focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis and goes beyond health care utilization, adopting health outcomes as the endpoint of interest. This model is further differentiated from its predecessors by using a feedback loop to illustrate that health outcomes may affect aspects such as health beliefs, and need. It added genetic susceptibility as a predisposing determinant and quality of life as an outcome By using the framework's relationships we can determine the directionality of the effect following a change in an individual's characteristics or environment. For example, if one experiences an increase in need as a result of an infection, the Andersen model predicts this will lead to an increased use of services (all else equal). One potential change for a future iteration of this model is to add genetic information under predisposing characteristics. As genetic information becomes more readily available it seems likely this could impact health services usage, as well as health outcomes, beyond what is already accounted for in the current model. Criticisms and rebuttals The model has been criticized for not paying enough attention to culture and social interaction but Andersen argues this social structure is included in the predisposing characteristics component. Another criticism was the overemphasis of need and at the expense of health beliefs and social structure. However, Andersen argues need itself is a social construct. This is why need is split into perceived and evaluated. Where evaluated need represents a more measurable/objective need, perceived need is partly determined by health beliefs, such as whether or not people think their condition is serious enough to seek health services. Another limitation of the model is its emphasis on health care utilization or adopting health outcomes as a dichotomous factor, present or not present. Other help-seeking models also consider the type of help source, including informal sources. More recent work has taken help-seeking behaviors further, and more real-world, by including online and other non-face-to-face sources.

His most successful spell was with Cardiff City, finishing as the club's top scorer for two consecutive seasons. Career Collins began his career playing non-league football for Tooting and impressed enough for Queens Park Rangers to sign him in 1931. However, he struggled to make an impact in the Football League and returned to non-league football with Tunbridge Wells Rangers. His goalscoring exploits for Tunbridge saw him offered a second chance at professional football by Rochdale in 1933, later playing for Stockport County and Walsall. In January 1936, having scored 14 league goals during the first half of the season for Walsall, Collins was signed by Liverpool. He made his debut for the Reds in a 6‚Äì1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion and appeared in a further five matches in the following month. However, the following season, Collins found himself out of favour and was forced to wait a year for his next, and final appearance, for the club, playing in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Preston North End on 13 March 1937 in place of Fred Howe. He was allowed to leave the club soon after, in May 1937, joining Football League Third Division South side Cardiff City for a fee of ¬£1,500, scoring the Bluebirds goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Clapton Orient on his debut and a hat-trick in his home debut in the following match, a 5‚Äì2 victory over Torquay United. His prolific form saw him finish as the club's top scorer in two consecutive seasons, between 1937 and 1939, forming an effective partnership with Bert Turner in his first season, and he continued in the same form during the abandoned 1939‚Äì40 season, scoring four goals in the three league matches that were completed prior to the suspension of the Football League following the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, Collns appeared as a guest player for Swindon Town and Aberaman Athletic.

Her doctoral research involved synthesis of hybrid vitamin D3 analogs. Career In 1999, White joined Eric Jacobsen's labs at Harvard University as an NIH postdoctoral fellow. During this time, she developed the first synthetically useful methane monooxygenase (MMO) mimic system for catalytic epoxidations with hydrogen peroxide. In July 2002, White joined the Harvard University chemistry department as a faculty member. In 2005, she moved to Illinois, where she currently works at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a professor of chemistry, researching C‚ÄìH bond activation. Dr. White's notable students include Abigail Doyle, of Princeton University. Research White and her team aim to study and develop selective allylic and aliphatic C-H oxidation reactions for use in organic synthesis. White has contributed novel palladium/sulfoxide and iron catalysts that functionalize C-H bonds selectively, predictively, and without the need for directing groups. Her palladium/sulfoxide catalyst is referred to as the White Catalyst, and her iron catalyst, Fe(PDP)(MeCN)2(SbF6)2, is referred to as the White-Chen catalyst; both catalysts are commercially available. Recent research in the White lab includes designing reactions for effecting non- directed, remote aliphatic C-H hydroxylation of simple amide-containing molecules. White has also applied these catalysts and their derivatives to new applications, with the most recent being the White catalyst's dehydrogenative Diels-Alder reaction and the iron-mediated intramolecular C-H amination reaction.

Life  Karl was the only surviving child of the Duke Julius Siegmund of W√ºrttemberg- Juliusburg (1653‚Äì1684) from his marriage to Anna Sophia (1647‚Äì1726), the daughter of the Duke Adolf Frederick I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He became Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Juliusburg when his father died in 1684, although he stood under guardianship until he came of age in 1704. When his uncle Silvius II Frederick died in 1697, his uncle Christian Ulrich I took over the Duchy of Oels and left the Duchy of Bernstadt to Charles. On 20 December 1703 in Meiningen, he married Wilhelmine Louise (1686‚Äì1753), the daughter of Duke Bernhard I of Saxe-Meiningen. The marriage remained childless. Charles ruled arbitrarily and wastefully. In 1740, his councilors therefore turned to emperor Joseph I, who ruled against the Duke. In 1742, Karl asked his country's captain for a new wig, however, it was not granted due to an empty treasury. He then sold off the Lordship of Gosch√ºtz and the city of Twardog√≥ra, the latter to Count henry of Reichenbach-Gosch√ºtz (1705‚Äì1775). Charles died in 1745. Since his marriage had been childless, the Duchy of Bernstadt fell to his cousin Charles Christian Erdmann, who was thus able to unite all the Silesian possessions of the House of W√ºrttemberg in a single hand.

Loss of control may be the result of mechanical failure, external disturbances, aircraft upset conditions, or inappropriate crew actions or responses. Causes Aircraft experiencing a loss of control depart from normal flight and can reach attitudes or situations from which it is impossible for them to be recovered. Due to the certification and design processes, it is extremely rare for aircraft to experience a loss of control without extreme mishandling or a technical defect. A NASA Study on Aircraft Loss of Control Causal Factors and Mitigation Challenges developed a preliminary list of causal factors that contribute to loss of control compiled through interviews, reviews of accident reports and team analysis of available data. Causal factors in the list were segregated into three categories: (1) pilot- or human-induced; (2) environmentally-induced; and (3) systems-induced. The following list does not order the causal factors by frequency of occurrence or importance. Contributing factors involving inappropriate pilot actions may include: * Poor judgment or aeronautical decision making * Failure to recognize an aerodynamic stall or spin and execute corrective action * Intentional failure to comply with regulations * Failure to maintain airspeed * Failure to follow procedure * Pilot inexperience and lack of proficiency * Use of prohibited prescription or over-the-counter drugs, illegal drugs, or alcohol Notable accidents Loss of control has been the cause of many air disasters some of which are listed below. Aeroflot Flight 8641 Metal fatigue in the jackscrew of the horizontal stabilizer caused the component to fail while the plane was en route from Leningrad to Kiev, Ukraine on 28 June 1982. The crew lost control of the plane and at 10:50 crashed just south of the city of Mozyr in Belarus killing all on board. In the aftermath of the tragedy, authorities grounded all Yakovlev Yak-42 jets, and the planes underwent major design changes until they were deemed worthy to fly again in late 1984. Japan Airlines Flight 123 was a scheduled domestic Japan Airlines passenger flight from Tokyo's Haneda Airport to Osaka International Airport, Japan. On August 12, 1985, a Boeing 747SR operating this route suffered a sudden decompression twelve minutes into the flight and crashed in the area of Mount Takamagahara, Ueno, Gunma Prefecture, 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Tokyo thirty-two minutes later, resulting in the deaths of 520 of the 524 people on board the aircraft. The crash site was on Osutaka Ridge, near Mount Osutaka China Northwest Airlines Flight 2303 lost control during take-off from Xi'an, China. The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154, had maintenance carried out before its flight, and the autopilot yaw-channel had been erroneously connected to the bank control, and vice versa. Additionally, this incorrect maintenance was not done in a properly approved facility. When the pilot engaged the autopilot, the aircraft began to oscillate violently. Any attempts to rectify matters only made things worse, as the plane shook itself to pieces, breaking up in midair before the crew could react, killing all on board. Lauda Air Flight 004: On 26 May 1991 The Boeing 767-3Z9ER named Mozart left Don Mueang International Airport, Bangkok, Thailand to Vienna. When the Mozart reached thirty-two thousand feet, the crew received a visual warning indicating that a possible system failure would cause the thrust reverser on the number 1 engine to deploy in flight. Having consulted the aircraft's Quick Reference Handbook, they determined that it was \\"just an advisory thing\\" and took no action. At 23:17, the thrust reverser on the number 1 engine deployed while the plane was over mountainous jungle terrain in the border area between Suphanburi and Uthai Thani provinces, Thailand. First Officer Thurner's last recorded words were, \\"Oh, reverser's deployed!\\". The 767 stalled in mid-air and entered a spiral dive to the left, disintegrating at . All 223 people on board were killed. Most of the wreckage was scattered over a remote forest area roughly in size, at an elevation of above sea level, in what is now Phu Toei National Park, Suphanburi. The wreckage was at 14.44 degrees north and 99.26 east. The wreckage site is about three nautical miles north-northeast of Phu Toey, Huay Kamin, Dan Chang District, Suphan Buri Province. Hikers arrived at the crash site and made video recordings of the wreckage. United Airlines Flight 585: On March 3, 1991, 737-200 Flight 585 was on final approach to Colorado Springs Municipal Airport from Stapleton when it spun out of control, banking right, then rolled upside down before entering a downward spiral to the right. The aircraft disintegrated when it hit the ground All 20 passengers and 5 crew were killed. USAir Flight 427: Three years later after United Airlines Flight 585, September 8, 1994 another Boeing 737 spun out of control and crashed, the Boeing 737-3B7 flying the route which was registered N513AU, was approaching runway 28R of Pittsburgh International Airport, located in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania. The aircraft suddenly banked violently to the left, rolled upside down, then went into a downward spiral while rolling left. The jet then crashed near the airport; the crash killed all 127 passengers and 5 crew. The bodies of the occupants were so severely fragmented that the crash site was initially declared a biohazard by the NTSB. Both crashes were traced to a malfunction in the planes' rudder controls. Aeroper√∫ Flight 603 On October 2, 1996 a Boeing 757-23A impacted the ocean killing all 61 passengers and 9 crew on board. It was found that the adhesive tape had been accidentally left on the static ports by the maintenance personal after servicing the aircraft. This led to their air data computers being unable to report the correct airspeed and altitude. American Eagle Flight 4184: A flight from Indianapolis to Chicago using an ATR-72, was preparing for landing when the right aileron suddenly moved upward, causing the right wing to drop abruptly. The plane pitched down and went into a dive, corkscrewing about its right wing, and impacted the ground in a soybean field near Roselawn, Indiana. All 64 passengers and 4 crew members perished. Investigators determined that the crash was caused by atmospheric icing disrupting airflow over the right wing. Alaska Airlines Flight 261: Took off from Mexico en route to California. The MD-83 had been in maintenance, and the T-tail's jackscrew had not been checked as called for in the maintenance schedule. After several tries, the crew was able to unfreeze the stabilizer, and the airplane pitched downward into a dive. The pilots were able to recover and were preparing to divert to Los Angeles when the tail broke loose from its assembly. The plane pitched over again 70 degrees nose down, rolling inverted as it fell. The pilots attempted to control the aircraft while inverted to no avail; 86 seconds later the aircraft hit the Pacific Ocean nose first and broke up on impact with the water, killing everybody on board instantly. Copa Airlines Flight 201: Was preparing to land in fierce thunderstorms when, in a manner similar to the Colorado Springs crash, the plane suddenly banked sharply to the right and spiral-dived to the ground, crashing in a jungle area of the Darien Gap at the speed of 400 knots (460 miles per hour), killing all 47 passengers on board instantly. An investigation revealed that the plane's attitude indicator had failed, causing the pilots to lose track of their plane's bank angle. Aeroflot Flight 4225: Took off from Almaty International Airport en route to Simferopol Airport, the Tupolev entered an altitude of no more than 500 feet and was in a zone of hot air. The plane entered a steep nosedive and stalled; the crew lost control and the plane crashed, killing 166 people. Asiana Airlines Flight 991: Took off from Incheon International Airport for a night cargo flight to Shanghai Pudong International Airport on July 28, 2011. Almost halfway to its destination, the crew declared a cargo fire emergency and wanted to divert to Jegu Airport. The fire got much worse, and the plane became totally uncontrollable. The plane flew into the Pacific Ocean, killing the two pilots instantly. Air Midwest Flight 5481: Took off from Charlotte/Douglas international airport to Greenville-Spartanburg international airport. The Beechcraft 1900D had its elevator range of motion cut to only 7 degrees downward but a full 14 degrees upward during a maintenance error and was overweight. The plane took off from runway 18R with 21 passengers and crew. Right after the gear was raised, the plane pitched up and the crew lost control. The plane stalled and pitched downward into a steep dive. It crashed into a corner of an aircraft hangar, killing all 21 people aboard instantly. United Airlines Flight 232 was a regularly scheduled United Airlines flight from Denver to Chicago, continuing to Philadelphia. On July 19, 1989, the DC-10 (registered as N1819U) serving the flight crash-landed at Sioux City, Iowa, after suffering a catastrophic failure of its tail-mounted engine, which led to the loss of many flight controls. At the time, the aircraft was en route from Stapleton International Airport to O'Hare International Airport. Of the 296 passengers and crew on board, 111 died in the accident and 185 survived, making the crash the fifth-deadliest involving the DC-10, behind Turkish Airlines Flight 981, American Airlines Flight 191, Air New Zealand Flight 901, and UTA Flight 772.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. Despite the deaths, the accident is considered a prime example of successful crew resource management because of the large number of survivors and the manner in which the flight crew handled the emergency and landed the airplane without conventional control. 2003 Baghdad DHL attempted shootdown incident On 22 November 2003, shortly after takeoff from Baghdad, Iraq, an Airbus A300B4-200F cargo plane, registered OO-DLL and owned by European Air Transport (doing business as DHL Express) was struck on the left wing tip by a surface- to-air missile while on a scheduled flight to Muharraq, Bahrain. Severe wing damage resulted in a fire and complete loss of hydraulic flight control systems. Because outboard left wing fuel tank 1A was full at takeoff, there was no fuel-air vapour explosion. Liquid jet fuel dropped away as 1A disintegrated. Inboard fuel tank 1 was pierced and leaking.Great escape Returning to Baghdad, the three-man crew made an injury-free landing of the seriously damaged A300, using differential engine thrust as the only pilot input. This is despite major damage to a wing, total loss of hydraulic control, a faster than safe landing speed and a ground path which veered off the runway surface and onto unprepared ground.\\"Air Crash Investigators\\" Paris Match reporter Claudine Vernier-Palliez accompanied a Fedayeen unit on their strike mission against the DHL aircraft.\\"Voici le commando qui a touch√© l'Airbus\\", Claudine Vernier-Palliez, Paris Match, N¬∞ 2845 ‚Äì 27 Novembre 2003 Sara Daniel, a French weekly newsmagazine journalist claimed receipt, from an unknown source, of a video that showed insurgents, faces concealed, firing a missile at the DHL A300.
