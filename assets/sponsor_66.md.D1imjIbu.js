Queen of the South Jimmy Rutherford played 65 first team games for Queen of the South in which he averaged slightly above one goal per game with 66 goals.http://www.qosarchive.co.uk/07sep.htm He jointly holds the club record for the most goals in a single season when he hit 41 goals in season 1931-32. However some of these were cup goals and as such he does not hold the record for the most league goals in a season (that record is held by Jimmy Gray who scored 37 league goals in season 1927-28). In Rutherford's record breaking season he scored five goals in one game, a Scottish Cup 11-1 victory at Palmerston Park against Stranraer. The other goals were by George Derby (2), Jenkins, Dyer, McCall, McDonald. This result is the club record high scoring win. However Rutherford's five goals in a single game is not a club record as this has been surpassed by the six goals by Jimmy Gilmour versus Arbroath on 2 February 1926 and Jim Patterson versus Cowdenbeath on 16 December 1961. Despite his goals per game ratio he does not hold the goals per game record for the club. Hughie Gallacher joined Queens when he was 17 and scored 19 goals in his 9 games for Queens. Rutherford's goals per game ratio at Queens does however compare well against other prominent forwards to have played for Queens surpassing such as Dave Halliday, Billy Houliston, Jim Patterson, Neil Martin, Andy Thomson and Stephen Dobbie. Halliday in his time at Queens had not yet converted from left winger to centre forward.

A typical use is to allow mobile device software to scale the display of information and user interaction to different screen sizes. The abstraction allows an application to work in pixels as a measurement, while the underlying graphics system converts the abstract pixel measurements of the application into real pixel measurements appropriate to the particular device. For example, on the Android operating system a device-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen,http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#dips- pels while the Windows Presentation Foundation specifies one device- independent pixel as equivalent to 1/96th of an inch.http://blogs.msdn.com/b/text/archive/2009/12/11/wpf-text-measurement- units.aspx As dp is a physical unit it has an absolute value which can be measured in traditional units, e.g. for Android devices 1 dp equals 1/160 of inch or 0.15875 mm.

Biography Grogan was born about 1738, the eldest son of John Grogan of Johnstown Castle, Wexford, by his wife Catherine, daughter and heiress of Major Andrew Knox of Rathmacknee. His father, a Protestant landlord, was a member of the Parliament of Ireland. Grogan succeeded to the family estates, was High Sheriff of Wexford for 1779 and was from 1768 to 1776 M.P. for Enniscorthy in the Irish parliament. On the outbreak of the Irish rebellion of 1798 Grogan joined the insurgents, and became commissary-general in their army. When Wexford was taken by the government forces Grogan was tried by court-martial. He pleaded that he had been forced to take a nominal lead, but had been guilty of no overt act, but was hanged and beheaded on Wexford bridge on 28 June 1798. Two other landlords of Wexford who had taken the same action as himself, John Henry Colclough and Bagenal Beauchamp Harvey, suffered with him, as well as other rebel leaders. Their heads were set up on the court-house, and their bodies flung into the Slaney; but Grogan's body was recovered by his followers, and secretly buried at Rathaspick, near Johnstown. His estates were escheated by the crown, but were restored on the payment of a heavy fine to his youngest and only surviving brother, John Knox. Another brother, Thomas, a lieutenant in the British army, was killed at the battle of Arklow on 9 June 1798. A cousin, Edward Grogan, born in 1802, M.P. for Dublin from 1841 to 1868, was created a baronet on 23 April 1859.

Life and career  Saint-Yves was born in 1667 at Maubert- Fontaine (Ardennes, Northern France), out of a family affiliated to Marie de Guise, who called him and his elder brother (1660‚Äì1730) to Paris for becoming her pages. He subsequently took his vows at the Congregation of the Mission in 1686 and worked at the pharmacy, where he learned medicine and surgery. He subsequently specialised in eye pathology and left the priory of St Lazarus in 1711 when he set up his own practice at his elder brother's, rue Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle in Paris. His studies, and in particular his treatment of cataracts earned him a strong reputation all around Europe and many patients queued at his consultancy. From his lazarist past, Saint-Yves kept a strong sense of charity and sense for the poor, as well as for natives from his region of origin. Saint-Yves died in Paris on August 3, 1731, at the peak of his reputation and wealth.  Operation of cataract  At the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries, it became more and more clear that sight was not located in the lens, but that the deterioration of the latter was the actual cause of the cataract. In Paris, notably Pierre Brisseau (1631‚Äì1717) introduced his conclusions from eye dissection to the Academy of Medicine in 1705, before publishing a Trait√© de la Cataracte et du Glaucome (Treatise on cataracts and glaucoma, 1709), to be followed by Antoire Ma√Ætre-Jean (Trait√© des maladies de l'oeil, Treatise on eye pathologies, 1707). These ideas allowed the introduction of new surgical treatments, and Saint-Yves achieved a first extract of a dislocated lens on a living patient in 1707 and stabilised his operating technique over a couple of hundred cases that first year. He also advised famous surgeon Jean-Louis Petit in his operation of the cataract in 1708. Cataract operation quickly spread in Paris afterwards. The Encyclopedia mentions Saint-Yves, as follows: \\" Among French authors, Saint-Yves was the only one who provided details on its operating more, although limited ones. He was pushing a needle through the globe in order to raise while pulling out the cristalline; He does not provide any further information on the process, but confirms that patient were quickly healed. / Parmi les auteurs fran√ßois, il n'y a que Saint-Yves, qui soit entr√© dans quelques d√©tails tr√®s-succincts, fur la pratique de cette op√©ration. Il pastoit, au moyen d'une aiguille , une foie √† travers le globe pour le soulever pendant l'extirpation ; il ne d√©crit point le proc√©d√© qu'il suivoit, & il se borne a dire , que les malades font gu√©ris en peu de temps.\\"  Treaty of pathology  Charles de Saint-Yves, Trait√© des maladies des yeux, 2nd edition 1736 Based on such experience and his large fame, Saint-Yves published in 1722 a treatise of descriptive pathology that durably set out as a pillar of the French school of ophthalmology : Nouveau trait√© des maladies des yeux o√π l'on expose leur structure, leur usage, les causes de leurs maladies, leurs sympt√¥mes, les rem√®des et les op√©rations de chirurgie qui conviennent le plus √† leur gu√©rison, avec de nouvelles d√©couvertes sur la structure de l'oeil, qui prouvent l'organe imm√©diat de la vue, par Mr de Saint-Yves, chirurgien occultiste de Saint C√¥me (New treatise of eye pathologies, with description of eye structures and uses, the origins of their illnesse along with their symptoms, the most appropriate remedies and surgery treatments, including new discoveries concerning eye structure that prove the exact location of sight, by Mr de Saint-Yves, eye surgeon at Saint- C√¥me). The first edition, in French was published in Paris in 1722, and followed by new editions in Amsterdam (1736) and Leipzig (1767). After a minor argument in Paris gazette le Mercure de France, Saint-Yves book became a reference across Europe and was translated in several languages, namely in English (London 1741 et 1744), German (Berlin 1730), Italian (Venise 1750, 1768 et 1781), or Dutch (1739).  Posterity  Saint-Yves bequeathed his name and his fortune to his closest assistant Etienne L√©offroy, who took over his master's practice and developed it across Europe. A series of Parisian intellectuals (medicine and arts) followed, with the name Saint-Yves.

History The theme of Paphlagonia and its governing strategos are first mentioned in November 826, and the theme seems to have been established c. 820... The territory of the theme corresponds roughly to the late antique province of Paphlagonia, which had been subsumed in the themes of Opsikion and Boukellarion... Its administrative and ecclesiastical capital, as during Antiquity, was Gangra.. Warren Treadgold ‚Äì who notably believes that Paphlagonia belonged to the Armeniakon, and not the Boukellarion ‚Äì suggested that its re-emergence as a separate province was linked with the new threat of Rus' naval activity in the Black Sea.. According to the Arab geographers Ibn Khordadbeh and Ibn al-Faqih, the province numbered 5,000 troops and five fortified places.. A notable exception to the usual thematic hierarchy is the existence of a katepano, in charge of a naval squadron, with his seat at Amastris. After the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, most of the region was lost to the Seljuk Turks; the campaigns of John II Komnenos in the 1130s managed to recover firm control of the coast. The interior became disputed territory, John II took Kastamonu and Gangra but the latter soon returned to Turkish hands. After the Fourth Crusade, Paphlagonia came under the control of David Komnenos, but in 1214 the Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris seized the western parts up to Amastris. These remained in Byzantine hands until the late 14th century, when they were taken over by the Turks or the Genoese.

The Edelweiss came second in its class at the 1963 World Gliding Championships (WGC) and first in its class two years later. Several are still flying in France and elsewhere in 2010. Design and development The Edelweiss is a 15 m class, single seat, shoulder wing sailplane with a butterfly tail, built mostly from wood. The wing has a single spar and is skinned with 8 mm foam-bonded plywood. It has almost constant chord; it had forward sweep on the two prototypes but production Edelweiss have unswept wings. The ailerons are metal and are shorter on production aircraft. Inboard airbrakes, again shorter in production aircraft, can extend from both upper and lower surfaces. The butterfly tail consists of two all moving surfaces, with wood sandwich leading edges and fabric covering elsewhere. Both carry trim tabs. The slender fuselage is assembled from two formed, foam-bonded ply shells, each with inbuilt longerons. Nose and tail cones are of laminated plastic. The pilot sits in a semi-reclining position, under a long, starboard hinged, canopy which ends at the wing leading edge. The prototypes had longer noses than later aircraft. The Edelweiss lands on a fixed, sprung, monowheel undercarriage, fitted with a wheel brake operated jointly with the airbrakes. The Edelweiss flew for the first time on 25 September 1962. An initial production batch of 15 was begun in January 1965. Operational history The two Edelweiss prototypes competed in the 1963 WGC, held at Junin, Argentina and were placed 2nd and 17th in the Standard Class, piloted respectively by J. Lachney and C. Labar. At the next WGC, held in 1965 at South Cerney, UK, two production aircraft finished in 1st and 7th place in their class, piloted by Fran√ßois Louis Henry and J. Lachney; two others were placed 8th and 10th (pilots J.-P. Cartrey and J. Penaud) in the Open Class (unrestricted span). 51 Edelweiss have appeared on the French civil register. As of mid-2010, 12 Edelweiss remained on the French register and 1 on each on the registers of Belgium and Monaco; at least 3 are not active. Another is on the US register.

The championship was founded and continues to be run by William Grant & Sons., distillers of Glenfiddich and other whiskies. Ten of the leading pipers in the world, all of whom will have won important awards since the previous October, are invited. Each of them submits a list of six piobaireachd, and is required to play one of them. They also submit lists of six marches, strathspeys and reels, and play one of each, twice through. There are prizes in each discipline, and an overall championship prize. 2012 Championship The Glenfiddich Piping Championship 2012 was won by Iain Speirs of Edinburgh.

After American authorities charged him with spying for the East German government in 1983, he became part of a high-profile prisoner exchange between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Early life and education Born in Farnst√§dt, Germany, Alfred Zehe was trained from a young age to be an underground copper miner. In 1964, he graduated from the University of Leipzig with a degree in Physics; in 1969, he received the degree of Doctor rerum naturalium; and in 1975, he received the degree of Doctor scientiae naturalium. He held a chair in Experimental Physics at the Technical University of Dresden from 1980 to 1991, during which time he taught periodically at the Autonomous University of Puebla in Puebla, Mexico. Prior to the 1990 German reunification, Zehe‚Äôs ability to travel, including his teaching at University of Puebla, was contingent on his consulting with the East German government on matters of national security. Sting Operation and Arrest In 1982, Zehe was summoned from Puebla to the East German embassy in Mexico City to meet with East German officials, who sought Zehe‚Äôs expertise regarding recently acquired documents on sonar technology. Unbeknownst to Zehe at the time, the documents had been purchased by East German agents from an undercover U.S. operative in Washington, D.C.Harvey A. Silverglate, Three Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent (Encounter Books, 2009), 219 The U.S. operative, in an FBI-managed sting operation, had gone shopping on Washington‚Äôs embassy row \\"to lure a spy from one or another of the Communist embassies to come out and take the bait.\\"Craig R. Whitney, Spy Trader: The Darkest Secrets of the Cold War (Random House, 1993), 266 After purchasing the documents, the East Germans realized they lacked the expertise in Washington to evaluate the intelligence, so they called on Zehe in Mexico City. There, he reviewed the documents, which turned out to be outdated information on submarine sonar-detection, and returned to his teaching post in Puebla. On November 3, 1983, Zehe was arrested while attending the annual symposium of the American Vacuum Society in Boston.New York Times: \\"East German Enters Guilty Plea to Buying Secret U.S. Documents,\\" February 25, 1985, accessed December 8, 2010 He was subsequently charged under the Espionage Act with conspiracy to obtain classified documents related to military technology and deliver them to a foreign government. The decision to arrest him at the conference with television cameras on hand was designed to fuel public awareness of the dangers of scientific espionage.P. A. Redhead, ed., Vacuum Science and Technology: Pioneers of the 20th Century, History of Vacuum Science and Technology, vol. 2 (American Vacuum Society, 1994), 21 The FBI later asked the American Vacuum Society to furnish it with the names of the 2600 attendees at the Boston meeting and threatened to subpoena the information. The Society declined but replied that it would comply with such a subpoena. The FBI did not pursue the matter.Mitchel B. Wallerstein, Lawrence E. McCray, Scientific Communication and National Security: The Issues in 1984, January 31, 1984, 11, available online, accessed December 8, 2010 The East German government posted bail for Zehe in June 1984. He remained in Boston while awaiting trial. Wolfgang Vogel, East German lawyer and spy trader, was enlisted by the East German government to help free Zehe.Berliner Zeitung: Andreas F√∂rster, \\"Der Regisseur fuhr im goldfarbenen Mercedes vor,\\" June 12, 1995 , accessed December 8, 2010 Vogel contacted Alan Dershowitz to oversee the legal aspects of the effort and Ronald Greenwald to act as personal liaison between him and Zehe. Dershowitz, seeking to avoid a conflict of interest with his then-client Anatoly Shcharansky, a founder of the Refusenik movement who had been imprisoned in Moscow for allegedly spying for the United States, brought in Harvey A. Silverglate to defend Zehe.Spy Trader, 265 Silverglate claimed that under any reasonable interpretation of the Espionage Act, Zehe had not committed a crime.Three Felonies a Day, 220 Zehe did not purchase the documents at issue in the case, but only reviewed documents presented to him in Mexico City, Silverglate asserted. He also told how at Robert Mueller's direction, prosecutors used \\"national security\\" as a reason to withhold documents from the defense even though they were prepared to let the East Germans review them. Silverglate further contended that the indictment was invalid because the Espionage Act does not cover espionage conducted by a foreign citizen outside the United States. On January 29, 1985, U.S. District Judge David S. Nelson denied Zehe‚Äôs motion to dismiss the case, ruling that the Espionage Act could be applied extraterritorially to both citizens and noncitizens because of the threat to national security that espionage poses.United States v. Zehe, 601 F.Supp. 196 (D. Mass 1985); Kent College of Law: United States v. Zehe, January 29, 1985, accessed December 8, 2010 U.S. prosecutors then offered to allow Zehe to defect to the United States, where he could take residence and continue his academic career.Three Felonies a Day, 222 Despite being closely watched by the East German government, Zehe accepted this offer and agreed to defect. Shortly thereafter, however, the U.S. government refused to accept Zehe as a bona fide defector.

His original fields were nuclear and elementary particle physics but branched out into applications of physics in other disciplines. Most of his career he has been a physics professor at Harvard University. Biography Wilson was born in Putney, London, on 29 April 1926 to Dorothy Jennett Kingston, a teacher of French, and Percy Wilson a civil servant in the Board of Education, who had been a Naval officer in World War I. He went to Colet Court school in Hammersmith, a preparatory School for St Paul's School, and then to St Paul's School from 1939 to 1943. He earned a BA in 1946 at Christ Church Oxford, and an MA and D Phil in 1949. He was awarded a Research Lectureship at Christ Church from 1949 to 1954. On leave from this lectureship he visited America on a Guggenheim fellowship in 1950 ‚Äì 1952, firstly at Rochester New York, then at Stanford University, California. While at Stanford he married Andree Desiree Dumond, daughter of the physicist Jesse Dumond of California Institute of Technology. He returned to Oxford in 1952 for 3 years before taking up a position as Assistant Professor at Harvard University where he then served as Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics. He visited the USSR in 1958. After the dissolution of the USSR helped to found the International Sakharov University in Minsk, Belarus in 1991. From 1975 he became a frequent visitor to the Arab countries and lectured in 44 different countries altogether. In 1988 he became a member of the Science Advisory Board of the Atlantic Legal Foundation, a public interest law foundation. He and his wife had 6 children.Richard Wilson Photographs He died in May 2018 at the age of 92.R.I.P. Professor Richard Wilson Research Wilson's first research was on the properties of the nucleon. He started by using radioactive sources and then using first the cyclotron at AERE, Harwell, UK then the cyclotron at Harvard University, USA. This work is described in many papers and in the book \\"The Nucleon-Nucleon Interaction\\" (Wiley-Interscience) in 1963. At Harvard he became an enthusiastic supporter of the Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA) and was Chairman of the Management committee from 1961 to 1968. He became known for his work on nucleon form factors, an interest which continues. He was a Trustee of the Universities Research Association from 1987 to 1993, and studied the inelastic form factors. Wilson was an early proponent of electron- positron colliding beams. and worked thereon in Frascati, CEA and Cornell University. In 1991 he realised that the general public was no longer automatically supporting physicists and began a career explaining the positive aspects of radiation use, as well as its risks and dangers. In this he used the \\"hands on\\" style of an experimental physicist and soon became an expert on nuclear accidents: Three Mile Island, Chernobyl & Fukushima. He is particularly known for his visits to Chernobyl, being the first American scientist to go to the plant, and measure radioactivity levels thereby exposing himself to the dangers. He expanded his interests to other hazards, and thereby helped to found the field of Risk analysis. His paper \\"The Daily Risks of Life\\" was reprinted in Readers Digest and the Farmers' Almanac. In the same year his testimony about the risks of benzene was quoted by the US Supreme Court. In this work he realised that while it is interesting what scientists say in their conferences; the US public is more concerned about of what Congress enacts in response but most importantly what the courts said last week. This realisation has led to an activity on emphasising, to the courts the fundamental thinking of a physicist. This includes the role of expert witnesses in court cases. Publications Wilson is the author of 935 published articles and papers in particle physics and (nuclear) risk assessment. His writings have appeared in various scientific journals, including Nature and Science. They are listed on his webpage: http://physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/publications/published_papers.html from which site many may be downloaded.

This method reduces the infectious levels of disease-causing agents that may be found in donated blood components, while still maintaining good quality blood components for transfusion. This type of approach to increase blood safety is also known as ‚Äúpathogen inactivation‚Äù in the industry. Despite measures that are in place in the developed world to ensure the safety of blood products for transfusion, a risk of disease transmission still exists. Consequently, the development of pathogen inactivation/reduction technologies for blood products has been an ongoing effort in the field of transfusion medicine. A new procedure for the treatment of individual units of single-donor (apheresis) or whole blood‚Äìderived, pooled, platelets has recently been introduced. This technology uses riboflavin and light for the treatment of platelets and plasma.  Method  This pathogen reduction process involves adding riboflavin (vitamin B2) to the blood component, which is then placed into an illuminator where it is exposed to UV light for about five to ten minutes. Exposure to UV light activates riboflavin and when it is associated with nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), riboflavin causes a chemical alteration to functional groups of the nucleic acids thereby making pathogens unable to replicate. In this way the process prevents viruses, bacteria, parasites and white blood cells, from replicating and causing disease. :::::::UV Light + Riboflavin ‚Üí Irreversible Inactivation This method using riboflavin and UV light renders pathogens harmless by using a non-mutagenic, non-toxic method. Riboflavin and its photoproducts are already present in the human body and do not need to be removed from blood products prior to transfusion.  Examples of pathogens inactivated by this method  * Viruses ‚Äì both enveloped and non-enveloped including: Avian Flu, Chikungunya, CMV, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, Human B-19, Influenza, Rabies, and West Nile. This adds a level of protection for those receiving the transfusion product against viruses that donors are screened for (and may be at a level too low to be detected- window period) as well as those that they are not screened for at the time of their donation. * Bacteria ‚Äì such as: B. cereus, E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. acnes, S. marcescens, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae, S. mitis, S. pyogenes, and Y. enterocolitica. * Parasites ‚Äì including: Babesiosis, Chagas disease, Leishmaniasis, Malaria, and Scrub typhus. * White blood cells ‚Äì due to the effective inactivation of white blood cells in donated blood products, riboflavin and UV light treatment may be used as an alternative to gamma-irradiation for the prevention of transfusion-associated graft-versus- host disease (TA-GVHD), a serious blood transfusion related complication.  Application  The riboflavin and UV light method for pathogen reduction of platelets and plasma is in routine use in multiple countries throughout Europe.CaridianBCT. (2010, June 23).

It is a Grade I listed building, and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It overlooks the Gipping valley. History The earliest fabric in the church is in the nave, which is 10th- or 11th-century. The east window is from the 14th century, and the tower was added in the 15th century. Also around this time the north porch was built and doorways and windows in the nave were replaced. A major restoration was carried out in 1852 under the direction of the then rector, The high churchman Rev George Drury, working with the architect Richard Phipson. Until then the church had consisted of a nave, a chancel, a west tower and a north porch. The restoration included virtually rebuilding the chancel and adding the transepts and organ chambers. Much of the joinery of the transept roofs and fittings was carried out by Henry Ringham. It is thought that some of the stained glass in the east window was designed by Rev Drury. The church was declared redundant in 1977 but it was not vested in the Churches Conservation Trust until 11 years later. Architecture The church is built of flint, parts of which have been rendered, with limestone dressings. The roofs are tiled. The church has a short nave with a north porch, north and south transepts, a chancel, a vestry, and a west tower. The nave seems to be Anglo-Saxon, indicated by characteristic long-and-short quoins at the western corners. The tower is Perpendicular, and the parts restored in the 19th century are in a Decorated style. The tower has a battlemented parapet on which are seven limestone statues. There were originally eight, but one is missing. It is supported by buttresses decorated with flushwork. The nave contains moulded north and south doorways. The rear arch in the south doorway is round-headed. The nave roof is in three bays. The transept roofs contain carved bosses. The octagonal limestone font dates from about 1400. The rest of the fittings date from the 19th-century restoration. These include the pulpit with its elaborate pierced tracery. The two-manual organ was built in 1863 by Bevington.

Academic career McGregor was born in Thames, New Zealand on 8 July 1894, the son of a draper. He attended Auckland Grammar School in 1909, and then became a school teacher. In 1918 he was appointed a demonstrator in biology at Auckland University College, and in 1922 became a lecturer in zoology. In 1924 he undertook ecological research into the kauri, a giant tree species native to New Zealand. In the late 1920s he was hired by the State Forest Service as a consultant for the Waipoua forest. In 1929 he paid his own way on an expedition to Australia, New Guinea and what is now Indonesia. McGregor did not obtain his BSc in Zoology until 1932, by which time he was de facto head of zoology at the university. In 1933 he was formally made lecturer in charge of zoology, and in 1939 became head of the newly formed Zoology department, with a spacious new building for which he had designed the interior layout. The building has been described as \\"mausoleum-like\\" by one of McGregor's students. For the rest of his career, he gave most of the zoology lectures based on a traditional curriculum that covered all major aspects of the subject as known at that time, but that was lacking in fieldwork. He built up an excellent zoology museum based around the collection from his 1929 trip. The university did not make him associate professor until 1949 and never made him a full professor. He complained that he had been promised the full professorship if he succeeded in building up the zoology school, as he had, but without effect. McGregor has been described as \\"charismatic and forceful in the lecture theatre, but poorly qualified to preside over a scientific discipline that was on the threshold of rapid change. Essentially insecure, he ran the department with a rod of iron, suppressing dissenters and, by and large, discouraging scientific debate\\". Conservation work McGregor was dedicated to conservation of the indigenous flora and fauna of New Zealand. Starting in the 1940s, McGregor launched a campaign to protect the Waipoua kauri forest, giving the status of a sanctuary. He wrote an 80-page illustrated pamphlet on the subject, which proved an effective manifesto for conservation. He said the forest \\"is not merely unique among the forest types of the world; it is at the same time undoubtedly one of Nature's most splendid achievements\\". He organised a petition that was signed by 70,000 supporters. His emotional appeals and superior rhetoric were successful in winning the battle. He continued his campaign against forestry in the reserve after retiring in 1960, and founded the New Zealand Conservation Society. Legacy McGregor married Kathleen Gladys Dacey in 1920, and they had three daughters and a son. After his first wife's death in November 1954, he remarried in October 1955. He died at Auckland on 1 June 1977. A giant kauri in Waipoua with diameter and height is named the \\"McGregor Kauri\\" in his honour. The Waipoua forest sanctuary is now bordered to the south by the 350-hectare (860-acre) Professor W.R. McGregor Reserve. A species of lizard, Oligosoma macgregori, is named in his honour.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Sly is voiced by Kevin Miller in all appearances to date. Sly is a raccoon who is descended from a long line of master thieves and uses his skills, with the help of his long-time friends Bentley and Murray, to pull off heists. Characteristics Sly is a gentleman thief raccoon who is descended from a long line of master thieves who specialize in robbing from legit criminals as opposed to innocent bystanders, thus making them vigilantes. The Cooper clan has ancestry coming from medieval Europe, feudal Japan, and the American frontier, tracing all the way back to Ancient Egypt, making him of multi-racial descent. When Sly was eight years old, his father and mother were killed by a gang called the Fiendish Five. The gang stole the \\"Thievius Raccoonus\\", a book containing the Cooper family's thieving techniques and moves. Sly was sent to an orphanage where he met Bentley, a highly intelligent turtle, and Murray, a comically self-confident and brawny hippopotamus. Sly is extremely agile and uses his skills, as well as enlisting the help of his two allies Bentley and Murray, in crime or even when infiltrating and intercepting other convicts. Sly carries a hooked cane, a long-standing family heirloom that he inherited from his father, and uses it in many of his maneuvers including as a blunt weapon. Sly also has abilities such as walking on ropes, climbing pipes and general sneaking in order to pickpocket guards for money, keys or loot. Another of his skills is using disguises to get across areas that are otherwise impossible to access. Sly, as a thief, is cunning, devious and secretive. However, he is also loyal, true, brave, friendly and he prefers his relationship with his friends, Bentley and Murray and his, if rather complicated and unrequited, love for Carmelita Fox, a police detective, over loot and riches. Appearances Sly made his debut appearance in Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus. The game starts out by telling his backstory, including history of his family, the death of his father and the theft of his family book, the Thievius Raccoonus. Sly breaks into detective Carmelita Fox's office and takes a case file about the Fiendish Five, the gang responsible for Sly's childhood loss. Sly and his friends, Bentley and Murray, then set out on a journey to collect all of the stolen pages of the book. In the end, Sly defeats Clockwerk, the leader of the gang who killed his father and stole the book. The second game, Sly 2: Band of Thieves, focuses on a new set of villains: the Klaww Gang. The gang is revealed to have stolen the pieces of Clockwerk. Sly and the gang then seek out the members of the Klaww Gang and steal back the parts. However, the real villain of the game is revealed to be Constable Neyla, who seems to be Sly's ally until she betrays them, and merges with the Clockwerk parts to become Clock-La (a portmanteau of \\"Clockwerk\\" and \\"Neyla\\"). Sly then fights Clock-La, and as Bentley goes to get the chip which lets Clockwerk live, the mouth closes down and cripples him. The third game, Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves, takes place roughly a year after Sly 2. Sly's main enemy is now Dr. M, a mysterious mandrill scientist who attempts to claim the Cooper family vault for himself. Sly and Bentley recover Murray, who has been in hiding ever since Bentley's accident (which he blames on himself) and then go to find new members of the gang to help them in the heist of the Cooper Vault. Sly appeared alongside Bentley in PlayStation Move Heroes, along with Jak and Daxter from the Jak and Daxter franchise and Ratchet and Clank from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, where his in-game rival is Nathan Drake, a treasure hunter from the Uncharted series. Sly's storyline begins outside the Cooper Van with Bentley alerting Sly to the fact the Thievius Raccoonus' last pages were ripped out. Sly sets out to find the culprit, and after arriving in the boss stage by parachuting in, he finds Drake with the pages trying to figure out what they mean. Sly lands and quickly taunts him about carelessly handling the pages, Nathan responds by challenging him to a fight. After defeating the boss of the game, Sly returns to Bentley and Murray with the pages, and Bentley promptly notices that they've been translated into ancient Mesopotamian, and the only translator that Bentley knows of is in Istanbul. After enhancing the Cooper van's performance, they set off for Turkey. Sly reappeared in the fourth main installment, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time. The plot centers around not only Sly, but also Bentley, Murray, Carmelita and Sly's ancestors, as they team up together and travel through time to restore the Thievius Raccoonus from being destroyed by their new, time-traveling enemy, Cyrille Le Paradox and his henchmen. Despite some rather close calls (including a twist revealing that Penelope, Bentley's girlfriend, is working for Le Paradox), Sly ultimately manages to defeat all of Le Paradox's cohorts and restore the Thievius Raccoonus; however, in the final battle with Le Paradox aboard his blimp, with his time machine malfunctioning, Sly ends up being transported to Ancient Egypt as the blimp explodes, leaving him stranded in the ancient desert. In 2009's Infamous, Sly Cooper's calling card can be found on Cole McGrath's backpack. This same easter egg can be seen in Infamouss sequel Infamous 2. In the 2014 video game Infamous Second Son, Sly Cooper makes an appearance as graffiti painted on a wall. This is very appropriate since this game was created by Sly Cooper's creators Sucker Punch Productions. In the 2016 Ratchet & Clank film, Sly Cooper appears on Clank's database alongside Daxter from Jak & Daxter as he tries to find out what race Ratchet is. Overall, Sly is one of only three characters to appear in every single incarnation of the franchise, the others being Bentley and Murray. Reception GamesRadar listed Sly on their list of \\"The 25 best new characters of the decade\\", stating that \\"'Gentleman thief' is an archetype that‚Äôs woefully underrepresented in videogames\\". They also listed him on their list of \\"The sexiest new characters of the decade\\", saying \\"Sly's the kind of character romance-novelists wish they could write\\". Sly won an award at the Game Developer's Conference for the best \\"Original Game Character of the Year\\" in 2002. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 74th best hero in video games, calling him \\"the Danny Ocean of gaming.\\" References Category:Anthropomorphic animal characters Category:Anthropomorphic characters in video games Category:Fictional gentleman thieves Category:Fictional raccoons Category:Male characters in video games Category:Orphan characters in video games Category:PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale fighters Category:Sly Cooper characters Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment protagonists Category:Video game characters introduced in 2002 Category:Video game mascots Category:Vigilante characters in video games ","title":"Sly Cooper (character)"},{"id":"29967716","text":"The Exposition universelle et internationale of 1913 was a World's Fair held in Ghent from 26 April to 3 November.Davy Depelchin, \\"The Ghent Universal and International Exhibition of 1913: Reconciling Historicism, Modernity and Exoticism\\", in Cultures of International Exhibitions 1840-1940, edited by Marta Filipova (Farnham, 2015), p. 185.

Nicknamed 'Marvo', Mallan was a fans' favourite and cult-hero and ended up playing seven seasons at Palmerston before being released by John Connolly in the summer of 2000. Mallan then went on to play for Arbroath, Stirling Albion (where he scored versus Heart of Midlothian in a Scottish League Cup match), Stenhousemuir and Dumbarton. Mallan then returned to Junior football, where he signed for Glenafton in New Cumnock as a player-coach and after one season moved to near-neighbours Auchinleck Talbot. In his first year playing for the Bot and aged 39, Mallan scored in the 2006 Scottish Junior Cup Final with a 30-yard header, after the opposing Bathgate Thistle goalkeeper slipped trying to collect the ball. Mallan also appeared from the substitutes' bench and set up the winning goal in the 2009 Scottish Junior Cup Final, and at the end of a six-year spell with Auchinleck Mallan again appeared as a substitute in the 2011 Scottish Junior Cup Final at 44 years old. Mallan then went on to play for Glasgow club St Anthony's for a brief spell. More recently, Mallan has been coaching at St Mirren's Youth Academy. Personal life Stevie is the third of four generations of Mallans to play football at a high level. His grandfather, Jim or Jimmy was a defender with Celtic and St Mirren and was selected for the Scottish Football League XI with the Hoops in 1949 and played in the 1955 Scottish League Cup Final with the Buddies.Lifelong St. Mirren fan undertook epic journey to see League Cup Final win for Hearts, Scottish Professional Football League, 15 March 2013 Mallan's father, also named Jimmy, played Junior football as a striker and scored a hat-trick for Johnstone Burgh in the 1964 Scottish Junior Cup Final. Mallan's son Stephen, who was born in 1996, debuted for St Mirren as a midfielder in November 2014 before moving to England to play for Barnsley and back to Scotland with Hibernian.Stevie Mallan: Hibs sign midfielder from Barnsley on four-year deal, BBC Sport, 6 June 2018 References  External links   Category:1967 births Category:Living people Stevie Category:Association football forwards Category:Scottish footballers Category:Kirkintilloch Rob Roy F.C. players Category:Clyde F.C. players Category:Queen of the South F.C. players Category:Arbroath F.C. players Category:Forfar Athletic F.C. players Category:Stirling Albion F.C. players Category:Stenhousemuir F.C. players Category:Dumbarton F.C. players Category:Glenafton Athletic F.C. players Category:Auchinleck Talbot F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:St Mirren F.C. non-playing staff Category:Footballers from Glasgow ","title":"Stevie Mallan"},{"id":"29967749","text":"William Groombridge may refer to: *William Ironside Groombridge, secretary of English football club Gillingham/New Brompton *William Groombridge (painter) See also *Groombridge (disambiguation) ","title":"William Groombridge"},{"id":"29967755","text":"William Groombridge (1748-1811), was a British water-colour painter.

The colloquial meaning of reparations has changed substantively over the last century. In the early 1900s, reparations were interstate exchanges (see war reparations): punitive mechanisms determined by treaty and paid by the surrendering side of conflict, such as the World War I reparations paid by Germany and its allies. Now, reparations are understood as not just war damages but compensation and other measures provided to victims of severe human rights violations by the parties responsible. The right of the victim of an injury to receive reparations and the duty of the part responsible to provide them has been secured by the United Nations. In transitional justice, reparations are measures taken by the state to redress gross and systematic violations of human rights law or humanitarian law through the administration of some form of compensation or restitution to the victims. Of all the mechanisms of transitional justice, reparations are unique because they directly address the situation of the victims. Reparations, if well designed, acknowledge victims' suffering, offer measures of redress, as well as some form of compensation for the violations suffered.See Reparations can be symbolic as well as material. They can be in the form of public acknowledgement of or apology for past violations, indicating state and social commitment to respond to former abuses. Proponents of reparations assert that in order to be effective, reparations must be employed alongside other transitional justice measures such as prosecutions, truth-seeking, and institutional reform.Cf. Such mechanisms ensure that compensatory measures are not empty promises, temporary stopgap measures, or attempts to buy the silence of victims. Types The legal concept of reparation has two components: the right of the victim of an injury to receive reparation, and the duty of the party responsible for the injury to provide redress. Reparations can be sought by individuals through judicial systems, or they can be policies introduced by the state to address the concerns or needs of a wider populace. While the first strategy is instrumental in creating legal precedent, the second is a more efficient way to recognize the concerns of more people. The United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law describes five formal categories of reparations: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition. # Restitution ‚Äì measures which serve to \\"restore the victim to the original situation before the gross violations occurred\\". This can include: restoration of liberty, enjoyment of human rights, identity, family life and citizenship, return of one's place of residence, restoration of employment, and return of property. # Damages Compensation ‚Äì the provision of compensation \\"for any economically assessable damage, as appropriate and proportional to the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case\\". Such damage includes: physical or mental harm, lost opportunities, material damages and loss of earnings, moral damage, cost of legal, medical, psychological, and social services. # Rehabilitation ‚Äì medical, psychological, social services, and legal assistance # Satisfaction ‚Äì various measures which include the cessation of human rights violations and abuses, truth-seeking, searches for the disappeared, recovery and reburial of remains, judicial and administrative sanctions, public apologies, commemoration, and memorialization. # Guarantees of non-repetition ‚Äì reforms ensuring the prevention of future abuses, including: civilian control of the military and security forces, strengthening an independent judiciary, protection of civil service and human rights workers, the overall promotion of human rights standards, and the establishment of mechanisms to prevent and monitor social conflict and conflict resolution. Who receives reparation Victims of violations of international human rights or humanitarian law have the rights to prompt, sufficient, and effective reparation. Victims can be individuals or a collective group of individuals who suffered similar violations. Such victims, as defined by the UN Basic Principles on the matter, are: \\"Persons who individually or collectively suffered harm, including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss, or substantial impairment of their fundamental rights, through acts or omissions that constitute gross violations of international human rights law, or serious violations of international humanitarian law‚Ä¶ the immediate family or dependants of the direct victim and persons who have suffered harm in intervening to assist victims in distress or to prevent victimization.\\" Who provides reparation The state, as the authority responsible for ensuring the protection of human rights and the administration of justice within their borders, is correspondingly also responsible for providing redress for abuses and injustices suffered by their citizens. The UN Basic Principles also states that if a person or entity other than the state can be found liable for the violations and abuses endured, such party is responsible for providing reparation either directly to the victim or through compensating the state for reparations rendered. The international legal underpinning for the right to effective remedy and duty to provide reparation can be found in multiple human rights and humanitarian treaties and conventions, including: # The Universal Declaration of Human Rights ‚Äì Article 8 # The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‚Äì Article 2 # The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ‚Äì Article 6 (PDF version) # The United Nations Convention Against Torture ‚Äì Article 14 # The Convention on the Rights of the Child ‚Äì Article 39 # The Hague Conventions respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land ‚Äì Article 3 # Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts ‚Äì Article 91 # The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) ‚Äì Articles 78 and 75 Also available at Examples of reparations programs Canada ‚Äì For more than 100 years, Canada retained a practice of removing indigenous Canadian children from their families and placing them in church-run Indian residential schools (IRS). This process was part of an effort to homogenize Canadian society, and included the prohibition of native language and cultural practices. In 1991, the Canadian government established the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP), charged with exploring the relationship between aboriginal peoples, the government, and society. As a result of the commission's recommendations, the government symbolically issued an apology in a \\"Statement of Reconciliation\\", admitting that the schools were designed on racist models of assimilation. Pope Benedict XVI also issued an apology on behalf of church members who were involved in the practice.Assembly of First Nations: \\"AFN National Chief Says Private Audience with Pope Benedict XVI in Vatican City \\"Closes the Circle\\" and Enables Work Towards Reconciliation for Residential School Survivors\\" In addition, the government provided a $350 million fund to help those affected by the schools. In 2006, the federal government signed the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, agreeing to provide reparations to the survivors of this program. The Settlement totals approximately $2 billion, and includes financial compensation, a truth commission, and support services.International Center for Transitional Justice, Canada Program page In 2017 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized to the LGBTQ2S people of Canada in the House of Commons and announced reparations that would be made to citizens who were injured by specific actions of the State. Chile ‚Äì In 1990, Chile's newly elected president Patricio Aylwin created the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the human rights abuses of General Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorial regime. The commission investigated disappearances, political executions, and torture, publishing the Rettig Report with its findings in 1991. Afterwards, its work was continued by the National Corporation for Reparations and Reconciliation. These programs recommended reparations for the victims, including: monthly pensions, educational benefits for the children of the disappeared, exemption from military service, and priority access to health services. However, these initiatives have also been criticized on a variety of grounds, such as their refusal to identify the perpetrators of violence and their failure to recognize a comprehensive range of victims to whom reparations are due. Morocco ‚Äì In Morocco, the period between the 1960s and 1990s is often referred to as the \\"years of lead,\\" referring to the massive human rights violations that occurred in the government's campaign of political oppression, including executions, torture, and the annihilation of other civil liberties. Shortly after he ascended the throne in 1999, King Mohammed VI created the Independent Arbitration Commission (IAC) to compensate the victims of forced disappearances and arbitrary detention. The IAC decided more than 5,000 cases and awarded a total of US$100 million, but victims and their families complained of lack of transparency in the tribunal's procedures and demanded truth seeking measures in addition to financial compensation. These pressures were instrumental in leading to the 2004 creation of the Arab world's first official truth-seeking initiative, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. The IER issued a ground-breaking reparations policy that upheld notions of gender equity and resulted in roughly US$85 million in financial compensation paid to almost 10,000 individuals, as well as recommendations on other measures such as the provision of health care and restoration of civil rights. The IER's recommendations also led to a groundbreaking collective reparations program that combined symbolic recognition of human rights violations with a development component in eleven regions that had suffered from collective punishment. As of May 2010, implementation of the collective reparations program was ongoing. Other reparations programs have been proposed and/or implemented in: Argentina, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, East Timor, El Salvador, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Iraq, Malawi, Liberia, South Africa, Kenya, the United States, and others.  Dignity Restoration  Dignity restorations has been posited as a potential remedy for dignity takings and the associated dehumanization and infantilization. Unlike reparations, dignity restoration is intended to be a more comprehensive remedy that includes both reparations and restorative justice. Dignity restoration is intended to be a remedy congruent to the harms associated with deprivations of property and dignity. The term dignity restoration was born from the marriage of reparations and restorative justice. The goal of restorative justice is ‚Äúrestoring property loss, restoring injury, restoring a sense of security, restoring dignity, restoring a sense of empowerment, restoring deliberate democracy, restoring harmony based on a feeling that justice has been done, and restoring social support.‚Äù Remedying both the material and immaterial aspects of involuntary property loss requires restoration of property as well as restoration of the various relationships damaged by the unfair confiscation. In the realm of dignity takings, dignity restoration is an adequate remedy because it addresses both the deprivation of property and dignity. In order for dignity restoration process to be effective, it needs incorporate restitution, redistribution, reparations, and restoration. This process needs to occur with the substantial input from those harmed by the takings. Because dignity takings most often occur alongside other non-property-related dignity oppression, such as rape, detainment, death, disappearance, and violence, it is critical that dignity restoration occurs in conjunction with other remedial measures.  Dignity Restoration: The South African Case  Dignity restoration for dignity takings have been researched with labor-intensive data collection and analysis, including 150 interviews conducted with South Africans whom colonial and apartheid authorities forcibly removed from their properties, as well as nine months of participant observation within the South African Land Restitution Commission. Potential problems There are logistical problems inherent in reparations, such as clearly defining the objectives, goals, and processes by which reparations will be distributed, determining how to address a range of atrocities with streamlined programs, or balancing economic development with financing reparation efforts. Some experts suggest that the problems lie in the very definition of reparations themselves. The right to seek and obtain reparations is vested with the state whose citizens suffered the losses, but individuals are barred from pursuing a claim for compensation directly against the state that wronged them. The grant of reparations is thus a political question, and individuals who suffered harm may be left undercompensated or uncompensated. The UN's guidelines on reparations could be contested on the fact that they equate human rights violations with violations of civil and political rights, ignoring abuses of economic, social, and cultural rights. The guidelines explicitly state that their intent is to restore victims to their status in a time of peace, but the distribution of rights and resources often wasn't equal in peacetime. Thus reparations, if their intent is to return a society to its status quo, run the risk of ignoring systemic oppression and reproducing social hierarchies. For instance, reparations programs have been critiqued for ignoring the needs of women in transitional justice processes. In 2007, women's groups mobilized to examine how reparations policies could be more responsive to victims of gender-based violence. Their efforts led to the \\"Nairobi Declaration on Women's and Girl's Right to a Remedy and Reparation,\\" which states that \\"reparations must go above and beyond the immediate reasons and consequences of the crimes and violations; they must aim to address the political and structural inequalities that negatively shape women's and girl's lives.\\" Nairobi Declaration on Women's and Girl's Right to a Remedy and Reparation (2007), International Meeting on Women's and Girl's Right to a Remedy and Reparation, Nairobi. Some of these concerns can be addressed by empowering women to have a voice in the reparations process, challenging discriminatory practices, and educating communities about sexual violence. In addition to gender-based discrimination, children are often excluded from reparations procedures. The reasons of this are varied; reparations often fall in the hands of parents and are only indirectly given to children, and reparations programs often do not take into account the fact that children and adults are affected differently by violence. Thus reparations should also have a child-specific component to target abuses that are specifically suffered by children.

Life Gudwal is said to have been of noble parentage and a native of Wales. At an early age he entered the priesthood, and became a bishop. Afterwards he led a party of 188 monks across the sea to Cornwall, where they were hospitably received by Mevor, a prince of the country, and Gudwal founded a monastery not far off (according to the Bollandists, in Devon). After his death his monks carried his body to Montreuil in Picardy, and it eventually, in 955 or 959, found a resting-place in the monastery of Blandinberg at Ghent, where his festival was kept on 6 June. Relics of Gudwal were also preserved at Y√®vre-le-Ch√¢tel and Pithiviers in the G√¢tinais. Such is briefly the legend as given by the Bollandists, but Surius and Malbrancq make Mevor a native of Picardy, reading Corminia (Cormont) for Cornuvia (Cornwall), and say that it was there that Gudwal established his monastery. The parish of Gulval, near Penzance, is dedicated to him, and there is a celebrated holy well there, but the old oratory has been destroyed. Gudwal's life and miracles were written by a monk of Blandinberg in the twelfth century (the writer refers to Abbot Gislebert, who died in 1138), but there seems to have been an older life which has perished. The full life is printed in the 'Acta Sanctorum,' and abbreviations of it are given by Capgrave and Surius. Gudwal must be distinguished from St. Gudwal or Gurval, an Irish monk and disciple of St. Brendan, who became second bishop of St. Malo in the seventh century. This saint's festival was also kept on 6 June, though the day is sometimes given as 6 January. References Further reading *Doble, G. H. (1960) The Saints of Cornwall; part 1.

Originally, it was the seat of the Central Mint of Prague; it was named after the Italian experts who were at the forefront of the minting reform. The main area of the mint consisted of coin-makers-workshops, or Smithies, which were located around the courtyard, and the minting chamber, called ‚ÄúPreghaus‚Äù, where the Prague groschen were struck. After its reconstruction at the end of the 14th century, the Italian Court became a part-time royal residence. History For many centuries, the Italian Court was the centre of the state economic power: it contained the royal mint and was the residence of the king during his visits to Kutn√° Hora silver mines. The history of the building reaches back to the late 13th century, when it served the function of a town castle: a safe storehouse of the silver ore and an important part of the town fortifications. It was separated from the town itself by moats, which survive in the lower section as cellars; the water in the moat also protected the castle from fires. [2] Following the reform of the mints by King Wenceslas II, all of the previously functioning coinage-works were situated in the Italian Court and coins of a unified value ‚Äúthe Prague groschen‚Äù began to be struck. During the 14th century the castle was completely rebuilt; although the greatest flourishing of the building activity came at the end of the century, under the reign of Wenceslas IV. The reconstruction was done by the workshop of Peter Parler, which was then completing the church of St. James and starting his work on St Barbara's Church. [2] The royal mint and the office of the supreme master minter came to an end in the 18th century after the great fire of 1770; the town hall was relocated into the Italian Court. Present Currently, the building serves as a museum of coin minting; the most interesting interiors, such as the royal chapel and hall of audience are open to the public.

He played part or all of six seasons in Major League Baseball between 1913 and 1919 for the Philadelphia Athletics, primarily as a catcher. After his major league career, he continued to play minor league baseball until 1928.  Major League Baseball Career  Wickey made his major league debut on September 29, 1913 at the age of 18 as a catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics. He continued to play for the Athletics on-and-off again until September 16, 1919. His career batting average in the major leagues was .199. He played the greatest number of games in 1915 (64 games), 1918 (74 games), and 1919 (57 games).  Minor League Baseball Career  Wickey played minor league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles for part of the season in 1914, 1916, 1917, 1922, and 1923. He was part of the International League Championship teams in 1922 and 1923. With a batting average of .310 in 1922, Wickey had several key hits that attributed to the Orioles taking the pennant in 1922. Wickey returned to his hometown of Rochester, NY in 1923 and played for the Rochester Tribe in 1923, 1926, and 1927. Wickey's career also included two seasons with the Buffalo Bison in 1924 and 1925. In 1928, Wickey played his last season in the minor leagues for the Reading Keystones. He ended his career in 1929 at the age of 34 playing for the Elmira Colonels in the New York-Pennsylvania League.  Personal Life  Wickey married Bessie Peterson of Kenosha, Wisconsin on April 12, 1923. Wickey and Bessie met in 1921 when Wickey was playing independent baseball in Kenosha.

Each year, the CMWCs are held in a different city around the world, with each host city designing its own unique course. The highlight of the CMWCs is the main race in which cyclists are given manifests and must pickup and deliver items to various locations around the host city as quickly and efficiently as possible. The total number of pickups and deliveries, or \\"drop offs\\" is unknown to the messengers before the race, but has been known to reach up to 100 stops and usually takes between 3‚Äì4 hours to complete. The cyclist who completes all of the assigned deliveries in the least amount of time wins the race. In addition to the main race there are also several side events which have become increasingly popular over the past few years. These events change yearly depending on the discretion of the host city but usually include backward circles, bike polo, bunnyhop, cargo race, longest skid, sprints, and trackstand. A racer's spoke card from the Cycle Messenger World Championships, Budapest, Hungary, 2001 History The idea for the Cycle Messenger World Championships, or Cycle Messenger Championships (CMCs) as it was initially called, was first conceived in 1992 by Achim Beier and his assistant, Stefan Klessman. Both worked for messenger Berlin, a Berlin-based messenger service, and were inspired to have a gathering of the world's bicycle messengers after talking with co-worker and ex-Washington D.C. bicycle messenger Michael \\"Ozone\\" Odom. Beier then took a trip to New York City where he visited Washington Square Park and talked with local bicycle messengers including James \\"The General\\" Moore about the proposed idea. The idea was received well by the local messengers and thus Beier and Klessman began planning the logistics of the first Cycle Messenger Championships. Since no competition of this type had ever taken place, there were many challenges to overcome before the first CMC be completed. Most notably, the host city, Berlin, needed to approve the proposal of such an event. This, in itself, was an enormous task since many streets had to be shut down for an entire weekend, the duration of the event, including Stra√üe des 17. Juni, the main thoroughfare for East-West traffic through Berlin, and the area around Brandenburg Gate. In the end, the city of Berlin approved the event with only minor changes to Beier's requests and in 1993 the first Cycle Messenger Championships took place. In all, around 500 messengers participated in the inaugural event. Though the 1993 CMC was declared a success, it lost a substantial amount of money. As a result, Beier and Klessman decided to transfer ownership of the event to a sports marketing company which had expressed interest in organizing it. Beier and Klessman stayed with the project, acting as consultants, to ensure that the competition retained its authenticity. The marketing company, though based in Berlin, had a partner in London and thus it was decided that the 1994 CMWC would be located there. Unfortunately though, months before the scheduled date of the CMWC the marketing company pulled its sponsorship of the event and left Beier and Klessman alone on the project. After much deliberation, it was decided that the 1994 CMWC would still take place in London, though now it would be organized solely by cycle messengers. Against all odds, the event took place and attracted around 500 participants. Once again, the CMWC was deemed a success. With the sting of the marketing company's withdrawal still fresh, several cycle messengers at the 1994 event decided to form a committee dedicated to the successful realization of the CMWC. Largely self-appointed and without any real power the committee floundered. The need for such an organization, however, was being realized by more and more cyclists. The 1995 CMWC took place in Toronto, and in 1996 it was hosted in San Francisco. It was here that the International Federation of Bike Messengers Association, or IFBMA, was created for the purpose of guaranteeing that the CMWC would take place each year. This committee, unlike the previous one, was open to all who wished to attend and thus had the potential of being a legitimate organization.  Cycle Messenger World Championships  Since the inception of the IFBMA the CMWCs have taken place each year in different locations around the world. The following is a list of host cities along with the year they hosted, or will host, the CMWCs: * 1993 Berlin, Germany * 1994 London, England * 1995 Toronto, Canada * 1996 San Francisco, United States * 1997 Barcelona, Spain * 1998 Washington D.C., USA * 1999 Z√ºrich, Switzerland * 2000 Philadelphia, USA * 2001 Budapest, Hungary * 2002 Copenhagen, Denmark * 2003 Seattle, USA * 2004 Edmonton, Canada * 2005 New York City, USA * 2006 Sydney, Australia * 2007 Dublin, Ireland * 2008 Toronto, Canada * 2009 Tokyo, Japan Montreal Cycle Messenger World Championship Group Photo * 2010 Panajachel, Guatemala * 2011 Warsaw, Poland * 2012 Chicago, USA * 2013 Lausanne, Switzerland * 2014 Mexico City, Mexico * 2015 Melbourne, Australia * 2016 Paris, France * 2017 Montreal, Canada * 2018 Riga, Latvia * 2019 Jakarta, Indonesia * 2020 Bogota, Colombia *2021 Yokohama, Japan Events Main Race The main race is designed to simulate the normal workday of a cycle messenger. At the start of the race, depending on what format is used, each messenger is given a manifest or a number of packages with the location of pick-ups and drop-offs of packages throughout the closed course. The course is composed of numbered or named checkpoints spread throughout a closed course which has been anywhere from a few kilometers to 10 kilometers or more in total track distance. Participants usually must traverse the length & breadth of the course many times to complete the event. The messengers seek to quickly and efficiently plan their routes in order to pick up and deliver each package in a timely manner. Several different systems have been used, most of these involve manifests, some involve multiple manifests. The total number of manifests and deliveries is unknown to the messengers before the start of the race but has been known to reach as high as 100 pick-ups and drop-offs. The field of cyclists is narrowed down after each manifest in some forms of this event but in others no elimination process is used and results are tallied for the entire field. The event usually takes between 3 and 4 hours to complete. London cycle messenger Sprints The sprints are a shorter distance race, usually ranging from 200‚Äì300 meters in length, on a closed course with the cyclist crossing the finish line first declared the winner. Elimination rounds are utilized to determine the winner, usually 5-10 participants race each heat. La Ocho This event is not considered a portion of the CMWC but was attempted on one occasion at a CMWC event in Guatemala, but the event was never realized. This figure-8 track was designed by architect Dieter Janssenhttp://www.dieterjanssen.com especially for the 2010 CMWC at Panajachel, Guatemala. The 200 meter course consisted of an Euler spiral loop built from rammed-earth with banked curves and a heavy timber over-under bridge intersection in the middle. The geometry was idealized for a 65 km/h speed, though its range could support a minimum of 12.8 km/h and a maximum of 140.9 km/h based on an average rider's weight, the expected frictional force and a maximum inclination angle of 45 degrees. Unfortunately the track was destroyed by rain before the event took place. The race was held on level ground with no bridge. Lines drawn on the surface indicated where the track might have been. In construction it never resembled the design provided by the architect, heavy timber abandoned for 4x4 & 2x4 stud frame construction. Banked turns were never achieved. La Ocho track model, Dieter Janssen architect La Ocho track sections, Dieter Janssen architect Bunny hop This event has been described as the high jump of cycling. Designed to simulate the need for avoiding obstacles during a messenger's workday, contestants must use their bikes to jump over a bar of increasing height. If a contestant is unable to clear the bar after two attempts at a particular height, he or she is eliminated from the competition. The last contestant remaining is declared the winner. The current CMWC record for this event is 1.27 meters set by Marlon Prather at the 1998 CMWC in Washington D.C., USA. Since the late 1990s a notable rise in popularity of the fixed gear bicycle has caused this event to decline as few participants are able to bunnyhop their fixed gear bicycles over any object of much more than 10 to 20 centimeters. Track stand The track stand competition is an event in which cyclists try to maintain a stationary position for as long as possible while on a bicycle. All cyclists start off with both hands and feet on the bike in the traditional trackstand position. As the competition progresses, cyclists are instructed to remove specific limbs from the bicycle. The order which cyclists remove their limbs from the bicycle usually starts with taking off one hand, then both hands, one foot, then both feet. The cyclist who remains balanced in an upright and stationary position the longest is declared the winner. Cyclist performing a trackstand without hands. Skids This competition consists of cyclists attempting to create the longest skid. Quite possibly one of the most dangerous events other than the main race, competitors sprint toward a starting line then lock up their back wheel to initiate the skid. Competitors must then balance themselves over their handlebars to create as little friction as possible between the rear stationary wheel and the ground while still steering their bicycle. Each cyclist is given two attempts to skid as far as possible. The record for the longest skid at the CMWC is set around 500 feet. It is not necessary to actually leave a \\"skid mark\\" and competitors are allowed to move their pedals slightly as well as to cause the rear wheel to leave the ground while trying to pivot their weight forward in order to decease friction between the road surface and rear wheel. An Exhibition event, this skill has no application in the actual function of a bicycle messenger. Backward Circles Like the Skids, this event has no correlation in simulating the ordinary workday of a cycle messenger. This competition requires cyclists to pedal backwards in consistent and consecutive circles. The cyclist who can complete the most consecutive backward circles is declared the winner. Cargo Race This side event requires cyclists to transport oversized objects from one point to another. Typical objects chosen for delivery range from beer kegs to boxes. Hay bales, pallets and lengths of lumber are also used in the challenge. Cyclists are encouraged to come up with creative ways of transporting such irregularly shaped objects while still using a bicycle. Many competitors prefer to use panniers and trailers, while some even use specially designed bicycles for the event. Bike polo Bike polo follows the same general guidelines as hockey only this event is played using bikes. This event has no correlation to any particular bicycle messenger skill but was introduced for the 2008 CMWC in Toronto because a number of bicycle messengers enjoy playing the game and bicycle messengers are credited for much of the hype and expansion of this sport. The 2008 tournament drew over 100 participants on 35 teams and lasted throughout the event. It was the first large and international bike polo tourney in history, presented as the first ever World Bike Polo Championships. Only a portion of the participants were bicycle messengers, the rest were polo players drawn to the tournament for its potential size due to its sponsorship by the CMWC 2008, although the tournament results were not included as CMWC results. Teams consisting of three cyclists used mallets to pass a ball and score as many goals as possible. Teams usually compete on a concrete court of varying sizes. Millen√°ris velodrome in Budapest. Reception The CMWCs have been well received by the local populations of several host cities while others consider the event a nuisance. For instance, the 2007 CMWCs in Dublin, Ireland, were pushed to the outer limits of the city after the local population protested the event. On the other hand, the 2002 CMWCs held in Copenhagen, Denmark, were welcomed by the city and competitors were even treated to a free breakfast and free beer courtesy of the mayor.

It ran through the northwestern Harz Foreland from B√∂r√üum via Salzgitter, Ringelheim and Seesen to Kreiensen. It opened on 5 August 1856 and was one of the oldest railways in Germany. In 1956 a shorter link to Brunswick was built in the shape of the Brunswick‚ÄìSalzgitter Bad railway and with this line was connected through to the Brunswick‚ÄìKreiensen railway.  Traffic  Today it mainly serves regional trains and, after that, a few goods trains. In the 2009 timetable it will be worked hourly by Regionalbahn trains from Brunswick via Seeseon to Herzberg am Harz, and every two hours by the Regionalbahn from Bad Harzburg via Seesen to Kreiensen (with extra services at peak times). Normally Lint multiples (DB Class 648) are used that are stabled by Alstom at Salzgitter. From a fares perspective, the line from Brunswick to Seesen forms part of the Brunswick Region Fare Zone and, from Seesen to Kreiensen, the Lower Saxony Transport Network. History  The Brunswick‚ÄìHanover Treaty of 1837 that regulated the construction of the Brunswick‚ÄìBad Harzburg railway had already established a basic agreement allowing both countries to work together towards a southern link. Only 15 years later a further treaty was contracted. This allowed Brunswick to build a line from Brunswick to the Hanoverian Southern Railway at Kreiensen. This in turn allowed Hanover to build a railway line from B√∂r√üum (in Brunswick) via Ringelheim (Hanover) to Seesen (Brunswick). From there it was agreed to build the line via Harriehausen (again in Hanover) to Kreiensen, where both lines were connected. The line was opened on 5 August 1856. Three months earlier the Hanoverian Southern Railway was opened from Hanover to Kassel. The line was successful and in 1865, the Altenbeken‚ÄìKreiensen railway was opened, creating a western connection with the Ruhr area. In 1868 this was followed by the link from B√∂r√üum to Jerxheim on the former Brunswick‚ÄìWolfenb√ºttel‚ÄìJerxheim‚ÄìOschersleben‚Äì Magdeburg railway. This connection became an important east-west route, with traffic to and from G√∂ttingen and Frankfurt stronger than that to and from the Ruhr. The Herzberg‚ÄìSeesen railway, opened in 1871, however, did not fulfil expectations. After the division of Germany traffic flows changed. All railways between Helmstedt (Brunswick‚ÄìMagdeburg railway) and Walkenried (South Harz Railway) were disrupted at the Inner-German border, including the Jerxheim crossing on the line from Magdeburg via Eilsleben and Oschersleben. Better access was sought in the Salzgitter area. In 1956, a direct connection from Salzgitter- Bad to Brunswick was opened by closing a gap from Salzgitter to Dr√ºtte, partly using a section of the Brunswick‚ÄìDerneburg railway that was closed in the 1940s. The railway is not electrified and today Salzgitter-Dr√ºtte to Neuekrug- Hahausen is single track. It is part of Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs Harz-Weser network. It is planned to be controlled remotely from the electronic interlocking in G√∂ttingen. References  Sources  * H√∂gemann, Josef (1995). Eisenbahnen im Harz (I), Band 1: Die Staatsbahnstrecken.

This gas giant is between 5 and 10 times the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System. Due to their young age and high temperature all four discovered planets in the HR 8799 system are large, compared to all gas giants in the Solar System. Description HR 8799 e is the fourth planet orbiting HR 8799 in order of discovery. It is a young, hot and massive gas giant, and is fairly close to its star, lying just between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus in the Solar System. The planet is still glowing red hot. HR 8799 e is the innermost known planet as it orbits closer to its star than the other three known planets in this planetary system. This planet orbits at an estimated distance of 14.5 AU based on the relationship between angular separation measured by direct imaging observations and the star's distance from Earth. The estimated period of this planet if the orbit is face- on is about 50 years. Discovery A team of researchers led by Christian Marois at the National Research Council's Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics identified the planet from data taken in 2009 and 2010 using the W.M. Keck Observatory in the K and L spectral bands. They announced their findings on 22 November 2010. A separate work reporting the detection of HR 8799 e, led by Thayne Currie and using the Very Large Telescope, was made public six weeks later. Observations obtained since then with the Large Binocular Telescope show that HR 8799 e has a spectrum and temperature similar to HR 8799 c and d. Observations In 2013, near infrared spectroscopy from 995 to 1769 nanometers made with the Palomar Observatory showed evidence of methane and acetylene but no signs of ammonia or carbon dioxide gas. There is no explanation as to why the planet shows strong methane absorption, but the other 3 planets in this system do not, despite all 4 planets having similar atmospheric temperatures. On 27 March 2019, the European Southern Observatory announced the result of their Very Large Telescope astronomical interferometer (VLTI) imaging of HR 8799 e employing the GRAVITY instrument. This was the first direct observation of any exoplanet using optical interferometry. A spectrum ten times more detailed than earlier observations revealed a complex exoplanetary atmosphere with clouds of iron and silicates swirling in a planet-wide storm. Team leader Sylvestre Lacour said: > \\"Our analysis showed that HR8799e has an atmosphere containing far more > carbon monoxide than methane ‚Äî something not expected from equilibrium > chemistry. We can best explain this surprising result with high vertical > winds within the atmosphere preventing the carbon monoxide from reacting > with hydrogen to form methane.\\" The observations with GRAVITY confirmed the spectral type of ~L7 for the planet HR 8799 e. Previously the spectral type suggested a higher temperature than the measured effective temperature. The GRAVITY observations showed that the planet has a low surface gravity, which solved the discrepancy. A low surface gravity is also observed for many young brown dwarfs and is seen as an indicator of youth.

Kennedy's men returned with a suitcase full of $35,000, making it one of the more famous instances of miscommunication in the greasing of political palms in Logan history. 2004 sting During the 2004 election season in the town of Logan, West Virginia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in a controversial move, had four- term mayor Thomas Esposito run for the West Virginia House of Delegates in order to ferret out corruption in Logan County politics. Officials in neighboring Lincoln County, West Virginia were also charged. Esposito was a prominent criminal defense attorney and four-term Mayor of Logan who was directed to buy votes by the FBI and implicate as many local politicians as possible in a Federal probe directed by Assistant U.S. Attorney R. Booth Goodwin II. In the end, Esposito was directed to pull out of the race before the general election and pleaded guilty to a single charge of misprision of a felony, putatively for bribing Logan County, West Virginia magistrate, Danny Wells, who himself received a nearly eight-year Federal sentence for his own bribery and extortion charges. Esposito himself was merely disbarred and served two years of probation. He is considered to have bribed Wells by paying off his $6500 bar tab. Others charged with crimes as a result of the sting Other public figures were charged with federal crimes and forced to resign. The following men were implicated in the sting: *Logan County Clerk Glen Dale \\"Houn' Dog\\" Adkins admitted he sold his vote for $500 in 1996. *Perry French Harvey, Jr., former UMWA official pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe voters. *Ernie Ray Mangus was granted immunity against the charge of receiving $1,000 to buy votes in exchange for his cooperation. *\\"Big\\" John Mendez, Sheriff of Logan County, was compelled to resign and barred for life from running for public office. *Lincoln County Circuit Clerk Greg Stowers entered a guilty plea to a federal vote-buying charge in a probe directed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen George. *Logan police chief Alvin ‚ÄúChipper‚Äù Porter Jr. and Logan VFW president Ernest Stapleton both entered related guilty pleas. Voter disenfranchisement controversy Although Esposito was a sham candidate controlled by the Federal Government, he received 2,175 votes in his faked bid to be elected to the 19th District of West Virginia's House of Delegates. Greg Campbell, Perry Harvey's attorney, argued unsuccessfully before District Judge David A. Faber that Esposito's faked campaign interfered with an election and disenfranchised everyone voting for him. Judge Faber took thirty minutes to decide that the votes were irrelevant.

ONS traces its origin to the first National Cancer Nursing Research Conference, supported by the American Nurses Association and the American Cancer Society in 1973. Following this conference, a small group of oncology nurses met to discuss the need for a national organization to support their profession. Since its official incorporation in 1975, it has grown to include 215 chapters. It provides information and education to nurses around the world. In addition, the society plays an active role in advocacy activities at the local, state, national, and international levels. ONS produces the largest conference dedicated to oncology nursing, Congress, held annually. ONS members represent a variety of professional roles, practice settings, and subspecialty practice areas. Registered nurses, including staff nurses, advanced practice nurses, case managers, educators, researchers, and consultants, and other healthcare professionals, are eligible for membership. The society offers information and resources for nurses at all levels, in all practice settings, and in all subspecialties.  Nursing education  ONS is accredited as a provider of continuing nursing education by the American Nurses Credentialing Center‚Äôs Commission on Accreditation. ONS is also accredited as a provider of continuing education by the California Board of Registered Nursing, Provider #2850. ONS offers online and in-person education for oncology nurses to stay current on the latest cancer treatments and symptom management techniques. The society also holds both in-person and e-conferences.  Publications  ONS publishes two scholarly journals: the Oncology Nursing Forum and the Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing.. The Society's news magazine, ONS Voice, is published both in print and online. ONS also publishes books, guidelines and standards for the cancer care community.  Advocacy  ONS participates in a variety of advocacy activities. It lobbies Congress on behalf of nursing and especially oncology nursing. For example, ONS signed on to the nursing consensus statement to improve patients‚Äô access to, cost, and quality of treatment as part of the 2010 healthcare reform. It also advocated with the nursing community for nursing provisions to be included as part of the healthcare reform bills.  Cancer Patient Treatment Education Bill  With Representative Steve Israel as the bill sponsor, ONS reintroduced the Assuring and Improving Cancer Treatment Education and Cancer Symptom Act (H.R. 1661) to the House of Representatives in 2013. The legislation would provide for Medicare reimbursement of the time that registered nurses spend educating people diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers about their disease and the effects of treatment.

The battle, fought near the town of Zierikzee, ended in a Franco-Holland victory. The battle is part of a larger conflict between the Count of Flanders and his French feudal lord, King Philip IV of France (1296‚Äì1305). Flemish invasion of Hainaut, Zeeland and France The County of Zeeland was an area that had been contested between the Count of Flanders and the Count of Holland since the 11th century. Originally granted in 1012 by Emperor Henry II to the count of Flanders Baldwin IV, by 1076 the area had become part of Holland but under Flemish overlordship. After the Flemish victory in the battle of the Golden Spurs, the Flemish attacked John II Avesnes, count of Holland, Zeeland and of Hainaut and conquered Lessines. The House of Dampierre and the House of Avesnes had been involved in a familial war for decades. In retaliation to the Flemish invasion of Hainaut John's son William plundered Cadzand. In reaction to this raid, Guy of Namur, son of Guy I of Flanders, formed a fleet at Sluis, which sailed on 23 April 1303 to claim Zeeland for the Flemish. After Flemish landings near Arnemuiden and Veere the troops of William fled to Middelburg which surrendered on 9 May. After this the Flemings conquered the whole of Walcheren and several other islands. Only Zierikzee was held for the count of Holland. In July an armistice was arranged between the Flemings and the count of Holland. Covered by an armistice in the north, the Flemings raised an army near Cassel, which entered France and attacked Saint-Omer, Terwaan and Tournai. In August Philip IV of France tried to raise a new army to counter this threat, but due to mutiny over backpay he was forced to conclude an armistice until May 1304 with the Flemings, which was later extended to June. The armistice gave the French the opportunity to raise a new army in peace for the next campaigning season. In the Spring of 1304 the armistice between the Flemings and Holland was broken. William attacked and defeated the Flemings near Castle Blodenburg. A fleet led by William and his uncle Guy of Avesnes, bishop of Utrecht however was defeated by the Flemings, the bishop being captured. After this victory, the Flemings invaded Holland and Utrecht. Seeing the Flemish success John II, Duke of Brabant then joined the Flemish cause. Dordrecht, led by Witte van Haemstede, a bastard son of count Floris V, brought the cities of Holland to the side of William and the Flemings retreated. After this Zierikzee, which was still held by Holland, was besieged. Battle of Zierikzee Upon the end of the armistice between France and Flanders, Philip IV launched his army on Tournai and sent his fleet, led by Rainier Grimaldi, to aid the count of Holland. Grimaldi's fleet consisted of 30 French and eight Spanish cogs and 11 Genoese galleys. This fleet was joined at Schiedam by the small fleet of Holland, consisting of five more ships. This combined fleet then set sail for Zierikzee. Guy of Namur could count on a motley fleet of 37 Flemish, English, Hanseatic, Spanish, and Swedish ships, as well as numerous smaller vessels. On the evening of August 10, the two fleets met on the Gouwe, back then a bay near Zierikzee. As the river was silted, maneuvering was hindered, which aided the smaller vessels of the Flemings. The Flemish tried a fire ship attack which failed when the vessels were blown back to the Flemish lines. At first the battle seemed to go to the Flemings as the larger French ships were immobilized by grounding. But when the tides changed, the larger French ships came free and joined the fight, turning the battle to Grimaldi's advantage. The next morning, the Flemish ships were seen to aimlessly float, apparently sabotaged by a traitor who cut their moorings. As the Franco-Hollander fleet was still in battle array, it was able to easily put down further Flemish resistance. Consequences As a result of the French victory, Guy of Namur was captured and the siege of Zierikzee was lifted. One week after the naval battle, on 18 August Philip IV himself was able to defeat the Flemish main army at the battle of Mons-en-P√©v√®le. On 22 August Count John II died and was succeeded as count of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland by his son William.  References * G. Asaert, J. van Beylen en H.P.H.

Factual background Himmel, an attorney, agreed to represent the 18-year-old victim of a motorcycle accident to recover settlement money from her first attorney. The client had won a $23,000 settlement after the accident, but her first attorney had allegedly pocketed the money instead. The client asked Himmel not to report the first lawyer's misconduct to the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (IARDC) because she feared that it would hinder the recovery efforts. Over the course of 24 months, Himmel brokered an agreement where the first attorney promised to pay $75,000 if the client agreed not to prosecute. In 1986, the IADRC charged Himmel with a violation of Rule 1-103(a) of the Illinois Code of Professional Responsibility for failing to report the first attorney's misconduct.In re Himmel, 533 N.E.2d 790, 791 (Ill. 1988) Decision The court held that Himmel had a duty to report the misconduct of the first attorney under Rule 1-103(a), which requires lawyers with knowledge of misconduct by another lawyer to report it to the appropriate disciplinary authority.107 Ill.2d R. 1-103(a) The court held that the client's communication about the first attorney's misconduct was not protected by the attorney‚Äìclient privilege because she had discussed the matter in the presence of non-privileged third parties (her mother and fiance). The court upheld the IADRC's decision to suspend Himmel's license for one year.In re Himmel, 533 N.E.2d 790, 794 (Ill. 1988) Impact In the years preceding the decision, the Illinois and Chicago bars had been greatly criticized as a result of Operation Greylord, in which lawyers failed to report the misconduct of other attorneys.William J. Wernz, To Report or Not to Report, Bench and Bar of Minnesota (December 1988) Months earlier, in a case cited in this decision, In re Anglin, 122 Ill.2d 531, 525 N.E.2d 550 (May 18, 1988), the Illinois Supreme Court refused to reinstate the law license of an attorney convicted of (among other felonies) possessing stolen securities, and who wished to be reinstated while continuing to withhold the name of the person or persons from whom he received the stolen securities. These combined situations greatly increased the frequency of attorney misconduct reporting. In 1988, 154 attorneys were reported for misconduct in Illinois. In 1989, 922 attorneys were reported for misconductDaryl van Duch, Best Snitches: Land of Lincoln Leads the Nation in Attorneys Turning in Their Peers. Natl.

All Saints and its neighbour St Lawrence's Church were built by the Benedictine monks of Evesham Abbey in the 12th century to serve the people of Evesham. All Saints is now the town's parish church, as St Lawrence's was declared redundant in the 1970s. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building by Historic England. History Intriguingly, the two parish churches share the same churchyard. After the Dissolution All Saints adopted a strongly Puritan method of preaching and worship (in common with many other English churches). This style lasted until, roughly, the major Victorian restoration (1872-6) by Frederick Preedy, when All Saints moved to a high church (Anglo-Catholic) tradition of worship. Through the 1970s it became increasingly clear that the upkeep of two medieval churches, with all the attendant challenges and problems, was too great a burden for the two congregations. A series of meetings and discussions, led by the Revd Canon A. Webb, led to the decision to keep only one church: All Saints.John Turner, The Evesham Churches (1990), 11-12. The parish of St Lawrence, Evesham, was declared redundant on 8 December 1977. In the following year the church was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund (since 1994 called Churches Conservation Trust).Pastoral (Amendment) Measure 1994 (1994 No. 1), 13(2). and on 1 January 1978 the parishes of All Saints and St Lawrence were united.

The marque is often seen on vehicle and aircraft windscreens. History The Triplex Safety Glass Company Ltd was founded in 1912 by Kent- born Reginald Delpech (30 March 1881 - 29 May 1935). The company was established in 1912 to build laminated windscreens in Britain, under French patents. On 9 September 1929 Triplex formed a joint venture company with Pilkington in St Helens. The company is now part of Pilkington Automotive. In the 1960s Triplex bought its main competitor British Indestructo Glass, giving it a monopoly in British laminated glass production. In the 1980s, around 1,000 people worked at the Triplex site in St Helens and about 700 at the site in Kings Norton. Pilkington retired the Triplex brand in August 1993. The company was formally dissolved in September 2019.

It had its main plant at Kings Norton in the West Midlands. The St Helens factory now manufactures under the GKN (Aerospace Transparency Systems) brand. Aerospace glass continues to be made at the site. It is believed that the automotive building fell out of use with the collapse of MG Rover in 2005 (when Pilkington downsized operations), although closure quite possibly predated this. Products Triplex made laminated and toughened windscreens and windows for the automotive, rail, marine and aerospace sectors. Particularly widespread is the use of so-called \\"triplex\\" adhesives, which result from the bonding of two or more glasses - single or safety - usually via polyvinylbutyric (PVB) membranes. The glazing is welded by heating and later pressing. Triplex glasses exhibit the maximum impact resistance. This glazing system is distinguished for the optimal use of safety in use since, if it breaks, the glass pieces are held in place by means of the intermediate membranes, preventing serious injury.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is particularly noted for its Norman door, made of wood and ironwork. It is described as a \\"work of outstanding importance\\", and a \\"rare and precious survival\\". History The church dates from the 11th century. It was recorded in the Domesday Book as serving the villages of Little Hormead and Great Hormead. The chancel was rebuilt in the early 13th century and a bellcote was added in the 15th century. A south porch was added in the 18th century. In 1888 the church was restored, during which the east end was rebuilt and the bellcote was reconstructed. In the 13th century St Nicholas' Church had been built in Great Hormead, and Little Hormead lost its independent rector in 1886. It was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust in 1995. Architecture Exterior St Mary's is constructed in flint with stone dressings. The south porch is in brick, and the roofs have red tiles. The bellcote is timber with a pyramidal roof. There is a canonical sundial on the south wall. The plan of the church consists of a tall narrow nave without aisles, a chancel at a lower level, a south porch, and a bellcote at the west end. Much of the church is Norman in style, particularly the nave. This includes the north and south doorways, a north window and the chancel arch. The south window in the nave dates from the 15th century. The two-light west window was inserted during the 1888 restoration and is in Perpendicular style. The east window in the chancel is a triple lancet. In the south wall of the chancel are two 13th-century lancet windows, a large 15th-century window, and a priest's door. Interior The octagonal font dates from the early 14th century and has panels of blank tracery around its bowl. In the southeast corner of the chancel is a 15th- century piscina. Above the chancel arch is a carved and painted Royal coat of arms of Charles II dated 1660. The 12th-century north door, described as having a \\"most lavish display\\" of ironwork, is no longer \\"in situ\\", but is preserved inside the church. It consists of two interlacing quatrefoil patterns, around which is a border containing scrolls, all of which is surmounted by a serpentine dragon. Dendrochronology has confirmed that the trees from which the door is built were felled between about 1130 and about 1150.

Today it is operated as a show mine under the name of Roter B√§r Pit Educational Mine by the Sankt Andreasberg Society for History and Archaeology (Sankt Andreasberger Verein f√ºr Geschichte und Altertumskunde). The name Roter B√§r means \\"Red Bear\\". In line with historical practice the funds required to restore the historic mine were raised through the formation of a mining trades union and issue of share certificates.  History  The former iron ore mine situated in the B√§ren valley at the foot of the Kn√∂chel, east of Sankt Andreasberg forms the heart of the educational Roter B√§r Pit today. The mining of brown iron ore, which occurs here as lens-shaped inclusions in a Middle Devonian shale-limestone series, began around 1800 and ended in the mid-1860s. The pit, which was operated by private individuals (Eigenlehnern), produced about 50-60 tons of ironstone annually with a workforce of just 4-6 men. The very soft, often clayey, ore was won using picks (Keilhauen) without the need for drilling and blasting. Simple hand picking enabled it to be enriched by up to 35-40% Fe content. Its only customer was the Hanoverian state's K√∂nigsh√ºtte smelting works in Lauterberg (founded 1733). Despite only moderate levels of iron content, this ore was in great demand because of its good smelting properties and high proportion of manganese. Blended with red iron ore from the Sieber valley enabled good wrought iron and cable iron (Seileisen) to be produced. During this period a network of relatively shallow pits with a total length of more than 1,000 metres were dug. Today these pits have largely been filled in or collapsed and are only accessible in a few places. With the transfer of Hanover to Prussia (in 1866) and the introduction of charcoal blast furnaces at the K√∂nigsh√ºtte smelter (in 1871) the ore from the Roter B√§r no longer had a market. The mine was abandoned and fell into ruins. 10 years after the establishment of silver mining at St. Andreasberg (the Samson Pit, in 1910), the old mine was worked again by the firm of Ilseder H√ºtte based at Gro√ü- B√ºlten near Peine as part of a national exploration programme. Although the unworkability of the collapsed and practically exhausted deposit rapidly became clear, the search for as yet still undiscovered lodes of metal continued until 1923. For about 10 years trial digs were driven northwards and northeast into the mountain, work that employed up to 42 miners. Prospecting was not only carried out at the level of the surface galleries, but also at a depth of 170 m at the face of the Sieber gallery, (the drainage gallery of the St. Andreasberg mining field). From the Wennsgl√ºckter lode from where the tunnel was long enough, the 700 m long B√§r cross passage was built running northwards. Despite the driving of trial pits with a total length of about 4 km it did not prove economical to recoverable the ore reserves. The weak and relatively low metal-poor lodes (Hermannsgl√ºcker, Wilhelmsgl√ºcker and Ernst lodes) that were discovered turned out at least to be mineralogically very interesting. Highlights include the arsenide nickel-cobalt ores, and a complex composition of selenide mineralizations.  Visitor mine  A Dennert Fir Tree at the entrance to the show mine In 1931 the newly founded Sankt Andreasberg Society for History and Archaeology took the pit over and established the first visitor mine in the Harz. After 10 years guided tours came to a standstill due to the Second World War. The site, which now acted as an air- raid shelter, saved the lives of many people who fled here during the fighting in April 1945. From 1947-1949 there were again unsuccessful attempts to mine the remaining clay minerals in eastern field of the mine. In the early 1950s when the historical society devoted itself to the creation of a mining museum on the Samson Pit, the then owner of the mining field, Berging. Dr. Ernst Bock took over the gallery and used it occasionally as an educational mine for the Clausthal Mining Academy. Later the site fell into decay. In 1988 the surface gallery was opened by the mining working group again, and made partially accessible to visitors. The pit is not just used as a visitor mine, however; it is also to supply drinking water and, during the winter, acts as sheltered haven for bats. In addition, work is underway to carry out further research and to preserve and protect the old mine workings. Great importance is attached to ensuring they are preserved as far as possible in their original state.

The company provided mirror trading services to its clients that allowed them to make trading decisions based on other traders actions. The company was acquired by Oanda in 2013, which decided to close down the service a year later in October 2014. The idea behind the company was to let traders collaborate on trading strategies, styles, and techniques in what would become known as social trading. This stemmed from the fundamental chaos of the retail forex market and the large number of solo \\"day traders\\" that were looking for trading ideas. One of Currensee's main innovations was the \\"Trade Leaders Investment Program,\\" in which Currensee used a proprietary algorithm to identify top-performing traders from within the social network, invited them to participate in the program, and then allowed other investors to follow and execute their trades in their own brokerage account. Something that was akin to the mutual fund system based in stock indexes.  History  The company was founded in 2008 by software developer Asaf Yigal and Forex trader Avi Leventhal, at the time of the late-2000s recession. They identified an opportunity to offer Forex trading as an alternative asset class and a new way to trade together. The company was led by CEO Dave Lemont, and was headquartered in Boston's North End neighborhood. Currensee was funded by North Bridge Venture Partners, Egan-Managed Capital and Vernon & Park Capital. They were a member of the National Futures Association and registered with the Financial Services Authority. It was acquired by the forex broker Oanda Corporation in September 2013. On October 9, 2014, Oanda Corporation announced that on October 31, 2014, Currensee and the OANDA Trade Leaders Program (OTLP) will cease operation.https://fxtrade.oanda.com/community/forex- forum/topic/54009895/  The Currensee Social Network  Together Yigal and Leventhal combining social networking with real trade collaboration. Currensee's goal was to bring transparency to retail Forex trading by creating an active network of traders and a different way to make investing decisions. The Currensee trading social network connected retail Forex traders from around the world so they could see each other's actual trades and share trading strategies in real time to make more informed trade decisions. Traders linked their live brokerage accounts to Currensee, so when they participated in discussions and on trading teams, fellow traders could look at their trading performance and make an informed decision about their next trade. This form of social trading, or trading together, allows Forex traders to collaborate and share their Forex best practices, trading strategies, preferred pairs and economic indicators, and so on. This is a key differentiator, as there is a wide discrepancy between user performance in \\"demo accounts\\" and live brokerage accounts. As at 2010 the social network was made up of members from over 80 countries connecting with other traders to form online trading teams, share trading ideas, market insights, and trading strategies. With the 7,000-member community traded approximately $50 billion in volume per year. Currensee's motto was ‚ÄúTrade Together‚Äù. Currensee differentiated itself from other online trading communities by allowing only live Forex brokerage accounts to be linked in a trader's Currensee profile. They did not link demo accounts. The company's message of ‚ÄúReal trades. Real traders. Real time.‚Äù supported their stance on transparency in the Forex market. Currensee's competitors included eToro, FX Copy and ZuluTrade.  Trade Leaders Investment Program  In October 2010, Currensee launched their Trade Leaders Investment Program (TLIP). Investors in the TLIP selected the Trade Leader (or Trade Leaders) whose trades they wanted to follow and execute in their own trading account. Trade Leaders were selected from the members of the Currensee social network via a proprietary algorithm developed by Currensee's engineering team, and were screened for eligibility based on historical performance, risk management, and returns. Investors in the program selected the Trade Leaders they wanted to invest in, allocate their funds, and build Trade Leader portfolios. Whenever a Trade Leader executed a trade, it was mirrored in the investor's own brokerage account. The investors were able to see every trade that was made. The model was similar to that of a stock mutual fund.  Leaderboard and the Trader Authority Index  The Trader Leaderboard ranked the top traders in the Currensee community based on historical and real-time performance. Trade Leaders featured on Currensee's Leaderboard were measured against the Trader Authority Index (TAI). The TAI is a proprietary algorithm that combines performance, risk and experience into a single index. The TAI score was displayed on the Currensee Trade Leaderboard and on every Trade Leader's profile.  Tweet My Trades  Currensee allowed its members the option of automatically sharing their open and closed positions using the Tweet My Trades feature using Twitter. When a trader executed an order, Currensee automatically sent a tweet on the trader's behalf. This served a dual purpose, as the high volume of daily tweets spread throughout the Forex community on Twitter extended their reach beyond their own network of users.  Currensee Social Indicators  Currensee Market Watch Social Indicators is another proprietary element; this one aggregates the trading knowledge of the network to deliver unique social data. Currensee Social Indicators provided real-time, aggregate trade information by currency pair along with volume, percentage short/long, and winning/losing across the community. Members could see which of their ‚Äútrading friends‚Äù were trading a particular pair and could use that information to make more informed trading decisions. This ability to share amongst a community is a key pillar of successful social networks, although it's unknown how effective this data is for new traders.

In 2010, along with the United States Air Force's Hickam Air Force Base, the facility was merged to form Joint Base Pearl Harbor‚ÄìHickam. Pearl Harbor is the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on Sunday 7 December 1941 brought the United States into World War II. Overview Naval Station Pearl Harbor provides berthing and shore side support to surface ships and submarines, as well as maintenance and training. Pearl Harbor can accommodate the largest ships in the fleet, to include dry dock services, and is now home to over 160 commands. Housing, personnel, and family support are also provided and are an integral part of the shore side activities, which encompasses both permanent and transient personnel. Because Pearl Harbor is the only intermediate maintenance facility for submarines in the Middle Pacific, it serves as host to a large number of visiting submariners. The Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific (NCTAMS PAC), Wahiawa, Hawaii is the world's largest communication station. The headquarters site of this shore command is located in the central section of the island of Oahu, approximately three miles north of Wahiawa. History 1899‚Äì1941 Following the annexation of Hawaii, Pearl Harbor was refitted to allow for more navy ships. In May 1899, Commander John F. Merry was made naval representative with authority to transact business for the Navy Department and its Bureaus. He immediately assumed control of the Coal Depot and its equipment. To supplement his facilities, he was assigned the Navy tug and two coal barges. Inquiries that commenced in June culminated in the establishment of the \\"Naval Station, Honolulu\\" on 17 November 1899. On 2 February 1900, this title was changed to \\"Naval Station, Hawaii\\". The creation of the Naval Station allowed the Navy Department to explore territorial outposts. In October 1899, and Iroquois made extensive surveys and sounding of the waterways to Midway and Guam. One of the reasons for these explorations was to select a possible cable route to Luzon. A coal famine and an outbreak of the bubonic plague were the only two incidents that hindered the Commandant from fulfilling his duties. Because of the severe coal shortage in September 1899, the Commandant sold coal to the Oahu Railway and Land Company and the Inter- Island Steam Navigation Company, Ltd. Although this indicated the affinity of economic ties with the Navy, it was to a certain extent counteracted by the quarantine of the naval establishment from December 1899 to February 1900, because of the bubonic plague. Approximately 61 deaths were recorded in Honolulu for this period. Work was consequently delayed on nascent Navy projects in Honolulu Harbor. From 1900 to 1908, the Navy devoted its time to improving the facilities of the that constituted the naval reservation in Honolulu. Under the Appropriation Act of 3 March 1901, this tract of land was improved with the erection of additional sheds and housing. Improvements included a machine shop, smithery and foundry, Commandant's house and stables, cottage for the watchman, fencing, 10-ton wharf crane, and water-pipe system. Pearl Harbor was dredged and the channel enlarged to accommodate larger ships. On 28 May 1903, the first battleship, , entered the harbor for coal and water. However, when the vessels of the Asiatic station visited Honolulu in January 1904, Rear Admiral Silas Terry complained that they were inadequately accommodated with dockage and water. Under the above Appropriation Act, Congress approved the acquisition of lands for the development of a naval station at Pearl Harbor and the improvement of the channel to the Lochs. The Commandant, under the direction of the Bureau of Equipment, attempted to obtain options on lands surrounding Pearl Harbor that were recommended for naval use. This endeavor was unsuccessful when the owners of the property refused to accept what was deemed to be a fair price. Condemnation proceedings, under the Hawaiian law of eminent domain, were begun on 6 July 1901. The land acquired by this suit included the present Navy Yard, Kauhua Island, and a strip on the southeast coast of Ford Island. The work of dredging the coral reef that blocked Pearl Harbor progressed rapidly enough to allow the gunboat to proceed to the upper part of Main Loch in January 1905. One of the early concerns of the growing station was that the Army would make claims on its property. Because of their facilities, as wharves, cranes, artesian wells, and coal supplies, many requests were made by the Army for their use. By February 1901, the Army had made application for the privilege of establishing on Navy docks movable cranes for handling coal and other stores, a saluting battery and a flag staff on the naval reservation, and an artesian well of its own. All these requests were rejected by the Bureau of Equipment on the theory that, once granted, they \\"will practically constitute a permanent foothold on the property, and end in dividing it between the two Departments, or in the entire exclusion of the Navy Department on the ground of military expediency as established by frequency of use.\\" However, the Army Depot Quartermaster at Honolulu contracted for the sinking of an artesian well on the Naval Station with the Commandant's approval, who, in turn, acted on a recommendation of the Bureau of Yards and Docks. The flow of water obtained amounted to over 1.5 million gallons per day, sufficient for all purposes of the Army and Navy. The Bureau of Equipment felt that its word of caution was justified when the Depot Quartermaster in 1902 let it be known that any water used by the Navy from the artesian well was \\"only given by courtesy of the Army\\". Opening of Dry Dock No.1 in 1919. Despite the warnings of the Bureau of Equipment, the War Department, the Department of Labor and Commerce, and the Department of Agriculture had secured permission to settle on the naval reservation. By 1906, the Commandant believed that it was necessary for the Bureau of Yards and Docks to develop a policy on the future of the station. The docks were being used to a greater extent by the Army transports than by Navy ships, and the Army was actually attempting to get possession of Quarantine Wharf (which was built by the Territorial Government on the Naval Reservation, with the understanding that it could be taken over at any time by the Navy Department upon the payment of its appraised value). In 1903, the Department of Labor and Commerce received about for an Immigration Station. The Department of Agriculture had, in the meanwhile, secured part of the site intended for a hospital as an experimental station. The Commandant felt that, if the station was going to develop beyond a mere coaling depot, these territorial encroachments on the part of other departments should be stopped, particularly when they were enjoying the benefits of naval appropriations. \\"On the other hand,\\" he wrote, \\"if it is the intention to improve Pearl Harbor and eventually abandon this station every effort should be made to begin work there as soon as possible... I am informed that important commercial interests will make a strong effort next year to have Pearl Harbor improved, and I think that will be an opportune time for the Navy Department to make efforts in the same direction.\\" In 1908, the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard was established. The period from 1908‚Äì1919 was one of steady and continuous growth of the Naval Station, Pearl Harbor, with the exception of the discouraging collapse of the drydock in 1913. The Act of 13 May 1908 authorized the enlargement and dredging of the Pearl Harbor channel and lochs \\"to admit the largest ships,\\" the building of shops and supply houses for the Navy Yard, and the construction of a drydock. Work on the dock started on 21 September 1909. In April 1910, the barquentine Amaranth became the fourth deep-sea, cargo- carrying vessel to venture into the newly dredged harbor, having been preceded by the three-masted schooner W.H. Marston on 8 March, and the schooner Ariel and bark Marston a few days later. Amaranth delivered materials for construction of the dry dock facility. Work progressed satisfactorily on all projects, except the drydock. After much wrangling with Congress to secure an appropriation of over three million dollars for its construction, the drydock was wrecked by \\"underground pressure\\". \\"On February 17, 1913, the entire drydock structure rumbled, rocked, and caved in.\\" The drydock was ceremonially opened to flooding on 21 August 1919, by Mrs. Josephus Daniels, wife of the Secretary of the Navy. In 1917, Ford Island in the middle of Pearl Harbor was purchased for joint Army and Navy use in the development of military aviation in the Pacific. As the Imperial Japanese military pressed its war in China, concern over Japan's intentions caused the U.S. to begin taking defensive measures. On 1 February 1933, the U.S. Navy staged a mock attack on the base at Pearl Harbor as part of a preparedness exercise. The attack \\"succeeded\\" and the defense was deemed a \\"failure\\". Sunday 7 December 1941 sinking during the attack. Aircraft and midget submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy under the command of Admiral Chuichi Nagumo began bombing Honolulu at the U.S. naval base. Through earlier code breaking activity, the Americans had determined that an attack was likely to occur. However, while the Americans failed to discover Japan's target location, it was believed that the Philippines was the most likely target.At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor, Gordon Prange (1981), At 06:05 on 7 December, the six Japanese carriers launched a first wave of 183 aircraft composed mainly of dive bombers, horizontal bombers and fighters. thumb The Japanese struck American ships and military installations at 07:51. The first wave attacked airfields of Ford Island. At 08:30, a second wave of 170 Japanese aircraft, mostly torpedo bombers, attacked the fleet anchored in Pearl Harbor. The battleship was hit with an armor-piercing bomb which penetrated the forward ammunition compartment, blowing the ship apart and sinking it within seconds, killing 1,177 crew members. The overall death toll was 2,467 people: 2,403 American citizens‚Äî2,335 members of the U.S. military and 68 civilians‚Äîand 64 members of the Imperial Japanese Navy.Pearl Harbor Facts Five U.S. battleships were sunk and the other remaining three were badly damaged. Overall, nine ships of the U.S. fleet were sunk and 21 ships were severely damaged. Three of the 21 would be irreparable. 188 U.S. aircraft were completely destroyed and 159 others were damaged. Japan lost 29 out of the 353 aircraft they attacked with. The attack on Pearl Harbor was the largest attack committed by foreign nationals on American soil in peacetime and in general prior to the September 11 attacks. The first shots fired were from the destroyer on a midget submarine that surfaced outside of Pearl Harbor; Ward sank the midget sub at approximately 06:55, about an hour before the attack on Pearl Harbor. West Loch Explosion, 1944 Just after 3 p.m. on Sunday 21 May 1944 an explosion in a staging area for Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs) and other amphibious assault ships in West Loch leading to a fire which quickly spread among the ships being prepared for Operation Forager, the invasion of the Japanese-held Mariana Islands. Over the next 24 hours, six LSTs sank, 163 naval personnel died and 396 were injured. A subsequent Naval Board of Inquiry never determined the exact cause of the disaster. But it concluded the initial explosion was caused when a mortar round aboard detonated during an unloading operation because it was either dropped or went off when gasoline vapours ignited. The incident ‚Äì together with the Port Chicago disaster two months later ‚Äì led to major changes in weapon handling practices within the United States Navy. Post-World War II years Over the years, Pearl Harbor remained a main base for the US Pacific Fleet after World War II along with Naval Base San Diego. In 2010, the Navy and the Air Force merged their two nearby bases; Pearl Harbor joined with Hickam Air Force Base to create Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. From 1932 to 1983 the most recognizable structure on the submarine base was the 100-foot-tall Escape Training Tank. A similar tower on Ford Island was converted to an airport control tower during World War II and still stands. Generations of submariners learned to escape in up to 80 feet of water using buoyant ascent, and were trained in the use of the Momsen lung or Steinke hood. The Steinke hood was replaced by the Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment in the 2000s. Bloch Arena located on the base is still in use today and hosted the collegiate Pearl Harbour Basketball Invitational and was home to the Honolulu Chiefs of the American Basketball League. The address is 224 A Avenue, Honolulu, HI 96818. National Historic Landmark USS Bowfin is now a museum at Pearl Harbor. The Navy base itself was recognized on 29 January 1964 as a National Historic Landmark district and with the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. Within its bounds, it contains several other National Historic Landmarks associated with the attack on Pearl Harbor, including the Arizona, , and . As an active Navy base, many of the historic buildings that contributed to the NHL designation are under threat of demolition and rebuilding. Vessels Surface ships presently homeported s (9)     * s (1) * Submarines presently homeported , and at the submarine base, in April 2018. s (10)      * s (6)    As part of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Navy announced in early 2006 that it would shift 60% of its attack submarines to the Pacific by 2010. USS Missouri , now a museum ship, docked at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor ' (\\"'Mighty Mo\\" or \\"Big Mo\\") is a United States Navy , and was the fourth ship of the U.S. Navy to be named in honor of the U.S. state of Missouri. Missouri was the last battleship built by the United States, and was the site of the surrender of the Empire of Japan which ended World War II. Missouri was ordered in 1940 and commissioned in June 1944. In the Pacific Theater of World War II she fought in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa and shelled the Japanese home islands, and she fought in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. She was decommissioned in 1955 into the United States Navy reserve fleets (the \\"Mothball Fleet\\"), but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan, and provided fire support during Operation Desert Storm in January/February 1991. Missouri received a total of 11 battle stars for service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf, and was finally decommissioned on 31 March 1992, but remained on the Naval Vessel Register until her name was struck in January 1995. In 1998, she was donated to the USS Missouri Memorial Association and became a museum ship at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

It is often abbreviated as ’Ä‘±‘ø or HAK, in keeping with its Armenian spelling, but it is occasionally referred to as the ANC in English-language media, including in its official website. From 2008 to 2013 it was a coalition of 13 opposition parties. In 2013, when certain member parties left the Pan-Armenian National Movement, the remainder of the organization collectively decided during a conference to form a new party called the Armenian National Congress.ANC turns into Armenian National Congress partyPANM becomes Armenian National Congress party Formation and goals The website of the Armenian National Congress lists five main goals: In addition, the ANC also believes in maintaining good relations with Armenia's neighbors, including normalizing relations with both Turkey and Azerbaijan, developing closer relations with the Middle East, self- determination of the Republic of Artsakh, encouraging further European integration of Armenia and deepening cooperation with the European union, the United States, Russia and maintaining strong relations with CIS member states. History 2008 merge The Impeachment Union party was officially dissolved in 2008 as members opted to join the ANC. 2011 protests During the 2011 Armenian protests, the HAK played a major role in organizing demonstrations and pushing for the government of President Serzh Sargsyan, who defeated Ter-Petrosyan in the 2008 election, to accept the demands of protesters. The death of 10 supporters of Ter-Petrosyan as a result of protests that followed Sargsyan's disputed victory are a major rallying point for protesters. Relations between the HAK and Heritage, a fellow opposition party, have historically been rocky, with differences in tactics during the 2011 protests widening the rift. 2012 parliamentary election After the 2012 parliamentary elections Armenian National Congress gained 7 seats in the National Assembly of Armenia.http://res.elections.am/images/doc/060512.pdf 2015 Armenian constitutional referendum In the 2015 constitutional referendum in Armenia, the ANC supported the \\"no\\" camp.

Plot Two filmmakers try to create a film venturing on the life of Jos√© Rizal. Before they do that, they try to investigate on the heroism of the Philippine national hero. Of particular focus is his supposed retraction of his views against the Roman Catholic Church during the Spanish regime in the Philippines which he expressed primarily through his two novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. The investigation was done mainly by \\"interviewing\\" key individuals in the life of Rizal such as his mother Teodora Alonso, his siblings Paciano, Trinidad, and Narcisa, his love interest and supposed wife Josephine Bracken, and the Jesuit priest who supposedly witnessed Rizal's retraction, Vicente Balaguer. Eventually, the two filmmakers would end up \\"interviewing\\" Rizal himself to get to the bottom of the issue. Production In 1997, director Mike de Leon had been working on a film project on the life of Jose Rizal with Cinemax Studios. Along the way, he invited screenwriter Clodualdo del Mundo Jr. to collaborate with him in the project. Problems during production eventually led to the project being scrapped, though it would later be completed by director Marilou Diaz-Abaya as the 1998 film Jose Rizal. Despite this, de Leon and Del Mundo decided to proceed with producing an independently financed film on Jose Rizal. The duo tried to conceptualize on a film different from that of the original film project they worked on. De Leon created his first draft of the script in the English language, while Del Mundo would translate the script in the Filipino language and add some revisions.

Members of the FRB who viewed the pre-release screening on November 9, 1999 noted that the film brought hope that the local film industry will still be able to excel as the new millennium unfolded. Reception The film has been critically praised for its unique depiction on the life of Jose Rizal. Those who viewed the film at the FRB pre-release screening noted that the film managed to make a difficult subject \\"accessible, comprehensible and even exciting\\" and presented itself in a manner that the younger audience could relate to. Film critic Nestor Torre views the film as an \\"artistic triumph\\" and believes that it would generate discussion among its viewers on Rizal's status as a hero. In 2004, the New York-based film magazine Film Comments included the film in its list of 10 Best Films in Alternative Cinema. Despite receiving critical acclaim, it was not able to earn well financially when it was first released to Philippine theaters in a limited run. It was re-released in 2000, but was soon pulled due to its poor performance. Accolades The film won six of 13 awards at the 23rd Gawad Urian in 2000, namely Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Joel Torre), Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Music. Aside from these, it was also nominated for Best Screenplay, Best Actor (Cris Villanueva), Best Supporting Actor (Ed Rocha), Best Production, and Best Editing. The film also got three nominations from the Film Academy of the Philippines, namely Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Daria Ramirez), and Best Editor.

Discovery  Optical lift is a component of force imparted from uniform light. First CP1 fabricated flying carpets The ability of light to apply pressure to objects is known as radiation pressure, which was first postulated in 1619 and proven in 1900. This is the principle behind the solar sail, which uses light radiation pressure to move through space. A 2010 study by physicist Grover Swartzlander and colleagues of the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York shows light is also capable of creating the more complex force of \\"lift\\", which is the force generated by airfoils that make an airplane rise upwards as it travels forward. This study was published on December 2010 in Nature Photonics journal. Swartzlander predicted, observed and experimentally verified at a micrometer-scale that when applying a beam of laser light to a semi-cylindrical refractive rod, it automatically torques into a stable angle of attack, and then exhibits uniform motion. The experiment began as computer models that suggested when light is incident on a tiny object shaped like a wing, a stable lift force is applied to the particle. Then the researchers decided to do physical experiments in the laboratory, and they created tiny, transparent, micrometer-sized rods that were flat on one side and rounded on the other, rather like airplane wings. They immersed the lightfoils in water and bombarded them with 130 mW infrared laser light from underneath the chamber. Radiation pressure pushes the particles along the direction of propagation, this is called the scatter force, but the excitement came when the particles were forced to the side in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagating light. The transverse force on the particles is the lift force. The researchers discovered not only that the rods experienced stable lift, but that, depending on refractive index, the rod could have up to two stable angles of attack it rotated to when exposed to the laser light. Symmetrical spheres tested did not exhibit this same lift effect. In optical lift, created by a \\"lightfoil\\", the lift is created within the transparent object as light shines through it and is refracted by its inner surfaces. In the lightfoil rods a greater proportion of light leaves in a direction perpendicular to the beam and this side therefore experiences a larger radiation pressure and hence, lift.  Potential uses  Using optical lift to steer solar sails The 2010 discovery of stable optical lift is considered by some physicists to be \\"most surprising\\". Unlike optical tweezers, an intensity gradient is not required to achieve a transverse force. Many rods may therefore be lifted simultaneously in a single quasi-uniform beam of light. Swartzlander and his team propose using optical lift to power micromachines, transport microscopic particles in a liquid, or to help on self-alignment and steering of solar sails, a form of spacecraft propulsion for interstellar space travel. Solar sails are generally designed to harness light to \\"push\\" a spacecraft, whereas Swartzlander designed their lightfoil to lift in a perpendicular direction; this is where the idea of being able to steer a future solar sail spacecraft may be applied. Swartzlander said the next step would be to test lightfoils in air and experiment with a variety of materials with different refractive properties, and with incoherent light.

He was born in Dublin, the son of Sir Jonas Greene, who was Recorder of Dublin from 1822 until his death in 1828, and his wife, the leading actress Marianne Hitchcock, daughter of Robert Hitchcock (died 1809) and his wife Sarah. Robert was an author and playwright, who was deputy manager of the Theatre Royal, Dublin: he is best remembered for his book An Historical View of the Irish Stage. Sarah Hitchcock like her daughter was a very popular actress on the London and Dublin stages.Published by R. Marchbank, Dame Street, Dublin 1788 Richard graduated from the University of Dublin, where he was auditor of the College Historical Society. He was called to the Bar in 1814 and became King's Counsel in 1830. As a young barrister he attended (without a brief) the hearing of R. v Waller O'Grady, a much publicised case of quo warranto concerning the power of patronage of Standish O'Grady, the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, who had sought to appoint his younger son Waller to the office of Clerk of the Pleas in the Court of Exchequer. Greene co-wrote an account of the case which he published , and which gained him some favourable attention.Greene, Richard Wilson Report of the proceedings...at the suit of the King v Walter O'Grady Dublin 1816 In 1831 he was the first person to be appointed to the new position of Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,Casey, James The Irish Law Officers Round Hall Sweet and Maxwell 1996 which ranked below the two senior law officers, but was nonetheless a very onerous Crown office. The choice of Greene for the position was an interesting one since he was generally regarded as a political opponent of the Government of the day.Hart, A.R. The History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland Four Courts Press 2000 He became Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1842 and was Attorney-General for Ireland briefly in 1846. He was raised to the Bench as Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1852 and served on that Court until shortly before his death in 1861. He married Elizabeth Wilson, daughter of Thomas Wilson of Fulford, North Yorkshire in 1819, and took her surname as well as his own. He made his reputation as an advocate with an impressive closing speech for the Crown at the trial of Daniel O'Connell in 1844. According to Elrington Ball his appointment to the Bench was due to the personal regard which Lord Derby, the Prime Minister, had for him.Ball, F.

Uusi Suomi is Finnish for \\"New Finland\\", the name adopted by this Finnish block settlement. The homesteaders found an area in Saskatchewan near Qu'Appelle River which resembled the homeland of Finland both in geography and climate. The earliest settler arrived in 1888, and was followed by Finnish immigrants from Finland as well as from the iron ore mines of Minnesota and Dakota regions in the United States. The centre of the New Finland district consisted of a church, hall, and schoolhouse. Finland was undergoing profound changes following Tsar Nicholas II's February manifesto which was a main factor initiating the Great Exodus from Finland. The Canadian Pacific Railway along with Canadian immigration minister Clifford Sifton were advertising both abroad and in the United States encouraging settlement to Canada's \\"Last Best West\\". The community which arose had strong religious beliefs and celebrated Finnish cultural traditions. History David Jeremia Kautonen was the first Finnish settler to arrive at the New Finland district in 1888, setting up a homestead on southwest quarter section of township 36 range 17 west of the second Meridian. According to C.D. Hendrickson, immigration agent for the Canadian Pacific Railway, there were only three families living in the New Finland District in the spring of 1891. By 1882, the nearby town of Whitewood, Provisional District of Assiniboia, North-West Territories was a major stop on the C.P.R. Kautonen had been joined by John Lauttamus and Matti Mutamaa. The C.P.R. immigration department then encouraged Finnish settlers of the Minnesota and Dakota region in the United States to emigrate to Canada. With this in mind, delegates from the American Finnish districts traveled to New Finland, North West Territories and were well pleased with what they had surveyed. As a result, several Finnish settlers of the United States abandoned their employment in the iron ore mines and immigrated to the New Finland District. The three families who originally came to the area wrote letters back to friends and family still residing in Finland, describing the settlement and urging them to come to Canada. Soon the New Finland district had swollen to 50 people. A letter to the Dominion of Canada Minister of the Interior was written February 15, 1900 by Samuel Kivela and Thomas Karppinen clergyman requesting information about settlement prospects in Canada. This letter was in response to articles placed in the Finnish newspapers by the United States who wished to discourage settlement in Canada. The Canadian Department of the Interior responded promptly, and advised that the Finnish newspapers would soon have reports directly from agents from Finland who had traveled from Finland to inspect Canada first hand. Many of these new immigrants were \\"Church Finns\\" with strong religious beliefs. By 1893 they had established their religious institution, the St. John Suomi (Finnish) Lutheran Synod; in 1907 they built their church. By 1899, a Finnish consul found the population close to 250 persons. The community had erected both a church and two schools, New Finland School District 435 in 1896 and Nurmi Oja SD #1416 in 1906. In 2010, around 200 people identify themselves as part of the New Finland district. Immigration The years between 1870 and 1930 are sometimes referred as 'the Great Migration' of Finns into North America. There are several factors which resulted in immigration of Finns to Saskatchewan. Push factors refer primarily to the motive for emigration from the country of origin, which usually involves its history. The ‚ÄúFebruary manifesto‚Äù of Tzar Nicholas II in 1899 merged the army of Finland with that of Russia which resulted in mandatory army training. Other cultural freedoms were being usurped during this time which violated the constitution of Finland. Pull factors towards Canada were largely of extensive advertisements done by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The C.P.R. was undertaking the transcontinental railway, and was looking at settling the Prairie Provinces, rather than running a rail line through a barren plain. All lands east of the provisional districts of Saskatchewan and Assiniboia were taken. Immigration Minister Clifford Sifton adopted the motto, \\"The Last Best West\\" and supported immigration by passing The Dominion Lands Act offering a free quarter section for a $10 registration fee. Applicants just had to prove up the land with a three-year residence. Enticing immigrants to Canada offset low internal migration, and developed its natural resources. Immigration agents targeted continental European farmers who would make stable and lifetime settlers as grain farmers in the western frontier. Economic migration and labour migration show a profound difference in wage rates. As J.K. Lauttamus sums it up, in 1890, he arrived in New Finland with $15.00 CAN in his pocket. He worked his land from sun up to sun down and, by 1899, he had $1,600, a home, stables, horses, cattle, land and agricultural implements. He was very happy in the new land and could not even imagine where in Finland he would have been able acquire such possessions. $15.00 would be around $230 in today's market, and $1,600 would be equivalent to about $40,000 after inflation. (The Canadian dollar and the American dollar were worth the same until 1914.) One consequence of immigration was the change in surname. The lengthy, hard to pronounce and hard to spell, Finnish names did not serve well in English dealings. Kurkim√§ki was often shortened to M√§ki, Ahonen to Aho, and Saarinen to Saari. Demographics The population of the New Finland district was enumerated as a portion of the rural municipality RM of Willowdale No. 153. New Finland is also location in the RM of Rocanville, that information should be updated Geography New Finland is a district in the Qu'Appelle valley, the south eastern part of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Uusi Suomi is Finnish for New Finland, the name adopted by this Finnish block settlement. The district is north Wapella. It is northwest of Whitewood, Saskatchewan, and south of Yorkton. The Manitoba border is located just to the east. Esterhazy, New Stockholm and Tantallon are other neighbouring settlements. The district is located in the rural municipality of Willowdale. The Dominion Land Survey description of New Finland District's location are sections within Township (Tsp) 16, 17, 18 at Ranges 32, 33 West of the First meridian and sections within Tsp 16, 17, 18 within Ranges (Rge) 1,2 West of the Second Meridian. The centre of the district consisting of church, hall, and schoolhouse was Section 36 Tsp 17, Rge 1 West of the 2nd Meridian. New Finland is located in the north eastern section of the topographical area named Wood Hills to the north of Moose Mountain and south of the Qu'Appelle River. New Finland is situated in the Melville Plain of the Aspen Parkland ecoregion. Economy The Finnish settlers found an area which was still wooded and had historically escaped the many grass fires which blanketed the great plains. The homesteaders found an area which resembled their homeland both in geography and climate. Qu'Appelle River and Round Lake were nearby water areas, for a community used to a land of lakes. Suomi translates to \\"the people and the land of the marshes\\". They were able to bring many of the farming customs of Finland to the new country. They ploughed the land with oxen, harvested with scythes, and threshed it with flails. The Finns were also excellent cattlemen. For sustenance, fish was plentiful from the streams and rivers as were various species of wild game. Many settlers would add an extra room to the sauna to keep the chickens warm through the cool winter months. The families were self-sufficient on the land, trapping, hunting, completing garments of skins and hides, picking berries, canning and baking. Settlers would travel into town, a trip which took 24 hours by horse, selling logs for any additional provisions they may need. In the early 1900s the community saw a store, blacksmith, sawmill, grist mill, and shingle making enterprises spring up. The Clayridge post office was part of the New Finland district. Climate New Finland has a humid continental climate, with extreme seasonal temperatures. It has warm summers and cold winters, with the average daily temperatures ranging from in January to in July. Annually, temperatures exceed on an average in late July Typically, summer lasts from late June until late August, and the humidity is seldom uncomfortably high. Winter lasts from November to March, and varies greatly in length and severity. Spring and autumn are both short and highly variable. On July 5, 1937 an extreme high of was recorded, and on January 12, 1916, a record low of . Education Education was provided firstly in two one-room school houses, and in a few years, six schoolhouses served the district and then ten. New Finland, Nurmi Oja, and Convent Creek were geographically situated within the district. Many of the students spoke the Finnish language, and needed to be instructed to learn English. The settlers assembled October 26, 1896 to construct New Finland School District 435. The ten schools serving pupils of the district were: Carnoustie SD #309 (1895‚Äì1959), Deerwood SD #465 (1898‚Äì1962), Forest Farm SD #90 (1889‚Äì1957), Grove Park SD #518 (1899‚Äì1966), Woodleigh SD #1023 (1905‚Äì1959), Hopehill SD #1519 (1906‚Äì1965), Nurmi Oja SD #1416 (1906‚Äì1958). And again on November, 1925, the community assembled to arrange for the construction of Convent Creek 4640 which was operational between 1926 and 1961, followed by Elliott SD #4742 (1928‚Äì1962), and Cranbrook SD #4753 (1937‚Äì1963). After these one room school houses were closed, students would be bussed into the larger urban communities of Rocanville, Wapella or Whitewood for their education. Arts and culture The community established a lending library early in its pioneering days. \\"Suomalainen uskoo sanan voimaan\\" is a Finnish proverb which translated means that a Finn believes in the power of the word. The Finnish valued literacy and initiated the building of both school and library to encourage education. Many pioneers after building their distinctive Finnish log houses with the square corner finishing architecture would erect a sauna, steam sauna or a savu, smoke sauna. Vihtas, or switches were employed to open up the pores. \\"Jos ei sauna ja viina ja terva auta niin se tauti on kuolemaksi\\"; \\"If sauna, liquor and tar salve won't make you well, death is imminent.\\" The sauna was valued for cleanliness and became a weekly gathering with men bathing together, then women, then children. Food was brought, and a generally good time was held by all. Another custom which was adopted in the New Finland district was to establish a \\"temperance society\\" as was popular with many Finnish settlements. With the outlawing of alcohol, the community would prosper on the new frontier which presented challenges of its own without the problems of drunkenness. The New Finland district does celebrate St. John's Day with their annual Juhannus - Celebration of Summer. As part of the festivities a traditional bonfire, kokko, may be lit. This picnic and community gathering is held on the Saturday nearest to June 24 each year. Two particularly large celebrations were in 1988, the communities' centennial year, and another 1993, the centennial year of the St. John's Finnish Synod Evangelical Lutheran Church. In this way descendants of the original Finnish homesteaders who remain in the New Finland district still retain some aspects of their Finnish ethno-cultural heritage. The hall built in the community supported regular, theatrical performances and sports events. Music was supplied by accordion and mouth organ. Points of interest St. John's New Finland Lutheran Church, with an active congregation, was officially declared a municipal heritage property on May 4, 2007. The church building was built in 1907, and then the community moved it in 1934 by steam engine to the present location south of the original construction site. This arduous undertaking necessitated sawing the church in half. The seam can still be seen where the church was rejoined. In 1993, a book, The Finns of New Finland 1888‚Äì1993, was published in recognition of its centennial, and in 2003, the Finns celebrated the church's 110 anniversary.

Biography Fagan was born on New Year's Day, January 1, 1851 in Dublin, Ireland and emigrated to the United States with his parents as a child. After being educated in public schools, Fagan became a blacksmith's apprentice. In 1872, Fagan partnered with Issac Mansfield to form Architectural Iron Works, a manufacturing company which provided structural and decorative iron. He served as a volunteer fireman, and became interested in politics. Fagan was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1888 and served two terms. While an Assemblyman, Fagan became known for his proposal to split Hudson County by allowing the northern towns to secede and form a new Hamilton County. Fagan was a co-founder and part owner of the \\"Hoboken Observer\\" newspaper in 1893, which later became the \\"Hudson Observer\\" He was indicted by a grand jury in 1899. He died on May 9, 1921 at his home on 1000 Hudson Street, Hoboken, NJ.  Political Career  Fagan first entered politics as the Democratic candidate for the NJ House of Assembly in 1888. His opponent was William Letts. During his first term, he was a member of the committees on ways and means, municipal corporations, unfinished businesses, State Library, and Soldier's Home. Fagan was part of a movement to divide Hudson county into two parts, naming the southern half \\"Hamilton County\\" after Alexander Hamilton. He was re-elected in both 1889 and 1890.

Fagan Iron Works Following his partnership with Issac Mansfield, Lawrence Fagan became the proprietor of the Fagan Iron Works, a prominent foundry located initially in Hoboken, and later relocated to Jersey City. Fagan Iron Works supplied many of the characteristic architectural iron store fronts in Hoboken, as well as iron railings for brownstone and tenement buildings. As of 1897, The Fagan Iron Works were located at 309 Jefferson Street, in Hoboken. Later, the Fagan Iron Works were moved to Jersey city, located on two square blocks under what is now the ramp from Route 1&9 and Rt. 78 entering the Holland Tunnel.

The Kauri Museum is in the west coast village of Matakohe, Northland, New Zealand. The museum, to the south of the Waipoua Forest, contains many exhibits that tell the story of the pioneering days when early European settlers in the area extracted kauri timber and kauri gum. The museum has over 4000 sq metres of undercover exhibits, including the largest collection of kauri gum in the world, and the largest collection of kauri furniture. It has a model of a 1900s kauri house with furniture and models in the dress of the early years, and an extensive collection of photographs and pioneering memorabilia. On the wall, there are full-scale circumference outlines of the huge trees, including one of 8 metres, larger even than Tane Mahuta. The museum includes a working mock-up of a steam sawmill. It tells its story from the colonial viewpoint, and presents its representation of the kauri gum industry as part of the process of creating the New Zealand identity. It has little to say about negative aspects, such as the impact on the MƒÅori people. The Kauri Museum has however helped raise awareness of the need to conserve the remaining forest through a display of photographs by the conservationist Stephen King, presented in partnership with the Waipoua Forest Trust.

As well as having crew members assigned certain duties, pirates found a way to reduce conflict among themselves and maximize profits. They used a democratic system, spelled out by written ‚Äúarticles of agreement,‚Äù to limit the captain's power and to keep order on board the ship. Roles and duties on a pirate ship The captain was elected by all the men in the crew and could be replaced by a majority vote by the same. Cowardly or brutal captains were quickly voted out of their position.Ossian, Robert. \\"Roles and Duties On Board a Ship.\\" Pirate's Cove. http://www.thepirateking.com/historical/ship_roles.htm (accessed November 27, 2010). Captains were expected to be skilled and dependable seamen. They were also expected to be bold and decisive leadersOssian, Robert. \\"Roles and Duties On Board a Ship.\\" since they made the most important decisions including how to engage a target, how to pursue prey, how to escape the authorities and how to deal with an attack. In the latter situations, there was no time for taking a vote and settling conflicting opinions.Leeson, Peter T. An-arrgh-chy: The law and economics of pirate organization. The Journal of Political Economy 115 (6) (Dec. 2007): pp. 1049-1094 The quartermaster had the same authority as a captain (except during battle). The crew elected him to represent their interests. He commanded the crew during absence of the captain. His other jobs included keeping order, settling conflicts between crew members and determining the amount of food and drink distributed to each crew member. The sailing master oversaw the navigation and sailing of the ship. Often, because of their skills, they were forced into service for pirates. The boatswain took care of the boat by supervising supplies, inspecting the ship every morning and reporting the condition of the ship to the captain. He also supervised deck activities including the handling of the sails and the weighing and dropping of the anchor. The carpenter, under the boatswain and quartermaster's directions, repaired the ship. Sometimes, the carpenter would also be the surgeon on the ship. The master gunner ensured that the cannons and weapons were in working order. The mate (often there were first and second mates) usually worked under the ship's master, boatswain, gunner or carpenter as an apprentice. Mates also outfitted the ship with ropes, pulleys, sails and other rigging as needed. Other roles The common sailor would be familiar with the rigging, sails and the steering of the ship. They kept watches and handled cannons during battle. A rigger worked the running rigging and furled and released sails. Young boys or men on a pirate ship were often servants known as cabin boys. During battles, powder monkeys ran gunpowder from below deck to cannon crews and also relayed messages. Organization on board Watches were kept all day long. There was a larboard (left side) watch and a starboard (right side) watch; the quartermaster ran one watch, the sailing master the other. Most watches were 4 hours long except for the two dog watches, which were two hours long. The shorter watches prevented crew members from ending up with the same watch day after day.Little, Benerson. The Buccaneer's Realm: Pirate Life on the Spanish Main, 1674-1688. (Washington, D.C: Potomac Books, 2007), 233 The quarter bill, which listed duties in battle, was written before any battles took place and posted in a public place on the ship. During an actual battle, most of the crew stayed flat on their stomachs, under cover, until the time came to engage with the target, with the exception of those commanding and sailing the vessel. Once the target was close enough, the captain often remained on the quarter-deck, poop-deck or near the tiller. The sailing master, boatswain and mates managed the sailing of the vessel while the rest of the crew handled small arms or took responsibility for the cannons. A gun crew was responsible for two cannons, one on the starboard and its opposite cannon on the larboard). Ship's boys carried cartridges and gunpowder up to the deck.Little, Benerson. The Buccaneer's Realm: Pirate Life on the Spanish Main, 1674-1688. 233-234 Articles of agreement Pirate articles were based on the chasse-partie created on buccaneer ships in the 17th century. The chasse-partie determined the division of plunder among the crew as well as other rules. 18th-century pirates built upon this concept and created their own version of \\"Articles of Agreement.\\" Before setting out on their expedition, pirates wrote their articles alongside the election of a captain or quartermaster. The articles needed the consent of every crew member, and ‚Äúall [pirates] swore to ‚Äòem‚Äù sometimes on a Bible or whatever was at hand.Leeson, Peter T. An-arrgh-chy: The Law and Economics of Pirate Organization. During the election of a new captain, men who wanted another leader often drew up separate articles and sailed away from their former crew- mates. Pirate democracy was flexible but unable to deal with long-term dissent from the crew.Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death\\": The Social World of Anglo-American pirates, 1716 to 1726. The William and Mary Quarterly 38 (2) (Apr. 1981), 212 One description of the ritual of the pirate's code was in Alexandre Exquemelin's Buccaneers of America, published in 1678. Pirates called a first council (which included all crew members) to decide where to get provisions. Then they raided for supplies. Afterward, food rations were determined (with the captain receiving no more than any man). A second council decided on the articles of agreement, which were put in writing.Cordingly, David. 1996. Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates. (New York: Random House, 1996.), 96-97 These articles of agreement served four purposes: *They specifically designated shares of the plunder for each crew member. Shares of the plunder were spelled out on the basis of each crew member's skills and duties. Captain and quartermaster typically received one and a half or two shares; gunners, boatswains, shipmates, carpenters, and doctors typically received one and a quarter or one and a half shares, and all others one share each.Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 210 Some of the plunder went into a \\"common fund\\" to provide for severely injured men (who had lost their sight or their limbs). This, in turn, promoted loyalty among the crew because they knew they would be taken care of.Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 211 If the value of the plunder was questionable, they would sell it before dividing the money among themselves. This prevented conflict between crew members and also prevented the quartermaster from hoarding the most valuable items. *The articles prohibited activities that would cause conflict between crew members, such as excessive drinking, gambling, stealing and bringing women (or boys) on board. Some, like Bartholomew Roberts' articles, also prevented crew members from settling arguments with duels while on board the ship. *They outlined punishments for various offenses. Punishments included marooning, whipping, slitting of ears and noses, and for severe crimes, death. *They created rules for the general safety of the ship. Usually, articles also required members to keep their weapons in good working order. Also, since fire was especially dangerous on ships, some pirate articles forbade activities such as firing guns or smoking in areas of the ship that carried flammable goods, such as gunpowder. Articles also described incentives like bonuses for productive crew members and thus prevented each man from allowing everyone else to pick up the slack. Two examples of pirate articles In 1723, a man named John Phillips and four companions seized a schooner owned by William Minott of Boston. They named the ship the Revenge, chose officers and swore to their articles on a hatchet, since they did not have a Bible: Anything not covered in the articles would be settled by crew members, who would act as a type of judiciary body to interpret the articles and apply them to the situations not found in the articles. For the most part, pirates strictly followed their articles. It appears that ‚Äúpirates were more orderly, peaceful and well-organized among themselves than many of the colonies, merchant ships, or vessels of the Royal Navy.‚Äù Counter-culture to normal maritime life and labor Piracy was usually voluntarily chosen, and it was a way of life that challenged the society pirates left behind. Most pirates came from the lowest social classes and went out to sea in search of a better life as well as loot and treasure.Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 204, 208 As well as these pragmatic and economic reasons, the ‚Äúspirit of revolt against common oppressors,‚Äù the oppressors being the governments and societies of nations, helped create pirate democracy. Pirate democracy was a counter-culture, created by common sailors, to the traditional organization of maritime life and labor.Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 127 On most merchant and Navy vessels, there was a hierarchy with captains holding the highest authority, then officers and at the bottom, ordinary sailors. On these ships, a captain had complete control over every aspect of life on his ship, including the division of food, wages, labor assignment and discipline. Thus, it was easy for a captain to become abusive and use his authority to take advantage of his crew. John Archer who sailed with Edward Teach said before his execution explained his stint as a pirate: ‚ÄúI could wish that Masters of Vessels would not use their Men with so much Severity, as many of them do, which exposes us to many Temptations.‚ÄùRediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 218 Colonel Benjamin Bennet wrote of pirates to the Council of Trade and Plantations in 1718: ‚ÄúI fear they will soon multiply for so many are willing to joyn with them when taken.‚Äù Sailors on seized ships joined pirates because of the appealing ‚Äúprospect of plunder and ‚Äòready money,‚Äô the food and the drink, the camaraderie, the democracy, equality, and justice, and the promise of care for the injured.‚ÄùCordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 136 Another appeal of piracy came in the limiting of the captain‚Äôs power over the crew. Pirate Francis Kennedy puts it succinctly: ‚Äúmost pirates, ‚Äòhaving suffered formerly from the ill-treatment of their officers, provided carefully against such evil‚Äô once they arranged their own command.‚ÄùRediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 209 Thus, pirate democracy came with a series of check and balances that protected the rights of the crew. Checks and balances Piratical checks and balances proved quite successful. According to Captain Charles Johnson, owing to the institution of the quartermaster, aboard pirate ships \\"the Captain can undertake nothing which the Quarter-Master does not approve. We may say, the Quarter-Master is a humble Imitation of the Roman Tribune of the People; he speaks for, and looks after the Interest of the Crew.\\" The dual executive was a distinctive feature of pirate organization.Rediker, Marcus. Under the Banner of King Death, 210 A quartermaster, along with the captain, was elected by the crew. The presence of the quartermaster divided the immediate authority on the ship into two, so one man couldn't have complete control over the crew. Also, the captain had to keep in mind that he only ruled because his crew allowed him to. A captain could be pulled from his position by a majority vote of the crew for various reasons, including: cowardice, poor judgment, abusive or controlling behavior (called predation) and other behavior that the crew believed infringed on their interests. The captain also lived like the rest of the crew; he had no privileges in lodgings or food and drink. However, the ultimate, highest authority on the ship was the pirate council, a group that included every man on the ship. The council determined where to go for the best prizes and how arguments were to be resolved.Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù210 Also, discipline was dealt out on the basis on \\"what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company [believed] fit.\\" Pirates took their democracy beyond their ship as well. Upon seizing a prize, pirates administered the \\"distribution of justice\\" and asked the crew of the captured ship about their Captain's nature. If the crew complained that their Captain had been cruel, the pirates tortured and then executed the captain. A kind captain was often released and rewarded.Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 215-216 Brotherhood on the seas For the most part, Western pirates did not prey on one another and were always willing to help out fellow pirates. For example, in April 1719, Howell Davis and his crew sailed into the Sierra Leone River, alarming the pirates commanded by Thomas Cocklyn until they saw the Jolly Roger. After a while, they saluted each other with cannon. Other crews ‚Äúoften invoked an unwritten code of hospitality to forge spontaneous alliances.‚ÄùRediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 219 The Jolly Roger, the most famous symbol of every pirate's experience of death, violence and limited time on Earth, was used to terrify targets but also to identify fellow pirates.Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 222-223 Pirate fraternity was further expressed by threats and acts of revenge against nations targeting pirates.Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death,‚Äù 220 The dream of Libertalia Also see: Libertatia ‚ÄúPirates and other social bandits adopted social mechanisms which can be summarized as libertarian, democratic, federal, egalitarian, fraternal, and communal. It may well be argued that these 'floating commonwealths' are examples of a form of pre-Enlightenment radicalism.‚Äù They were also far less conscious of national, religious and racial differences than what was common.Johnson, David E. Review: Of Pirates, Captives, Barbarians, and the Limits of Culture. American Literary History 14 (2) (Summer 2002): pp. 358-375. Even women, like the pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read, as could enjoy the freedoms of life aboard a pirate ship.Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea. (Atlanta;Kansas City, Mo.: Turner Pub. ; Distributed by Andrews and McMeel, 1996.), 135 In the 2nd volume of A General History of the Pyrates (published 1728), Captain Charles Johnson tells the tale of Captain Mission and his pirates, who established a utopian republic on the island of Madagascar. They called it ‚ÄúLibertalia,‚Äù where societies would be based on the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity. Mission's pirates were determined to guard the common people's rights, fight the power of monarchies and allow people to make and judge their own laws and elect and rotate their leaders. They chose a council without distinguishing between nationality or race. They opposed labor and condemned slavery. The tale goes that Mission and his men integrated slaves from captured ships into their society as well.Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 125-126 However, Captain Mission and Libertalia probably never existed except as an expression of the ‚Äúliving traditions, practices and dreams of an Atlantic working class, many of which were observed, synthesized and translated into discourse by the author of A General History of Pyrates‚Ä¶[which also included] utopian practices of the early 18th century pirate ship.‚ÄùCordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 126-127 Nevertheless, in 1713, English pirates Thomas Barrow and Benjamin Hornigold did proclaim themselves the governors of a tangible pirate republic on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. They were joined by pirate captains like Charles Vane, Thomas Burgess, Calico Jack and Blackbeard. However, this republic was soon eliminated in 1718, by Captain Woodes Roger with his appointment as the Royal Governor of the Bahamas.Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 111-112 The English ruling class recognized the influence of Libertalia and its alternative social order, and they soon put their efforts into quashing it. There were worries of a pirate ‚ÄúCommonwealth‚Äù (such as the one Barrow and Hornigold set up), especially one in areas where no nation would be able to fight them.Cordingly, David.

Archaeological investigations of the household serve as a microcosm for the greater social universe. The household serves as a space for socialization processes. Household archaeology focuses on the household as a social unit, and involves research on the household's dwelling and other related architecture, material culture, features, and larger sociopolitical organizations that are associated with a specific culture. Household social relationships have been associated as serving as an \\"atom\\" for society.Yanagiasako, Sylvia (1979), Family and Household: The Analysis of Domestic Groups. Annual Review of Anthropology, 8: pp. 161-205, Annual Reviews. Therefore, household studied effectively convey information pertaining to flexible economic and ecological conditions Household activity encompasses spheres of activity related to function and how people act. Household archaeology redefines the notion of the household and the domestic by challenging notions of what households are, how they operate and the social implications of such analysis. The material culture provides information about such activities. Households are families, domestic groups, and co-habitations. Households function in a variety of fashions. History of Theoretical Background Household archaeology involves investigations of household activities. It encompasses social formation processes, family or co- residential organization and the material culture associated with such activities. Scholarly inquiry into household studies began in the 1960s with research emphasis upon a micro-scale analysis of social groups.Bender, Donald (1967), A Refinement of the Concept of Household: Families, Co-Residence and Domestic Functions. American Anthropologist 65(5): pp. 493-504, Blackwell. Households are commonly referred to as the most basic social unit. Households operate within social and economic processes aimed to structure general conditions of social life. \\"Household\\" and \\"family\\" are social phenomena. According to Bender, these constructions are \\"logically distinct and, under certain circumstances, vary independently of each other.\\" The household has three elements: the social (demographic), the material (possessions and dwellings) and the behavioral (activities).Wilk, Richard and William Rathje (1982), Household Archaeology. American Behavioral Scientist, 25(6): pp.617-639. Household membership employs a variety of strategies and behaviors. Household archaeology is concerned with the material culture remaining from basic activity patterns as a result of human behavior. Archaeological implications The material record thoroughly represents the intimate spaces of everyday life. It challenges how to formulate questions about everyday experiences. How people construct and interact with the world around them provide material evidence of a specific worldview.Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/worldview Based on the Random House Dictionary, ¬© Random House, Inc. 2010. The household consists of the social (demographic and relationships of its members), the material aspect (dwelling and structures), and the behavioral aspect (activities it performs). A household can be considered as ‚Äúa corporate body organized by reference to shared practices and [a] common estate.‚Äù Robin, Cynthia (2003). New Directions in Classic Maya Household Archaeology. Journal of Archaeological Research 11(2): 307-356. Religion, rituals and social activities are often organized at the household level and reinforced by habitual actions through time. Human agency also affects conceptions of household ideology. Scientific inquiry within household archaeology is a balance between theoretical arguments and empirical data to support or refute the evidence. Household archaeology is a platform for examining inequality. Whether gender, social or material, inequality exists in archaeological analysis. General topics Defining the household The term \\"family\\" today implies a kinship tie, while domestic groups are associated with function and co-residence simply implies shared dwelling space. A household can be any of these. Household function is concerned with production, consumption, reproduction and socialization. These functions can be interpreted archaeologically. Domestic chores have historically been associated with a gendered division of labor and tasks associated with maintaining the household chores and child rearing. Gender Historically, a presumed gendered binary exists associating men with the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù sphere and women with the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù sphere. This often is explained by the historical division of labor in hunter-gatherer societies where men were responsible for food procurement of large game and women were responsible for child-rearing and gathering plant food sources. Friedrich Engels argued that the sexual division of labor was an \\"outgrowth of nature\\" because men went to war, and hunted while women cared for the house and prepared food.Moore, Henrietta (1988). Kinship, Labour and Household: Understanding Women‚Äôs Work. Feminism and Anthropology, pp. 43-72. University of Minnesota Press: Minneapolis. This argument is unacceptable today. Women are engaged in productive, active work inside and outside the home all over the world. Anthropological inquiry into the sexual division of labor in the domestic domain began with Ester Boserup's work on women and economic development. A universally assumed Western division between the ‚Äúdomestic/house/private‚Äù space versus the ‚Äúpublic/exterior male world‚Äù exists. This launched a structured division between gendered social worlds. Women have made a substantial contribution to subsistence activities and household production. The structured system of social relationships also implies an ‚Äúidealized‚Äù gendered identity associated with a public vs. private dichotomy. Political actions and socioeconomic motivations aid male and female actions in domestic groups.Hartmann, H. (1981) Family as the Locus of Gender, Class and Political Struggle: The Example of Housework. In Signs 6(3): 366-394. The mother-child relationship is often associated with the nucleus of all family groups. Reproduction involves physical reproduction, child rearing and socialization. Households can be organized to collectively achieve these tasks. Gender themes resonate as a result of this action. Household studies of space and place often involve function and activity. Site layouts, and conceptions of households provide information about gender roles in the past. Household space The dwelling itself serves as a material, functional space. The house serves as a \\"privileged entity\\" for studying intimate spaces of inside space.Bachelard, Gaston (1994) 'The House, From Cellar to Garret, The Significance of the Hut'. In The Poetics of Space, translated by Maria Jolas, Pp.3-37. Orion Press: New York. Storage space can assess a socially constructed identity. This process allows groups to apply spatial and social meaning to control knowledge.Hendon, Julia A. (2000) Having and Holding: Storage, Memory, Knowledge, and Social Relations. In American Anthropologist 102(1): 42-53. Alternatively, discard behavior reflects how acquisition and use reflects patterns of daily life.LeeDecker, Charles (1994) Discard Behavior on Domestic Historic Sites: Evaluation of Contexts of Domestic Household Consumption Patterns. In Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, 1(4): pp. 345-375. Particular spaces within the dwelling itself are reserved to accomplish household tasks. For example, the kitchen is reserved for cooking and the bedroom is reserved for sleeping. However, not all cultures adhere to such traditions. Methodology Multiple lines of evidence prove to be most useful in household archaeological studies. Human settlement patterns, site formation processes, and material culture help to organize household studies that bridge theoretical and methodological interpretations of archaeological assemblages. Botanical, Faunal assemblage, ceramic, privy, historical documents, art history, and refuse data provide information for methodological applications of household archaeology. Household Archaeology employs a dynamic interaction between theoretical and practical. Applications of ‚Äúlongue dur√©e,‚Äù an Ethnohistory approach are suggested as a method for household anthropological Archaeology. Joyce employed such methods in examining the socialization processes for Aztec children.Joyce, Rosemary (2000). Girling the Girl and Boying the Boy. In Human Lifecycles, World Archaeology. 31(3): 473-483. Household archaeology encompasses the space outside the dwelling itself. New scientific analysis allow households to be examined using new techniques such as soil chemistry, bone chemistry, and Paleoethnobotany. Uniquely preserved examples allow archaeologists to examine households carefully and devise new techniques for analysis.

It is the smallest atoll in Micronesia, with a total surface of only 13 km¬≤ and a land mass of less than 1 km¬≤. Namoluk is part of the Eastern Islands or Upper Mortlock Islands group, located about 185 km to the SE of Chuuk and 50 km NW of Etal Atoll. History Prior to European colonialism in Micronesia, Namoluk was allied with Ettal, Oneop, and Moch in wars against Lukunoch, Satawan, Kuttu, and Ta. Occasionally Namoluk would also ally with Nama to battle against Losap. Such alliances shape modern-day sense of identity and community among the different island communities. The first documented contact of the Namoluk atoll by westerners was in 1827 when Captain Richard Macy sailed by the atoll on the whaleship Henry. The next year, the explorer Fyodor Litke made first foreign contact with the locals aboard the Senyavin. In his account he reported that the locals approached his ship using their canoes and asked if they could explore the ship. Litke and the locals parted on good terms, and whalers and traders started using Micronesian waters more. Culture Food and diet Prior to the introduction of imported trading goods in the early twentieth century, the people of Namoluk relied on the Pacific Island diet of seafood, fruits such as coconuts and breadfruit, and taro. Occasionally islanders would supplement this with pork, chicken, or sweet potato. The Japanese introduced polished rice and canned fish during their colonial reign, and US exporters introduced other canned meats and turkey tail during the 1960s.

He was the founder of the large law firm in Downtown Baltimore, Weinberg and Green (originally named Weinberg and Sweeten). He was once a resident of the Reservoir Hill Community near Druid Hill Park in Baltimore and former Special States Attorney for Baltimore City. Early life and career Weinberg was a self-taught stenographer at the age of 15. He left school (Baltimore City College High School) to take a job as a typist for an uncle who was a court reporter. He was known as one of the youngest members of that profession. By the time Weinberg was 18, he had begun his own court reporting business. For the next 12 years, Weinberg worked as the official court reporter to the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City. He was also in the pool of stenographer at the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore when President Woodrow Wilson was nominated. Later career Weinberg's public service career spanned over 70 years. Weinberg graduated from the University of Maryland School of law in 1919. After graduation, he co-founded Weinberg and Sweeten (later changing its name to Weinberg and Green). Philanthropy, Zanvyl Krieger was amongst the names of lawyers who practice at the firm. It was the first large law firm in the state of Maryland to include both Jewish and Christian partners. In the 1930s he filed one of the earliest damages lawsuits against a labor union; he was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention held in Chicago in support of Governor Albert Ritchie of Maryland nomination. In 1936 he successfully argued to the Supreme Court on behalf of Harry Marks Clothing Company in the case upholding the constitutionality of the National Labor Relation Act. Also on Weinberg's list of public duties includes: radio personality to acquaint the public with recent changes in law; former president of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation and Phoenix Club; and member of the board at Old Phoenix Hospital (now named Sinai Hospital).

It also has appended to it a list of 22 successive Grand Masters of the Knights Templar after de Molay, ending in 1804, the name of Bernard-Raymond Fabr√©-Palaprat appearing last on the list (who revealed the existence of the Charter in 1804). The document is written in a supposed devised ancient Knights Templar Codex. Actually in Freemason custody, the document is kept at the Mark Masons Hall in London. Based on analysis of the deciphered code as well as of the circumstances of the finding of the charter, most researchers have concluded that it is a forgery. An English translation of the Larmenius Charter was published in 1830.  Contents  In the document, Larmenius, then a very aged man in his 70s, states that the Grand Mastership of the Knights Templar Order was verbally transmitted to him ten years earlier (March, 1314) by the imprisoned Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. Larmenius was a Palestinian-born Christian who became a member of The Order of the Temple during the waning years of the Crusades. He was later the Templar Preceptor on the island domain of Cyprus after the Templar exodus from the mainland of the Holy Land to Cyprus after the fall of Acre in 1295. In this position, Larmenius was left in charge as Templar Seneschal (second highest rank in the Order) of the large remaining \\"exited\\" Templar forces in the Mediterranean in 1305 when de Molay was tricked into coming to Paris for meetings with Philip IV of France and the Pope Clement V. In the document, Larmenius states he has become too aged to continue with the rigorous requirements of the Office of Grand Master, and \\"transfers\\" his Grand Mastership of the Templar Order to Franciscus Theobaldus, the Prior of the Templar Priory still remaining at Alexandria, Egypt. With this declarative Charter, Larmenius protects the Order for perpetuity by continuing the legitimate line of Grand Masters of the Templar Order, which continues the \\"Second Phase\\" of the Order through the \\"Dark Period\\" through to its semi- private unveiling at the Convent General of the Order at Versailles in 1705 by Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, elected Grand Master of the Templar Order, and later also Regent of France.  History  The Charter has long been suspected to be a forgery - it was suggested it was the work of a Jesuit named Father Bonani, who assisted Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans in 1705 to fabricate the document, to re-establish the 'Societ√© d‚ÄôAloyau' (\\"Society of the Sirloin\\"), who claimed to be a continuation of the Knights Templar, and also an attempt to gain recognition with the Order of Christ in Portugal. This Order was dissolved in 1792 during the French Revolution by the death of its Grand Master, the Duke Timol√©on de Coss√© Brissac, massacred at Versailles. An item of his furniture was bought by Brother Ledru, the son of Coss√© Brissac's physician, whereupon he discovered the Charter of Larmenius hidden inside it, and showed it to Fabr√©-Palaprat in 1804. Revised and enlarged by Robert I. Clegg. With supplemental volume by H.L. Haywood. Peter Partner believes the document was fabricated by Ledru.  The code  While the charter actually is written in some code, a number of researchers have claimed that the codex, once deciphered, appears to be a more modern, scholarly Latin, and not ecclesiastical Latin used during the period of its supposed origin.

The launch occurred on 8 October 2012 at 00:34:07 UTC.  History  In May 2012, it was reported that the Falcon 9 had been transported to Cape Canaveral. The Dragon CRS-1 arrived on 14 August 2012. On 31 August 2012, a wet dress rehearsal (WDR) was completed for the Falcon 9, and on 29 September a static fire test was completed; both of these tests were completed without the Dragon capsule attached to the launch vehicle stack. The mission passed its Launch Readiness Review (LRR) on 5 October 2012. The launch occurred on 8 October 2012 at 00:34:07 UTC and successfully placed the Dragon spacecraft into the proper orbit for arriving at the International Space Station with cargo resupply several days later. During the launch, one of the nine engines suffered a sudden loss of pressure 79 seconds into the flight, and an immediate early shutdown of that engine occurred; debris could be seen in the telescopic video of the night launch. The remaining eight engines fired for a longer period of time and the flight control software adjusted the trajectory to insert Dragon into a near-flawless orbit.  Mission timeline   Flight day 1, launch (8 October)  The SpaceX CRS-1 Falcon 9 launches on 8 October 2012. The mission plan, as published by NASA before the mission, called for the Falcon 9 to reach supersonic speed at 70 seconds after liftoff, and pass through the area of maximum aerodynamic pressure, \\"max Q\\" ‚Äî the point when mechanical stress on the rocket peaks due to a combination of the rocket's velocity and resistance created by the Earth's atmosphere ‚Äî 10 seconds later. The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight when the Falcon 9 would nominally be high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after ‚Äî an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into low-Earth orbit. Forty seconds after second- stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's grapple fixture.  Flight day 2 (9 October)  The mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular coelliptic orbit.  Flight day 3 (10 October)  As Dragon chased the International Space Station, the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra- high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission. During the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by Mission Control Houston and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close- range guidance systems, composed of LIDAR and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the position ‚Äî the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were go for the capture of Dragon. At that point, Expedition 33 crewmember Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's robotic arm, known as Canadarm2, reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC. Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander Sunita Williams of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's Harmony module. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's Common Berthing Mechanism at 13:03 UTC. The opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.  Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October)  Cupola on 14 October 2012. Over a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth. After its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer Kevin Ford used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the release point, and release the vehicle. The Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. It takes about 30 minutes for Dragon to reenter in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, about off the coast of southern California. The Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, have then be jettisoned. The SpX-1 capsule seen back at a port on 30 October 2012. The landing was controlled by automatic firing of its Draco thrusters during the atmospheric reentry. In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual drogue parachutes deploy at an altitude of to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. The full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the three main parachutes, each in diameter, at about . While the drogues detach from the spacecraft, the main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately . Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still permit a safe landing. The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a crew boat for telemetry operations, and two rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. Onboard are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore. SpaceX technicians opened the side hatch of the vehicle and retrieved the time-critical items. The critical cargo items were placed on a fast-boat for the trip back to California for eventual return to NASA that then took care of the precious science cargo and handle the post-flight analysis of the samples. The rest of the cargo was unloaded once the Dragon capsule reached SpaceX's test facility in McGregor, Texas.  Payload  The Dragon spacecraft being integrated onto Falcon 9 on 30 September 2012.  Primary payload  When launched the CRS-1 Dragon was filled with about of cargo, without packaging. Included was of crew supplies, of critical materials to support the 166 experiments on board the station and 66 new experiments, as well as of hardware for the station as well as other miscellaneous items. The Dragon returned of cargo, without packaging. Included was of crew supplies, of scientific experiments and experiment hardware, of space station hardware, of spacesuit equipment and of miscellaneous items.  Secondary payload  For some months prior to the launch, a prototype second- generation Orbcomm satellite was planned to be launched as a secondary payload from Falcon 9's second stage. Although the secondary payload made it to the Dragon insertion orbit, an engine anomaly on one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage during the ascent resulted in automatic engine shutdown and a longer first-stage burn on the remaining eight engines to complete orbital insertion while subsequently increasing use of propellant over the nominal mission. The primary payload contractor, NASA, requires a greater- than-99% estimated probability that the stage of any secondary payload on a similar orbital inclination to the International Space Station will reach their orbital altitude goal above the station. Due to the engine failure, the Falcon 9 used more propellant than intended, reducing the success probability estimate to approximately 95%. Because of this, the second stage did not attempt a second burn, and Orbcomm-G2 was left in an unusable orbit and burned up in Earth's atmosphere within 4 days after the launch.Orbcomm craft falls to Earth, company claims total loss Both SpaceX and Orbcomm were aware, prior to the mission, of the high risk that the secondary payload satellite could remain at the lower altitude of the Dragon insertion orbit, and that was a risk that Orbcomm agreed to take given the dramatically lower cost of launch for a secondary payload.  Launch attempts   Falcon 9 engine anomaly  Video of the launch of SpaceX CRS-1 Falcon 9 During the ascent, 79 seconds after launch, an engine anomaly occurred with one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX has emphasized for several years that the Falcon 9 first stage is designed for \\"engine out\\" capability, with the capability to shut down one or more malfunctioning engines and still make a successful ascent. In the event, the SpaceX CRS-1's first stage shut down Engine no. 1, and as a result continued the first-stage burn on the remaining eight engines longer than usual at a somewhat reduced thrust to insert the Dragon spacecraft into the proper orbit. Although unintended, this was the first inflight demonstration of Falcon 9's \\"engine out\\" design, and \\"provides a clear demonstration of the engine out capability\\". In response to the anomaly, NASA and SpaceX jointly formed the CRS-1 Post-Flight Investigation Board. Preliminary information from the post-flight review board indicates that the Engine no. 1 fuel dome, above the nozzle, ruptured but did not explode. The burning fuel that exited before the engine was shut down caused the fairing rupture, as seen in the flight video recordings. Subsequent investigations revealed in a Congressional hearing pinpointed the issue as a result of an undetected material flaw in the engine chamber jacket, likely introduced during engine production. During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber. This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure. As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of Engine no. 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.

In 1864 a battalion of veteran volunteers of the \\"Irish Seventh was consolidated with a sister Irish regiment, the 30th Missouri Volunteer Infantry (the \\"Shamrock Regiment\\") and operated as a \\"demi-brigade\\" known popularly as the \\"Missouri Irish Brigade\\" Service The 7th Missouri Infantry Regiment was organized at St. Louis, Missouri, in June 1861 and mustered in for three years service. It was often referred to as the \\"Irish Seventh\\" given the large number of Irish immigrants who were enlisted in its ranks.Enlistment in the \\"Irish Seventh\\" was apparently encouraged by Captain Patrick E. Burke, a respected Irish immigrant and veteran St. Louis Militia officer. Burke had been 1st lieutenant of the \\"Washington Blues\\" (aka \\"Captain Kelly's Company) a popular ethnically Irish militia company in ante-bellum St. Louis. He resigned over the issue of secession and joined the Federal 1st Missouri Volunteers. Joseph Ward Tucker, editor of the secessionist Missouri State Journal, publicly criticized any St. Louis Irish who might follow Burke's public call for other Irish to join the expanding Federal forces. The regiment was a special project supported by the Federal commanders in Missouri, Brigadier General William S. Harney and Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon.In a May 15, 1861, letter to Secretary of War Simon Cameron, General Harney wrote: \\"I think that it is of utmost importance that an additional regiment, consisting exclusively of Irishmen, should be raised in St. Louis. It will at once settle matters in St. Louis and do away with the prejudice against the Government troops [i.e., Missouri volunteers in Federal service], which consist almost exclusively of Germans.\\" Missouri Troops in Service During the Civil War, Dept of War, Record and Pension Office, Washington, 1902 p123 Most of the volunteers in Missouri's early regiments were German immigrants, and Lyon supported the creation of a regiment recruited from St. Louis' Irish-American population to demonstrate that the Union cause in Missouri had support beyond the German-American community. Many St. Louis Irish (the second largest immigrant community in the city) were ambivalent about the new Republican Party and Federal military action against seceding states. In addition, Irish Americans were strong participants in the pre-war Missouri Volunteer Militia, and many resented the May 10, 1861 Federal arrest of the Militia for suspected secession activity. The 7th Missouri was intended to attract ethnic-Irish support by focusing on the Irish community's \\"ownership\\" of the regiment, and make a public political statement by demonstrating that there were Irish Unionists in Missouri.Ironically, a second Celtic influenced regiment was established at the same time by accident. The 8th Missouri Volunteers (also known as the \\"American Zouaves\\") was recruited at the same time to demonstrate \\"native American\\" support for Unionism beyond the German community in the same way the 7th Missouri was to show Irish support. However, large numbers of Irish joined the \\"American Zouaves\\", causing some writers to describe the Eighth Missouri as the \\"Irish Zouaves\\". Like other ethnically Irish regiments during the Civil War, the \\"Irish Seventh\\" carried a distinctive green regimental color. An article in the July 12, 1862 Boston Pilot described the flag, stating that on one side the flag featured the: \\"Irish harp, guarded by a savage-looking wolf dog, surrounded by a wreath of shamrocks, surmounted by an American eagle, and supported on either side by flags and other implements of war. A golden halo shoots out and over the whole. On the other side is a 'sunburst' in all its glory, with the Irish war cry as a motto - 'Faj an Bealac![sic]\\"Rodgers, Thomas G, Irish- American Units in the Civil War, Oxford, UK, Osprey Publishing, 2008, p10The motto on the Seventh Missouri's colors is a variant transliteration of the Gaelic war cry Faugh A Ballagh which is usually translated as \\"Clear the Way!\\" and was used by numerous Irish-American units on both sides of the Civil War.

In seals, the mites can be both prevalent (almost every single seal has them) and abundant (more than 1000 mites per seal). Although clinical observations and gross examination indicate that O. attenuata parasitization alone is not serious, some erosion and inflammation of the nasal turbinates and nasopharynx in seals has been observed in histological sections. If concomitant parasitization with O. attenuata and O. diminuta occurs, alveolar emphysema and more serious ailments can threaten the life of the mammal. Morphology Mature mites are shown to be elongated in the posterior part of body to form a club-shape with the rounded posterior extremity. Ten to twelve transverse rows of 8 to 12 sharp denticules and a few rows of minute spines are present on the ventral surface of the capitulum and the posterior surface of coxa III, respectively. Transmission The usual mode of host-to-host transmission by Orthohalarachne is thought to be accomplished by active larvae that crawl or are sneezed from one animal to another. Both males and females are relatively non-motile and have well developed claws from maintaining their position in the nares. Prevalence and pathology There is almost 100% prevalence of infestation of the nasal mite in the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) on the Pribilof Islands. Mucosal erosion was observed in the nasal turbinates as well as the nasopharynx. Based on clinical observation, the effects of the mite are of minor impairment, however, heavy infection have been shown to lead to more serious problems, such as impairment of respiration, lesions in the lungs and secondary alveolar emphysema. Human incidences The first known human incidence of transmission from walrus to human happened at SeaWorld in San Diego, California. A 35-year-old Caucasian man recalled seeing the walruses spitting and snorting, and later feeling irritation in his eye. Three days after his visit to SeaWorld, the mite specimen was discovered and recovered from the lower part of his ocular iris. Pathological changes in the affected areas by the mites were a marked abrasion of the mucosa and destruction and necrosis of the deeply placed tissues by the action of the legs, palps and chelicerae of the mites.

This power source was incorporated in the Betacel-Biotronik heart pacemaker. The device was not widely adopted because of its limited lifespan and doubts over the use of radioactive material.

As the first (and only) viable betavoltaic power source ever developed, it was immediately used to power heart pacemakers. Betacel powered cardiac pacemakers were implanted in numerous patients in the 1970s. Biotronik GmbH & Co., Ingenieurburo, Berlin, adapted its chemical battery-powered pacemakers to accept the promethium-fueled Betacel battery. The Betacel powered Biotronik pacemakers were considered to have useful lives of 7 to 10 years.\\"Benefits and Risks of Promethium Battery-Powered Pacemakers,\\" R. Franco and M.L.

Original technology Betacels utilized Pm-147 beta sources that were combined with custom designed silicon p-n junctions. Operational configurations involved stacking unidirectional sources with Si p-n junctions in a series arrangement. The power output of the Betacel was approximately 400 microWatts. The power density of the battery was approximately 0.025 milliWatts per cubic centimeter. The battery itself was approximately one cubic inch in volume (16 cm3). Most of the volume was used for shielding, to contain the gamma radiation that was emitted from the Pm-146 contaminant within the Pm-147.\\"Betacel Nuclear Batteries for Biomedical Applications,\\" L.C. Olsen and S.E Seeman, 8th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference, Philadelphia, PA, page 451, August 13‚Äì17, 1973. These Betacel batteries presented an efficiency of approximately 4%. However, higher efficiency devices were in the development process utilizing bidirectional beta sources. These bi-directional source devices would have yielded efficiencies approaching 8%. Unfortunately, these higher efficiency devices were never realized since pacemaker manufacturers focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries which did not utilize radioactive material, and could power pacemakers for 5 to 7 years. Although previous betavoltaic devices degraded rapidly due to radiation damage, the Betacel showed no deleterious effects from radiation. The power levels decreased as expected. In particular, the battery power decreased exponentially with a half-life of 2.62 years, the same as that for Pm-147. Limitations and demise Pm-147 is not an ideal source since the half life is only 2.62 years and the contaminant Pm-146 emits gamma rays that require batteries to be well shielded. The material is toxic and not readily available. Moreover, at the time there was a certain stigma associated with the use of nuclear power and radioactive materials: the public was genuinely fearful and leery of any nuclear technology. This stigma, combined with advances in (and the lower cost of) lithium-ion battery technology, eventually overshadowed aspirations of a more lucrative future for the Betacel, relegating betavoltaic batteries to the realm of academic research in the years that immediately followed. Later developments in betavoltaic technology The Betacel did not last but it provided a foundation for future betavoltaic technology research and sparked a resurgence of interest in betavoltaic power generation. Other sources such as tritium have been considered and implemented in the development of betavoltaic batteries. Between 2001 and 2010, four commercial companies (City Labs, Inc., BetaBatt Inc., Qynergy, Inc. and Widetronix, Inc.) have ventured into betavoltaic power cell development, while university research on the subject is still actively being conducted. Rapid advances in semiconductor and materials science technology, integrated circuit design and fabrication, and micro- / nano-scale microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), have converged to the extent that extremely small devices with diminutive power requirements are becoming more and more routine. These devices are ideally suited for betavoltaic power sources that can easily and safely offer nanoWatt-to-microWatt power levels with enduring 20-year lifetimes.

On January 5, 2016, Pascal Paoli was transferred to the Maritime Corse M√©diterran√©e, a new entity succeeding SNCM following its takeover by the Corsican businessman Patrick Rocca. On February 3, after a technical stop at the Tunisian yards of Menzel Bourguiba, the ship arrived in Marseilles without any commercial markings. At the end of May 2016, the ship received the red livery of Corsica Linea, the trademark of the Corsican consortium Corsica Maritima which merged with the MCM. The ship departed Marseille for Bastia on May 25, 2016, for its first voyage under its new colors. Name The ship is named after Filippo Antonio Pasquale de' Paoli (6 April 1725 ‚Äì 5 February 1807), a Corsican patriot, statesman and military leader who was at the forefront of resistance movements against the Genoese and later French rule in Crsica. He became the president of the Executive Council of the General Diet of the People of Corsica, and also designed and wrote the Constitution of the state. Routes The Pascal Paoli operates between Marseilles and Bastia on the island of Corsica. The 220 nautical mile overnight trip takes 12 hours. Boarding by GIGN French GIGN special forces operating by air approach the SNCM ferry Pascal Paoli. On September 27, 2005, during the social unrest following the decision to privatize SNCM that owned and operated the ship, striking sailors of the Corsican Workers' Trade Union occupied the Pascal Paoli, docked at the seawall off the port of Marseille, with the plan to move the ship to Bastia. The commander was instructed to steer the ship to Corsica. After departure, Pascal Paoli was approached by military helicopters. The ship arrived in the vicinity of Bastia around 11 pm but did not approach, as the striking sailors wished, and spent the night a few cable lengths from port. In the early hours of September 28, after authorities had taken a decision overnight, members of the Hubert and GIGN commando, with five helicopters, took possession of the ship. The striking sailors did not resist, and the soldiers gained control of the ship. Under Navy escort, the ship was directed towards Toulon, where it docked in the enclosure of the naval base. The ship remained there until October 13, when it departed for Marseille in the evening.

He is the founder of JITEC, Vectoria Inc., TeliPhone Corp., and the New York Telecom Exchange Inc. Earlier in his career, Lalibert√© gained some notoriety in Quebec with JITEC, a public company which at its peak in 2000 had an estimated value of $CDN575 million. More recently, he invented several technologies in telecommunications, social media, and information technology (IT). Early years Beno√Æt Lalibert√© was born in Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Qu√©bec, Canada. He started his own business called Jitec in 1986 at the age of fourteen, building computer systems in his basement for friends and family. He dropped out of high school to work full-time on JITEC. After working at JITEC for several years as sole proprietorship, he incorporated the company in 1992 and began to sell computers, software and related components in Canada. The Growth of JITEC In 1994, Lalibert√© created Vectoria Inc., a portfolio of companies involved in software, information technology, and telecommunications. In conjunction with Vectoria, JITEC created the first electronic virus immune computer using its Electronic Virus Activity Control (EVAC) technology. EVAC was built into computer servers to immediately detect and prevent viruses. By 1996, JITEC had CDN$7 million in annual sales and 45 employees. This led to him winning the Young Entrepreneur of the Year award by the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC). In 1997, Lalibert√© created Windows Based Intelligent Terminals (WINBIT) and POWERVEC servers. He worked with Microsoft to develop the first generation of cloud computing services. In July 2000, JITEC was listed on the Montreal Stock Exchange after a successful IPO. At this point, Lalibert√©'s personal net worth was in excess of $345 million. Controversy JITEC was growing rapidly; its stock had jumped from CDN$3.80 in late July 2000 to CDN$11.65 in only a few weeks. This sudden success caught the attention of many, including multi-millionaire Herbert Black, who then became a friend and advisor to Lalibert√©. However, unbeknownst to Lalibert√©, Black had a well established history of profiting from the short selling of companies' stocks. Soon after becoming involved with Lalibert√©, Black allegedly began this process with JITEC. He reported Lalibert√© to the Quebec Security Commission (QSC) and accused him of insider trading and irregular transactions. He put immense pressure on the QSC to have a cease trade order issued against JITEC, which triggered an investigation. Meanwhile, JITEC stock was falling rapidly based on leaked information to the media. On Nov 10th, 2000, Paul Trudeau, principal investigator for the QSC in the case signed an affidavit required for the QSC to issue a personal cease trade order on Lalibert√© and an investigation was initiated. This resulted in his forced resignation as CEO the following day, the same day that Black had initiated a class action suit against JITEC, CIBC, Canaccord, and Lalibert√© himself for losses incurred with the drop in share price. However, at the same time Black was shorting the stock at $10 thereby benefitting from the stock's drop. In 2011, after conducting an extensive investigation, the CIBC filed as part of its defence, that Black himself alone was responsible for the drop in share price. July 2000: Benoit Lalibert√© at The Montreal Stock Exchange on JITEC's first day of trading. A small article in the Journal de Montr√©al in 2002 reported that Paul Trudeau, the QSC investigator, was reinstated after being arrested and subsequently fired for receiving a bribe of $1,000 from Herbert Black in 2000. Black, who had not disclosed to Trudeau the personal interests he had in the fall of the stock price, was revealed to have shorted the stock of JITEC through insider trading with privileged information. He had apparently manipulated the Commission des Valeurs Mobili√®res du Qu√©bec (CVMQ- now the Authorit√© des March√©s Financiers, AMF) in hopes of profiting from the downfall of the JITEC stock: he was short selling stocks while informing other investors of alleged irregularities in order to decrease its price (Black had been previously linked to a Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawyer and investigator, Dennis O'Keefe who was disbarred in 2005 based on conflict of interest charges from his 1995 investigation of Sumitomo Corp. for copper price fixing which resulted in a $150 million settlement in 1998). Black denied these allegations. When this was brought to the attention of Lalibert√©, he immediately filed a lawsuit against the QSC for a record-breaking $127 million in November 2003 on the basis that the QSC was complacent with Black in the demise of JITEC . It was later revealed that Laurent Lemieux, another senior QSC investigator involved in the JITEC case had leaked information on the investigation to the press and was also fired. In what some have viewed as retaliatory, subsequent to Lalibert√© launching the lawsuit the QSC initiated actions on securities infractions. The entire affair has been widely reported in Canadian media. On September 23, 2013, the Montreal newspaper La Presse published an article on Lalibert√©, which chronicled his business life since 2000. In October 2014 the case was settled for 9.85 million. A court-appointed claims administrator is currently in the process of dealing with all claims in the matter. Inventions Lalibert√©, through Investel Capital Corporation, currently holds several international patents and patents-pending. Among those are: Paid-to-View In 2013 Lalibert√© developed Paid-to-View, a patent- pending technology primarily for streaming content services such as Cable TV and IPTV whereby subscribers have the option to watch their television programs with a branded overlay provided by advertisers. Based on the length of time this overlay is used, advertisers provide incentives such as reduction of their telecommunications bill, discounts, and cash by check or prepaid credit card. Geolocation filters and demographics determine the overlay options and incentives provided. Investel filed for a patent for Paid-to-View in Canada under application number 2,917,948, in the US under serial number 14/993,661, and internationally under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, application number PCT.CA2014/050628.http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic- cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2917948/summary.htmlhttps://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=CA161865852https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2015003263https://www.google.com/patents/WO2015003263A1?cl=en iFramed In 2013 Lalibert√© invented iFramed, an online system for creating advertising campaigns on social media. This consists of a back office platform for the advertiser and a smartphone and tablet application which allows users to upload branded content onto their social media accounts. It also provides users with a permanent personal digital copyright watermark on their content. Users can then be paid for sharing this content on social media when they select an iFramed sponsor or advertiser and permit iFramed to overlay the sponsor or advertiser's logo or message on it. Once the content is posted, the user receives a financial credit to their iFramed account. iFramed users can also choose to support affinity groups such as charities, schools, local sports teams, and community initiatives by donating their credits automatically and instantly to these organizations. Investel filed for a patent for iFramed in Canada under application number 2,863,124, in the US under application number 502660891, and internationally under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, application number PCT/CA2014/050628. In June 2016 iFramed was granted patent number 2,887,596 in Canada.http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic- cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2887596/summary.htmlhttps://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=CA151361059https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2015100496https://www.google.com/patents/WO2015100496A1?cl=en In August 2016, Investel filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Canada against Snapchat for patent infringement related to the iFramed patent.http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/canadian-investment- fund-files-claim-against-snapchat-inc-for-patent-infringement-over- geofilters?__lsa=74e1-6eaf Internet Personal Communication Service (iPCS) In 2014, Lalibert√© developed the Internet Personal Communication System (iPCS), a Smartphone Over IP (SoIP) technology which uses data only to provide all voice and text services from a cloud-based platform. iPCS utilizes a thin client which interfaces with the cloud to provide enhanced security and access to all iPCS functionality. It operates seamlessly between Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE and can be used anywhere where wireless data is the available. The service is login-based and any iPCS subscriber can therefore use any phone with any iPCS SIM card to access their account and services. No user data or user profile information resides on the device as everything is stored in the iPCS cloud. iPCS uses generic and identical SIM cards, which are used only to provide access to its network, making the subscriber independent from any SIM, device, or network. Any iPCS-enabled device can be used by any iPCS subscriber via the login procedure, allowing for multiple profiles on a single device. Investel filed for six patents for iPCS in Canada under application numbers 2,910,654, 2,910,520, 2,871,283, 2,871,290, 2,871,249, and 2,871,247, and internationally under the Patent Cooperation Treaty number PCT/CA2015/051119.http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic- cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2910654/summary.htmlhttp://www.ic.gc.ca/opic- cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2910520/summary.htmlhttp://www.ic.gc.ca/opic- cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2871290/summary.htmlhttp://www.ic.gc.ca/opic- cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2871283/summary.htmlhttp://www.ic.gc.ca/opic- cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2871249/summary.htmlhttp://www.ic.gc.ca/opic- cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2871247/summary.htmlhttps://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2016074072https://www.google.com/patents/WO2016074072A1?cl=en iPCS was developed with the support of the Canadian Scientific Research and Experimental Development Program (SRED). It was launched in beta in October 2014. Other Projects  TeliPhone Corp.  TeliPhone Corp., founded in August 2004, is an Internet-based digital telecommunications company specializing in hosted business telephony systems that reduce customer capital equipment costs while offering global incoming and outgoing call services. With its own technology, it has developed its International IP-based telecommunications network.  The New York Telecom Exchange  In October 2008, Lalibert√© created the New York Telecom Exchange (NYTEX) which was based on the principles of a traditional commodity exchange. NYTEX was incorporated in the State of New York and Lalibert√© became its chief technology officer. He commoditized international termination, creating a reference quality for each market. This allowed telecommunications to be traded like oil or any other commodity with multiple and anonymous buyers and sellers on a neutral electronic platform. TeliPhone Navigata-Westel In December 2012, TeliPhone Corp. acquired Vancouver-based Navigata Communications 2009, Inc., a major provider of voice and data services with most of its operations in Western Canada. Now TeliPhone Navigata-Westel, it is one of the largest independent facilities-based Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLEC) in Canada. It provides services such as voice, data, Internet broadband, IT support, Cloud computing, and IPTV to carriers, business, government, and residential clients. In August 2014, following the successful restructuring of TNW, he announced that he was leaving the company to pursue other projects. Investel Capital Corporation In 2013, Lalibert√© helped to conceive Investel Capital Corporation (ICC), an investment fund based in Vancouver and Toronto which specializes in the acquisition of distressed or underachieving telecommunications companies for the purpose of financial turnaround. ICC also develops technology-based intellectual property. Companies acquired by ICC have access to ICC's resources and network infrastructure. This creates the conditions for increased margins through reduced costs via economies of scale, shared overhead, and management resources as well as lower costs through increased buying power.

At various times, the term referred to the territory which included Alexandrovsky and Kemsky Uyezds of Arkhangelsk Governorate and some parts of Olonets Governorate.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 25‚Äì27 The first references to Murmansk Krai date back to the period after the February Revolution when the power in the region was assumed by the Murmansk Soviet of the Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. On , 1917, the Soviet transferred all the power to the newly created Murmansk Provisional Revolutionary Committee; however, after the joint assembly of the Murmansk Soviet with the representatives of the local democratic organizations on , 1917, the Revolutionary Committee was dismissed and all power was returned to the Soviet. On February 18, 1918, the Arkhangelsk Governorate Congress of Deputies declared the town of Murmansk the center of Murmansk Krai, and in terms of self-government recognized its independence from Arkhangelsk Governorate. It emphasized that Arkhangelsk Soviet of Deputies has no authority over the Murmansk Soviet and that the latter is directly subordinated to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR. On May 2, 1918, the Council of People's Commissars considered a formal separation of Murmansk Krai from Arkhangelsk Governorate, and while the separation was found to be desirable, the final decision had been postponed. In June 1918, the Murmansk Krai Soviet reached an agreement with the representatives of the Allies, and the foreign armies disembarked on the krai's territory. On August 2, 1918, Soviet power fell in Arkhangelsk, and the Provisional Government of the Northern Oblast was established instead. On August 6, 1918, the Murmansk Krai Soviet authorized Chairman Yuryev to agree on the inclusion of Murmansk Krai (Alexandrovsky and Kemsky Uyezds of Arkhangelsk Governorate, a part of Olonets Governorate, and some other territories) into Northern Oblast. On September 15, 1918, the Provisional Government issued a resolution which accepted Murmansk Krai as a part of Northern Oblast. In October 1918, they also abolished all the soviets and restored zemstvos. On February 2, 1920, the Provisional Government of the Northern Region issued a resolution establishing Murmansk Governorate, which included Alexandrovsky and Kemsky Uyezds of Arkhangelsk Governorate and parts of Olonets Governorate. The governorate, however, proved to be short-lived and was abolished after the Soviet power on the Kola Peninsula was restored on February 21, 1920. Alexandrovsky and Kemsky Uyezds were restored in their 1917 borders.

Created and hosted by Scott Lewis and Gary Winter, the show was filmed in New York City from 1983 to 1986 and, at the invitation of cable access producer Jeff Krulik, in the Washington DC metro area, from 1986 to 1989. The show is notable for early appearances of bands such as the Butthole Surfers and the Beastie Boys (who appear with drummer Kate Schellenbach, later of Luscious Jackson). Other musical guests include the Ben Vaughn Combo, Raunch Hands, Half Japanese, Shockabilly, R. Stevie Moore, and Velvet Monkeys.\\"The Scott and Gary Show: Birthing Beastie Boys and Buzz Alike.\\" Black Book Magazine, December 11, 2009. As of July 2017 all The Scott and Gary Show episodes became available to view on Nightflight Plus.  A Chronological History of The Scott & Gary Show*  :Ben Vaughn Combo‚ÄîDecember 1983: The famous first episode of The Scott & Gary show, filmed in Black and White. Ben went on to write theme music for Third Rock and That '70s Show, and has worked with classic artists like Charlie Feathers, Joe South and Alan Vega. Features the original combo of Lonesome Bob on drums, Aldo Jones on stand-up bass and Gus on accordion. :Beastie Boys‚ÄîJanuary 1984: Little Beastie Boys and Girl (Kate Schellenbach of Luscious Jackson), during the era of ‚ÄúCookie Puss‚Äù mania. See the early stages of their charm in insightful interview. Driving them to the studio they went on about how they shouldn‚Äôt have to do small stuff like cable and that they were going to be big stars. Took us twenty years to figure out that one of the songs they performed, ‚ÄúEgg Raid on Mojo‚Äù was about them tossing eggs at a bouncer who wouldn‚Äôt let them into a bar. :¬Ω Japanese‚ÄîFebruary 1984: Prime ¬Ω Jap. Personal victory for S & G was getting these superstars. Brother David did not make the trip. With Don Fleming (Gumball) on guitar, the brilliant Jon Dreyfuss on sax and Mark Jickling on guitar. This was our Valentine‚Äôs Day Show, which gave Scott the opportunity to wear red. Sure laugh now, but back then red overalls looked pretty hip. :R. Stevie Moore‚ÄîApril 1984: The original home cassette artist (close to 250 releases), and son of Sun session man Bob Moore makes a very rare live appearance. The Nashville transplant weaves his cult like influence over all who require a daily dose of eccentric pop. About 1 hour after the taping this episode was available on cassette through Stevie‚Äôs mail order catalog! Talk about quick turnaround. :Raunch Hands‚ÄîApril 1984: New York Crunchabilly. Rip snorting stampede of roots rock and roll fueled by Alligator Wine. One of our favorite bands who actually opened for The Banshees at Radio City! A great bunch‚Äôo‚Äôguys who have had numerous releases. They later wound up living in Spain spreading that good ole‚Äô rock and roll religion. :Curtis A‚ÄîMay 1984: Recording for cool indie label Twin Tone, a native Minnesota-ian, and living in a comic book shop (no joke) made Curtis a natural for us. His disk was full of hard plucked electric guitar ditties with some out-there lyrics. Producing this episode was a wee tense. Twin Tone kept promising that Curtis was going to call. But he said he had lots of trouble finding a phone. The label rep said we have this other band called The Replacements you might be interested in having. Scott told them let‚Äôs see how this one comes off first. Truth was we had seen The Replacements play their first show at Folk City and they were b-o-r-i-n-g. :Butthole Surfers‚ÄîOctober 1984: It was the Butthole‚Äôs first trip to the big city and we caught them in all their psychedelic desert drug haze glory. Following in the footsteps of fellow Texans the Thirteenth Floor Elevators, they unleashed a devastating performance. Priceless interview too. Gibby informs Scott of the pride he felt in his former occupation as an accountant. Buttholes actually wanted Scott to go with them to MTV the next day and screen the tape. Scott said no thanks, thinking that if he went with them he would never be seen again. We later learned that this episode was used as an example of the dangers of Public Access programming at some symposium in Sacramento! :The Johnsons‚ÄîJanuary 1985: Intense pop rock with moody introspective lyrics. This episode includes a commercial for the cult film, ‚ÄúTerminator Exterminator‚Äù. Scott attempts the spinning plate on a pole shtick he had seen on The Ed Sullivan Show. To avoid injury he used paper plates. :No King‚ÄîFebruary 1985: Containing past members of D.C. legendary Chumps along with future Workdogs, No King sounded the way Scott thought The Dream Syndicate was supposed to sound. Their manic beat urban dramas were the perfect accompaniment to our fancy black dress cocktail party. Inspired by Playboy After Dark, this episode was the social event of the season. The black tie audience spilled onto the stairs and around the studio drinking champagne and eating hors d'oeuvres. :Woofing Cookies‚ÄîMarch 1985: The Cookies were a very young band of garage poppers. They gained a footnote in music history by being the band that decided to go to Athens Georgia and showed up on the front porch of REM‚Äôs Peter Buck‚Äôs home and begged him to produce a 45, which he did. :Shockabilly‚ÄîMarch 1985: Dr. Eugene Chadbourne, future Shimmy Disc impresario Kramer and drummer Licht. Scott gets a lesson in playing the electric garden rake. The Shockers played one of their prototypical alternative freak-outs. This episode also featured the suave Danny Barfman and his Dating Service. Television at its anarchic best. :Alter Boys‚ÄîDecember 1985: Come all ye Heathens to this Christmas episode. Oh wait! It‚Äôs the kind of Alter Boy that believes thou shalt be pummeled with sonic intertwining guitars. On this episode Gary decides to use Danny Barfman‚Äôs video dating service. He‚Äôs still waiting for a response. :The Clintons‚ÄîDecember 1985: This was our Bar Mitzvah episode, number 13. We needed a real man‚Äôs band and got it with the Clintons' twangy country rock with a hint of glam. The Clintons were staple of New York‚Äôs cow punk scene, and this episode had the best looking couples ever seen slow dancing on Public Access TV. Scott & Gary did their wrestling promo years before it was considered good family entertainment. The Clintons management was also involved with Natalie Merchant and Whatever Number of Maniacs. They said they would love to be on. Truth was Scott had seen them at Folk City one night thought they were b-o-r-i-n-g. :The Rhomboids‚ÄîMarch 1986: Our first episode taped in Maryland, our first one-hour show, and no one knew quite what to expect. We had established a relationship with kindred spirit Jeff Krulik who ran the Public Access Studio, who kindly invited us to tape some episodes. We knew just a few folks in the area, but our show had been airing there and was getting good feedback. The feedback must have spread because we had a fantastic turnout! It was a pure 1960‚Äôs psychedelic fuzz punk happening. With inspiration from such role models as The Seeds and The Chocolate Watchband, The Rhomboids delivered the goods nicely wrapped with paisley sport jackets and candelabras. The Slickee Boys mythical Kim Kane presented Scott & Gary with the keys to the city! Throw in some of the finest looking go-go chicks around and an infomercial for singing sensations, The Yeah Brothers, and we were an instant hit in the land of crab cakes. :Velvet Monkeys‚ÄîMarch 1986: The legendary show that was broadcast live. Maryland suburbanites still talk about it. The idea was that Scott & Gary would do the show in our underwear, the joke being that we lost our luggage on the trip down. The Velvet Monkeys featured Don Fleming (darling indie producer of Hole, Alice Cooper, etc.), and did sort of a Led Zep send-up in full rock-star regalia. Mr. Fleming played the part of the surly star to the hilt. During the interview Scott pinged him on the head with a toy squeaky hammer, thinking this would bring him to his senses. Fleming leapt on top of Scott and started wrestling with him! Everyone thought it was a joke! Gary, carrying a spear, came running in. He also thought it was a gag until he got to the stage and saw the fists flying. The whole band got involved and serious mayhem broke loose. Viewers called the station saying what the hell is going on...you got guys in their underwear wrestling guys in wigs! :The Beatnik Flies‚ÄîFebruary 1987: Members of the tangerine marshmallow underground ring true like a Carnaby Street dream. In this episode Gary and I face off in the battle of the Jerry Colonna (\\"who?‚Äù) impersonators. Scott opened the show with an impassioned plea for First Amendment tolerance. See, we had been distributing our show to public access systems in NYC, Boston, Austin, Minnesota and San Francisco. We thought Seattle would be a great addition. However, Seattle did not feel likewise. It seems a Ms. H at Seattle Public Access deemed us unsuitable due to ‚Äúnumerous references to sex and drinking of alcohol on camera by High School students‚Äù. We thought it hilarious that this open-minded tastemaker took the show so seriously. Well, we never had high school students on the show. See, as a way of paying homage to teen dance shows of the past Scott would ask the bands what High School they went to, usually getting very funny answers. We had also sprinkled sparkle confetti on the floor to create a neat effect. Jeff said not to do that again; the stuff was showing up for months in adjacent offices, conference rooms, etc. It got management wondering what went on during weekends. :Das Yahoos‚ÄîFebruary 1987: Crawling from the swamp that had birthed Philadelphia‚Äôs fabled Sick Kids, the Yahoos put the rockin‚Äô in rockin‚Äô bones. They had just worked on an EP with Lux and Ivy of the Cramps producing and were itching to spread their batwings and let it rip. Gary and I also drove to the hoop to play some one on one and give a strong argument for 1970‚Äôs style tight fitting basketball shorts. :Beatoes‚ÄîApril 1989: Always blazing (behind) TV‚Äôs ever changing technology, Scott and Gary attempt Public Access‚Äôs first 3D broadcast! Featuring the quirky nerd pop and poetic flourishes of the Beatoes. Hailing from inner city Baltimore the band presented matching shirts, wry lyrics, and odes to polyester slacks and Mad Dog 20/20. This was the second band to feature an electric rake. Scott and Gary also pay tribute to the great serials of the past with episode II of ‚ÄúFlying Man‚Äù; aluminum- helmeted defender of earth. We also show our concern for the environment with a special report from one Exxon‚Äôs scientist on how to cook fish covered in oil. :Ben Vaughn‚ÄîApril 1989: We thought it proper to start inviting back some of our favorite guests to see how they were and what they were up to. Well, the talented Mr. Vaughn was up to mucho. He drove his ‚Äò67 Rambler into the audience‚Äôs hearts singing songs about love gone not-too-good, love gotten better, dumping your lover and keeping your lover forever. And then something about France and Jerry Lewis. Providing the sensitive accompaniment was the delicate Aldo ‚ÄúPowderhead‚Äù Jones. Besides espousing on the finer points of ballet, there is concrete video evidence of Jim Morrison still living and episode III of Flying Man. Since Ben was in a rush to leave after the show, Scott was able to catch him for a little chat on the fly. That‚Äôs right; the interview took place in the Men‚Äôs room. Don‚Äôt mind those folks in the back using the urinal. And how did that woman pee standing up? *From the Archives of The Scott & Gary Show Notes External links *Nightflight Plus interviews with Scott and Gary *Scott and Gary Show Facebook page *Scott Lewis's website *Guide to the Scott and Gary Show Archive at NYU's Fales Library *Museum of the Moving Image: TV Party: A Panorama of Public Access Television in New York City *Museum of the Moving Image: Un-TV *The Wall Street Journal: Before the Web, It Was Public-Access *The Village Voice: Freaks & Geeks *Alamo Drafthouse Cinema: The Scott & Gary Show *Sheepshead Bites: Beastie Boys clip, Scott & Gary Show Category:1980s American variety television series Category:1983 American television series debuts Category:1989 American television series endings Category:American public access television shows ","title":"The Scott and Gary Show"},{"id":"29971940","text":"Lithuanian sportspeople are Lithuanian athletes who have attained outstanding achievements in sports.

In his youth, while still living in upstate New York, he operated a butchery, a general store, a grain mill, and a tannery. Reynolds established a successful leather-tanning operation in Chicago before becoming a grain trader in the upper-Mississippi River corridor. He acquired his own steamboats in order to improve access for his own grain shipments, and he eventually expanded to haul freight on the Mississippi River for other shippers. This fleet of river steamers grew into a company called the Diamond Jo Lines. He developed the Hot Springs Railroad in Arkansas. As a legacy, he established an endowment for the University of Chicago in order to build a clubhouse: the Reynolds Club, most recently used as a student union. Early life Joseph Reynolds was born June 11, 1819, in Fallsburg, New York to a large Quaker family. He only completed a grade school education. He started two ventures at a young age. First, he set himself up as a local butcher. At the age of seventeen, he and his brother Isaac established a general store in nearby Rockland, New York. He was married to Mary Morton, who was born about 1820 in Thunder Hill, Sullivan County, New York. Archive.org. While he was still overseeing the operations of the mill, he bought out a nearby tannery. He reorganized and expanded the facilities, and was soon turning a profit selling leather. Moving west Chicago In 1855, Reynolds sold his businesses in Rockland and moved his family to Chicago. He started a tanning business on West Water Street. He traveled through Wisconsin and Minnesota, buying hides and furs. He received the nickname \\"Diamond Jo\\" at this time. There was another J. Reynolds in the same business in Chicago, and their shipments became mixed. Joseph Reynolds conceived the idea of establishing a trademark. He marked his next shipment with his nickname \\"JO\\" enclosed within a diamond.Palimpsest, State Historical Society of Iowa, April, 1970 \\"Diamond Jo\\" was written by Reynolds without an \\"e\\" on Jo.North Iowa Times newspaper, McGregor, Iowa, January 1, 1880 Advertisement for Diamond Jo Steamers Grain trade In 1860, Reynolds sold his Chicago tannery and entered extensively into the grain business along the Mississippi, moving to McGregor, Iowa, and made his home there. Just one transportation companythe Minnesota Packet Company hauled grain on that part of the Mississippi River, and Reynolds found that other shippers were given priority, while his grain languished and sometimes spoiled. In 1862, he entered the steamboat business to avoid losses to his cargo sitting at the docks. He commissioned the steamboat Lansing and hired a captain from Wisconsin. This allowed Reynolds to move his grain along the river to the railhead at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin on his own timetable. Then the Minnesota Packet Company made a deal with Reynolds: if he agreed to sell the 123-foot sternwheeler, they would extend better freight service to him in the future. He sold the Lansing. However, not much later, he built a 242-ton sternwheeler and two barges. He named the steamboat Diamond Jo. Transportation businesses The Northwestern Packet Company, reorganized from the Minnesota Packet Company, approached Reynolds in regard to selling his fleet in 1862. Reynolds agreed and contracted with shipping companies to transport his grain for the next three years. In 1866, a new cartel of grain merchants was able to control shipping in the area, and Reynolds started building a new fleet of steamships. In 1867, he acquired some barges and the 61.5 ton steamboat John C. Gault. The next year he purchased three more steamers and a fleet of barges, calling his new company the \\"Chicago, Fulton, and River Line.\\" In 1871, he added one more steamboat, Diamond Jo, after which many started referring to the company as the \\"Diamond Jo Line.\\" Just as before, Reynolds acquired vessels to provide for his own shipping needs on a small segment of the upper Mississippi River. He continued to acquire more vessels, including tugboats and barges, and established a shipyard near Dubuque, Iowa. However, with this new enterprise, Reynolds increased the tonnage he hauled on behalf of other shippers, and expanded the scope of his river operations, running anywhere from St. Louis to St.Paul. During this expansion toward St. Louis, around 1880, he invested in larger steamboats. These included the sternwheelers Mary Morton (500 tons), Sidney (618 tons), and Pittsburg (722 tons). He continued to operate the shorter, lighter boats of his fleet upriver. In April 1875, Reynolds began building the Hot Springs Railroad between Malvern, Arkansas, and Hot Springs. The railroad was sometimes called the \\"Diamond Jo Line\\" for its developer. Death and legacy The Reynolds Club, University of Chicago Joseph and Mary Reynolds had one son named Blake who was born in McGregor their first year of residence there. Blake died during his late-twenties. Joseph and Mary Reynolds gifted a fountain and a park to the town of McGregor in memory of Blake. Reynolds died of pneumonia at the age of 71 in his room at the Congress Mine in Congress, Arizona. After his death his estate was valued at between $8 and $10 million completely debt free. His estate included real estate, steam packets, grain elevators, mining properties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri, and the Hot Springs Railroad, a narrow gauge line running from Malvern, Arkansas, to Hot Springs, Arkansas. He is buried at a family plot in Mount Hope Cemetery (Chicago) with his wife, Mary Morton Reynolds, and his son, Blake. Reynolds established an endowment with the University of Chicago to build the Reynolds Club, which as of October 2017, is still used as a student union. This endowment included a scholarship fund. Construction started on the Tudor-style building in 1901 and was designed by the firm of Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge. Originally planned as a library, the Reynolds Club included a billiard room, a bowling alley, and a theater. His wife, Mary Morton, inherited the Diamond Jo Line, and after she died in 1895, it was acquired by a partnership led by her brother. In 1911, the steamboat fleet was sold to Streckfus Steamers. W. C. Handy includes a reference to the Diamond Jo Line in his song Saint Louis Blues, \\"You ought to see dat stove pipe brown of mine / Lak he owns de Dimon Joseph line.\\" See also *The Joseph \\"Diamond Jo\\" Reynolds Office Building and House in McGregor, Iowa is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. *Diamond Jo Boat Store and Office in Dubuque, Iowa.

It was written by Ian Brennan, directed by Brad Falchuk, and was broadcast immediately following Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. In the episode, an effort to dispel student rivalry forces the McKinley High football team and glee club to unite. When cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) withdraws her squad from the halftime show of a championship football game, the disparate groups must come together to perform a routine and win the game. Reportedly the most expensive post-Super Bowl episode ever produced, \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\" cost $3‚Äì5 million. It featured over 500 extras, including an array of stunt artists. News anchor Katie Couric guest-starred as herself, provoking controversy by making a jibe about television personality Dina Lohan. The episode featured cover versions of five songs, including a dance performance of \\"California Gurls\\" by Katy Perry and a mash-up of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" with \\"Heads Will Roll\\" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Series creator Ryan Murphy had considered using the episode as a musical tribute to Jackson. The performances were met with mixed reception from critics. With the exception of \\"California Gurls\\", each of the numbers were released as singles, available for download. The \\"Thriller / Heads Will Roll\\" mash-up was the highest charting in all regions, peaking at number seventeen in Australia. In the US, the episode was watched by 26.8 million viewers, making it the most watched episode of Glee and was also the highest-rated scripted TV broadcast in three years. It received a mixed response from critics, who differed over its accessibility to the Super Bowl audience. Several criticized the repetitive theme of football versus glee club rivalry, finding \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\" below typical Glee standards. Plot Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), the coach of the cheerleading squad, grows disillusioned with the sport, and in an effort to recapture her love for it, plans to fire Brittany from a cannon during the team's next competitive routine. Meanwhile, football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) has the school football players join the glee club, New Directions, in order to dispel rivalry between the students. In revenge for opposition to her cannon plan, Sue has the cheerleading Regionals competition moved to the same night as a football championship game, so her cheerleaders will be unavailable for the halftime show, and forces the affected squad members to resign from the glee club. New Directions' director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) announces that the club members, including the football players, will perform the halftime routine, planning a mash-up of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" with \\"Heads Will Roll\\" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. He notices and encourages the talent of Dave Karofsky (Max Adler), a bully who has previously acted violently towards the glee club members. When the football players are attacked by members of the school hockey team, Karofsky convinces a number of the football players to quit the glee club, resulting in Beiste barring those players from the championship game. To ensure that the game goes ahead, glee club members Rachel (Lea Michele), Mercedes (Amber Riley), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Lauren (Ashley Fink) join the football team. The game begins badly for the McKinley side, and when Tina is injured during a play, captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) takes control of the situation. He has club member Puck (Mark Salling) convince the former football players to return, and convinces cheerleaders Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris) and his ex-girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron) to quit the cheer squad and perform at the halftime show. Only Karofsky refuses to participate, but when he sees the positive reaction the crowd has to the routine, he joins in himself. Beiste welcomes the football players back, and they go on to win the game by intimidating the opposing side, dressed as zombies from the halftime routine. Sue's cheer squad loses at Regionals for the first time in seven years, and she is named Loser of the Year in a televised interview with Katie Couric. Furthering her ire, the cheerleading budget is slashed due to the cannon being seen as endangering the lives of children. The money is then handed over to the glee club so they can pay to go to regionals. Karofsky dismisses Finn's suggestion that he join the glee club permanently. Finally, Quinn kisses Finn, telling him that his actions have reminded her of why she loved him. Production Katie Couric guest starred in the episode \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\" is reported to be the most expensive post-Super Bowl episode in television history, as well as the most expensive episode of Glee, costing $3‚Äì$5 million. Filming was halted on December 10, 2010 as a result of several cast members contracting tonsillitis. An outbreak of the flu soon followed, and filming of the \\"Thriller\\" performance was delayed by four weeks. The episode was co-sponsored by General Motors, allowing for limited commercial breaks. The Glee cast featured in a two-minute Chevrolet commercial during the episode. Based on the season one episode \\"Mattress\\", they gave an in-character performance of \\"See the USA in Your Chevrolet\\". Series creator Ryan Murphy intended \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\" to feel thematically similar to the pilot episode, with the central idea being \\"music bringing disparate people together.\\" Co-creator Brad Falchuk explained that one of the series' core conflicts had always been the idea of \\"two worlds\\" within McKinley High: the glee club and the popular students. He stated that this discord would be brought to a head in the episode. News anchor Couric made a guest appearance in the episode as herself. She was a fan of the series prior to her casting, having praised its handling of subject matters such as homosexuality, disabilities and teenage pregnancy. Brian Stelter of The New York Times noted that her appearance was unusual, as anchors from rival networks‚Äîin Couric's case, CBS‚Äîdo not typically make cameos on their competitors' programs. Series regular Chris Colfer and recurring guest star Darren Criss were not included in the original draft of the script, but were added by series creator Murphy in a late revision. Other recurring characters who appear are football coach Shannon Beiste, glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) and Lauren Zizes, cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) and school bullies Dave Karofsky and Azimio (James Earl). Two new football-playing characters were introduced: Scott Cooper and Strando, who E! columnist Kristin dos Santos reported might have an increased role in the series as it continued. However, they did not make any additional appearances on the show in its second season. Additionally, producers hired fire breathers, jugglers, and bicycle motocross stunt performers for the episode. 500 extras were used, as well as the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band. In January 2011, entertainment website Zap2it reported that Filipina singer Charice would appear as exchange student Sunshine Corazon, performing The Black Eyed Peas' \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" with rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline. However, Murphy later stated that Charice would not return to Glee until the end of the year, though she ultimately also made an appearance before then in \\"A Night of Neglect\\". Reception Ratings In the US, \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\" was watched by 26.8 million viewers, and received a rating/share of 11.1/29 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, marking the highest rating for a Glee episode. This also made the episode the highest-rated scripted broadcast of a TV series in three years. The episode continued a trend of declining Super Bowl lead-out show retention. It attained a higher rating than the last scripted lead-out show, The Office episode \\"Stress Relief\\", which followed Super Bowl XLIII, but was down 31 percent on the premiere episode of the reality television series Undercover Boss, broadcast after Super Bowl XLIV. Both ratings and viewership significantly increased from the previous Glee episode, \\"A Very Glee Christmas\\", which was viewed by 11.07 million US viewers and received a 4.4/13 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic upon its initial airing. In Canada, where the episode was also broadcast on February 6, 2011, it attained 2.16 million viewers and was the ninth most-watched show of the week. Viewership declined from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.37 million viewers and ranked fifth for the week. The episode's Australian broadcast, on February 14, 2011, drew 1.13 million viewers, making Glee the fourth most-watched program of the night and the most-watched in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It placed tenth in the weekly viewership rankings. Here, viewership registered an increase of approximately 47% over the previous episode, \\"A Very Glee Christmas\\", which aired on December 7, 2010, attracted 769,000 viewers, and failed to reach the top fifty for the week. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.64 million viewers (2.21 million on E4, and 433,000 on E4+1), becoming the most-watched show on cable for the week. Critical response The episode was met with mixed response from critics. Robert Bianco of USA Today found it lacking in plot and a driving moral, however felt that it was acceptable as a standalone episode ‚Äì one which could be enjoyed by fans and new viewers alike. In contrast, Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger commented that despite the football-centric plot, the episode would be hard to follow for new viewers brought in by the Super Bowl, requiring too much knowledge of previous storylines. New York Willa Paskin felt that Murphy demonstrated \\"utter contempt\\" for the potential new audience. She suggested that the McKinley High football team were used as a metaphor for new viewers‚Äîwho could come to love Glee if they embraced its musical numbers‚Äîbut found this insulting as the team are portrayed as being ignorant and intolerant. Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic found the episode lacking in Glee \\"usual acerbic wit and emotional heft\\", and criticized the under-use of Colfer and Criss. Highlighting a general malaise with the show, Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post deemed Sue's boredom with cheerleading a meta-reference to the series itself. Both she and Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club noted negatively the repetition of familiar storylines, such as the football team vs. glee club rivalry and Sue's attempts to destroy the club. VanDerWerff observed that Glee \\"keeps tossing the same elements into the hat and coming out with similar results, as though the only thing anybody‚Äôs putting any effort into are the musical numbers.\\" She graded the episode a \\"C\\", calling it \\"boring\\". Time James Poniewozik also commented on the repetitive premise, suggesting that the jocks versus geeks plot was the one most likely to be accessible to the new audience. He found the episode \\"easily forgettable\\" overall, criticizing the flat characterization, but noted that even when the series frustrates him, he continues to love Glee for, not in spite of, its inconsistency. IGN's Robert Canning also found the long-running football vs. glee storyline repetitive, but wrote that the football players joining glee club was \\"a welcome twist\\", however convoluted and unrealistic. He rated the episode 8/10, finding it \\"preposterously fun\\". Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker considered the episode \\"at once in-your-face and under-handed, very clever about its very cynicism.\\" He noted that while he had become jaded with Glee, he enjoyed \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\", summarizing that, \\"Everything in this episode was chaotic and topsy-turvy, but you never had the feeling the silliness was getting away from the producers. It all came together.\\" Rick Porter of Zap2it criticized Katie Couric's cameo for an attack made against Dina Lohan. During her interview with Sue, Couric lists Lohan and her dog Sparky as failed Loser of the Year contenders. In a previous episode, Glee also mocked Lohan's daughter, Lindsay. Porter felt that the jibe diminished Couric's journalistic credibility, deeming the Lohans easy targets. However, Canning called Couric's cameo \\"perhaps the funniest part of the episode\\", and de Moraes stated that the best line of the episode comes when Sue \\"looks Katie Couric right in the eye and says, 'I hate you, Diane Sawyer.' The Daily News Soraya Roberts expressed relief that the writers were not gullible enough to have Karofsky end the episode by joining the glee club. Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times opined that Karofsky's character development was the best element of the episode, but found his conflicted emotions convoluted, and was pleased that he was victimized by the hockey team. Music Performances Murphy initially intended the episode to be the second of the season paying tribute to a single band or artist, following the Britney Spears tribute episode \\"Britney/Brittany\\", and considered covering songs by Elton John, Prince, The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen or Michael Jackson. Although several artists agreed to a tribute, ultimately it was decided that songs by multiple acts would be covered. Katy Perry's \\"California Gurls\\" was used as the opening number, performed as a dance routine by the school cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Paying homage to Perry's original music video, one element features the cheerleaders appearing to shoot fire from their breasts. Falchuk, the episode's director, stated that the sequence was included to attract male Super Bowl viewers who would not ordinarily watch Glee. Rachel and Puck perform a duet of Lady Antebellum's \\"Need You Now\\", intended to showcase the merits of glee club. Finn leads a performance of The Zombies' \\"She's Not There\\" as the halftime show warm-up number, and rival a cappella choir the Dalton Academy Warblers perform Destiny's Child's \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\", led by Blaine. A mash-up of Jackson's song \\"Thriller\\" with \\"Heads Will Roll\\" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs was used as the final number. In early reports relating to the episode, Lynch claimed that Couric and Morrison would perform a dance number to \\"Tea for Two\\", Vincent Youmans and Irving Caesar's song from the 1925 musical No, No, Nanette. This rumor was later dispelled by Murphy. Commentary Katy Perry was reportedly excited by the performance of her song \\"California Gurls\\" in this episode. Musical performances also attracted mixed commentary. Though Perry was reportedly excited by the performance of her \\"California Gurls\\", it was poorly received by critics. VanDerWerff found it surprisingly \\"weak and lifeless\\", and Fallon called it \\"slow, unfunny, and, quite frankly, boring.\\" Reiter also deemed it boring, describing it as \\"an elaborate smorgasbord without flavor\\", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman criticized the uninspired, over-the-top choreography. The performance of \\"Need You Now\\" was praised by Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal, though he branded it a \\"disastrously tactless\\" song choice. Both he and Jenna Mullins of E! Online questioned the likelihood of a country ballad enthusing the football players toward glee club. Entertainment Weekly Breia Brissey graded the performance \\"B+\\", enjoying the union of Puck and Rachel, but finding it lacking in originality. She gave the same grade to \\"She's Not There\\", appreciating the way the song choice complemented the episode's Finn/Quinn storyline. VanDerWerff also received the performance positively, calling it one of the season's better numbers, and Futterman felt that Monteith's vocals were a \\"perfect fit\\" for the song, appreciating the initially odd choreography for making the performance more interesting. Reiter was frustrated by the costuming, writing that the zombie makeup made the choreography difficult to follow. Brissey's lowest grade, a \\"B‚àí\\", went to \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\". Though she enjoyed the a cappella cover, Brissey found it incongruous in context, opining that Glee best performances are those linked to the storylines, allowing viewers to invest in their message. Several critics voiced similar complaints while enjoying the song itself, including Mullins, Futterman and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson. Tucker felt that it had \\"more snap and vigour\\" than the final number, but also disapproved of its awkward inclusion, writing that it impacted negatively on the episode's momentum. Fallon gave the track an entirely positive review, suggesting that it should have been the episode's opening number and lauding it as \\"surprising, oozing with charm, and actually kind of joyous.\\" CNN's Lisa Respers France embraced the \\"completely random and bizarre\\" song choice, writing that it reminded her of the first season, \\"when [she] never knew what to expect and [...] was often happily surprised.\\" Reiter too reviewed it favorably, calling it the best performance of the show. She appreciated the focus on facial expressions during the performance, in contrast to the elaborate costuming which she felt distracted from other numbers. Bianco preferred the intimacy of \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" to \\"Thriller / Heads Will Roll\\", which both he and Hyman criticized for its overproduction and editing. While Bianco found the final number anonymous, Hyman and Futterman approved of the performance overall, particularly for the makeup and costuming. Flandez and Brissey compared it favorably to the Super Bowl XLV halftime performances, with Brissey stating that the mashup did Jackson justice and giving it her highest grade of the episode, an \\"A‚àí\\". Roberts wrote that the performance \\"lived up to the pre-show hype\\", but felt that the rest of the episode \\"paled in comparison\\". VanDerWerff commented favorably, \\"For the few minutes that number was on the screen, Glee was nearly everything it could be, blending fun music with insane production values and characters coming to certain emotional realizations in the moment, heightened as it is by the music.\\" Chart history \\"Bills, Bills, Bills,\\" \\"Need You Now,\\" \\"She's Not There\\" and \\"Thriller / Heads Will Roll,\\" were released as singles, available for digital download. The last three tracks are also included on the series' sixth soundtrack album, Glee: The Music, Volume 5, and the first is also included on the seventh soundtrack album, Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers. Each song charted on the Billboard Hot 100, and all but \\"She's Not There\\" placed on the Canadian Hot 100 and Australian ARIA Charts. In the US, three of the four tracks debuted on the February 10, 2011 issue: \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" entered at number 79, \\"Need You Now\\" at number 72, and \\"Thriller / Heads Will Roll\\" at number 75. The February 17, 2011 chart saw \\"She's Not There\\" debut at number 87, while \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" climbed to 44, \\"Need You Now\\" to 62 and \\"Thriller / Heads Will Roll\\" to 38. In Canada, the three charting singles debuted on the February 11, 2011 chart. \\"Need You Now\\" entered at its peak position of number 51. \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" entered at number 86 and peaked the following week at 58. \\"Thriller / Heads Will Roll\\" entered at 76 and peaked at 30. The singles' Australian release saw them enter the charts on February 21, 2011: \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" at number 71, \\"Need You Now\\" at 46 and \\"Thriller / Heads Will Roll\\" at 17. Having previously dropped out of the chart, the original Lady Antebellum version of \\"Need You Now\\" re- entered at number 31 in the same week as the Glee cover. \\"Thriller / Heads Will Roll\\" also managed to chart in Ireland at number 37 and in New Zealand at number 38.

It consists of four buildings‚Äîan office, a brew house, an engine‚Äìmachine house, and a stable‚Äìstorage house‚Äîall constructed between 1872 and 1890 in the German round-arch style. The site is bounded by Belvidere Street to the southeast, Beaver Street to the northeast, and Locust Street to the northwest, with the address 31 Belvidere Street. The main brew house, the engine‚Äìmachine house, and the office building were designed by Brooklyn architect Theobald Engelhardt, while the stable‚Äìstorage house was designed by Frederick Wunder. The Ulmer Brewery was one of over a dozen German-operated breweries that were built in Bushwick during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It ceased to be an active brewery in 1920 due to Prohibition in the United States, which outlawed alcoholic beverage production. The Ulmer family continued to own the office building until 1952; the other buildings were sold and used for light manufacturing, and the office building became a private residence. On May 11, 2010, the brewery was designated a New York City Landmark, becoming the first brewery in the city to receive this status.  History   Context  Brewing was a major industry in New York City going back to the 18th century. though early development of breweries in Brooklyn was quite slow, with relatively few commercial brewers. When freshwater was discovered under northern Brooklyn during the late 19th century, including under Williamsburg and Bushwick, resulted in the development of breweries, where many German immigrants worked at the time. By 1880, there were 35 breweries in Brooklyn, including a 14-block \\"brewer's row\\" within Bushwick that contained at least 11 breweries. This coincided with a large increase in Germans settling Bushwick. William Ulmer (1833‚Äì1907), an immigrant from the German territory of W√ºrttemberg, was one of the early settlers in the Bushwick brewery district. He was the nephew of both John F. Betz and Henry Clausen Sr., who in turn were brewers and apprentices of D.G. Yuengling Sr. In 1871, Ulmer and a Bavarian immigrant named Anton Vigelius founded the Vigelius & Ulmer Continental Lagerbier Brewery, at the intersection of Belvidere (formerly Ann) and Beaver Streets. Two years prior, Vigelius had bought the land from the Debevoises, and just before the brewery was constructed, had sold off his half-stake in the land to Ulmer.  Operations  Construction was already underway by 1871, when an accident at the site killed three construction workers. The first buildings on the site, the brewery and a nearby residence, are thought to have been completed by the same year. The brewery was fairly successful, and in 1875 the Brooklyn Daily Eagle described the Vigelius & Ulmer brewery as one of the larger breweries in the Williamsburg area, out of 30 or 40 breweries operating in the neighborhood. Vigelius then relinquished his ownership stake in the brewery. Ulmer became its sole proprietor and subsequently reorganized it into the William Ulmer Brewery. In 1881, some workers went on strike to protest low wages. Over the years, several improvements were made to the brewery to accommodate additional brewing capacity and to utilize advances in that industry. In 1880, a new storage house would be built on Beaver Street. Five years later, Theobald Engelhardt designed a large expansion that included an office building; machine and boiler structures; and a washroom and keg-filling room in the back of the main brewery building. Frederick Wunder would design a three-story brick stable and storage house in 1890, which replaced the stable building already on the site. The Eagle stated in 1886 that the counting-houses at Ulmer Brewery and several others in the area were \\"not surpassed by anything of the kind on Broadway or Wall Street\\". Additions would continue through the 1900s, including a 236-barrel container for cooking the brew, installed in 1906. By 1896, Ulmer was described as a millionaire, and he lived at a large estate on Bushwick Avenue. Although there is no documentation to support that Ulmer operated any beer gardens to sell his beer, Ulmer did operate several facilities including Ulmer Park in Gravesend; Dexter Park in Woodhaven, Queens; and a beer pavilion in Forest Park, Queens. When Ulmer retired in 1900, the company was reincorporated with his son-in-law John W. Weber (1858‚Äì1933) as its president. Weber, as well as Ulmer's wife Catherine and his other son-in-law John F. Becker, served as directors of the newly reincorporated company. When Ulmer died in 1907, the brewery had become one of Brooklyn's largest. The brewery had produced of beer a year at its peak. However, after the enactment of Prohibition, production of alcoholic beverages became illegal and the brewery closed in 1920.  Post-closure  After closure, the brewery's buildings were sold and used for light manufacturing. The family continued to own the office building before selling it in 1952. In 1985, Jay Swift, a stone sculptor and marble worker, purchased the office building and renovated it. At the time, the main building was used as a storage facility for a nearby lamp company. Swift would move out in the late 1990s, and the office building remained unoccupied for several years, as Swift had declined potential tenants who wanted to make extensive changes to the exterior. By 2008, The New York Times mentioned that a furniture designer lived in the office building. On May 11, 2010, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the brewery an official city landmark, making it the first brewery to receive this status. At the time of the landmark decision, the office building was still being used as a home. , the residence was on sale for $4 million.  Design  The William Ulmer Brewery's constituent structures include the main brew house and its annex; the engine‚Äìmachine house; the office; and the stable‚Äìstorage house. The main brew house and annex were designed by Brooklyn architect Theobald Engelhardt in 1872. Engelhardt went on to build the house and the office building in 1885. The stable‚Äìstorage house was designed by Frederick Wunder in 1890. Similar to other German breweries, the Ulmer Brewery buildings were largely designed in the American round-arch style, inspired by the German Renaissance Revival style or Rundbogenstil. As with other factory structures built in that era, regularly spaced window openings let in natural light but also allowed an \\"organization\\" and \\"dignity\\", while decorative brick facades allowed for both a fire-resistant material and a \\"relatively economical means of relieving plain brickwork\\".  Main brew house  alt=The main brew house, built in 1872 and expanded in 1881, is located at the western corner of Beaver and Belvidere Streets. It was originally stories high and contained a mansard roof. Later expansions brought the building's height to four stories, with a flat roof. The main brewing house measures along its northeastern elevation on Beaver Street, and along its southeastern elevation on Belvidere Street. The original structure, comprising the eastern two-thirds closer to the intersection of Beaver and Belvidere Streets, contains a facade with brick archivolts above the second through fourth floors' window openings, as well as archivolts at the bricked-over window openings on the first floor. In the original structure, there are three vertical window bays on each side, which are separated by projecting brick vertical pilasters and contain two archivolted windows on each floor. The first floor contains several doors and a roll-down metal gate on Beaver Street, but features few windows. The northwestern two-thirds of the Beaver Street (northeastern) facade contains a different window configuration, and its second and third floors contain rectangular windows without archivolts.  Engine‚Äìmachine building  On Belvidere Street, to the southwest of the brew house, is the engine‚Äìmachine building, built as a two-and-three-story structure in 1885. It also contained brick archivolts; a projecting pilaster separating the building's two bays; and a cornice made of brick. The three-story portion is located just southwest of the main brew house, and their facades are flush with each other. The northeastern half of the engine‚Äìmachine building contains extra-high first- and second floors, such that the third floor of this building aligns with the fourth floor of the main brew house. This half of the building is composed of two bays, each with two windows. Combined with the main brew house, it makes a reverse \\"L\\" shape. The southeastern half is two stories, corresponding with the southwestern section of the main brew house. The first floor contains a garage as well as small window openings on the first floor. The facade has four windows on each floor with two windows to each bay. The first floor contains a garage.  Office building  alt= The two-story office building, completed in 1890, has the address 31 Belvidere Street. The two-story building was built in the Romanesque Revival style. It features a cobblestone facade, a slate-covered mansard roof, and terracotta ornament. The facade is divided into two bays: the outer bays contain two pairs of arched windows on the first floor and two dormered windows on the second floor. These flank the central bay, which contain a main archway on the first floor; an engraved sign with the letters \\"OFFICE\\" above the archway; a second floor with two windows; and a pediment above the second floor. A cobblestone driveway is located northeast of the office building. The original building measures wide and deep, located on a lot measuring . Several additions have been built behind the original building, including a two-story brick structure and one-story cement structure.  Stable‚Äìstorage building  The stable building, completed in 1885, has the address 28 Locust Street, on the northwestern portion of the site. It measures and is largely rectangular. The building is stories high with a cellar that is located half a story below ground level. The facade is made of cobblestone, and the Locust Street facade has been split into three architectural bays, each with two windows. A cobblestone driveway runs to the northeast of the stable building. The last major structure to be developed for the brewery, the stable building contains archivolted windows on the third floor; parapets above the first and third floors; pilasters between the windows; and a pediment atop the center bay facing Locust Street. An elevator was constructed by 1932 in a separate shaft, possibly on a preexisting one- story building.

This technique is part of the High Frequency Mechanical Impact (HFMI) processes. Other acronyms are also equivalent: Ultrasonic Needle Peening (UNP), Ultrasonic Peening (UP). Ultrasonic impact treatment can result in controlled residual compressive stress, grain refinement and grain size reduction. Low and high cycle fatigue are enhanced and have been documented to provide increases up to ten times greater than non-UIT specimens.  Theory  In UIT, ultrasonic waves are produced by an electro-mechanical ultrasonic transducer, and applied to a workpiece. An acoustically tuned resonator bar is caused to vibrate by energizing it with a magnetostrictive or Piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer. The energy generated from these high frequency impulses is imparted to the treated surface through the contact of specially designed steel pins. These transfer pins are free to move axially between the resonant body and the treated surface. When the tool, made up of the ultrasonic transducer, pins and other components, comes into contact with the work piece it acoustically couples with the work piece, creating harmonic resonance. This harmonic resonance is performed at a carefully calibrated frequency, to which metals respond very favorably, resulting in compressive residual stress, stress relief and grain structure improvements. Depending on the desired effects of treatment a combination of different frequencies and displacement amplitude is applied. Depending on the tool and the Original Equipment Manufacturer, these frequencies range between 15 and 55 kHz, with the displacement amplitude of the resonant body of between .  Application  UIT is highly controllable. Incorporating a programmable logic controller (PLC) or a Digital Ultrasonic Generator, the frequency and amplitude of UIT are easily set and maintained, thus removing a significant portion of operator dependency. UIT can also be mechanically controlled, thus providing repeatability of results from one application to the next. Examples of mechanical control employed with UIT include: *CNC milling machines *Lathes *Robotic control *Weld tractors With these types of controlled applications, the surface finish of the work piece is highly controllable. For many applications, UIT is most effectively employed by hand. The high portability of the UIT system enables travel to austere locations and hard to reach places. The flexibility that is facilitated by variations in the tool configuration (such as angle-peening-head) ensures that access to very tight locations is possible. UIT's effectiveness has been illustrated on the following metals, among others: *Aluminium (including sensitized Aluminium) *Bronze *Cobalt alloys *Nickel alloys *Steels **Carbon steel **Stainless steel **High-strength low-alloy steel **Manganese steel *Titanium  History  UIT was originally developed in 1972 and has since been perfected by a team of Russian scientists under the leadership of Dr. Efim Statnikov. Originally developed and utilized to enhance the fatigue and corrosion attributes of ship and submarine structures, UIT has been utilized in aerospace, mining, offshore drilling, shipbuilding, infrastructure, automotive, energy production and other industries. Different industrial solutions exist nowadays and are commercialized by a limited number of Original Equipment Manufacturers worldwide.  Practical applications  UIT enables life extension of steel bridges. This technique has been employed in numerous US states as well as other nations. The result is a greatly reduced cost of infrastructure. UIT has been certified for this use by AASHTO. The use of UIT on draglines and other heavy equipment in the mining industry has resulted in increased production and has decreased downtime and maintenance costs. UIT is employed on drive shafts and crank shafts in a number of industries. Results show that UIT increases shaft life by over a factor of 3. The US Navy uses UIT to address cracked areas in certain aluminum decks. Without UIT, crack repairs resulted in almost immediate re-cracking. With UIT, repairs have shown to last over eight months without cracks.

After the cancellation of As the World Turns in 2010, Conn left her role as then Katie Peretti and joined the cast of One Life to Live as newly-created character Aubrey. Aubrey began her time in town as a smart and beautiful con artist but soon developed into a more caring person with a less criminal outlook on life. Casting and characterization Terri Conn was offered the new role of Aubrey Wentworth following the cancellation and series finale of the CBS daytime drama As the World Turns, less than two months earlier. After having spent 12 years as Katie Peretti from 1998 until 2010 and a guest starring role on CBS' The Young and the Restless in 1995, Conn remained a part of the genre after the show contacted her agent after releasing a casting call for the character. After screen testing with OLTL star Erika Slezak (Victoria Lord) and David Fumero (Cristian Vega), Conn was hired for the role. Conn's continued career was considered a relief to the actress because of the difficult job market as well as the new direction she would be taking by playing a more mature role. Conn commented on the development of the character and the difference between her OLTL and ATWT roles in an interview with TV Guide columnist Michael Logan: The casting coincided with the hirings of former World Turns co-star Tom Degnan (Joey Buchanan)http://www.aoltv.com/2010/10/18/soap-casting-news-atwts-terri- colombino-joins-one-life/ and newcomer Josh Kelly (Cutter Wentworth). The arrivals would permit a love quadrangle between these three characters and Kelly Cramer, played by Gina Tognoni, who rejoined the show several months earlier after the cancellation of another long running CBS daytime drama, Guiding Light. Storyline Aubrey Wentworth comes to town on a plane coming from London to visit her boyfriend Joey Buchanan in Llanview. She meets Joey's ex-wife Kelly Cramer, and both women are unaware of the other's feelings for the man. Aubrey arrives and meets Joey's parents Clint Buchanan and Victoria Lord and accepts Joey's surprising marriage proposal, where Kelly learns the two were a couple. As Kelly and Aubrey's rivalry grows, Aubrey's real boyfriend Cutter Wentworth arrives and it is apparent that the pair are planning on conning Joey of his fortune after she marries him. As Cutter poses as her brother, they succeed in keeping her secret from being revealed by Kelly and her aunt Dorian Lord. However, their deception comes out when she and Joey take care of Ryder Ford, the son of Jessica Buchanan while she is under the influence of her alternate personality \\"Tess.\\" Aubrey wants to be honest with Joey because she finally recognizes her feelings for him and tells him about her and Cutter's real plans, but Joey breaks up with her and Jessica soon regains custody of her son. After Cutter discovers that Aubrey has actual feelings for Joey, he shocks Aubrey by eloping with Tess/Jessica and blackmailing Clint for a piece of his fortune and ownership of The Buchanan Mansion in exchange for committing their daughter to St. Anne's. Cutter later loses his piece of the Buchanan fortune and the mansion when he discovers that Clint had a loophole in the mansion's deed that he could take back ownership of the mansion anytime he wants to. Clint gives the mansion to his long-lost son Rex Balsom after he blackmails him for his entire fortune so that his recently \\"deceased\\" fianc√©e Gigi Morasco can donate her heart to Clint after he suffered a major heart attack. It later turns out that he got the heart of Gigi's sister Stacy Morasco when it was later revealed that Gigi was still alive. After Joey and Kelly reunite and leave town following his divorce from Aubrey, she shortly reunites with Cutter after they begin a life without crime. However, she breaks up with him again after learning his attempt to con Clint's other son, Rex after the \\"death\\" of his fianc√©e Gigi, following the reveal that Aubrey's real name was Kristine Karr and the real Aubrey Wentworth was Cutter's own sister Kimberly Andrews. Kristine took on the name so that she and Cutter could con rich men out of money under the disguise of brother and sister. Aubrey eventually becomes a confidant for Rex and his son Shane Morasco as Cutter tries to con them out of their family's money with the fact that Gigi was still alive and it was her sister Stacy who died. Cutter is eventually arrested and Kim leaves town. After Rex and Shane reunite with Gigi, Aubrey realizes she no longer has a place in anyone's lives and leaves town.

History The Westphalian town of Dorsten is host to Germany's oldest continuous cloister of the Franciscan Order, founded in 1488. Out of this cloister, Petrinum was established as a Latin school in 1642. Although the Thirty Years‚Äô War (1618‚Äì48) had badly derogated Dorsten's medieval wealth and status as a member of the Hanseatic League of international trading cities, the town council mobilised support for the clerics‚Äô efforts. In 1823 the Latin school became a Progymnasium, meaning that a more encompassing list of subjects was taught. The last Franciscan headmaster died in 1837 and in 1898 the school was made a full Gymnasium. Petrinum subsequently moved to a new building in 1902 and in 1904 the first Abitur exam was conducted at the school now officially named ‚ÄúCatholic Gymnasium (with compensatory education in Greek) at Dorsten‚Äù. During the Occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 the school building served as headquarters for Belgian troops, which meant that teaching had to take place in another building. After heavy disruptions during the Second World War, instruction returned to normal in 1948 although the school building still had to be shared with a Volksschule. Due to the continuing shortage of teaching rooms, the building was extended, completely overhauled and re-opened in 1963. In 1978 the first girls took the Abitur exam at the former boys' school and in 1982 Petrinum moved to a completely new building by the Wesel-Datteln Canal. The building was further extended by a new tract in 2003.

The castle houses a museum of art and culture. Geography The castle, above its town Velenje, is in the ≈†alek Valley (), located on the top of a hill to the west of the town. Over the centuries this castle, along with two others in its vicinity, ≈†alek and Eken≈°tajn, has played a key role in controlling the routes from the Celje Basin to Carinthia. Archaeological excavations have revealed that the valley where the castle is located was the settlement of prehistoric man. Since medieval times, Velenje Castle in the ≈†alek Valley was also known as the \\"Valley of Castles\\" for the over twenty castles built in this valley. Approach to the castle is from a foot track from the bus station in the town, and also by road from the old town. History The castle was a strategically important fortress first mentioned in 1270; from it various owners controlled the routes from the Celje Basin to Carinthia. From the 14th century, the castle's ownership has gone through several noblemen. The castle seen in the present shape was fully refurbished in the early 16th century by the Wagen von Wagensberg family and also in subsequent centuries. Following the complete renovation, the castle became their Renaissance residence. In the 19th century, Karl and Bianca Adamovich owned the castle. It was the summer residence of Count Coronnini- Kromberg until 1943 when he was evicted by the Germans. Subsequent to World War II, it became a government property. The castle was again renovated after 1957 and it now also houses a museum. Architecture The castle has been built conforming to the topography of the land, on a rounded hill. It has a five-pronged exterior wall forming a large courtyard, which has a well and also a large flowerbed combined with an elegant arcade. A defense tower, a triangular shaped fortification, is built as part of the wall on the northeastern side of the courtyard. The residential buildings are located on the southeast corner; these are provided with basement cellars. Museum Velenje Castle The museum located within the castle premises has a diverse collection in its many galleries. Its unique art collections include African art (only one of its kind in Slovenia with 1000 art pieces which includes furniture, jewelry, music instruments, masks and puppets, and the carved sculptures of the donor), which was donated to the museum by the Czech-born sculptor Franƒçi≈°ek Foit; contemporary art by local artists of Slovenia, artifacts related to the history of the valley from the Roman period and Baroque of the Middle Ages through the centuries, including figureheads of Tito and Kardelj leaders of Yugoslavia during communist rule in Slovenia, remnants of two mastodons, a chronology of Velenje emerging as a town and Baroque artwork from the Church of St. George () at ≈†kale. The museum also has a reconstructed grocer's shop of the 20th century, a reconstructed inn of the 1930s, a model of a coal pit, and many other artifacts. The Slovenian Coal Mining Museum () is also located in the vicinity of the castle where deep coal mining shafts are visitor attractions.

It is the former site of what was known as Babb's Beach Amusement Park, a small amusement park that was active in the first half of the 20th century. At its height in the 1930s, the surviving dance hall hosted dances for up to 3,000 weekend patrons. The property, owned by the town since 1977, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history Babb's Beach is located in northwestern Suffield, on the eastern shore of the Middle Pond of the Congamond Lakes, which separate Suffield from Southwick, Massachusetts. The property is about in size, and has of shoreline that is mostly beaches. The beach is separated from the balance of the property by a low bluff. The remainder of the property is an open grassy area, with the surviving buildings of the amusement park era on the northern edge. A split-rail fence separates the property from the road, with an opening and a short gravel drive leading to an informal parking area. and The most significant building is a large dance hall; other surviving buildings are an arcade, a shooting gallery, and a small generator shed. The dance hall is a single-story wood frame structure, with a central hip-roofed element ringed on three sides by extensions for services, and with a smaller projection on the north side for the stage area. View from the bluff down to the beach and lake The Congamond Lakes began to develop as a leisure and recreational destination beginning in the 1850s, following the construction of the New Haven and Northampton Railroad along the former route of the Farmington Canal, which had used the lakes as part of its route. Curtis Babb capitalized on the increasing popularity of the lakes as a destination by building a series of small cabins on the lakefront, and offering steamship service to the train on the far shore. Babb's son Nelson took over the property in the 1910s, and expanded its facilities. He converted a horse barn into a dance hall, and also built a bathhouse and boathouse on the waterfront. Facing competition from other lakefront amusement operators, he also offered a variety of rides, including a merry-go-round that was built on a platform in the lake. The dance hall proved a major draw, and was eventually replaced by a larger structure. Performers at the venue included Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, and Kay Kaiser. Business declined during the Great Depression, which Nelson Babb sought to counter by offering more amusements. He built an arcade, and adapted the dance hall to permit roller skating. The hall became known as one of the region's finest for that activity. Business declined after World War II, and was dealt a significant blow by Hurricane Diane, which destroyed the park's waterfront facilities in 1955. Babb turned the property over to the town in 1977, but continued to operate the dance hall as a roller skating facility until 1997.

Print. This specific coin, named the Neil/Carter/Contursi specimen 1794 Flowing Hair Dollar, is believed by most experts to be the first silver dollar stuck in the U.S. Mint. In May 2010, Contursi sold the Neil/Carter/Contursi 1794 Silver Dollar for $7.85 million to the Josh Galt Group, which at the time, set a world record for the highest amount ever paid for any single coin. In December 2011, the unique Brasher Doubloon, the first gold coin made for the young United States, was sold by Steven L. Contursi of Laguna Beach, California, to Certified Acceptance Corporation (CAC) of Far Hills, New Jersey. An undisclosed Wall Street investment firm subsequently has purchased it from Blanchard and Company of New Orleans, Louisiana for a record price of nearly $7.4 million, the most money ever paid for this historic rare coin. Most recently, Steve Contursi donated the 1792 Half Disme, an early American coin valued at more than $220,000, to the ANA‚Äôs Money Museum. In late December 2011, Steven L. Contursi, President of Rare Coin Wholesalers, donated a 1792 half disme, graded NGC About Uncirculated 58, to the American Numismatic Association's Edward C. Rochette Money Museum in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Contursi said he donated his coin to the ANA unrestricted, \\"with no strings attached,\\" explaining that it was his way of \\"giving back\\" to an association he has \\"always believed in.\\" When Contursi donated his coin, he was unaware that the example of the famed rarity was missing and presumed stolen from the museum's collection, which was later disclosed by ANA officials on January 19. Contursi has bought and sold a number of examples of the 1792 half disme during his career, ranging from the finest known, graded Mint State 68, to circulated specimens. In fact, he currently has one that grades MS-65 in his collection. Steve Contursi purchased a 1907 gold coin that experts have called the most beautiful in U.S. currency on June 29, 2012. The coin, a Proof Ultra High Relief double eagle, was designed at the turn of the century by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens after a request from President Theodore Roosevelt to bring more beauty into American coin design. Reminiscent of ancient Greek coins, its reverse features an eagle and its front the classical figure of Miss Liberty. This coin stands out because only 20 of this type are known to exist and this particular coin is a Proof 69 Ultra High Relief. The coin's figures are so raised from the rest of its surface; it could not be easily stacked. \\"It almost looks like Miss Liberty is jumping out of the coin,\\" said Contursi.

He also worked as an associate research scientist at the Mailman School's of Public Health Center for the History and Ethics at Columbia University. In 2001, while researching in the U.S. National Archives, Turse discovered records of a Pentagon task force called the Vietnam War Crimes Working Group that was formed as a result of the My Lai massacre. These records became the focus of his doctoral dissertation, Kill Anything That Moves: United States War Crimes and Atrocities in Vietnam, 1965‚Äì1973.  Career  Turse is a contributing writer at the blog TomDispatch. He has written for publications such as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Harper's Magazine, Vice News and the BBC on subjects such as ethnic cleansing in South Sudan, the U.S. military in Africa, the video game industry, street art, the war in Afghanistan, and the Vietnam War. He has also reviewed books for the San Francisco Chronicle, The Daily Beast, Asia Times, and other publications.  South Sudanese Civil War  Turse has reported on the South Sudanese civil war that began in 2013 including an investigation of a government ethnic cleansing campaign for Harper's, and wrote a book on the South Sudanese civil war, Next Time They'll Come to Count The Dead. Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch wrote, \\"Turse gives a sobering account of the horrific crimes against ordinary people that define South Sudan's conflict. He shows how efforts to count the dead, investigate the crimes, and bring perpetrators to justice have so far failed. His compelling account reminds us why accountability is both urgent and necessary.\\" The Los Angeles Review of Books said Turse \\"delivers a scathing and deeply reported account of South Sudan's suffering since its collapse in December 2013.\\" Next Time They'll Come to Count The Dead was a finalist for the 2016 Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. book award.

The book is based on archival materials Turse discovered and interviews he conducted with eyewitnesses in the U.S. and Vietnam, including a hundred American Vietnam War veterans. Turse won a 2014 American Book Award and an Izzy (I.F. Stone) Award for Kill Anything That Moves.... Writing in The Huffington Post, Peter Van Buren called the book \\"one of the most important books about the American War in Vietnam.\\" John Tirman of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Turse forcefully argues the narrower question of how the government failed to prosecute crimes committed in Vietnam or Cambodia.\\" Writing in Proceedings Magazine, the official publication of the U.S. Naval Institute, Richard Ruth, a professor of SE Asian Studies at the U.S. Naval Academy wrote: \\"Turse argues that the enormous toll of civilian victims was neither accidental nor unpredictable. The Pentagon's demand for quantifiable corpses surged down the chain of command, through all branches of the U.S. military, until many units had become fixated on producing indiscriminate casualties that they could claim as enemy kills. Under this system, killing was incentivized: those with high body counts not only got promoted more quickly, their units were treated better and enjoyed greater safety than those who missed their 'killing quotas'... The incentivizing of death encouraged some U.S. soldiers to rack up thousands of kills over multiple tours. In a telling detail repeated in many of the case studies examined, the alleged Viet Cong eliminated by these American super killers often had no weapons on them when they were gunned down. Turse makes it clear that such high numbers would have been all but impossible without the inclusion of innocent bystanders.\\" Ruth also wrote: \\"Turse combines original on-site investigations and fresh archival research with a rich sampling of supporting material from several well-known histories and memoirs. A journalist by training, he interviewed survivors from several massacres as a supplement to the Criminal Investigation Command files he uncovered. The disparity in details between the survivors' horrific recollections and the doubting tone of the official military files is jarring. In many of the cases the reported war crimes, most of them based on evidence from concerned GIs, are dismissed for lack of interest as much as for lack of evidence,\\" and \\"Turse's study is not anti-veteran, anti-military, or anti-American.\\" Kill Anything That Moves was criticized for downplaying the scope and importance of the contribution Vietnam veterans made to the antiwar effort in the United States. During the war, U.S. antiwar activists repeatedly pointed to atrocities that Turse claimed to have \\"discovered.\\" Another criticism is that his book focuses on crimes by individual U.S. soldiers while ignoring policies such as the bombing of North Vietnam that killed tens of thousands of Vietnamese civilians. Wrote Michael Uhl in CounterPunch, \\"[Turse] seems to weigh the vile handiwork of individual GIs operating in the field on a par with the far more deadly toll that sprang from coldhearted policies of mass murder designed by high level commanders, political bureaucrats and academics: the indiscriminate use of artillery and air power to remove and disrupt populations, and which caused the overwhelming number of deaths and casualties among the South Vietnamese.\\" In Military Review, journalist and Vietnam war correspondent Arnold R. Isaacs states, \\"it would be a mistake to dismiss the facts set out in this book just because one dislikes the author's political slant. His conclusions may be overstated, but Turse makes a strong case that the dark side of America's war in Vietnam was a good deal darker than is commonly remembered. If the American war was not a crime against humanity, Turse confronts us with convincing evidence that there was an American war that it is hard to call anything else‚Äîand that we should not scrub this out of our history.\\" In another review of Turse's book, Peter Zinoman and Gary Kulik have accused Turse of omitting crucial context, selectively quoting \\"inflammatory witness comments\\" without corroboration, and pursuing an \\"ideologically driven caricature of the war in Vietnam. They also criticized Turse's approach as outdated and isolated from the current revisionist trends in the historical study of military violence against civilians. They stated that Turse's book continues following the orthodox approach‚Äîthe \\"Americanist view of the war in Vietnam in history and memory\\". Turse's work was pointed out as partial, misleading, and flawed methodologically.\\" Gary Kulik contends that the works of Nick Turse and one of his mentors, Christian Appy, are overly-supportive of the official Vietnamese communist narrative of the war that attempts to erase any histories/memories of South Vietnam before and after the North Vietnamese communist government violated the 1972 Paris Peace Accord, attacked, and took over Saigon and the South Vietnam. In January 2016 Turse agreed to remove defamatory statements in the book that Thomas K. Equels and his unit the 48th Assault Helicopter Company knowingly killed civilians in a mission on 4 April 1972. U.S. military operations in Africa Noting that the U.S. Africa Command (Africom) contends that it maintains only a token presence on the African continent, Turse found recent U.S. military involvement with 49 African nations. He investigated the size and scope of U.S. military operations in Africa and concluded, \\"From north to south, east to west, the Horn of Africa to the Sahel, the heart of the continent to the islands off its coasts, the U.S. military is at work. Base construction, security cooperation engagements, training exercises, advisory deployments, special operations missions, and a growing logistics network, all undeniable evidence of expansion‚Äîexcept at U.S. Africa Command. In an investigation for The Intercept, Turse revealed U.S. Africa Command's previously unreported claims the African continent is home to almost 50 terrorist organizations and \\"illicit groups\\" that threaten U.S. interests. Kelley B. Vlahos, the managing editor at The American Conservative, called Turse \\"by far the most dogged reporter of the U.S. military operations in Africa.\\"  Special Operations Forces  Turse has carried out extensive investigations of the U.S. military's most elite troops. Turse uncovered that in 2014, elite U.S. troops were dispatched to 70 percent of the countries on the planet and were carrying out missions in 80 to 90 nations each day. In a 2015 article for The Nation, Turse revealed that under the Obama administration, U.S. special operations forces deployed to 147 countries that year. Turse followed up to show that elite forces like Navy SEALs and Army Special forces deployed to 138 nations in 2016. In 2017, Turse wrote an article that revealed U.S. special forces had already deployed to 137 countries by mid-year.  U.S. military training programs  In a major investigation carried out by 100Reporters and The Intercept, Turse revealed \\"...the largely unknown details of a vast constellation of global training exercises, operations, facilities, and schools‚Äîa shadowy network of U.S. programs that every year provides instruction and assistance to approximately 200,000 foreign soldiers, police, and other personnel.\\" Data leaked by a whistleblower showed that training was carried out at no fewer than 471 locations in 120 countries‚Äîon every continent but Antarctica‚Äîinvolving, on the U.S. side, 150 defense agencies, civilian agencies, armed forces colleges, defense training centers, military units, private companies, and NGOs, as well as the National Guard forces of five states. In a separate investigation, Turse analyzed the expansion of the U.S. military's Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) program, which is designed to train America's special operators in a variety of missions from \\"foreign internal defense\\" to \\"unconventional warfare\\". Analyzing government files, Turse found that U.S. troops carried out approximately one mission every two days in 2014. Navy SEALs, Army Green Berets, and others on 176 individual JCETs, a 13 percent increase from 2013. The number of countries involved jumped even further, from 63 to 87. In an earlier investigation for The Intercept, Turse revealed \\"that from 2012 to 2014 some of America's most elite troops‚Äîincluding Navy SEALs and Army Green Berets‚Äîcarried out 500 Joint Combined Exchange Training missions around the world\\", a number that the U.S. military had previously refused to reveal. Afghan War victims With journalists Robert Dreyfuss and Sarah Holewinski, Turse investigated civilian casualties in Afghanistan in a special issue of The Nation. They found that no agency or entity had tracked civilian casualties over the entire conflict. In 2008, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the U.S. military set up a Civilian Casualty Tracking Cell whose goal was to track and lower civilian casualties. According to Dreyfuss and Turse, most civilians who died in the conflict did so at the hands of the Taliban and its allies, but that many thousands of Afghan civilians had been killed by U.S. and allied forces. Columbine as revolutionary act In the winter 2000 issue of the journal 49th Parallel, Turse wrote of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre, \\"Who would not concede that terrorizing the American machine, at the very site where it exerts its most powerful influence, is a truly revolutionary task? To be inarticulate about your goals, even to not understand them, does not negate their existence. Approve or disapprove of their methods, vilify them as miscreants, but don't dare disregard these modern radicals as anything less than the latest incarnation of disaffected insurgents waging the ongoing American revolution.\\" Historian David Farber of Temple University wrote that Turse's assertion \\"only makes sense in an academic culture in which transgression is by definition political and in which any rage against society can be considered radical.\\" Recognition * 2016 Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. book award, Finalist. * 2016 American Book Award, for Tomorrow's Battlefield: U.S. Proxy Wars and Secret Ops in Africa. * 2016 New York Press Club Award for Special Event Reporting * 2016 Online Journalism Association Award for Investigative Data Journalism * 2009 Ridenhour Prize, for investigation into the killing of Vietnamese civilians by American troops during Operation Speedy Express * 2009 James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism * 2009 MOLLY National Journalism Prize honorable mention * 2006 Tom Renner Award for Outstanding Crime Reporting from Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc., Finalist Works * Turse, Nick.

In particular, they describe how the probability that a stochastic process is in a certain state changes over time. Diffusion processes vs. jump processes Writing in 1931, Andrei Kolmogorov started from the theory of discrete time Markov processes, which are described by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, and sought to derive a theory of continuous time Markov processes by extending this equation. He found that there are two kinds of continuous time Markov processes, depending on the assumed behavior over small intervals of time: If you assume that \\"in a small time interval there is an overwhelming probability that the state will remain unchanged; however, if it changes, the change may be radical\\" -Ben Shmase, then you are led to what are called jump processes. The other case leads to processes such as those \\"represented by diffusion and by Brownian motion; there it is certain that some change will occur in any time interval, however small; only, here it is certain that the changes during small time intervals will be also small\\". For each of these two kinds of processes, Kolmogorov derived a forward and a backward system of equations (four in all). History The equations are named after Andrei Kolmogorov since they were highlighted in his 1931 foundational work.Andrei Kolmogorov, \\"√úber die analytischen Methoden in der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung\\" (On Analytical Methods in the Theory of Probability), 1931, William Feller, in 1949, used the names \\"forward equation\\" and \\"backward equation\\" for his more general version of the Kolmogorov's pair, in both jump and diffusion processes.Feller, W. (1949) \\"On the Theory of Stochastic Processes, with Particular Reference to Applications\\", Proceedings of the (First) Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability pp 403-432. Much later, in 1956, he referred to the equations for the jump process as \\"Kolmogorov forward equations\\" and \\"Kolmogorov backward equations\\".William Feller, 1957. On Boundaries and Lateral Conditions for the Kolmogorov Differential Equations Other authors, such as Motoo Kimura referred to the diffusion (Fokker‚ÄìPlanck) equation as Kolmogorov forward equation, a name that has persisted.Kimura, Motoo (1957) \\"Some Problems of Stochastic Processes in Genetics\\", The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 28 (4), 882-901 The modern view *In the context of a continuous-time Markov process with jumps, see Kolmogorov equations (Markov jump process). In particular, in natural sciences the forward equation is also known as master equation. *In the context of a diffusion process, for the backward Kolmogorov equations see Kolmogorov backward equations (diffusion).

He, more than anyone, was held responsible for the uprising due to his brutal treatment of the sailors. He was killed during the mutiny.  Early career  Born in Reval (in the Russian Governorate of Estonia), Ippolit Giliarovsky, the son of a Russian Orthodox priest, joined the Imperial Navy as a cadet in 1883. He was promoted from midshipman to artillery lieutenant in 1889. After serving as a naval artillery staff officer with the Baltic Fleet Command Giliarovsky was appointed as a senior officer on the cruiser Gromoboy. Giliarovsky was decorated for his part in the Battle of Chemulpo Bay during the Russo-Japanese War. A strict disciplinarian Giliarovsky routinely brutalised sailors under his command, punching one of them in the face for not knowing his name. On 18 October 1904 he was transferred to the position of second in command on the battleship Potemkin.  On the Potemkin  Giliarovsky was made the executive officer on the Potemkin, a position which he interpreted as requiring spying on the crew and searching them regularly, along with administering punishment. Captain Evgeny Golikov (ru) actually complained to his superiors that Giliarovsky was too harsh. On 27 June [O.S. 14 June] 1905, the crew refused borscht made with maggoty beef. Gilirovsky demanded to know why they were only eating bread and butter. He informed the ship's Doctor Smirnov. Smirnov said: \\"I already told them the meat is fine. The maggots are nothing more than larvae eggs that flies had laid there. They simply need to be washed away with salt and water. The cook did this on my instructions. If the crew continues to refuse to eat, then it is they who are spoiled. That's it.\\" Gilirovsky then went to the captain, saying \\"We have to teach them a lesson.\\" The captain summoned the crew, threatening any who didn't accept the borscht. Giliarovsky screamed \\"Come on, come on, hurry up!\\" but only 12 came forward. The executive officer ordered the boatswain to take the names of those who refused. The ship's marine guards (armed sailors) were called while the ordinary crewmen scattered. Giliarovsky then shouted: \\"So it's mutiny is it? Alright we know how to deal with that. If you think there's no discipline in the navy, I'll show you how wrong you are. Bosun, bring the tarpaulin.\\" In the event of an on-board execution a tarpaulin was used to prevent the deck being stained. Some sailors armed themselves while the majority milled in shocked confusion. Giliarovsky grabbed a rifle from one of the marine guards and ordered the remainder to shoot. Followed by a junior officer he rushed at Grigory Vakulinchuk, a revolutionary ring-leader. Vakulinchuk fired at the two officers, killing the lieutenant. Giliarovsky then shot Vakulinchuk in the chest. The wounded mutineer wrestled the rifle from Giliarovsky before being shot in the back by a petty officer. Another revolutionary Afanasi Matushenko fired at the officers and missed. Giliarovsky ordered the marine guards to shoot but they dispersed into the chaotic crowd on deck. Matushenko and two other sailors shot down Giliarovsky and another officer. Giliarovsky's last words were \\"I know you, you scoundrel. You may escape from the ship now, but I'll find you.\\" He was tossed overboard by the sailors. Giliarovsky's body was found at sea by the marine transport Gonets in August 1905. Seven of the eighteen officers on the Potemkin were killed during the brief violence of the actual mutiny. These included Giliarovsky, Captain Golikov and Doctor Smirnov. Two sailors were also killed. The surviving officers were eventually put ashore except for three who for varying reasons chose to remain with the ship. Author Richard Hough gives a more favorable appraisal of Giliarovsky's orders during the mutiny. Hough argues that Giliarovsky took reasonable action to maintain order and discipline after the captain's weak response to the crew's refusal to eat the borscht. Giliarovsky's initial threat to shoot crew members was a bluff that exceeded his formal authority. When the majority of the crew under the leadership of Matushenko again refused to obey orders and became threatening, Giliarovsky felt compelled to try to carry through on his threat. According to Hough (pg. 23), \\"Discipline in the Imperial Navy was no more and no less severe than in the British or United States navies\\".  Personal life  Giliarovsky was married with one young daughter. Both were travelling on the naval transport Vekha when it was taken by sailors from the Potemkin, while approaching Odessa. They were treated considerately by the mutineers and put ashore with the officers of the Vekha.

Volume If the radius of the sphere is denoted by r and the height of the cap by h, the volume of the spherical sector is :V=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi r^2h}{3}\\\\,.

Litton transformed into a military producer, building entire naval ships in their private shipyards and installing their privately produced equipment including communications and navigation systems.Litton Industries, Company History Described as \\"the best known economic link between Canada and the nuclear arms race\\",Rosenblum, Simon. \\"Misguided Missiles: Canada, the Cruise and Star Wars\\", p. 147-148, the Rexdale, Etobicoke, Ontario plant of Litton Industries was announced in October 1978 as one of two locations in the world that would be responsible for the manufacture of the Terrain Contour Matching (TERCOM) guidance systems of the American Tomahawk cruise missile.Ottawa Citizen, \\"Litton Canada, a high technology company creating jobs as it creates world markets for its products\\", April 15, 1981The Evening Independent. \\"Bomb blast rips Toronto plant that makes U.S. missile systems\\", 10/15/1982 p. 3-A The Canadian federal government had given Litton a $26.4 million grant, in addition to a $22.5 million interest-free loan specifically to allow them to bid competitively for the contract, drawing complaints from some members of the public for using federal funds to further the arms race.Sherbrooke Forum, \\"Police arrest missile protestors\\", November 20, 1981 The American contract called for approximately 407 cruise missiles to be fitted with navigation systems by Litton Canada,Canadian Press, \\"Pleas for peace accompany tributes on Remembrance Day\\", November 12, 1981Financial Post, \\"Defence contracts offer lucrative targets\\", October 24, 1981Windsor Star, \\"US intervenes in deal for new fighter airplanes\\", Nov. 7, 1979 Planning On the night of July 27, 1982, a British Columbia Department of Highways explosives storehouse north of Squamish was entered, and 38¬Ω cases of dynamite were stolen. On September 13, a local hunter came upon two wooden structures that had been built in the forests of Garibaldi, near the site of the theft. One contained four reels of detonating cord and three boxes of electric blasting caps, and the other building held 28¬Ω cases of dynamite, as well as explosive gelatins. This indicates that ten crates of dynamite were not stored in the wooden structures, to which Direct Action members Brent Taylor and Ann Hansen held keys. The three associates stole a GMC van in the Greater Toronto Area on September 30, as well as an Oldsmobile and Chevrolet Chevelle three and four nights later respectively.British Columbia Court of Appeal, R. v Belmas, 27 C.C.C. (3d) 142, 1986 CarswellBC 642 On the morning of October 14, just hours before the bombing, the Ontario Court of Appeals ruled that five Litton executives from the plant could not be called to testify by the defence counsel of 22 anti-nuclear activists who had been arrested for trespassing one year earlier.Windsor Star, \\"Tip to Police\\", October 15, 1982Tri-City Herald\\", October 15, 1982, \\"Toronto Missile Parts Plant bombed\\" Execution of the bombing The bombing was carried out on October 14, 1982, using a van that was parked in a location partially concealed by shrubs, with a fluorescent \\"warning box\\" duct taped to the hood, displaying a message, a digital clock counting down, and a single stick of dynamite. Belmas called the security desk and warned them that a dynamite bomb was placed in a van outside the building, and that it would detonate \\"in 15 to 20 minutes\\". She also told the guards to evacuate the plant, phone the local hotels to warn guests to stay away from windows to avoid injury and to have police close down passing roadways to limit the damage to Litton Industries. The bomb detonated 11 minutes after the phone call. Informal speculation by a local police constable three weeks after the bombing proposed that if responding officers had used radios, their use may possibly have triggered the detonation early.\\"Police radio may have set off Litton bomb\\", November 4, 1982, Ottawa Citizen Police radio use was not subsequently identified as a contributing factor.

The remaining three pages were titled \\"Statement regarding the October 14 Litton Bombing\\" and included an explanation of the purpose of the bombing, as well as an apology for the injuries. Aftermath Although Litton Industries indicated that the bombing had not slowed production by more than a week, the bombing was hailed as a \\"massive success\\" by the anarchist movement who saw it as \\"an act of sabotage\\" against the American military machine. Although there was not wide public support for the bombing, Ann Hansen later pointed to the fact that 15,000 people attended a \\"Refuse the Cruise\\" demonstration two weeks after the bombing as evidence it had forced the public to confront Canada's role in the military‚Äìindustrial complex.Faith, Karlene. \\"13 Women: Parables from Prison\\", p. 234 Others have concurred that the bombing did galvanise the population, who viewed the bombing as controversial or unnecessary, but took to the streets in greatly strengthened numbers to protest Canada complicity in the production of instruments of war. A month after the bombing, 700 people showed up at the Litton Industries plant to engage in \\"civil disobedience\\" despite police warnings.Best, Steven. \\"Igniting a Revolution\\", p. 246 Ronald Keating, the president of Litton Systems Canada, released a statement following the event, stating that \\"Bombing is madness\\", a statement ridiculed as hypocritical for a man \\"overseeing the very profitable construction of U.S. bombs\\".Desroches, Leonard. \\"Allow the Water\\", p. 254 Following the bombing, Litton increased their security budget by $2 million, money that Keating said \\"was money which could be put into our business to help make us more competitive\\".Hansen, Ann. \\"Direct Action\\", p. 469 The day after the bombing, an anonymous male telephoned Garrett Manufacturing, another defense contractor housed several blocks away in the same Toronto neighbourhood, to report that a bomb had been placed in the building; leading to an evacuation of the 15 personnel on-shift. 16 years later, due to purely financial considerations, Litton Industries lost their government contract to build the navigation systems to Kearfott Guidance & Navigation. In October 1984, the Litton headquarters in Brussels were bombed by the Communist Combatant Cells led by Pierre Carette.Curts, Raymond J. \\"Building a Global Information Assurance Program\\", 2002. p. 61-62 Investigation Sgt.

The telephones of CMPC members, including Ken Hancock, were wiretapped for \\"some considerable time\\" according to Roy McMurtry, the Attorney General of Ontario. Hancock was also the subject of a police raid that seized four bags of documents, after his name surfaced in the diary of Ivan LeCouvie, another man who was arrested and then released by police.December 16, 1982. \\"Ottawa Citizen\\", 'Documents taken in Litton bomb probe by police' Trials Gerry Hannah, pictured, later told Maximumrocknroll that he and Belmas pleaded guilty to lessen their sentences since \\"the evidence was overwhelming, to put it mildly\\".Maximumrocknroll, Volume 15, 1984 Taylor, hailed as the \\"intellectual leader of the group\\" due to having written about the philosophy of guerrilla tactics and revolution, was sentenced to 9 years for the Litton bombing, to be served concurrently with the 22-year sentence he received for conspiracy to rob an armoured bank truck. Hansen, pleading guilty, was sentenced to 12 years for the Litton bombing, to be served concurrently with her life sentence for conspiracy to rob the bank truck, her six years for the bombing of the power station and several other mixed sentences for the firebombing of the pornography stores in Vancouver.Clearwater, John. \\"Just Dummies: Cruise Missile Testing in Canada\\", p. 105 Gerry Hannah and Doug Stewart, although sentenced to six and ten years respectively for other Direct Action activities, were not convicted of playing any role in the Litton bombing. Some defenders of the group have suggested that the accused plead guilty to ensure the trial was not about who committed the action, but \\"to turn the trials into a political showcase, trotting out the evils of nuclear power, pornography and cruise missiles for all to see\\".Dementlieu, Punk Archive: The Vancouver 5 The judge ruled that Hansen's life sentence was merited because \\"[her] only remorse or regret is for the injury you caused the ten Litton Systems victims\\" and that she did not apologise for any of the group's property damage. In arriving at the sentencing for the group, the judge declared > I have no doubt that all of these people are well-motivated people working, > if not struggling, against unfavourable odds to promote their respective > causes...[but] the message must be crystal clear. Our Canadian way of life > will not tolerate the use of fire, explosive substances or weapons as a > means to furthering even worthy objectives.

Biography Sidney's family lived on North Broadway in East Baltimore when he was born in 1916, but they moved to Lake Drive in Reservoir Hill in 1922. Sidney resided there until he died in 2007. During his time there the neighborhood's demographics shifted to being predominantly African- American. He graduated from Baltimore City College in 1935 and promptly began working for the family real estate business, S. Sakols & Sons. The company managed 25‚Äì30 properties, most of them in East Baltimore. Beginning in 1940, he served in the army for four and a half years, reaching the rank of master sergeant. However, he did not find the work he did for the army very fulfilling and stuck to the real-estate business thereafter. Sakols filed a lawsuit against Baltimore Transit Co. for overcrowded buses in 1950, but he lost his case. He twice ran unsuccessfully for Congress, once in 1958 for the Senate and then again in 1968 for the House of Representatives. Sakols founded the Save Lake Drive Committee in response to the construction of the Jones Falls Expressway and the widening of Lake Drive that resulted from construction. In one demonstration, he managed to personally halt the construction, though only temporarily. Sakols sang in the Baltimore Symphony Chorus and composed a song entitled \\"The Governor's March\\". According to his nephew, David M. Schimmel, \\"It was recorded by the Naval Academy Band and it was played for the inaugurations of Governors Tawes and McKeldin. But the song, much to his dismay, never became a regular part of the inauguration.\\" Also an opera enthusiast, Sakols invented an ‚ÄúIlluminating Magnifying Lens‚Äù for reading libretto without disturbing other attendees of the opera. Sakols was a Conservative Jew and belonged to the Chizuk Amuno Congregation. He remained a member of the congregation throughout his life, even after the congregation moved out to the Baltimore suburbs.

Hammond also speaks at conferences and universities about his work and blogs on The Huffington Post. Hammond, who from the age of four enjoyed a happy childhood in a group home founded by Moose International, began building playgrounds in college, founding KaBOOM! with a friend in 1996. He has received multiple honors and awards for his work, including the President's Volunteer Service Award. In 2011, Hammond released his best-selling memoir, KaBOOM! How One Man Built a Movement to Save Play. He was listed in the Forbes 2011 list of the top 30 social entrepreneurs and was named as a \\"Health hero\\" by WebMD. Early life Born in Jerome, Idaho, to a nursing home employee and a truck driver, Hammond is the seventh of eight children. Two years after Hammond's father abandoned the family, Hammond's mother had a breakdown and found herself unable to take care of the children, and they were sent as wards of the court to the Mooseheart Child City & School, a group home in Mooseheart, Illinois. During the 14 happy years he spent at the home before achieving the age of majority, he enjoyed his experiences on the group home's playground, and in his junior year at Ripon College first took part in helping to build a community playground, assisting the mother of a friend. The dyslexic Hammond did not complete college, but relocated to Chicago as part of an Urban Studies Fellowship through the Associated Colleges of the Midwest. There, he studied under Dr. John Kretzmann, director of the Assets Based Community Development Institute in the Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The institute, which focuses on mobilizing struggling communities using resources already at hand, would later serve as a community-build model for KaBOOM! After seeing the influence of the playground he had helped build on its community, Hammond also participated in the Columbus, Ohio, and Chicago engagements of City Year, an AmeriCorps program seeking to build democracy through citizen service and social entrepreneurship. KaBOOM! In 1995, shortly after he had moved to Washington, D.C., Hammond read a story in The Washington Post about two local children who suffocated while playing in an abandoned car because they had nowhere else to play. This, combined with his prior experiences, inspired Hammond and his friend Dawn Hutchison to address the need for playgrounds for children. The pair were already committed to designing a day of service for Youth Service America and chose to build their first playground at Livingston Manor in southeast Washington, D.C. The project, which involved over 500 volunteers, took five days in October, 1995. Darell Hammond at an event in July 2008 Inspired by the build, Hammond and Hutchison incorporated KaBOOM! in April 1996, though Hutchison would remain with the new organization for only a year. Hammond became the organization's CEO. When their initial outreach attempts to non-profit foundations proved unsuccessful, they turned to and found support from businesses, beginning with The Home Depot. With the assistance of the business community and Hillary Clinton, who donated money from the sale of her book It Takes a Village, KaBOOM! built 38 playgrounds in 1997. By 2002, the number had risen to 441, and KaBOOM!'s largest corporate partners included The Home Depot, Nike, Target, Computer Associates and Sprint.Wei-Skillern et al (2007), pp. 377-378. By 1 October 2010, the organization had completed 1,869 playgrounds. Hammond remained active in the organization, frequently visiting playground sites under construction or renovation by KaBOOM! around the United States and, in 2000, convincing ice cream manufacturer Ben & Jerry's to create the company's first flavor to be named after a non-profit organization, with an appeal for participation written on the label of the new Kaberry KaBOOM! and different incentives provided around the United States. After hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, Hammond pledged to provide 100 playgrounds in the region, a goal he and KaBOOM! surpassed, with 136 playgrounds built as of early September 2010. In 2007, Money magazine indicated that Hammond spent \\"75% of his work life attending builds, wooing donors, speaking at conferences, and trying to persuade lawmakers of the social value of play.\\" Hammond also attends conferences and universities as a speaker to discuss his work. In addition, he is a blogger at The Huffington Post. In 2015, Hammond stepped down as CEO from KaBOOM!, but continues to serve KaBOOM! in an advisory capacity. Memoir Hammond released a memoir, KaBOOM! How One Man Built a Movement to Save Play, in April 2011. Published in hardcover by Rodale, Inc., the book reached The New York Times' best-selling list for \\"Hardcover Nonfiction\\" in May, 2011, at #4. The book traces Hammond's life from childhood to CEO. Honors and awards Since launching KaBOOM!, Hammond has personally received a number of honors and awards, including the President's Volunteer Service Award. Diet Coke honored Hammond in 1999 as one of five winners of its national \\"Making a Difference Award\\". Hammond was named among the \\"40 Under 40\\" by Crain's Chicago Business. Hammond was elected to the Fellowship of Ashoka: Innovators for the Public in 2003. In 2004, he was named among the \\"Power and Influence Top 50\\" by Non-Profit Times. In 2008, Hammond was honored by the Jefferson Awards for Public Service for \\"Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged\\" and by the New York University Stern School of Business with its \\"Satter Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award\\". In 2010, Hammond received the first American Express NGen Leadership Award, given to recognize professionals under 40 in the nonprofit sector who have had a transformative impact on a socially critical issue, and was also honored by the Washington Business Journal among its \\"40 Under 40\\" to recognize \\"the Washington region's brightest young business leaders\\". In 2008, Ripon University bestowed upon him an honorary degree. He was listed in the Forbes 2011 list of the top 30 social entrepreneurs and was named as a \\"Health hero\\" by WebMD.

Although Portugal was one of the first European presences in Africa, Portuguese influence remained coastal and trade-oriented until the late 1800s, early 1900s; \\"control of the hinterland was non- existent, even in the 19th century\\", but with increased competition between European powers, the Portuguese \\"became more aggressively engaged\\", and adopted ideals of assimilation.Keese (2006), pp. 27-28.  Laws and administration  Portuguese colonial laws had general and specific contexts for each of the colonies of Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea; \\"some of the legislation and policies the Portuguese implemented reflected their empire-wide preoccupations, [while] others reflected their concerns specifically with the colony\\".Heywood (2000), p. 64. In Angola, for instance, the procedure started with the applicant proving his ability to speak and write Portuguese; show that he had a source of income; and, pay a fee. The applicant must also furnish a number of documents and certificates. The Organic Charter of Guinea enacted in 1917 also stipulated that the applicant must show proof of dedication to the interest of Portugal. In other African colonies, authorities required that natives live in a \\"European manner.\\" A historical account even cited a covert surveillance system that monitored and ensured that assimilated parents do not teach their children any of the African languages. The role of the Department of Native Affairs, which was formed in 1914, had empire-wide effects; its purpose was \\"to classify the African population into \\"civilized\\" or assimilated (assimilado), and \\"non- civilized\\" or nonassimilated (n√£o-assimilado) to facilitate recruiting and to designate who were collaborators\\", which effectively initiated the legal distinction of assimilados throughout the colonial empire.Heywood (2000), p. 39. Two laws, the Estatuto Politico, Civil, e Criminal dos indigenas das col√≥nias de Angola, Guin√© e Mo√ßambique (Political, Criminal, and Civil Statute of the Natives of Angola, Guinea, and Mozambique) of 1926, which was revised as the Acto Colonial (Colonial Act) of 1930, and the Lei Org√¢nica do Ultramar (Organic Law of the Colonies) in 1954, explained the \\"subordinate but vital role the colonies and colonial peoples were to play in the new Portuguese Empire, and the duty of the government towards the \\"native\\" populations\\".Keese (2006), p. 54. The Portuguese colonial empire hoped that the assimilados would set an example for the rest of the Black Africans of the colonies to shift towards civilization; the Portuguese thus afforded some of the assimilados governmental roles, \\"as long as they were kept outside of 'anarchic democratic structures'\\".Keese (2006), pp. 92, 102.  Education and religion  Education and religion both were integral parts in the process of assimilation and the qualification for the status of assimilado. Beyond just the studying of Portuguese language and culture, the actual adoption of Portuguese culture as one's own, including the adoption of Christianity and the emulation of European and Portuguese ideals, was integral.Heywood (2000), pp. 55, 102.Keese (2006), pp. 92-93. Only through being Portuguese in every facet of life, from language to schooling to personal association, could one be considered a useful tool in society, and thus be afforded special rights.Keese (2006), p. 92.  Legal loopholes  Although the Portuguese conceded certain written rights to the assimilados, because of the authoritarian nature of the Portuguese government, \\"the status of 'assimilado' did not give these Africans explicit political rights\\".Keese (2006), p. 293. The Portuguese thus did not fear that assimilados would be \\"potential competitors\\" that might endanger \\"their predominant position\\". Since \\"the Portuguese colonial system could utilize more authoritarian instruments\\", the government could give assimilados jobs in the government, thus affording a small amount of protection to the assimilados, and proving to the international world the accommodating nature of their colonial rule, while not having to feel threatened by the educated assimilados in administrative jobs.Keese (2006), pp. 104, 296.  Motivations for assimilation   Lusotropicalism and a \\"civilizing mission\\"  The Portuguese were certainly not the only colonizing power to stress a \\"civilizing mission\\" (miss√£o civilizadora) as the central tenet of colonial expansion; the Portuguese elite, alongside many in power in most of the colonizer countries, believed that their country's \\"presence was a means to advance 'primitive peoples', to bring them knowledge and some kind of protection and welfare\\".Keese (2006), p. 46. However, the additional notion of assimilation adds a specific element to the motivations of Portugal's colonizing government. The notion of lusotropicalism, which posited a \\"multicultural image (lustropicalismo), with its emphasis on the mutuality and intermingling of African, Afro-Portuguese (creole), and Portuguese institutions\\" was introduced as New State propaganda displaying the ideal Portuguese colonialism, but the reality of Portugal's colonial institutions lay far from that ideal.  Reality  > In this perspective, Portuguese rhetoric, which stressed the luso-tropical > myth of a particular affinity to non-European cultures, including the > emergence of mesti√ßo populations and an easy way to assimilation, appears as > pure and voluntary hypocrisy. The myth would have been created to hide the > abuses inherent in the colonial system.Keese (2006), pp. 152-153. The myth was created during the Salazar regime, paralleling the motivations of the Catholic Church, to assure Portugal's stronghold in Africa ‚Äì to entrench the Empire into colonial Africa.Isaacman, Allen and Barbara (1983). Mozambique: From Colonialism to Revolution, 1900-1982, p. 39. Boulder: Westview Press, Inc. . The direct consequences of this myth of lusotropicalism and Portugal's supposed civilizing mission, present themselves in the form of direct and irrefutable contradictions of the ideals preached by the Portuguese colonizing government; despite the \\"white man's burden\\" of Portugal to civilizing and educating the Africans under its colonial rule, over the span of its five centuries of presence and influence in its African colonies, the Portuguese colonial government and educational system of Mozambique failed to train even one African doctor, and its other two colonies fared equally as poorly, with lowering life-expectancies as proof.Rodney, Walter (1972). How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, p. 206. London: Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications. .  View/treatment by Portuguese over time   African \\"inferiority\\"  It became clear that, although promoting the ideal of lusotropicalism to the world, Portugal viewed African superstition and magical practices as proof that the African culture and African mind was inferior, and thus should not truly be integrated into the Portuguese way of life and governance; thus, the Portuguese strove to limit the education and assimilation of Africans.Keese (2006), pp. 292-293. The Portuguese also saw this inferiority as irreversible and inevitable, claiming that unlike Portugal, Africa has only just begun its journey towards \\"civilization\\".Isaacman (1983), p. 40. Thus, Africans were supposedly not going to abandon their superstitions and be fit for the consideration of assimilation, further proving the hypocrisy of the Portuguese colonial government and its empty propaganda.  Restrictions on obtaining assimilado status  With increased time spent in the colonies, Portugal made it increasingly more difficult for the status of assimilado to be reached; after the Second World War in colonial Angola, the New State, the Portuguese regime, decided to alter the requirements necessary for the acquisition of assimilado status, making it more difficult to do so, and thus minimizing actual African presence in government and society; for example, in the Colonial Statute of 1954, in order to be considered for assimilado status, one needed to \\"have a Catholic baptismal certificate, obtain a civil marriage license, secure a Portuguese sponsor, be employed in a \\"civilized\\" job, and live like a Portuguese. By 1958 the entire process cost $100 (U.S.),\\" effectively making it near to impossible for such a status to be reached.Heywood (2000), p. 118. Due to the extremely rigid requirements, obtaining Portuguese citizenship proved to be so difficult that by 1958, there were only 30,089 assimilados out of the 4,392,000 total population of Angola. The number was smaller in Mozambique, which had 4,353 assimilados in the same period out of its 6,234,000 total population.  Restrictions once assimilated  For those very few Africans who were able to gain assimilado status, it can be argued whether or not their lives were improved in any appreciable amount; assimilados did not gain cultural integration into Portuguese society, and even with their education and increased status, their white, illiterate Portuguese settler counterparts in the colonies had full, unquestioned rights ‚Äì all in all, equal rights and civil status were out of the question.Heywood (2000), p. 119. Using the example of the Ovimbundu Protestant assimilados as proof, assimilados in the colonies were not given any appreciable amount of cultural, social or political equality: > In [areas with increased settler populations], Ovimbundu Protestant > assimilados faced residential discrimination, were unable to compete for > places in government and privately run schools, and rarely had opportunities > to socialize with whites and Afro-Portuguese in the private and public > clubs, theaters, beaches, and other places that catered to the \\"civilized\\" > population. Like the masses of Angola's \\"uncivilized\\" Africans, they resided > in the slums (muceques) with none of the access to the public services which > their taxes were supposed to provide. Yet they had to adopt the lifestyle of > the settlers, pay to send their children to non-government Protestant > schools, pay for licenses, and pay residence, and other taxes, while still > enduring daily indignities such as carrying identity papers as proof of > their urban residence. While assimilated citizens did have access to the benefits of the Portuguese law, they were not granted a position of equality with white Portuguese. Aside from discrimination, an assimilado had to carry an identity card proving his citizenship and must endure lower pay for the same work done by a white person. These prompted Eduardo Mondlane, the late leader of Mozambique Liberation Front, to describe the assimilado system as nothing but a mechanism to create a few \\"honorary whites.\\"  Cultural identity  Due to their assumption of Portuguese culture while being subject to non-Portuguese influence from their native African societies that they lived in, it is undoubted that assimilados faced difficulty in defining their cultural identity. Oftentimes, assimilados were left devoid of true culture ‚Äì for they were never truly accepted into Portuguese society, and with the abandonment of African ideals, were ostracized from African society.Heywood (2000), pp. 120-121 Occasionally, assimilados held on to the customs and traditions followed by their non-assimilated counterparts. However, there were many assimilados who \\"defined themselves as 'educated Black Portuguese' and nothing more\\".Keese (2006), p. 50. With the start of the revolution for independence, this debate of identity and loyalty of the assimilados came seriously into play, and many times, the locally run, African-based revolutionary groups attacked the notion of assimilados and viewed them as traitors to the cause of national liberation.Keese (2006), p. 105.  In the fight for independence  Assimilated and educated Africans played an important role in the fight for liberation, but since UNITA and UPA were both local-run, unity was hard to achieve; \\"the indications Mabeko Tali gives us for the East of Angola, where the MPLA armed front split in two because of incompatible attitudes between a local leadership and intellectual radicals, suggest that major gaps existed between 'educated militants' and the peasants of the Angolan interior\\".Keese (2006), p. 34. As educated Africans present during the time of revolution against the Portuguese regime, it can be assumed that assimilados would inevitably play a role in the struggle for liberation; however, the important role of the assimilado was possibly one more of internal fission and weakening of the anti-colonial resistance movement, than one of unified fight for independence against a dictatorial regime.Heywood (2000), p. 153. Although there was a relatively large portion of assimilados that did not fight on the side of Africans in the struggle for liberation, the presence and contributions of assimilados were integral, especially in the formation of the MPLA, which was formed from the amalgamation of an assimilado group with organizations of cultural nationalists and anti-government forces including the communist party of Angola.Heywood (2000), p. 129.

Historically, the grape was believed to be a clone of the Campanian grape Coda di Volpe but DNA analysis has shown that the two grapes are instead distinct varieties.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 185 Allen Lane 2012 History The name Caprettone may be derived from the Italian word for goat, capra. Ampelographers believe that the name Caprettone may be derived from the Italian capra which means goat and could be a reference to the historical role of shepherds in grape growing in southern Italy or to the characteristic shape of Caprettone clusters which can resemble a goat's beard. DNA analysis has revealed that Caprettone is closely related to the red Campanian grape Piedirosso (pictured). For many years, Caprettone was assumed to be a clone of Coda di Volpe but DNA analysis in the early 21st century showed that the two grapes are distinct varieties and that, instead, Caprettone was closely related to the red Campanian wine grape Piedirosso and the white Ginestra. It was also speculated that Catalanesca and Uva Rosa may also be related to Caprettone but DNA results from 2005 showed no close relationship between those varieties and Caprettone. Viticulture Caprettone is an early to mid-ripening grape variety that is usually harvested in Campania in mid to late September. The grape is noted for being able to maintain moderate acidity levels even in the warm climate of southern Italy. Wine regions For the 2000 census, Caprettone was still officially recognized as a clone/synonym for Coda di Volpe, which had reported, so the exact number of plantings for the grape is not known. Ampelographers believe that true Caprettone is mostly isolated to the province of Napoli where 15 villages around Mount Vesuvius have had a long history of production with the grape.

History One such barge is called the Dracone Barge invented in 1956. Other similar devices are the Spragg Bag invented in the 1980s, the water bag proposed by Nordic Water Supply in the late 1990s and the more recent REFRESH modular waterbag, developed in the 2010s. Terry Spragg of Manhattan Beach, California, builds flexible fabric barges for the transportation of bulk fresh water and is the reason why his product is referred to as the \\"Spragg Bag.\\"Waterbag web-site In the 1970s Spragg was a promoter of icebergs as a large source of fresh water, but soon realized this was impractical.New times, Volume 11, p. 62, Newspaper \\"Trud\\", 1978, University of Michigan, Google Digitized Jan 30, 2008 He then put his skills into developing the waterbag technology starting in the 1980s. Spragg has worked on and perfected this over the last twenty years with his associates. The first field test of his waterbag was in December 1990.Waterbag History and Technology The waterbag was long and it contained approximately of fresh water. It was towed from the Port Angeles harbor in the state of Washington. Another test was done in 1996 with a voyage from Port Angeles to Seattle, Washington.Gleick, p. 203 This test ended on April 29 when the fabric of one of the two bags under tow developed a tear. Spragg says that his next goal is to run another test voyage demonstration between Northern and Southern California and a demonstration of the waterbag technology in the Middle East as well as around the world. There are various reasons why it has been difficult to gain support for demonstrating the viability of waterbag technology in California and around the world.Aguanomics: Persistance [sic] ‚Äì and Baggs, February 14, 2009Aguanomics: Fear and Water Managers, September 18, 2009 Spragg claims when two waterbags pass underneath the Golden Gate Bridge for the first time in history the media will let the whole world know about it.Emily Bouckaert Freshwater Delivery in the Wake of Natural Disasters, Circle of Blue, March 25, 2010San Francisco Chronicle, August 6, 1999Gulf oil spill: Should the U.S. Army Corps start dredging?, Los Angeles Times ‚Äì Environment, May 20, 2010 A novel, Water, War, and Peace, has been completed that details the solutions waterbag technology offers to the complex political problems surrounding water issues throughout the Middle East, the United States, and the world.Water, War, and Peace (a novel)Water, War, and Peace by Terry G. Spragg & Associates, 1996 Nordic Water Supply waterbag The Norwegian company Nordic Water Supply developed a 10.800 m3 bag in 1997 under an agreement with the Turkish government to transport freshwater to Northern Cyprus. Within two years at least 7 million m3 of water had to be delivered annually at a cost of ‚Ç¨2.7M per year, with volumes growing over time, but the actual transport only amounted to 4 million m3 in four years and the contract was discontinued by Turkish authorities. As a result, NWS went out of business and was de-listed from the Oslo Stock Exchange in 2003. NSW's waterbag technology was acquired by the Monohakobi Institute of Technology in Japan. 184x184px The REFRESH waterbag was developed by a consortium of companies and research institutes from Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey and the Czech Republic within two European FP7 projects, REFRESH (running from 2010 to 2012) and the follow-up XXL-REFRESH (running from 2013 to 2015). The first project was focused on validation of the concept of modular waterbag; it developed a small scale prototype of 200 m3 capacity, tested in Greece in 2012. The second project was focused on scale-up and partial redesign of the REFRESH system. At the end of the second project the REFRESH waterbag concept reached commercial scale and a 2500 m3 system made of five 500m3 modules was tested offshore Spain in 2015. The length of the waterbag was 60 m long. The REFRESH concept is different from concepts of waterbag proposed earlier, based on huge monolithic containers (as the one proposed by Nordic Water Supply) or \\"trains\\" of smaller containers each one being sealed in itself (as the Spragg bag). The REFRESH waterbag is made of a series of modules, each one being a cylinder open at both bases, joined by watertight zippers. This makes it possible to perform all \\"dry\\" operations on ground at the level of single modules, overcoming the handling problems of monolithic containers and improves the behaviour in navigation with respect to the \\"trains\\" of connected bags. Technology Flexible barge filled with fresh water 168x168px The 1995 associated Spragg patents (#5,413,065 and #5,488,921) indicate that the inventions relate to a flexible fabric barge technology or combination of several bargesWater imports using ocean routes, Section 1.4.3 Water Bags made of a rubber polyurethane material. The main body portion of a flexible fabric barge is cylindrical in shape. The barge can be used by itself or as several connected flexible fabric barges that can be towed through the open ocean under extreme conditions. The patents further explain that the goal of Spragg's inventions are a practical water delivery system of fresh drinkable water that could be delivered to dry regions worldwide that have a shortage of potable water. One of the flexible fabric barge concepts aims at an economical delivery system for fresh water that would be considerably cheaper than desalination plants, rigid ships, tanker trucks, conventional barges, aqueducts or pipeline transport. Waterbags are more economical and better for the environment than desalination of the seas and oceans.Desalination vs. Waterbags The flexible fabric barge is a plastic container that is buoyant. It can be linked together with an attachment system to other flexible fabric barges to make a \\"train.\\" The \\"waterbags\\", which are sometimes referred to as balloons or bladders, are made up of a vinyl lining inside a stronger material net.Seattle Times-News, Feb 20, 1994, p. 30 Floating a plan to ship fresh water to California It is a type of \\"fabric water pipeline\\" when several are strung together for transport of liquids by tugboat through seas or open oceans to remote locations.Lawrence Journal-World ‚Äì April 27, 1996 p. 4 Zipper Zippers play an important part in extending the capacity of the waterbag beyond what is practically achievable by a single textile piece. The Spragg and REFRESH concepts both feature prominently zippers, albeit with a fundamental difference in its function. In the Spragg design, large waterbags are connected together like boxcars in a \\"train\\" fashion to increase the amount of liquids delivered at a time. It is estimated that the flexible barges could be as large as 14 meters in diameter and 150 meters in length, holding up to 17,000 cubic meters of fresh water or any other transportable liquid. Theoretically as many as 50 to 60 \\"waterbags\\" could be connected to one another and towed, although such a test has not been done to date. 173x173pxEngineers suggest that the fabric barge can hold a \\"train\\" of of liquids. A zipper coupler system is 10 times stronger than what is pulled by a 4,300 hp tug.Bulk Water Exports ‚Äì Status Report, May 11, 2010 Laborde Marine estimates a 4,300 horsepower tug with a bollard pull of 110,000 pounds can pull a \\"train\\" of fifty or so flexible barges weighing up to 1,300,000 tons. The \\"train\\" speed would be about 3 knots. This is over of fresh water or other liquid per trip. In the REFRESH design, the container itself is assembled on shore starting from planar cuts of fabric. Zippers run all along the perimeter of the fabric and make it possible to join an indefinite number of modules. Since each module is not closed by itself, zippers need to be watertight in order to ensure that no seawater leaks in. Invention Spragg Flexible barges coupled with zippers The basic invention is a device for the delivery of huge amounts of fresh water (700,000 to in each bag) at one time in a hostile wind and wave environment typical of oceans and large seas. Since freshwater is lighter than seawater the filled \\"bladders\\"Giant water bags proposed to quench a dry planet's thirst, The Seattle Times, reprinted by Lawrence Journal ‚Äì World ‚Äì Apr 27, 1996, p. 4 The giant bladders, each which holds .... (as they are sometimes referred toWestneat, The giant bladders, each of which holds , or as much water as 45,000 Seattleites use in a day, would form a flexible \\"fabric water pipeline\\" through the ocean.FRESH WATER ‚Äì BY THE BAG INVENTION WILL HELP WORLD'S DRY REGIONS, MILLIONAIRE SAYS.) float on top, similarly to icebergs, with little above the surface and most below the surface. Fresh water can be taken from rivers just before it discharges into salty seas or oceans, which then would not interfere with salmon spawning. The associated coupler and zipper patent describes that to be economically feasible there should be several such flexible barges towed at one time. The greater the volume of water that can be delivered per trip, the better the economics. This string of barges would typically consist of barges in size from 25 to in diameter and 200 to in length each. The unique characteristic of the Spragg Bag system is not the large volume of water in each bag, but what is called the world's strongest zipper (produced by Italian company Ziplast) that allows connection of several bags together in long trains.WATERBAG TECHNOLOGY AND INTER-STATE WATER TRANSFERS The large connecting zipper can be operated manually or by remote control with radio signals. The string of such flexible fabric \\"waterbags\\" may be coupled to a barge via a reinforced fabric nose cone where a tow line is attached. The REFRESH scheme is enabled by a specialty zipper, again developed by Ziplast, that uses a completely different tooth engagement design able to keep the strength of the original \\"Spragg\\" zipper while adding watertightness. Tests performed by the Spanish research centre AIMPLAS have confirmed that the zipper is able to stay watertight even when in tension. Each \\"waterbag\\" is generally filled to 80-90% capacity (so that it is not stiff and remains able to adapt to deformations when turning) and is flat across its top. Economics per year waterbag loading system designed by CH2M-HILL One San Francisco area reporter writes that waterbag technology would provide economical fresh water delivery to the Monterey Peninsula district and a solution to the shortage of fresh water in the area. He reports that the average family of four uses one acre-foot of water a year. This costs over $1000 for delivery using conventional methods, however this same amount of water delivered by Spragg Bags would cost about 30% less. Another newspaper reporter explains that towing Spragg Waterbags is environmentally friendly and is more economical than carrying water in ships or water tanker trucks or even using conventional rigid pipelines. An article in the July issue of ECONOMIST Magazine in 2008 explains that worldwide there is enough water for all, however most is often in the wrong place at the wrong time and it is just too expensive to transport.ECONOMIST Magazine, July 19, 2008, Water A soluble problem. Waterbag technology offers an easy and inexpensive solution to the problem of today's expensive conventional water transportation. It eliminates the difficulty of transporting water long distances by using the ocean as the means of transport. Waterbags considerably lower the capital costs and operating costs of moving fresh water from place to place. If a train was able to only move one or two box cars at a time, rather than in a train of dozens of boxcars at a time, it would not be very efficient and extremely expensive. Linking waterbags into \\"trains\\" of strings of waterbags and moving them through the ocean increases the economics of water transportation making it a viable practical option. The cost to transport water 300 to through the ocean, based on deliveries of to , is estimated to be between $350 to $450 per acre foot, depending on the length of the voyage and the amount of water delivered per trip. Increasing the amount of water delivered per day in each waterbag train will help to significantly reduce the cost of the water delivered. Once the reliability of the waterbag delivery system has proven its economics and reliability it will just be a matter of adding more waterbags to the trains, and more trains to the system in order to increase the amount of water delivered to selected locations, while also reducing the cost of the water delivered. Based on the increasing reliability of the waterbag delivery system over time, it should be possible to be able to economically deliver 100,000's of acre feet per year to many coastal locations around the world.Gleick, p. 205 According to the inventor of the Spragg bag, the total cost of delivering fresh water down the California coast by his waterbag technology for a distance of from British Columbia to Monterey would cost about $966 per acre- foot per year. Keith Spain in a study for a Master Of Arts then shows in an analysis that it would save the residents of the Monterey Peninsula some $1,134 per-acre foot otherwise using a desalination plant. This is a savings of over $19 million per year for the Monterey taxpayers. This number assumes a usage of approximately per year (17,000 X $1,134 = $19,278,000 savings).Monterey Institute of International Studies Master of Arts in Commercial Diplomacy by Keith Spain Applications Flexible barge with camera crew on top filming an actual application. One application seen is in the Middle East where large quantities of fresh water that are available in the Turkey region could be delivered to other places around the Mediterranean Sea that have an extreme shortage of drinkable fresh water, like Israel and Gaza.Westneat, The San Diego Union ‚Äì Tribune, April 28, 1996. p. A-3Popular Mechanics, March 1997, \\"Tech Update\\" Water goes by water Spragg believes that delivering fresh drinking water to water-poor nations can promote world peace.Fridell, p. 61 Israeli President Shimon Peres has written a letter in support of implementing a demonstration of Spragg Bag technology in the Mediterranean Sea as a tool for helping to bring Peace to the Middle East. In this letter President Peres states, \\"The draft of WATER, WAR AND PEACE written as a novel is in my view an original approach to highlight this grave problem and its solutions, that will pave the path to a better and more peaceful region. Your efforts to embark on a demonstration voyage to enlighten us all, both regarding the technological viability as well as cost, will surely contribute to meet the critical dilemma.\\"Shimon Letter He also points out that using waterbags towed through the Mediterranean Sea would be much more economical than transporting water through pipeline systems.Waterbag technology may help solve water crisis in Middle East , Today's Zaman, March 20, 2009 This view is shared by the REFRESH consortium. Waterbags have been proposed to be used for emergency purposes in order to link the Gulf Cooperation Counsel countries' desalination plants all along the Persian Gulf coast.Who has a spare $1m to prove that water can float?, The National, September 24, 2009 Another application is the regular delivery of fresh water over long distance routes. Proposed routes include from the state of Washington to dry regions of Southern California, from Mad River in Northern California to the San Francisco areaCup runneth Over, The journal, Humboldt County, California, cover story by Heidi Walters, Oct 22, 2009 and from Southern Chile to Atacama.

It would establish an economically sound new industry for bulk fresh water transport. An analysis of the economic and environmental advantages for waterbag technology by using the ocean currents from the Tully River to Brisbane, Queensland has been completed. On the Gold Coast the Tugan desalination plant is being built to supply 120 megaliters of drinking water daily at a cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Operation of the Tugan desalination plant will produce 235,000 tons of CO2 greenhouse gases annually. Preliminary cost estimates indicate that using waterbag technology to deliver the same amount of water from the Tully river to the Gold Coast may be 30 times less expensive than desalination, and that waterbag technology may emit 60 times less greenhouse gas. These figures suggest that waterbag technology would deliver water for much less cost than the proposed pipeline from the Burdekin River to Brisbane which is projected to cost approximately $7.5 billion for infrastructure and about $250 million for annual operation.Ian Edmonds Northern River Water for Australian Cities Spragg has proposed to the White House the idea of a peace offering in the Middle East by supplying 20 to 30 of his waterbags with fresh water and transport them from Turkey to the Palestinians and Israelis. The technology could also be used for the collection of Australia's factory waste water outputs, storm water, and sewerage for processing and reuse.Liz Penford speech  See also  * International trade and water * Water transportation * Flexible intermediate bulk container Footnotes Sources * Barlow, Maude, Blue Gold: The Battle Against Corporate Theft of the World's Water, Earthscan, 2003, * Fridell, Ron, Protecting Earth's Water Supply, Lerner Publications, 2008, * Gleick, Peter H.; The world's water: the biennial report on freshwater resources, Volume 1998, pp. 203-205, Spragg Waterbags, * Lawrence Journal- World ‚Äì April 27, 1996; Giant water bags proposed to quench a dry planet's thirst * McCabe, Michael, San Francisco Chronicle, August 6, 1999; Full of Holes, or in the Bag * Snitow, Alan, Thirst: fighting the corporate theft of our water, Publisher John Wiley and Sons, 2007, * Westneat, Danny, The San Diego Union ‚Äì Tribune, San Diego, Calif.:Apr 28, 1996. p.

He was returned to Parliament for Horsham in 1747, a seat he held until 1763, when he succeeded his uncle George Ingram, 8th Viscount of Irvine in the viscountcy. This was a Scottish peerage and did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords although he was forced to resign his seat in Parliament as Scottish peers were barred from sitting in the House of Commons. He was also a Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales from 1756 to 1760 and 1760 to 1763 (after the Prince had succeeded to the throne as George III).

They had five daughters. The eldest daughter, the Honourable Isabella Ingram, married the 2nd Marquess of Hertford and also became the mistress of the Prince of Wales, later George IV. In the 1760s Charles employed Capability Brown to re-landscape the park at Temple Newsam. The work was continued by his widow, who rebuilt the south wing and lived at Temple Newsam until her death in 1807. There is a portrait of Charles, 9th Viscount Irwin, by Benjamin Wilson, in the collections at Temple Newsam.Portrait of Charles Ingram, 9th Viscount Irwin, by Benjamin Wilson, see Art UK, Leeds Museums and Galleries/Bridgeman Images.

They named him Hemene Ka-Wan,, meaning Old Wolf. His published studies were anthropological, documenting the culture and history of the tribes. He became politically active as he represented the Plateau Native Americans against mistreatment by the United States federal government. He published accounts to report this mistreatment known to the public. He was considered an amateur in his day, but today his anthropology studies are deemed important enough to have a permanent home in Washington State University's special collections department. Current scholars describe his work as \\"significant\\" in his field, and helping to preserve the cultural heritage of the Native American tribes of the Columbia Basin. His papers are an \\"essential and valued resource\\", and the collection of his papers is \\"widely and intensively used.\\" After more than 60 years, the work he did remains \\"extremely valuable for outreach and teaching purpose.\\" A reviewer of the new biography, Voice of the Old Wolf: Lucullus Virgil McWhorter and the Nez Perce Native Americans, in the Universe Magazine, Spring 1997, quoted the author, Alanna Kathleen Brown, as saying that McWhorter was an \\"amazingly interesting, courageous, dedicated, and insightful man.\\" Of his accomplishments, she said: \\"McWhorter dedicated his energies to comprehending the cultures of the Native American tribes who surrounded him, and he committed himself to recounting the legends and epic personal stories of those he saw passing. McWhorter also continually argued for fair treatment and decency towards Native Americans whenever he could be an advocate.\\" Biography Early life Lucullus V. McWhorter was born on January 29, 1860 as one of twelve children to Reverend John Minion McWhorter and Rosetta (nƒóe Marple) McWhorter in Harrison County, Virginia (an area later admitted into the union as a part of the state of West Virginia). From his childhood on, Lucullus rejected a formal education and adapted his own methods of learning through his love for nature and the outdoors. He explored historical and Native American sites and began to read widely in history and the emerging field of archeology. As a teenager, he started working in his father's beef cattle business, and had this as a part of his life in his following decades. He married Adelia A. Swisher on March 17, 1883, and together they had three children: Ovid Tullius (born 1884), Iris Oresta (born 1886), and Virgil Oneco (born 1888). His wife Adelia died in the winter of 1893. The widower married again in 1895. In 1897, the family moved west, from Upshur County, West Virginia to Darke County, Ohio. Here, McWhorter continued his work as a farmer and rancher; he also continued his deep study of Native American tribes. He combined wide reading and research with engaging the Native American peoples and learning about their cultures. His studies of Native American tribes of West Virginia were significant to documenting their histories; he founded the journal, The American Archaeologist, with A. C. Gruhlke and J. R. Nissley to further his research. But McWhorter had his sights set on the American West. McWhorter and the Yakama Native Americans McWhorter left Fort Jefferson, Ohio on February 26, 1903 and headed west to settle in Yakima, Washington (called North Yakima until 1918). He arrived in April and set up a ranch on the outskirts of North Yakima on the Yakima River, where he was located on a trail connecting the town to the nearby Yakima Indian Reservation. \\"Anyone from the reservation with any business in town soon found the McWhorter place a convenient spot to camp, and the eager McWhorter began to make friends almost at once among the Yakamas.\\" McWhorter closely observed the Yakama culture and spiritualism, which he found to be simple and inviting. He began to question his own Christianity, which he ultimately renounced, and began a comparative study between different religions.Aulst, Nelson A. The Papers of Lucullus Virgil McWhorter (Friends of the Library: State College of Washington, 1959), 5-7. McWhorter‚Äôs frequent contact with the Yakama led to his championing their struggles against federal officials and white settlers. The plight of the Yakama Native Americans had been well established by the time McWhorter arrived in Washington. In 1855 various Native American leaders in Washington State had signed treaties with territorial governor Isaac Stevens, ceding their lands to the federal government and agreeing to move into reservations. The Yakima Native American reservation was one of three established during this time. The treaty guaranteed the Yakama rights to their land; however, following publicity about discovery of gold in the area, miners soon converged on the Yakama reservation. The Yakama War ensued, from 1855 to 1858. It ended in 1858 with the defeat of the Yakama by United States forces. As the years progressed, whites continued to encroach on the Yakama reservation. In 1887 Congress passed the Dawes Allotment Act, which provided for allotment of communal Native American lands in reservations to individual households in plots of 160 acres, sized for subsistence farming. It was another effort to force their assimilation to western farming styles. The government termed any lands left over after this distribution as \\"surplus\\" and allowed its sale to white settlers. This broke up the community of the reservation, and many whites worked to acquire even Yakama holdings. In 1906, US Senator Wesley L. Jones from Washington proposed a bill in Congress to require the Yakama to give up three-fourths of their remaining land in exchange for irrigation rights.McWhorter, Lucullus Virgil. \\"The Crime Against the Yakamas\\". North Yakima: Republic Print. 1913. Page 2, Box 2. in Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC), Washington State University. Seeing that the odds were against the Yakama, McWhorter quickly took action. McWhorter befriended Yoom-Tee-Bee, Chief of the Yakama, and sought to aid the people in their fight to preserve their rights and land. Together, the two rode on horseback across the Yakama reservation talking to residents and encouraging them not to sign any documents for US government officials. McWhorter became a prominent figure in Yakama affairs, and was invited to sit in on tribal councils; he wrote scores of letters to congressmen as well as prominent Native American civil rights activists on the east coast to bring the struggle of the Yakama to light.Yakama Tribal Council transcript, October 1, 1909, Box 34, in Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC), Washington State University. In 1913, McWhorter published a pamphlet, \\"The Crime Against the Yakamas,\\" detailing the long history of abuse of the Yakama at the hands of the United States government.[ McWhorter, Lucullus Virgil, 1913. 2. Chief Yoom-Tee-Bee died in 1910 but, as a result of his and McWhorter‚Äôs efforts, the Jones bill died in Congress in 1914. Later that year, McWhorter received a letter of thanks from Yoom-Tee-Bee‚Äôs successor, Stwire G. Watters, who wrote, \\"We prayed for someone like you to come to us.\\"Letter, Stwire G. Watters to Lucullus Virgil McWhorter, N. D. Box 36, in Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC), Washington State University. McWhorter was adopted as an honorary member by the Yakama tribe, being given the name Hemene Ka-Wan, meaning Old Wolf. He continued as an active force in the Yakima reservation for the rest of his life, attending council meetings, and acting as a mediator between the Yakama and officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). In 1916 he published \\"The Continued Crime Against the Yakamas\\", another pamphlet about their treatment by the government.McWhorter, Lucullus Virgil. \\"The Continued Crime Against the Yakamas\\". North Yakima: Republic Print. 1916. Box 2, in Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC), Washington State University. McWhorter‚Äôs advocacy for Native American rights against the oppression of the US government was a lifelong mission. It contributed to his passion for recording Native American history as told from a Native American perspectives. McWhorter and the Nez Perce Native Americans In 1907 McWhorter met Hemene Mox Mox, or Yellow Wolf, a Nez Perce man who stopped by his ranch near the Yakima River. After learning of Yellow Wolf‚Äôs experiences as a warrior and veteran of the Nez Perce War of 1877, McWhorter befriended him. McWhorter saw the need to record Nez Perce accounts of their history. \\"To hear Yellow Wolf,\\" he wrote, \\"was to be impressed by the unquestionable candor of his conviction that he and his associates were fully justified in all their actions\\". With a translator, McWhorter began studying Yellow Wolf‚Äôs life and the history of the Nez Perce. From this work, he published two books: Yellow Wolf: His Own Story (1944) and Hear Me, My Chiefs! (1951). Up until then, the only accounts about the Nez Perce and the War of 1877 were written by white U.S. soldiers who had fought against them. Their accounts were colored by their own perspective. General Oliver Otis Howard commanded the U.S. troops pursuing the Nez Perce during the Nez Perce War of 1877; he published his historical account as Nez Perce Joseph: An Account of His Ancestors, His Lands, His Confederates, His Enemies, His Murders, His War, His Pursuit and Capture (1881).Oliver Otis Howard, Nez Perce Joseph: An Account of His Ancestors, His Lands, His Confederates, His Enemies, His Murders, His War, His Pursuit, and Capture. Boston, MA: Lee and Shepard, 1881. McWhorter wanted to present the Nez Perce perspective to help preserve their cultural identity. The Nez Perce had gone through much change since the signing of the Walla Walla treaties on June 11, 1855: \\"It had taken the commissioners less than a month to acquire over thirty million acres of land in three future states‚Ä¶and added a fresh layer to the shifting sands of Native American identity along the Columbia River\\". Between 1855 and 1877, the United States forced a reduction in the Nez Perce Reservation to a fraction of its original size. After several disputes over land and resources, the Nez Perce people grew weary of the whites' influence over their land. The actions of three Nez Perce boys were the catalyst for the beginning of the Nez Perce War in 1877: \\"General Howard has shown us the rifle. We answer ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô We will stir up a fight for him. We will start his war!\\"McWhorter, Lucullus Virgil. Yellow Wolf: His Own Story. Pullman Washington State University Press. 1940, 41. As recounted by McWhorter, Yellow Wolf‚Äôs story was the anthem of all Nez Perce who fought for their way of life and lost. He depicted the \\"non-treaty\\" Nez Perce not as savages, but as a strong people who were resisting American oppressors. In doing so, McWhorter challenged the stereotype that had long been perpetuated by Native American histories told through white eyes. Later McWhorter worked to complete his \\"Field History\\" of the Nez Perce, which was published posthumously in 1951 as Hear Me, My Chiefs! Nez Perce History and Legend.McWhorter, Lucullus Virgil. Hear Me, My Chiefs!, Pullman: Washington State University Press. 1951. His final piece of work covered the history of the Nez Perce in Washington State‚Äôs Palouse region and the events following the end of the war of 1877. \\"On his deathbed, McWhorter made a request to his son, Virgil‚Ä¶to see his still untitled Field History through to publication.\\" It was his dying wish that the voice of the Nez Perce people would be heard and told from their perspective. His son Virgil McWhorter completed the book in 1951. The friendship which McWhorter developed with Yellow Wolf and the Nez Perce proved to be invaluable to his historical findings. Up to his death in 1944, McWhorter remained very active in Nez Perce relations with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. For most of his life, he had fought to preserve Native American identities, working as a persistent historian and caring friend. Without the efforts of McWhorter, the Nez Perce story would likely have been told only by white men ignorant of their traditional life and culture. Methods and research McWhorter did not pursue a formal education. From his wide reading in literature, he was inspired to conduct research into Native American life, culture, and history. He believed that most books written about Native Americans were lacking because the authors were too distant; they had not dealt directly with Native Americans to gain their perspective. McWhorter decided to combine his passion for advocacy with writing histories of Native Americans as told by the people themselves. He had frequent encounters with local natives on his ranch, but he also sought engagement through the creation of mock Native American encampments, which toured the Pacific Northwest rodeo circuit. The participants in this touring company wore traditional Native American dress, and performed their dances, and drumming. Native Americans from both the Nez Perc√© and Yakama tribes were frequent participants. McWhorter said it was because this rodeo circuit was similar to their traditional seasonal round of their former nomadic ways of life. At the rodeos, he had the opportunity to interview numerous Native Americans: \\"‚Ä¶with each rodeo or fair McWhorter learned more of the tribal oral tradition and he recorded what he heard. He well understood the unique opportunity at hand.\\" With such multiple sources, McWhorter could cross check his facts. Facts and accounts were often repeated by multiple persons, appearing to reinforce their accuracy. Both the Native Americans and McWhorter earned income from the performances of the rodeos. McWhorter's rodeos contrasted with the performances organized by such showmen as Buffalo Bill Cody. Instead of a ‚Äòwhite-washed‚Äô version of the West, McWhorter‚Äôs rodeos presented traditional and authentic Native American culture. It was part of his effort to educate white settlers about the peoples native to the region. McWhorter also met sympathetic contacts at these events, who shared his interest in Native American advocacy and history. At the Frontier Days celebration at Walla Walla in 1914, McWhorter met Cristal McLeod, also known as Mourning Dove. She was a mixed-race (half-blood) woman of Okanogan descent who had written, but not yet published, a semi- autobiographical novel called, Co-ge-we-a, The Half-Blood: A Depiction of the Great Montana Cattle Range. McWhorter would befriend Mourning Dove, serve as her editor, and help her publish her novel. He believed it expressed the struggle of Native American culture versus white culture, which he was also involved in. He also met Andrew Garcia, a former mountain man and trapper. In his early life, Garcia had married a total of three Native American women. One was a Nez Perce woman who had been among those fleeing their territory with Chief Joseph. In the correspondence between them that followed their meeting, Garcia wrote several thousand pages about life in Montana and among the Native American tribes there. From this material, he published a book, Tough Trip Through Paradise. In it he provided more details about Native American encounters with the 7th US Cavalry, which hunted Chief Joseph and his followers. Garcia's work is of sufficient historical significance to be kept by the Montana Historical Society. He might not have written his account if he had not developed the friendship with McWhorter. Historical significance McWhorter‚Äôs combined a deep interest in history with advocacy of Native American rights. His curiosity and openness allowed him to befriend Native Americans. He listened to many firsthand accounts of Native American history and legends. McWhorter sought to write histories about peoples with whom he had personal relations. In reviewing a new 1997 biography of him, Montana State University professor Alanna Kathleen Brown wrote, Works by McWhorter *The Crime Against the Yakimas, (1913) *The Border Settlers of Northwestern Virginia, from 1768 to 1795: Embracing the Life of Jesse Hughes and Other Noted Scouts of the Great Woods of the Trans-Allegheny, With notes and illustrative anecdotes, Hamilton, Ohio: Republic Publishing Company, 1915.

Web. 15 Dec 2010. Artificial lighting One of the greatest threats to the survival of hatchlings is artificial lighting. When a sea turtle hatches, its evolutionary instincts push it to move towards the brightest light in view, which naturally would be the sun or the moon, leading them toward the ocean horizon and into their new ecosystem.Lohmann, Catherine, and Kenneth Lohmann. \\"Sea turtles .\\" Current Biology 16.18 (2006): R784-R786. Web. 15 Dec 2010. However, due to the continual expansion of cities, construction of condos and hotels on coasts everywhere has grown exponentially. With the invention of the light bulb and therefore artificial light, the sea turtle's natural source of guiding light has been replaced and is no longer the only or the brightest thing of light. With virtually every coast in Mexico now constantly lit with buildings, the hatchlings become easily confused and turned around, few of them making successful treks to the ocean.Carvajal, Marc. \\"The Biogeography of Leatherback Turtles.\\" San Francisco State University. San Francisco State University, Nov 2002. Web. 8 Dec 2010. . Studies support artificial light as the leading cause for hatchling disorientation, showing that in 1999, 51% of the nests studied showed signs of confusion with one-fourth of all the hatchlings headed in the wrong direction.Nicholas, Mark. \\"Light Pollution and Marine Turtle Hatchlings: The Straw that Breaks the Camel's Back?.\\" The George Wright Forum. The George Wright Society, 2001. Web. 8 Dec 2010. As artificial lighting has been shown to be significantly harmful to the offspring of sea turtles, there have been several large-scale conservation efforts by Marine Life programs and conservation groups like that continue to educate the public on turtle conservation. Communities situated on or near a beach have been warned of the effects excessive lighting has on sea turtles and there has been substantial attempts to darken beaches and replace harmful artificial lighting with turtle-safe lights. Some entire communities have adopted official sea turtle protection regulations, such as Florida's ‚ÄúLights-out‚Äù policy.Lindsay, Fredrica. \\"Saving Sea Turtles with a Lights-Out Policy in Florida.\\" National Geographic News10 Mar. 2003: n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010. Magnetic interference Ferrous metal wire mesh screens are commonly used to protect sea turtle nests from predators' excavating and devouring the eggs and hatchlings. A new concern is that nestlings' delicate magnetic sense may not develop normally in the presence of the magnetic field interference from these steel mesh cages. The effects of the use of steel mesh as a cage material may not be known for many years until assessments can be made of the success rate of the first adult populations that developed within such cages begin attempting landfall for nest-making. Gravid turtles or their hatchlings may also be affected by the presence of magnetic fields arising from power cables, iron debris, steel seawalls or other human activities that locally modify earth's magnetic field. Oil spills and marine pollution An oiled Kemp's ridley sea turtle Marine pollution is both directly harmful to sea turtles as well as indirectly, through the deterioration of their natural habitats. Some of the most dangerous ocean pollutants include toxic metals, PCBs, fertilizers, untreated waste, chemicals, and a variety of petroleum products. Oil spills are particularly dangerous to sea turtles.\\"Sea Turtle Threats: Oil Spills.\\" Sea Turtle Conservancy (2010): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010. . Although oil does not tend to stick to them as it does to other marine life, sea turtles are still at risk when they surface for air, where oil can get in their eyes, skin, and lungs which can lead to significant health problems. Even if they are not directly in contact with marine pollution, sea turtles can still ingest harmful chemicals through the food they eat. Oil is also a cause for the death of seagrass, which is a large staple in the diet of the green turtle. The diets of the hawksbill sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, and Kemp's ridley sea turtle species have also been affected by the oil's role in the reduction of certain sponges and invertebrates. Extended exposure has been found to deteriorate the health of a sea turtle in general, making it more weak and vulnerable to a variety of other threats.Milton, Sarah, and Peter Lutz. United States. Oil and Sea Turtles Biology, Planning, and Response. 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010. According to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, formerly known as the Caribbean Conservation Program, the migration habits of sea turtles increase their exposure to marine pollution at each of the stages of their lives including eggs, hatchlings, juveniles, sub adults, or nesting adults. A 1994 study off of Florida's Atlantic coast, 63% of hatchlings surveyed had been found to have ingested tar. Loggerheads in particular have been shown to have the most problems with tarball ingestion, leading to esophageal swelling that can dislocate the intestines and liver leading to serious buoyancy issues as well as excessive swelling. Many regions heavily associated with oil, either exploration, transportation, or processing, are also significant sea turtle environments, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and particularly the coasts of Texas and Florida. Sea turtles existing in the exact areas where oil spills occur are not the only ones at risk due to the strong and far reaching ocean currents which can move pollution to great distances from its derivation.Witherington, B.E. \\"Ecology of neonate loggerhead turtles inhabiting lines of downwelling near a Gulf Stream front.\\" Sea Turtle Conservancy (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010. Breeding season is in particular a dangerous time for sea turtles due to the pollution of beach nesting sites.Antworth, Rebecca, David Pike, and John Stiner. \\"Nesting ecology, current status, and conservation of sea turtles on an uninhabited beach in Florida, USA.\\" Biological Conservation 130.1 (2006): 10-15. Web. 15 Dec 2010. Contamination of their diet can lead to disruption of digestion as well as physical injury of the sea turtles' digestive tracts. The nesting of female sea turtles is often deterred due to the potential of oily effluence. If the female does lay eggs, the development of the eggs is still at risk due to either oil in the sand or contamination from the mother turtle that was oiled while nesting. If the eggs in the nest have contact with oil while in the last half of their incubation phase, the rate of hatchling survival sharply decreases and those that do survive have a greater chance of physical deformities.United States. Impacts of Oil on Marine Mammals and Sea Turtles, 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010. Ocean plastic 8 million tons of plastic make their way to the ocean every year. Discarded plastic bags floating in the ocean resemble jellyfish, a common food of sea turtles. If a turtle eats a plastic foil, it tends to clog the turtle's digestive system and results in the animal dying. There have been many cases of dissection showing plastic foil and other debris inside turtles stomachs and intestines. Pictures of plastic items eaten by turtles There have also been cases where sea turtles have been found with plastic straws in their noses, plastic bags or toothbrushes in their stomachs, or fish hooks stuck on their flippers. Plastic straws can be dangerous to sea turtles, too, because they are often mistaken for food. This can cause the sea turtle to choke or die of starvation because they think that they are full, but they are not. Despite being small, plastic straws are among the top items that pollute the ocean. Tourism Owing to the popularity of numerous sea turtle species, people often travel to areas where the turtles nest, live to observe and photograph them. This has resulted in numerous deaths of the turtles through boat collisions, tourists attempting to catch or steal individuals, and other incidents. In Costa Rica, tourists have recently been criticised for interfering with the nesting habits of the resident olive ridley sea turtles, disrupting and confusing the animals by attempting to take selfies with them.  Boats  Image of a manatee with boat strike injuries. Similar injuries occur on turtle with parallel cuts (as shown in the image) or by blunt force trauma. There are numerous threats to sea turtles associated with boats including: oil spills, habitat degradation, and vessel collisions. Boat strike injuries result in two types of injuries: blunt force trauma and propeller slices in the carapace. Blunt force trauma is from the hull of the boat hitting the turtle. Blunt force trauma results in a cracking, less obvious, injury on the turtle's carapace. Propeller strikes form clear cut, parallel lines on the carapace of the turtle. The propeller wounds can cut into the spinal cord or lungs if deep enough, as these are located dorsally on the animal attached to the underside of the carapace. Sea turtle stranding data is the primary method of quantifying boat strike injuries, which has increased by 20% in Florida between 1985 and 2005. In general, sea turtles are not able to avoid boat collisions when boats are travelling too quickly. Also, the faster a boat is travelling the more damage is done to the turtle, making incidents more lethal. When sea turtles surface to breathe they continue swimming in the water column just below the surface, this allows them to get a few breathes in at a time, and then dive into deeper water to hunt or forage. This depth is the ideal depth for the propeller of the boat to hit the turtle, it also makes it even more difficult for boaters to try and avoid the turtle, since they can't be seen. There are ways to mitigate the problem. Speed reduction zones have been beneficial for species such as the Florida manatee. These zones would be especially important implemented in shallow, coastal regions near popular nesting beaches during nesting season. Vessel modification are another way that boaters can reduce their influence on marine life. Jet board motors have an impeller that eliminates the threat of propeller damage to marine turtles. The motor rests only a few inches from the hull of the boat, meaning it is less likely to hit turtles that are not surfacing to breathe. Propeller guards are slightly helpful at idle speeds, but once a boat begins to reach higher planing speeds they are ineffective in protecting the turtle from the propeller. Sea turtles that strand alive with boat injuries can be treated at rehabilitation facilities. Treatment is not always successful, but there are turtles that do survive boat strike injuries. Fishing According to an article in AAAS & Science, over 8 million sea turtles have died over the past twenty years due to injuries caused by being accidentally caught by fishing boats.Stokstad, Erik. \\"Sea Turtles Suffer Collateral Damage From Fishing.\\" Science AAAS 07 Apr 2010: n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010. Fisheries often use large-scale nets and hook systems that are indiscriminate and catch whatever comes along, be it sea turtle, dolphin, or even shark. What is known as \\"bycatch\\" is a large contributor to sea turtle deaths, as seen in Baja California.

Global warming is estimated to have serious effects on wildlife over the next few decades. There is evidence that sea turtles have already been affected. With the increase of temperature, polar ice has melted and has led to the rise of sea levels. This rise in sea levels has been a factor in the loss of beach, which for sea turtles means less nesting area. Global warming has been associated with severe weather, which could mean harsh and numerous storms that erode beaches and flood nests.\\"Global Warming.\\" SEE Turtles. N.p., 2007. Web. 9 Dec 2010. . As the overall temperature of the earth rises, so does the temperature of the sand, which diminishes the rate of hatchling survival. The temperature of the sand also affects gender, as higher temperatures have been shown to yield more female hatchlings. Changes in climate also influence currents and change the number and location of prey species. Water that is too warm can also cause coral bleaching, which is detrimental to reefs that are essential to certain species, such as the hawksbill sea turtle.Markey, Sean. \\"Global Warming Has Devastating Effect on Coral Reefs, Study Shows.\\" National Geographic News 28 Oct 2010: n. pag.

These tumors often grow to be so large that they hinder a sea turtle's ability to see, eat, and swim, therefore rendering the sea turtle unable to survive. Inexplicably, the majority of the cases of fibropapillomatosis have been diagnosed in the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) while none have been in the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). Cases of this disease have been found in all major oceans. Although the causes of this disease are not clear, many believe the source to be viral. These tumors are either smooth or contain pointed projections and they are red, pink, grey, black, or purple in color. These tumors are usually located anywhere on the soft skin tissue of the sea turtle, either the neck, eyes, or bottom of the flippers and range in size anywhere from a pea to a grapefruit.Florida.

Conservation efforts and rehabilitation centers A study by Discovery News targets the Mediterranean, the Eastern Pacific, the Southwest Atlantic, and the Northwest Atlantic as the regions in the direst need of preservation endeavors. In 1963, the Marine Turtle Group was created by the chairman of the Survival Service Commission of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources as the first international forum for sea turtle research and conservation.Davis, Frederick. \\"Saving sea turtles: the evolution of the IUCN Marine Turtle Group.\\" Endeavour 29.3 (2005): 114-118. Web. 15 Dec 2010. In the United States in 1973, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 was passed, providing protection for all sea turtle species, and in 1977, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to enforce the ESA with regards to sea turtles. USFWS is responsible for all sea turtle conservation on nesting beaches and NOAA Fisheries are responsible for the marine conservation of sea turtles. The conservation of sea turtles on an international scale has been led by two major environmental agreements: the Indian Ocean ‚Äì South-East Asian Marine Turtle Memorandum of Understanding and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles.\\"Marine Turtles.\\" Office of Protected Resources. NOAA Fisheries, 11 Nov 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010. .

N.p., 2011. Web. 4 Oct 2011. . The purpose of these centers is to help protect the local and endangered sea turtle population by: a) rescuing sick or injured turtles and taking them to the treatment facility, b) rehabilitating these turtles through various types of treatment and/or surgery, and c) releasing turtles back into the ocean once they have been successfully nursed back to health. Although some sea turtles' injuries are so severe that they can never become healed to the extent of being able to survive on their own outside of the facilities, hundreds of the patients from both the Gordon and Patricia Gray Veterinary Hospital in Juno Beach and the Sea Turtle Hospital in Topsail Island have been successfully rehabilitated and released in the last couple of decades. Evaluating the progress of conservation programs is difficult, because many sea turtle populations have not been assessed adequately. Most information on sea turtle populations comes from counting nests on beaches, but this doesn't provide an accurate picture of the whole sea turtle population. A 2010 United States National Research Council report concluded that more detailed information on sea turtles' life cycles, such as birth rates and mortality, is needed.

Descent and naming Siaosi Kiu Ngalumoetutulu Kiutauivailahi Kao and his wife Fatafehi ªolapaha Liku in 1952 baptised their second child and oldest son as Siale  ªAtaongo Kaho. When his father died on 20 January 1986, Siale  ªAtaongo succeeded him to the traditional Tongan noble title of Tu ªivakan≈ç.Genealogy (literally: king of the borrowed boat). As customary in Tonga, since that time his baptismal name is no longer used, instead he is referred to as Tu ªivakan≈ç (without any further qualification), or in more formal surroundings as  ªEiki n≈çpele Tu ªivakan≈ç, nowadays translated in English as Lord (noble) Tu ªivakan≈ç. To distinguish him from previous holders of the title, his original name can be added in parenthesis after his title. Tu ªivakan≈ç is the grandson of a former speaker of the Tongan Legislative Assembly, Siosiua Niutupu ªivaha Kaho, who was the younger brother of Tƒìvita Polutele Kaho (who also was a Tu ªivakan≈ç, and better known as TP Tu ªivakano), the prime minister just one century ago.  Background Tu ªivakan≈ç was educated in Tonga, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. He attended the Three Kings Primary School in Epsom. He then went on to Wesley College, Auckland, located in the small town of Paerata, outside of Pukekohe, South of Auckland. He was very successful at Wesley becoming Head Prefect, Athletics Champion and Captain of 1st XV. Tu ªivakan≈ç's qualifications include a Teaching Diploma obtained in 1974 from Ardmore Teaching College, New Zealand. In 1991 he received a bachelor's degree with Honours in Political Science after three years of study at the Flinders University of South Australia. Returning to Tonga following his study in New Zealand, Tu ªivakan≈ç worked in teaching at the Tonga High School and trained in youth development in Malaysia and Singapore in 1980. Tu ªivakan≈ç gained further experience in the Tongan education system appointed as Education Officer within the Ministry of Education in 1982. Between 1992 and 1996 Tu'ivakano became Senior Education Officer for Youth, Sport and Culture. During this period Tu'ivakano was involved with various Tongan Sporting organisations holding president roles with the Tonga National Rugby League, Tonga Sumo Association, Tonga National Taekwando Association and Vice presidency of the Tongan National Olympic Committee. Political career Tu ªivakan≈ç was elected as a noble representative for the island of Tongatapu in the 1996 election. From July 2002 to 2004 he served as Speaker of the Tongan Legislative Assembly. During his term as Speaker Tu'ivakano was in charge of Legislative Assembly Reforms involving the Reorganization of the assembly, Standing Orders of the House and realignment of the Parliamentary Pensions Scheme in accordance with other Commonwealth Countries. In March 2005 he was appointed to Cabinet as Minister for Works. A reshuffle in May 2006 saw him holding the portfolios of Minister for Training, Employment, Youth and Sport. Tu ªivakan≈ç was re-elected as a noble representative for Tongatapu in the 2010 election. Prime Minister On 21 December 2010 Tu ªivakan≈ç was elected Prime Minister in a secret ballot. Following constitutional reforms, this was the first time the Prime Minister was elected by Parliament, rather than appointed by the monarch. The only other contender was people's representative  ªAkilisi Pohiva, leader of the Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, which had twelve seats in Parliament (nine others being held by representatives of the nobility, and five by people's representatives with no party affiliation). Pohiva received twelve votes for the premiership, while Tu ªivakan≈ç was duly elected with fourteen. He was sworn in on 22 December. It was under Tu ªivakan≈ç's premiership that Tonga became, in November 2011, a founding member of the Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment.\\"NZ may be invited to join proposed ‚ÄòPolynesian Triangle‚Äô ginger group\\", Pacific Scoop, 19 September 2011\\"New Polynesian Leaders Group formed in Samoa\\", Radio New Zealand International, 18 November 2011 On 17 November 2011, Tu ªivakan≈ç represented Tonga at the first meeting of the PLG, as Prime Minister in Apia, Samoa. Since his election Tu ªivakan≈ç has continued Tonga's cooperation with the regional power of Australia, which is home to some 18,000 Tongans. In early 2011 the Australian Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs Richard Marles visited Tonga on two occasions and was the first overseas politician to visit Tu ªivakan≈ç since his election. In June 2011 Australian Senator John Hogg attended the opening of the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. In the period 2011-12 Australia Supplied the Tongan Government with A$32.1 million in Australian Overseas Development Assistance. In September 2013 Tu ªivakan≈ç suffered a stroke while attending the UN General assembly in New York. Following his loss to  ªAkilisi P≈çhiva in the 2014 election, Tu ªivakan≈ç was appointed Speaker of the Tongan Parliament. In March 2018 Tu ªivakan≈ç was arrested and charged with bribery, perjury and money laundering. On April 25 2020, Tu ªivakan≈ç received a two-year suspended sentence and a $US1,700 fine the offenses. Tu'ivakano will keep his hereditary noble title, estates and parliamentary seat. The false statement charge related to an incident in July 2015 when, with the purpose of obtaining a passport for Hua Guo and Xing Liu and with intent to deceive Immigration, Tu'ivakano wrote a letter stating that Hua Guo and Xing Liu were naturalized as Tongans in October 2014.

It has elliptical to egg-shaped leaves with a sharp point on the tip, white flowers and relatively large, broadly hemispherical fruit. Description Leptospermum grandifolium is a shrub that grows to a height of about or a tree up to tall with smooth bark that is shed in papery strips or flakes. It has narrow egg-shaped to elliptical leaves long and wide, often with a felty surface, with a small, sharp pointed tip and a base tapering to a short petiole. The flowers are arranged singly on short side shoots on the ends of leafy branchlets and are or more in diameter. There are broad, pale brownish bracts and bracteoles at the base of the flower bud. The floral cup is long and densely hairy. The sepals are egg-shaped to triangular, long and densely hairy, the petals white, long and the stamens about long. Flowering occurs from October to January and the fruit is a hemispherical capsule wide that remains on the plant when mature with the sepals attached. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum grandifolium was first formally described in 1802 by James Edward Smith in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London.

It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both ancient Greece and medieval-era France. While the concept of a political climate has been used historically to describe both politics and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier \\"political\\" to the base \\"climate\\" has been fairly recent. Public opinion is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate. As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, polls are used to estimate what the political climate \\"feels\\" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once. Etymology Climate According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the base climate comes from the Middle French climat, which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.\\"climate.\\" Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3.

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta.Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook. The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. Socrates‚Äîthe self-described \\"gadfly\\" of Athens because of his practice of elenchos (critical interrogation)‚Äîwas seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print. The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.Reeve, C.D.C. The Trials of Socrates. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print. Public opinion The phrase originates from the French term opinion publique, which was first attributed to Montaigne, the father of modern Skepticism and a major figure of the French Renaissance, around 1588 C.E.Donsbach, Wolfgang. The International Encyclopedia of Communication. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print. It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. Public opinion is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are. Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over Proposition 8 in California brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the United States as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.Dolan, Maura. \\"Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse.\\" Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. Opinion polls An opinion poll is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a cross-section of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the Wall Street Journal estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as response bias and selection bias.Bialik, Carl. \\"Grading the Pollsters.\\" Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010. Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the 1948 US presidential election, in which the prediction was that Thomas Dewey would easily defeat Harry Truman. Major polling organizations, including Gallup and Roper, indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.Crabtree, Steve. \\"Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election.\\" Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 December 2010. 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK \\"Brexit\\" referendum and the US presidential election were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect. Polls widely predicted a win for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, while instead Republican candidate Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College and, therefore, the presidency.

Background in Jewish ritual Although the term \\"baptism\\" is not today used to describe the Jewish rituals (in contrast to New Testament times, when the Greek word baptismos did indicate Jewish ablutions or rites of purification), the purification rites (or mikvah‚Äîritual immersion) in Jewish law and tradition are similar to baptism, and the two have been linked. In the Hebrew Bible and other Jewish texts, immersion in water for ritual purification was established for restoration to a condition of \\"ritual purity\\" in specific circumstances. For example, Jews who (according to the Law of Moses) became ritually defiled by contact with a corpse had to use the mikvah before being allowed to participate in the Temple in Jerusalem. Immersion was not required for converts to Judaism as part of their conversion, although many mistakenly believe otherwise based on more recent tradition. Immersion in the mikvah represents a change in status in regards to purification, restoration, and qualification for full religious participation in the life of the community, ensuring that the cleansed person will not impose uncleanness on property or its owners.Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Chagigah, p. 12 New Testament The New Testament includes several references to baptism as an important practice among early Christians and, while giving no actual account of its institution by Jesus, portrays him as giving instructions, after his resurrection, for his followers to perform the rite (see Great Commission). It also gives interpretations by the Apostle Paul and in the First Epistle of Peter of the significance of baptism. Baptism of Jesus Baptism of Christ, 1450 (National Gallery, London). The baptism of Jesus is described in the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. John's gospel does not directly describe Jesus' baptism. John the Baptist was a 1st-century mission preacher on the banks of the River Jordan. He baptized Jews for repentance in the River Jordan. At the start of his ministry, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. Critical scholars broadly agree that the baptism of Jesus is one of the most authentic, or historically likely, events in the life of the historical Jesus. Christian baptism has its origin in the baptism of Jesus, in both a direct and historical sense. Many of the earliest followers of Jesus were people who, like him, were baptized in the Jordan by John the Baptist. Baptism by Jesus The Gospel of John states that Jesus at an early stage led a mission of baptism that drew crowds. , considered by many scholars to be a later editorial insertion,See, e.g., the summary of such opinions by denies that Jesus himself baptized and states that he did so only through his disciples. Some prominent scholars conclude that Jesus did not baptize. Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz assert that Jesus did not baptize, detached the notion of repentance from baptism, recognized John's baptism, and put forward a purity ethic in tension with baptism. The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions also states that Jesus did not baptize as part of his ministry. E. P. Sanders omits John's account of Jesus' baptizing mission from his portrait of Jesus as a historical figure. Robert W. Funk considers the account of Jesus' baptism ministry in John to have internal difficulties: that, for instance, it reports Jesus coming to Judea even though he is already in Jerusalem and thus in Judea. actually speaks of Jesus and his disciples coming, not \\"Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·º∏ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒ±ŒΩ\\" (into Judea), but \\"Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·º∏ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒ±ŒΩ Œ≥·øÜŒΩ\\" (into the Judean countryside), which some interpret as contrasted with Jerusalem, the scene of the encounter with Nicodemus described immediately before. According to the Jesus Seminar, the passage about Jesus \\"coming to Judea\\" (as they interpret \\"Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·º∏ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒ±ŒΩ Œ≥·øÜŒΩ\\") to lead a mission of baptism probably preserves no historical information (a \\"black\\" rating). On the other hand, the Cambridge Companion to Jesus takes a different view. According to this source, Jesus accepted and made his own John the Baptist's message of repentance, forgiveness and baptism; taking over from John, when the latter was imprisoned, he called for repentance and for baptism as a first step in accepting the imminent Kingdom of God; and the central place of baptism in his message is confirmed by the passage in John about Jesus baptizing. After John's execution, Jesus ceased baptizing, through he may have occasionally returned to the practice; accordingly, while baptism played an important part in Jesus' ministry before John's death and again among his followers after his resurrection, it had no such prominence in between. New Testament scholar Raymond E. Brown, a specialist in the Johannine writings, considers that the parenthetic editorial remark of that Jesus baptized only through his disciples was intended to clarify or correct the twice repeated statement in the preceding verses that Jesus did baptize, and that the reason for its insertion may have been that the author considered the baptism that the disciples administered to be a continuation of the Baptist's work, not baptism in the Holy Spirit. Other New Testament scholars also accept the historical value of this passage in John. This is the view expressed by Joel B. Green, Scot McKnight, I. Howard Marshall. Another states that there is \\"no a priori reason to reject the report of Jesus and his disciples' conducting a ministry of baptism for a time\\", and mentions that report as one of the items in John's account \\"that are likely to be historical and ought to be given due weight\\".. In his book on the relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth, Daniel S. Dapaah says that John's account \\"may be a snippet of historical tradition\\", and comments that the silence of the Synoptic Gospels does not mean that the information in John was invented, and that Mark's account also suggests that Jesus worked with John at first, before moving to Galilee. Frederick J. Cwiekowski agrees that the account in John \\"gives the impression\\" that Jesus baptized. The Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible says that \\"though he [Christ] himself baptized not so many as his disciples; 'For he suffered them for an example, preferring one another.' The Gospel of John remarks, in , that, though Jesus drew many people to his baptism, they still did not accept his testimony, and the Jesus Seminar concludes, on the basis of Josephus's accounts, that John the Baptist likely had a larger presence in the public mind than Jesus. Paul's epistles In the Pauline epistles baptism effects and represents the believer's union with Christ, a union by which the believer shares in Christ's death and resurrection; cleanses of sin; incorporates into the Body of Christ and makes one \\"drink of the Spirit.\\" The conception of a sacramental principle, widespread not only in the Greco-Roman world, but even in pre-Columbian America and in preliterate societies, took on a unique significance, and to Paul's influence is attributed an interpretation given to the Christian rite in terms of the Greco-Roman mysteries but little weight can be attached to the counterparts of baptism in mystery religions as an explanation of the Christian practice. Gospel of Matthew ; ; Matthew begins with the \\"generation\\" of Jesus as Son of David, followed by the visit of the gentile Magi, and the flight into Egypt to escape Herod, after whose death the holy family returns into the land of Israel, then moves to Nazareth, and then includes a detailed version of the preaching of John the Baptist, followed by the baptism of Jesus. John protests to Jesus that he needs to be baptized by Jesus, but Jesus tells him to let it be so now, saying that it is fitting for the two of them (\\"for us\\") to thus \\"fulfill all righteousness.\\" When Jesus is baptized, he goes up immediately out of the water, the heavens open and John sees the Spirit of God descend upon him like a dove, alighting on him, and he hears a voice from heaven say, \\"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\\" Later, at the request of the mother of James and John, who prompted her to present their request to him to declare that they are to sit one at his right hand and the other at his left, Jesus speaks of the \\"cup\\" he is to drink, and he tells them that they too will drink of his cup, but in Matthew's gospel Jesus does not explicitly state that the baptism with which he must be baptized is also the \\"cup\\" that he must drink. The Gospel of Matthew also includes the most famous version of the Great Commission. Here, the resurrected Jesus appears to the apostles and commissions them to make disciples of all nations, to baptize, and teach. This commission reflects the program adopted by the infant Christian movement. Gospel of Mark ; This gospel, today generally believed by scholars to be the first and to have been used as a basis for Matthew and Luke, begins with Jesus' baptism by John, who preached a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. John says of Jesus that he will baptize not with water but with the Holy Spirit. At Jesus' baptism, he hears God's voice proclaiming him to be his Son, and he sees the spirit like a dove descend on him. During Jesus' ministry, when James and John ask Jesus for seats of honor in the coming kingdom, Jesus likens his fate to the cup that he will drink and to the baptism with which he must be baptized, the very cup and baptism in store for John and James (that is, martyrdom). ; The traditional ending of Mark is thought to have been compiled early in the 2nd century, and initially appended to the gospel by the middle of that century. It says that those who believe and are baptized will be saved, \\"but he who does not believe will be condemned.\\" Mark's gospel does not explicitly state that baptized persons who believe will be saved from the \\"wrath to come,\\" the wrath to which John the Baptist refers in Matthew's gospel, but readers can infer that being \\"condemned\\" includes the \\"wrath to come\\". Gospel of Luke ; ; This gospel begins with a statement that it contains reliable information obtained directly from the original eyewitnesses and servants of the word. It introduces the conception of John the Baptist, the annunciation of Gabriel to Mary the virgin, the birth of the Baptist who will be called the prophet of the Most High, and then the birth of Jesus, in the days of Herod, king of Judea, and of Caesar Augustus, emperor of the Roman Empire. There follows the account of Jesus in the Temple among the teachers; and then the calling and preaching of the prophet John the Baptist in the days of Tiberius Caesar, emperor, of Herod and Philip, tetrarchs, of Annas and Caiaphas, high priests; and then by far the briefest account in the canonical Gospels of the baptism of Jesus. The baptism of John is different from the baptism of the one who is to come after him. Jesus declares later that he has another baptism to be baptized with, and that he is under constraint (he is straitened) until it is accomplished. (The petition of the mother of James and John, the personal request of James and John, and Jesus' declaration to them that they will be baptized as he will be baptized, and will drink the cup that he will drink, is not in Luke's gospel.) In the Gospel of Luke, the risen Jesus appears to the disciples and the eleven apostles gathered together with them in Jerusalem and gives them the Great Commission without explicitly speaking of baptism, but readers can infer that \\"the forgiveness of sins\\" here includes \\"baptism\\" according to the preaching of the apostles at the time of Luke's gospel. Gospel of John The Gospel of John mentions John the Baptist's baptizing activity, in particular his baptism of Jesus,, and his statement that Jesus would baptize with the Holy Spirit. It also mentions baptizing activity by Jesus, specifying that the baptizing was not done by Jesus himself but by his disciples. Some references to water in John's Gospel have been interpreted as referring to baptism, in particular, the phrase \\"born of water and the Spirit\\" and the account of blood and water coming out of the side of Jesus when pierced after crucifixion Acts Acts of the Apostles, written , states that about 3,000 people in Jerusalem were baptized in one day on Pentecost. It further relates baptisms of men and women in Samaria, of an Ethiopian eunuch, of Saul of Tarsus, of the household of Cornelius, of Lydia's household, of the Philippi jailer's household, of many Corinthians and of certain Corinthians baptized by Paul personally. In Acts, the prerequisites of baptism are faith and repentance, but in certain cases (like Cornelius' household) the reception of the Spirit also precedes baptism. Also in Acts, some twelve men who had undergone John's baptism, a \\"baptism of repentance\\" that John administered, \\"telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus\\", were baptized \\"in the name of the Lord Jesus\\", whereupon they received the Holy Spirit. , and speak of baptism \\"in the name of Jesus\\" or \\"in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ\\", but whether this was a formula that was used has been questioned. Apostolic Age There is a scholarly consensus that the earliest Christian baptism was by immersion. Thomas Schreiner likewise states that \\"Most scholars agree that immersion was practiced in the NT\\", identifying submersion as the form of immersion practiced. Heyler says most New Testament scholars generally agree that Christian baptism in the New Testament era was by immersion. Everett Ferguson similarly speaks of \\"general scholarly agreement\\" that the baptism commanded by Jesus was immersion in water by dipping, in the form of a \\"full bath\\". He describes medieval depictions of Jesus standing in water while John poured water over him as a \\"strange fantasy\\" deriving from later church practice. Di Berardino describes the baptism of the New Testament era as generally requiring total immersion, Tischler says that total immersion seems to have been most commonly used, and Lang says \\"Baptism in the Bible was by immersion, that is, the person went fully under the waters\\". Sookey says it is \\"almost certain\\" that immersion was used. The Global Dictionary of Theology says that it is probable that immersion was the early church's normal mode of baptism, but that it was not seen as an important issue. The Didache or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, an anonymous book of 16 short chapters, is probably the earliest known written instructions, outside of the Bible, for administering baptism. The first version of it was written . The second, with insertions and additions, was written . This work, rediscovered in the 19th century, provides a unique look at Christianity in the Apostolic Age and is the first explicit reference to baptism by pouring, although the New Testament does not exclude the possibility of this practice.\\" Its instructions on baptism are as follows: Commentaries typically understand that the Didache indicates a preference for baptizing by immersion. in \\"living water\\" (i.e., running water, seen as symbolic of life). Furthermore, in cases of insufficient water it permits pouring (affusion), which it differentiates from immersion, using the Greek word ekche≈ç, (\\"pour\\", in the English translation) and not baptiz≈ç (\\"baptize\\", in the English translation), while at the same time considering the action done by pouring to be a baptism, giving no hint that this form made the baptism any less valid, and showing that immersion was not the only baptismal practice then acceptable. Barclay observes the Didache shows that baptism in the early church was by total immersion, if possible, Barton describes the immersion of the Didache as \\"ideally by total immersion\\", and Welch says it was by \\"complete immersion\\". James V. Brownson notes that the Didache does not specify either immersion or pouring when using running water, and Sinclair B. Ferguson argues that really the only mode that the Didache mentions is affusion. Martin and Davids say the Didache envisages \\"some form of immersion\\", and the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church refers its readers to its entry on immersion, which it distinguishes from submersion and affusion. Early Christianity Theology The theology of baptism attained precision in the 3rd and 4th centuries. While instruction was at first given after baptism, believers were given increasingly specific instructions before being baptized, especially in the face of heresies in the 4th century. By the 4th and 5th centuries, a series of rites spread over several weeks led up to the actual baptism at Easter: catechumens attended several meetings of intensive catechetical instruction, often by the bishop himself, and often accompanied by special prayers, exorcisms, and other rites. Catechumens recited the Creed on Holy Saturday to show that they had completed their catechetical instruction. At dawn following the Paschal Vigil starting the night of Holy Saturday, they were taken to the baptistry where the bishop consecrated the water with a long prayer recounting the types of baptisms. The catechumens disrobed, were anointed with oil, renounced the devil and his works, confessed their faith in the Trinity, and were immersed in the font. They were then anointed with chrism, received the laying on of hands, clothed in white, and led to join the congregation in the Easter celebration. By then, postponement of baptism had become general, and a large proportion of believers were merely catechumens (Constantine was not baptized until he was dying); but as baptisms of the children of Christians, using an adaptation of the rite intended for adults, became more common than baptisms of adult converts, the number of catechumens decreased. As baptism was believed to forgive sins, the issue of sins committed after baptism arose. Some insisted that apostasy, even under threat of death, and other grievous sins cut one off forever from the Church. As indicated in the writings of Saint Cyprian, others favoured readmitting the \\"lapsi\\" easily. The rule that prevailed was that they were readmitted only after undergoing a period of penance that demonstrated sincere repentance. What is now generally called the Nicene Creed, longer than the text adopted by the First Council of Nicaea of 325, and known also as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed because of its adoption in that form by the First Council of Constantinople in 381, was probably the baptismal creed then in use in Constantinople, the venue of the 381 Council. Mode of baptism Scholars \\"generally agree that the early church baptized by immersion\\", but sometimes used other forms. Howard Marshall says that immersion was the general rule, but affusion and even sprinkling were also practised. His presentation of this view has been described by Porter and Cross as \\"a compelling argument\\". Laurie Guy says immersion was probably the norm, but that at various times and places full immersion, partial immersion and affusion were probably in use. It is disputed where immersion was necessarily total. Tischler and the Encyclopedia of Catholicism say that the immersion was total. The same encyclopedia of Roman Catholicism notes that the preference of the Early Church was total immersion in a stream or the sea or, if these were not available, in a fountain or bath-sized tank, and Eerdman's Handbook to the History of Christianity says that baptism was normally by immersion, without specifying whether total or partial. The Dictionary of the Bible (2004) says \\"Archaeological evidence from the early centuries shows that baptism was sometimes administered by submersion or immersion... but also by affusion from a vessel when water was poured on the candidate's head...\\". In one form of early Christian baptism, the candidate stood in water and water was poured over the upper body. Baptism of the sick or dying usually used means other than even partial immersion and was still considered valid. Internet-available illustrations of ancient Christian representations of baptism from as early as the 2nd century include those in CF Rogers, Baptism and Christian Archeology, the chapter \\"The Didache and the Catacombs\\" of Philip Schaff's The Oldest Church Manual Called the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, and Wolfrid Cote's The Archaeology of Baptism. Studies before 1950 In The Archaeology of Baptism (1876) Wolfrid Cote, quoting Prudentius, who in his Psychomachia spoke of the \\"bathed chests\\" of the baptized, and the views of two earlier Italian archaeologists, stated that \\"the primitive mode appears to have been this: The administrator and candidate both standing in the water the former placed his right hand on the head of the candidate, and, pronouncing the baptismal words, gently bowed him forward, till he was completely immersed in the water\\". He included in his book a woodcut of a fresco in the Catacomb of San Callisto (a photographic reproduction appears in this article), and reported that one archaeologist interpreted it as a youth being baptized by affusion, while for another the youth standing in the water was \\"immersed in a cloud of water\\". Cote described this painting as of great antiquity, probably of the 4th or 5th century, while remarking that it is impossible to ascertain the precise age of the pictures in the catacombs of Rome. The other paintings that Cote described are of much later periods, while the mosaic in the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Fonte, in Ravenna (erected in the 4th century), which shows John baptizing Jesus by pouring water on his head from a cup, Cote explained as the product of later restoring. The font in this baptistery Cote described as ten feet in diameter and three and a half feet deep. Cote listed 67 still existing Italian baptisteries dating from the 4th to the 14th centuries, all of which he understood to have been used for total immersion. He made no mention of any pre-Constantine evidence. In 1903 Clement F Rogers published \\"Baptism and Christian Archaeology\\". This was a study of the archaeological evidence, both the positive evidence that paintings and carvings on sarcophagi etc. provide about how baptism actually was conferred, and the negative evidence given by the structure of baptismal fonts on how it could not have been conferred. He used literary sources plentifully but merely for illustration. For the first three centuries (i.e. before the time of Constantine) direct archaeological evidence is limited to pictures of baptism in the catacombs of Rome. Rogers concluded that \\"the direct evidence from archaeology alone may not be conclusive to show that in pre-Constantinian times baptism by affusion only was practiced generally or indeed in any one single case; but it does show that there was nothing repugnant in it to the general mind, that no stress was laid on total immersion, that the most important moments were held to be those when water was poured over the catchumen, and when the minister laid his hand on his head. This, taken in connexion with the known customs of later ages, make it more than probable that the usual method of administration was by affusion only.\\" Taking into account the positive archaeological evidence of post-Constantinian times, Roger concludes: \\"All the evidence of archaeology goes to prove that the essential part of baptism was considered in the early Church to be the pouring of water over the candidate's head by the bishop, or the guiding his head under a descending stream, followed by the laying on of hands\\"; he adds: \\"There remains the question, whether this was preceded by a self-immersion\\". To answer this question, he examines the negative evidence of ancient baptismal fonts, especially those found in archaeological sites, providing on pp. 347‚Äì49 a Synoptic Table of Fonts, with date, shape, diameter and depth, showing that some of them could not have been intended for full immersion. In his \\"Churches Separated from Rome\\" (1907), Louis Duchesne responded to accusations by Eastern Orthodox that the Roman Catholic was corrupted because of \\"the Filioque, baptism by affusion, unleavened bread, &c.;\\", by pointing to the absence of any ancient representation of baptism that showed the neophyte actually being immersed totally. Studies in the second half of the 20th century Alois Stenzel's 1958 study of baptism with a focus on liturgy argued that both immersion and affusion were practised by the early Church, since some baptismal pools which have been uncovered were too shallow for baptism and pictorial evidence favoured affusion. \\"Baptism in the Early Church\\" by George Rice (1981), in \\"Bible and Spade\\", cited Cote with favour and claimed that archaeology \\"overwhelmingly testifies to immersion as the normal mode of baptism in the Christian church during the first ten to fourteen centuries\\". Rice cites in particular imagery in the Catacomb of San Ponziano and a crypt in the catacomb of Santa Lucina, as well as a 9th- or 10th-century fresco in the basilica of San Clemente he also states that \\"pictures of Jesus standing in water while John pours water over His head are of a much later date than those depicting immersion and they demonstrate the change in the mode of baptism that came into the church\\". He mentions a 4th- century baptistery sufficiently large for immersion, Rice says that archaeological evidence demonstrates some early baptismal fonts large enough for adult immersion were later made smaller or replaced, to accommodate affusion baptism of infants, leading to mistakes in the dating of art works by 20th-century studies. In his contribution to the 1986 11th International Archaeology Congress on \\"What do the texts teach us on the equipment and furnishings needed for baptism in southern Gaul and northern Italy?\\" Jean- Charles Picard concluded that the texts speak only of immersion and that the area has no archaeological images of baptism by pouring water on the head.; as reported in . In 1987, on the basis of archaeology and parallels with Jewish practice, Sanford La Sor considered it likely that total immersion was also Christian practice. In the same year, Lothar Heiser, in his study of baptism in the Orthodox Church, concluded on the basis of the literary and pictorial evidence in that field that \\"the water customarily reached the hips of the baptizand; after calling on the triune God, the priest bent the baptizand under so as to dip him in water over the head; in the cases of pouring in the Didache and in sickbed baptism the baptized did not stand in the font\\"; but acknowledges that in present Greek practice the priest places the infant being baptized as far down in the water as possible and scoops water over the head so as to cover the child fully with water., as reported in In 1995, Renate Pillinger concluded from the evidence provided by images and buildings and by some literary sources that it was usual for the baptizand to stand in water no more than hip-deep and for the baptizer to pour water over him., reported in . With regard to the shallow baptismal fonts that archaeologists had discovered, Malka Ben Pechat expressed in 1999 the view that full immersion was possible even in small fonts with a mere 60 centimetres (2 feet) of water, while the fonts that were even shallower were intended for the baptism of infants. quoted in . 21st-century studies In the close of his comprehensive 2009 study, Baptism in the Early Church, Everett Ferguson devoted four pages (457‚Äì60) to summarizing his position on the mode of baptism, expressed also in his The Church of Christ of 1996, that the normal early-Christian mode of baptism was by full immersion. He observed that \\"those who approach the study of baptism from the standpoint of archaeology tend to find greater probability that affusion, or perfusion was a normal practice; those who come from the literary evidence see a greater likelihood of immersion, or submersion, being the normal practice\\"; but he intended his own comprehensive survey to give coherence to the evidence (p. 857). Ferguson dismissed Rogers' 1903 study as dated with regard to both the depictions of baptism and his survey of the baptismal fonts. Like Rice, whom he did not mention, Ferguson said that the size of the baptismal fonts was progressively reduced in connection with the prevalence of infant baptism, although there are a few cases where larger fonts are later than the smaller ones. Ferguson also stated: \\"The predominant number of baptismal fonts permitted immersion, and many were so large as to defy any reason for their existence other than immersion\\". Robin Jensen writes: \\"Historians have sometimes assumed that baptism was usually accomplished by full immersion ‚Äì or submersion ‚Äì of the body (dunking). However, the archaeological and iconographic evidence is ambiguous on this point. Many ‚Äì if not most ‚Äì surviving baptismal fonts are too shallow to have allowed submersion. In addition, a significant number of depictions show baptismal water being poured over the candidate's head (affusion), either from a waterfall, an orb or some kind of liturgical vessel.\\" Eerdman's Dictionary of the Bible also casts doubt on \\"the usual assumption that all NT baptisms were by immersion\\", stating that some early baptisteries were deep enough to stand in but not broad enough to lie down in, and mentioning that ancient representation of Christ at his baptism show him standing in waist-deep water. The immersion used by early Christians in baptizing \\"need not have meant full submersion in the water\\" and, while it may have been normal practice, it was not seen as a necessary mode of baptism, so that other modes also may have been used. Submersion, as opposed to partial immersion, may even have been a minority practice in early Christianity.

Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism. The earliest Christian baptisms were probably normally by immersion, though other modes, such as pouring, were used. By the third and fourth centuries, baptism involved catechetical instruction as well as chrismation, exorcisms, laying on of hands, and recitation of a creed. In the West, Affusion became the normal mode of baptism between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, though immersion was still practiced into the sixteenth. In the sixteenth century, Martin Luther retained baptism as a sacrament, but Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli considered baptism and the Lord's supper to be symbolic. Anabaptists denied the validity of infant baptism, which was the normal practice when their movement started and practiced believer's baptism instead. Several groups related to Anabaptism, notably the Baptists and Dunkards, soon practiced baptism by immersion as following the Biblical example. Background in Jewish ritual An ancient Mikveh (bath used for ritual immersion in Judaism) on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem Although the term \\"baptism\\" is not used to describe the Jewish rituals, the purification rites in Jewish law and tradition, called tvilah, have some similarity to baptism, and the two have been linked. The tvilah is the act of immersion in natural sourced water, called a mikva In the Jewish Bible and other Jewish texts, immersion in water for ritual purification was established for restoration to a condition of \\"ritual purity\\" in specific circumstances. For example, Jews who (according to the Law of Moses) became ritually defiled by contact with a corpse had to use the mikvah before being allowed to participate in the Holy Temple. Immersion is required for converts to Judaism as part of their conversion. Immersion in the mikvah represents a change in status in regards to purification, restoration, and qualification for full religious participation in the life of the community, ensuring that the cleansed person will not impose uncleanness on property or its owners.Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Chagigah, p. 12 It did not become customary,. however, to immerse converts to Judaism until after the Babylonian Captivity.. This change of status by the mikvah could be obtained repeatedly, while Christian baptism, like circumcision, is, in the general view of Christians, unique and not repeatable. Even the so-called rebaptism by some Christian denominations is not seen by them as a repetition of an earlier valid baptism and is viewed by them as not itself repeatable. During the Second Temple period the Greek noun baptmos was used to refer to ritual washing in Hellenistic Judaism. Mandaeans Mandaeans in prayer during baptism Mandaeans revere John the Baptist and practice frequent full immersion baptism (masbuta) as a ritual of purification, not of initiation. Mandaeans abhor circumcision and are possibly the earliest people to practice baptism.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvv6I02MNlcDrower, Ethel Stefana. The Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran. Oxford At The Clarendon Press, 1937. Early religious concepts and terminologies recur in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and Yardena (Jordan) has been the name of every baptismal water in Mandaeism. The Mandaic language is a dialect of southeastern Aramaic and is closely related to the language of the Babylonian Talmud. They formally refer to themselves as Nasurai (Nasoraeans). According to Mandaean sources such as the Haran Gawaita, the Nasurai inhabited the areas around Jerusalem and the River Jordan in the 1st century CE. Early Christianity Baptism of Christ, 1450 (National Gallery, London). John the Baptist adopted baptism as the central sacrament in his messianic movement,. seen as a forerunner of Christianity. Baptism has been part of Christianity from the start, as shown by the many mentions in the Acts of the Apostles and the Pauline epistles. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism. How explicit Jesus' intentions were and whether he envisioned a continuing, organized Church is a matter of dispute among scholars. There is a scholarly consensus that the earliest Christian baptism was normally by immersion,.. or at least that this is probable. Some interpret this as meaning total immersion or submersion beneath the water. Among those who take this view are Thomas Schreiner, Everett Ferguson, Di Berardino,. Tischler,. and Lang. Others understand immersion as not necessarily implying submersion beneath the water. Kirsten Marie Hartvigsen distinguishes between immersion and submersion and considers both as possible early-Christian forms of baptism, as does Christian Strecker. Laurie Guy says: \\"The church most likely practiced full immersion, partial immersion and affusion at various times and places in the early centuries, with sprinkling being practiced rarely (and probably only for medical reasons) during that time period.\\". Robin M. Jensen describes the early Christian baptismal ritual as having for basis \\"immersion in water (or a thorough soaking by pouring)\\", and describes the primitive, first-century ritual as having encompassed both \\"application of water (whether by immersion or by some other means) and an imposition of hands\\", adding that \\"'Baptism' originally conveyed the sense of water's application (if not also immersion) in its very definition\\". Other recent studies that see total immersion (submersion) as not the only form of baptism utilized by early Christians include Steven J. Schloeder,. Charles Thomas,. Stanley J. Grenz, and also the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church,. and the Oxford Dictionary of the Bible.. The theology of baptism attained precision in the 3rd and 4th centuries. While instruction was at first given after baptism, believers were given increasingly specific instructions before being baptized, especially in the face of heresies in the 4th century. By the fourth and fifth centuries, baptism had become a several-week-long rite leading up to the actual baptismal washing on Easter. During this time, catechumens attended several meetings of intensive catechetical instruction, often by the bishop himself, and often accompanied by special prayers, exorcisms, and other rites. Catechumens recited the Creed on Holy Saturday to show that they had completed their catechetical instruction. At dawn following the Paschal Vigil starting the night of Holy Saturday, they were taken to the baptistry where the bishop consecrated the water with a long prayer recounting the types of baptisms. The catechumens disrobed, were anointed with oil, renounced the devil and his works, confessed their faith in the Trinity, and were immersed in the font. They were then anointed with chrism, received the laying on of hands, clothed in white, and led to join the congregation in the Easter celebration. By then, postponement of baptism had become general, and a large proportion of believers were merely catechumens (Constantine was not baptized until he was dying); but as baptisms of the children of Christians, using an adaptation of the rite intended for adults, became more common than baptisms of adult converts, the number of catechumens decreased.. As baptism was believed to forgive sins, the issue of sins committed after baptism arose. Some insisted that apostasy, even under threat of death, and other grievous sins cut one off forever from the Church. As indicated in the writings of Saint Cyprian, others favoured readmitting the \\"lapsi\\" easily. The rule that prevailed was that they were readmitted only after undergoing a period of penance that demonstrated sincere repentance. What is now generally called the Nicene Creed, longer than the text adopted by the First Council of Nicaea of 325, and known also as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed because of its adoption in that form by the First Council of Constantinople in 381, was probably the baptismal creed then in use in Constantinople, the venue of the 381 Council. Infant Baptism Whether the earliest Christians practiced infant baptism, and thus whether modern Christians should do so, has remained a subject of debate between Christian scholars at least since the earliest clear reference to the practice by Tertullian in the early third century. Some claim that Biblical baptism can be interpreted and thus relative, others support the Biblical literal baptism as a public and personal testimony, without intermediaries, in the case of infants that cannot talk for themselves yet. Early Middle Ages Against Pelagius, Augustine insisted that baptism was necessary for salvation even for virtuous people and for children. The baptismal rite was significantly simplified during the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries as fewer and fewer of those baptized were converts from paganism. The rite became much less important and was conducted very quickly. Prebaptismal catechesis was abandoned, and baptism was usually conducted shortly after birth. Baptism of Augustine of Hippo as represented in a sculptural group in Troyes cathedral (1549) Middle Ages In 895, the provincial Council of Tribur commented on the traditional teaching that the triple immersion in baptism was an imitation of Christ for the three days he spent in the tomb, and the rising from the water an imitation of the resurrection of Jesus.. The linking of the baptismal immersion in and rising from the water with the burial and resurrection of Jesus arguably goes back to Saint Paul, and the linking of the triple immersion with the three days in the tomb is found in Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 313‚Äì86) and Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 ‚Äì after 394).. An 1890 sketch for St. Vladimir's Cathedral, Kiev: The Baptism of Saint Vladimir by Viktor Vasnetsov. Attendants (left) hold Vladimir's golden royal robes, which he has removed, and the simple white baptismal robe, which he will put on. The 12th century saw the meaning of the word \\"sacrament\\" narrowed down and restricted to seven rites, among them that of baptism, while other symbolic rites came to be called \\"sacramentals\\". In the period between the 12th and the 14th centuries, affusion became the usual manner of administering baptism in Western Europe, though immersion continued to be found in some places even as late as the 16th century. Throughout the Middle Ages, there was therefore considerable variation in the kind of facility required for baptism, from the baptismal pool large enough to immerse several adults simultaneously of the 13th century Baptistery at Pisa, to the half-metre deep basin in the 6th century baptistery of the old Cologne Cathedral. Both East and West considered washing with water and the Trinitarian baptismal formula necessary for administering the rite. Scholasticism referred to these two elements as the matter and the form of the sacrament, employing terms taken from the then prevailing Aristotelian philosophy. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, while teaching the necessity of both elements, nowhere uses these philosophical terms when speaking of any of the sacraments. Reformation In the 16th century, Martin Luther considered baptism to be a sacrament. For the Lutherans, baptism is a \\"means of grace\\" through which God creates and strengthens \\"saving faith\\" as the \\"washing of regeneration\\" in which infants and adults are reborn. Since the creation of faith is exclusively God's work, it does not depend on the actions of the one baptized, whether infant or adult. Even though baptized infants cannot articulate that faith, Lutherans believe that it is present all the same. Because it is faith alone that receives these divine gifts, Lutherans confess that baptism \\"works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare.\\" In the special section on infant baptism in his Large Catechism, Luther argues that infant baptism pleases God because persons so baptized were reborn and sanctified by the Holy Spirit. Swiss Reformer Huldrych Zwingli differed with the Lutherans by denying that baptism conveys grace to the baptized. Zwingli identified baptism and the Lord's supper as sacraments, but in the sense of an initiatory ceremony. Awaiting submersion baptism in the Jordan river Anabaptists (a word that means \\"rebaptizers\\") rejected so thoroughly the tradition maintained by Lutherans as well as Catholics that they denied the validity of baptism outside their group. They \\"rebaptized\\" converts on the grounds that one cannot be baptized without wishing it, and an infant, who does not understand what happens in a baptism ceremony and who has no knowledge of the concepts of Christianity, is not really baptized. They saw as non-biblical the baptism of infants, who cannot confess their faith and who, not having yet committed any sins, are not in the same need of salvation. Anabaptists and other Baptist groups do not consider that they rebaptize those who have been baptized as infants, since, in their view, infant baptism is without effect. The Amish, Restoration churches (Churches of Christ/Christian Church), Hutterites, Baptists, Mennonites and other groups descend from this tradition. Pentecostal, charismatic and most non-denominational churches share this view as well. In Reformed baptismal theology, starting with John Calvin, baptism is seen as primarily God's offer of union with Christ and all his benefits to the baptized. This offer is believed to be intact even when it is not received in faith by the person baptized. Baptism also initiates one into the visible church and the covenant of grace.

Located in the lowest part of Salento between Castro, Andrano and Diso, Marittima is about 48 km from Lecce. The part of the country overlooking the coast is named Marina di Marittima Toponymy According to popular opinion, the name of the town is due to its proximity to the sea. In fact, the coast is only a kilometre from the town. It has also been claimed that the name is related to the founders of the area, who arrived by sea and would have been called marittimi; so Marittima indicates the place where they lived. History There is no definite information on the origins of the town although it is assumed that Marittima was founded or inhabited by the Messapi and that it suffered the same fate as its neighbours, Vaste, Diso and Castro, which were overtaken first by the Romans and then by the Byzantines, the Normans and Angevins. The first written document confirming the presence of the settlement dates back to 1277; the Angevin registers from one year inform us of a certain \\"Rubeo de Soliaco\\" who was named \\"Lord of Casale Marittima\\". In the feudal period, Marittima was part of Castro County which was under the control of various noble families including the Orsini Del Balzo, Gattinara, Ruiz De Castro and the Lopez De Zunica families. This control lasted until 1809 when the Rossi family became the owners of Marittima. In the feudal Middle Ages, the daily life of the area's farmers and fishermen was shaken up when, on the 28 July 1537, the Turks (who were allies of the French against the Spanish governor of the Kingdom of Naples) seized Castro and destroyed several towns, including Marittima. Some years later, in 1573 when Marittima had only a hundred inhabitants, the town was ransacked again, this time by Saracen pirates (as were many neighbouring areas). Attacks by pirates occurred frequently until the early 19th century. In order to defend Salento, a system of watchtowers was built around Marittima. Between the end of 400 AD and the start of 500 AD a large tower ‚Äì known as Torre Lupo (Wolf Tower) ‚Äì was erected and still stands. Several turrets were also built in the inhabited centre. Marittima was an independent municipality until 1809.http://www.comunediso.it/Marittima-Storia.aspx|titolo=Storia di Marittima Monuments and places of interest Mother-Church The Mother-Church is dedicated to the Protector Saint Vitale. It was rebuilt several times: once in the 16th Century after the devastation by the Turkish and then in the 18th century due to the structure's dilapidation. The current structure dates back to early 1900. It has a simple facade with a central doorway which is flanked by two niches. The interior is of a neoclassical style with three arched aisles containing numerous paintings. The most important of which, Saint Vitale on Horseback, is on the high altar. In the central vault there is a stunning elliptical dome on which is painted the glory of the Trinity and the family of Saint Vitale. Shrine of Our Lady of Constantinople The Shrine of Our Lady of Constantinople, built in 1610, has preserved its architectural lines despite adjustments made over the centuries. This shrine is linked to an ancient tradition. An image of Our Lady of Constantinople on Lecce stone now dominates the high altar on an artistic canopy. The walls of the single nave, once adorned with numerous paintings, are now home to only those of Saint Francis of Assisi and Immacolata. Of notable interest are the baroque portal, the high altar containing the oval icon of the Virgin and the altar of the Crucifix dated 1691. There is also a small lead pipe organ which dates back to the 18th century. Convent of Conventual Fathers The Convent of Conventual Fathers was constructed between 1615 and 1619. This is known because, in 1614, it was not yet listed among the monasteries which existed at the time in Apulia. However, in 1621, a certain Catrini was buried there. The task of the convent's religious community was to guard the Shrine of Our Lady of Constantinople and to run a small hospital. The convent was suppressed for the first time in 1652 as a result of the Bolla Instaurandae of Pope Innocent X and was reactivated in 1654. The year 1795 marked the definitive end of the convent. Over the years it was owned by different families; the premises were even used as a tobacco processing factory. City Towers The City Towers were built by the Marittima University or by private citizen to defend the small town against attacks by Turkish pirates above all after the destruction of Otranto (1480) and Castro (1537 and 1573). Originally there were five but today only four towers remain: Torre di Alfonso (Alfonso Tower), Torre Baltassara (Baltassara Tower), Torre della Piazza (Piazza Tower) ‚Äì the only one which is still inhabited ‚Äì and Torre di Paolino Russi (Paolino Russi Tower.) Torre di Alfonso (Alfonso Towers) The largest and the most artistically beautiful, Torre di Alfonso (named after the owner) is located in the heart of the old town, in Via Cellini. It has a square base and was refined by adding a ledge and a balcony which adorn the upper face. Colonna Osanna (Hosanna Column) The Hosanna Column, so-called because it was used during the Palm Sunday, was erected in 1620 and was originally situated in the middle of the main square. It was dismantled in 1926 and rebuilt in 1961 near the Shrine of Our Lady of Constantinople. It is made from local stone and is topped by a cross.

The modern Japanese practice of Miyamairi is such as ceremony. In some, such evidence may be archaeological and descriptive in nature, rather than a modern practice.

Springer, 16 Feb 2012 The practice was defended by the religion as the only way to stop the poor from dumping unwanted daughters on them. Christianity Gnostic Catholicism and Thelema The Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, or Gnostic Catholic Church (the ecclesiastical arm of Ordo Templi Orientis), offers its Rite of Baptism to any person at least 11 years old. The ceremony is performed before a Gnostic Mass and represents a symbolic birth into the Thelemic community. Hinduism Akshara abyasam is a Hindu education initiation ceremony commonly held for children in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. While the ritual has a religious significance, it does not involve initiation into the faith, rather the start of schooling. Islam Islam practises a number of ablution ceremonies, but none of them has the character of a religious initiation rite. Belief in the monotheism of God in Islam is sufficient for entering in the fold of faith and does not require a ritual form of baptism. Sura 2:138 This can be seen in the Qur‚Äôan in the verse: \\"[And say, ‚ÄúOurs is] the religion of Allah; And who is better than Allah in [ordaining] religion? And we are worshipers of Him.‚Äù Judaism Conversion to Judaism requires full immersion in a Mikveh, a ritual purification bath connected to a natural spring, well of naturally occurring water or a cistern filled by the rain. According to Orthodox Judaism, immersion of a convert requires three religiously observant male witnesses, preferably rabbis. Potential converts must accept the laws and beliefs in Judaism in front of three witnesses; males must undergo circumcision before the ritual immersion. Mandaeanism Mandaeans revere John the Baptist and practice frequent baptism as a ritual of purification, not of initiation. Mystery religions In the Greco-Roman world, the mystery religions were those that required initiation, as distinguished from public rites that were open to all; the Greek word for \\"mystery\\", mysterion, comes from mystƒìs, \\"initiate.\\" (The contemporary English meaning of \\"something unknown or hard to know\\" developed from the secrecy surrounding the arcane knowledge promised by these religions.) The most famous of the ancient mysteries, and the most important in Classical Greece, were the Eleusinian Mysteries. The mysteries known as Orphic, Dionysian or Bacchic pertained to the god Dionysus and his \\"prophet\\" Orpheus. In the Hellenistic period under Roman rule, the mysteries of Isis, Mithras, and Cybele were disseminated around the Mediterranean and as far north as Roman Britain. Apuleius, a 2nd- century Roman writer, described an initiation into the mysteries of Isis. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of Isis. The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation, the details of which were secret, took place. On the next two days, dressed in the robes of his consecration, he participated in feasting. Apuleius describes also an initiation into the cult of Osiris and yet a third initiation, all of the same pattern.Apuleius, The Golden Ass (Penguin Books), pp. 211-214 The water-less initiations of Lucius, the character in Apuleius's story who had been turned into an ass and changed back by Isis into human form, into the successive degrees of the rites of the goddess was accomplished only after a significant period of study to demonstrate his loyalty and trustworthiness, akin to catechumenal practices preceding baptism in Christianity. Sikhism The Sikh initiation ceremony dates from 1699, when the religion's tenth leader (Guru Gobind Singh) initiated five followers and then was himself initiated by his followers. The Sikh baptism ceremony is called Amrit Sanchar or Khande di Pahul. The initiated Sikh is also called an Amritdhari, literally meaning \\"Amrit Taker\\" or one who has \\"Taken on Amrit\\". Khande Di Pahul was initiated in the times of Guru Gobind Singh when Khalsa was inaugurated at Sri Anandpur Sahibon the day of Baisakhi in 1699. Guru Gobind Singh asked a gathering of Sikhs who was prepared to die for God. At first, the people hesitated, and then one man stepped forward, and he was taken to a tent. After some time, Guru Gobind Singh came out of the tent, with blood dripping from his sword. He asked the same question again. After the next four volunteers were in the tent, he reappeared with the four, who were now all dressed like him. These five men came to be known as Panj Pyares or the \\"Beloved Five\\". These five were initiated into the Khalsa by receiving Amrit. These five were Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Mukham Singh, Bhai Sahib Singh, Bhai Dharam Singh and Bhai Himmat Singh. Sikh men were then given the name \\"Singh\\", meaning \\"lion\\", and the women received the last name \\"Kaur\\", meaning \\"princess\\". Filling an iron bowl with clean water, he kept stirring it with a two-edged sword (called a Khanda) while reciting over it five of the sacred texts or banis‚ÄîJapji, Jaap Sahib, Savaiyye, Chaupai and Anand Sahib. The Guru‚Äôs wife, Mata Jito (also known as Mata Sahib Kaur), poured sugar crystals into the vessel, mingling sweetness with the alchemy of iron. The five Sikhs sat on the ground around the bowl reverently as the holy water was being churned to the recitation of the sacred verses. With the recitation of the five banis completed, khande di pahul or amrit, the Nectar of Immortality, was ready for administration. Guru Gobind Singh gave the five Sikhs five palmsful each to drink. Wicca In Wicca, an infant is held up to the God and Goddess by the mother and then sprinkled with water or passed over a small fire. This is called Wiccaning.

Mickelson was born in Ottawa, Illinois, and attended Washington University in St. Louis and Oklahoma State University. He signed with the Cardinals in 1947 and was given his first big-league audition at the end of the 1950 minor league season, during which he batted a composite .413 in two Class B leagues.Minor league page in Baseball Reference. Mickelson collected only one hit and two bases on balls in 12 plate appearances over five games, however, and returned to the minor leagues for almost three full seasons. Acquired by the Browns' organization, Mickelson was called up in September 1953 after a season spent in the Double-A Texas League. The Browns were at the end of their 52-year stay in St. Louis; owner Bill Veeck was about to sell the team to an ownership group from Baltimore and the team would be reborn as the Orioles the next season. In the third inning of the Browns' final game on Sunday, September 27, at Busch Stadium, facing the Chicago White Sox, Johnny Groth doubled off Billy Pierce with two out. Mickelson then drove home Groth with an opposite-field single to give the Browns a 1‚Äì0 lead.1953-9-27 box score from Retrosheet But Chicago came back to tie the game in the eighth, sent the contest to extra innings, and won it 2‚Äì1 with a run in the top of the 11th. The RBI single was Mickelson's last big-league hit; he went hitless for the rest of that game, and then was 0-for-12 in his last Major League stint with the 1957 Cubs. Mickelson never appeared for the Orioles. His early-season 1957 stay with the Cubs punctuated four more minor league seasons at the Double-A and Open Classification levels. Although Mickelson collected only three hits, including a double, in 37 MLB at bats (with four bases on balls), he batted .316 with 1,374 hits during his minor- league career.

It is located at the Milwaukee Public Museum at 800 West Wells Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Description The Woodland Indian and Whistling Swans sculpture adorns the south fa√ßade of the Milwaukee Public Museum spanning 40 ft x 28 ft x 3 ft. The Native American Indian figure kneels with his arms outstretched, leading the viewers' eye to the prominent flock of four swans above. Architect Theodore Eschweiler (Eschweiler and Eschweiler) commissioned the artist, Marshall Fredericks, to design a sculpture for the museum's new building. The sculpture cost $50,000 and spans the building's facade from the second to fourth floors. A nearby plaque reads: History The Milwaukee Public Museum is one of the leading museums of human and natural history as well as the first museum to create full-sized dioramas. It originally shared a space with Milwaukee Public Library. In 1950 the architectural firm Eschweiler and Eschweiler proposed designs for a new building to house the museum. The building was built in the 1960s when Stephan Borhegyi, then museum director, led the effort to finish the project and incorporate advanced museum theories to the interior spaces. The building's architects commissioned Marshall Fredericks to create a sculpture for the museum's entrance facade. Woodland Indian and Whistling Swans symbolizes the Great Lakes area. \\"A Woodland Indian, ready to release an arrow from his bow, pauses in awe before the beauty of nature as seen in the flight of swans.\\"Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook, p. 64. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison Although Fredericks was paid $50,000 for the artwork, the mounting of the work was problematic because of the sculpture's weight and size. The city had to negotiate with contractors before the sculpture was finally installed. Owner It is administered by Milwaukee County, Department of Parks, Recreation and Culture.

Lady Betty was built as the private motorboat Chatana by the Matthews Boat Company at Port Clinton, Ohio, in 1913. She was later renamed Lady Betty. On 28 May 1917, the U.S. Navy chartered Lady Betty from her owner, Frank S. Washburn, Jr., of Rye, New York, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. The Navy took delivery of Lady Betty on 11 June 1917 at Newport, Rhode Island, and she was commissioned as USS Lady Betty (SP-661) on 25 June 1917 with Coxswain F. L. Washburn, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the 2nd Naval District in southern New England, Lady Betty carried out patrol duties in Newport Harbor and along the coast of Narragansett Bay for the rest of World War I. Lady Betty was decommissioned on 25 November 1918 and returned to Washburn on 9 December 1918. It is unclear whether she bore the name Lady Betty or Chatana after her return to him.The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/l1/lady_betty.htm states ambiguously that USS Lady Betty \\"resumed her former name' upon return to her owner, without making it clear whether she returned to her original name of Chatana or to the private name she held before her commissioning, which was Lady Betty. NavSource Online: Section Patrol Craft Photo Archive Lady Betty (SP 661) interprets this as meaning that she returned to the name Chatana after being returned to her owner; while this is possible, it was unusual for a boat upon return to her owner to revert to a name earlier than the one she had upon commissioning and often bestowed by an earlier owner.

The comital family traces its origins as a collateral branch of the patrician Spinola family, subsequently created Marquis and then Duke of Sesto and Marquis of Benafro (sometimes called Venafro). The Spinola, Doria, Grimaldi and Fieschi were the principal four families of Genoa, rivals for authority within the republic of Genoa in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Spinola family were allied to the Squarciafico family (created Marquess of Galatone), the Princes of Belmonte, and the Counts of Galerata. Distinguished members of the Spinola family include the celebrated general Ambrogio Spinola, Duke and Marquis of Sesto (1569-1630), his son Filippo Spinola (1596‚Äì1659) and Ambrose Spinola de la Cerda y Colonna, 5th Marquis of los Balbases and Duke of Sesto (1701‚Äì1757), all of whom were Knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece. All bore the title of Marquis or Duke of Sesto, as well as the title of Duke of San Severino, later to become celebrated by Stendhal. The current comital family, through marriage and inheritance, established itself in the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, first in the area of Salerno and later in Sicily, in the area of Messina, over time being known as Sesto, derivation of the original familial title. In 1711, following the death of Don Gaetano Pinelli, Duke of Acerenza, Marquess of Galatone and Count of Copertino, and concomitant with the arrangements which led to the succession of Oronzo Ravaschieri Fieschi Pinelli, 5th Prince of Belmonte to the titles of Duke of Acerenza, Marquess of Galatone and Count of Copertino, the last two being created for the Squarciafico family, the Sesto line, allied by marriage to the Squarciafico family since the marriage of Giulio Cesare, 2nd Marquess of Galatone to Lelia Spinola, daughter of Filippo Spinola, Duke of Sesto and Marquess of Venafro, was granted the title of Count with feuds in the province of Messina by Philip V (Philip IV of Sicily and Philip IV of Naples).

Amsterdam is well known for being bicycle friendly. Nevertheless, though people outside of the Netherlands consider Amsterdam to be one of the most famous and important centres of bicycle culture worldwide, the city itself is actually not at the top in terms of bike-friendliness compared to many smaller Dutch cities. This is reflected in the fact that Amsterdam is not on the short-list for the Fietsstad 2014 (BikeCity 2014) awards, announced by the Dutch Fietsersbond (Cyclists' Union): the cities of The Hague, Eindhoven and Almere were nominated for the Fietsstad 2014 awards, while the Netherlands' most bicycle-friendly city of Groningen won the award back in 2001. It should be made clear that for bicycle-friendliness, one must consider the Netherlands as whole. Meanwhile Amsterdam is also struggling with 44% of all cyclists feeling unsafe and a relatively high number of cycle fatalities. The basics As is common in Dutch cities, Amsterdam has a wide net of traffic-calmed streets and world-class facilities for cyclists. All around are bike paths and bike racks, and several guarded bicycle parking stations (Fietsenstalling) which can be used for a nominal fee. According to the most recent figures published by Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2015 the 442.693 households (850.000 residents) in Amsterdam together owned 847.000 bicycles ‚Äî 1.91 bicycle per household. Previously, wildly different figures were arrived at using a Wisdom of the crowd approach. Bicycles are used by all socio-economic groups because of their convenience, Amsterdam's small size, the 400 km of bike paths, the flat terrain, and the arguable inconvenience of driving an automobile: driving a car is discouraged, parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are one-way for motor vehicle traffic (but not for cyclists). Amsterdam's bike paths (Fietspad) are red in colour, in order to differentiate them from both the road ways and footpaths. Amsterdammers ride a wide variety of bicycles including the traditional Omafiets - the ubiquitous Dutch roadster with a step-through frame - to anything from modern city bikes, road bikes, mountain bikes, and even recumbent bikes. Many tourists discover Amsterdam by bike, as it is the typical Dutch way to get around the city. Bicycle tour groups offers a guided bike tour through the city. Bicycle traffic, in fact traffic in general, is relatively safe: in 2007, Amsterdam had 18 traffic deaths, of all types, in total. Bike traffic has a 32% mode share. Bicycle theft in Amsterdam is widespread: in 2005, about 54,000 bicycles were stolen and every year between 12,000 and 15,000 bicycles are retrieved from the canals. Process No other city in the world has tried to tackle the issue of our automobile- reliant lifestyle more radically and aggressively than the capital of the Netherlands, Amsterdam. The city is slashing car access and expanding accessibility and convenience of public transportation by extending hours while being transparent to aim to be an eco-friendly smart city. Roughly, two- thirds of urban transportation is taken place by bicycles and only 19 percent of the citizens use cars daily. Amsterdam‚Äôs ultimate goal is to become a ‚Äúcar- free city‚Äù; aspiring to be a zero-emissions city by making it physically harder for drivers to drive. This will be done by making central roads through-routes, using one-way systems, narrowing roads and creating barriers. Initiatives are taken by the city of Amsterdam itself, by the alderperson and city hall. They plan to even encourage people to use public transportation by running the Metro on weekends all night and be free for children under the age of 12. Urban planning and smart city planning often face the issue of cost. However, the Netherlands‚Äô government is being cost-efficient by using street- design tool ‚Äúknip‚Äù, making cuts. They are closing roads for cars and opening them to two-wheels and pedestrians, and creating space for sweeping squares, especially around big public spaces like a train station. Also, the city encourages the use of public transportation and drop-off taxis by slowly decreasing the number of parking spots. The government is pushing to reform the use of public transportation and make drivers give up their keys to reduce the number of cars on the roads in Amsterdam, hence reducing the CO2 emissions from gasoline. On top of all the efforts done by the legislation, the government is opening their City Data to the public online for free and easy access for its citizens; creating honest transparency with their people. Amsterdam is creating municipal policies under government-citizen transparency to become a smart city and to adapt to the growing urban sprawl happening globally. Possible issues By 2012, cycling in Amsterdam had grown tremendously in popularity ‚Äî up by some 40% in the previous twenty years. The city had 490,000 fietsers (cyclists) take to the road to cycle 2 million kilometres every day according to statistics of the city council. This has caused some problems as, despite 35,000 kilometers of bicycle paths, the country's 18 million bicycles (1.3 per citizen old enough to ride) were clogging Amsterdam's streets at peak times and parked bicycles were overcrowding train stations and other areas. This is being addressed by building even more bike lanes and bicycle parking stations with much greater capacity to tackle a problem many other cities in the world would envy, that of bicycle traffic congestion. Safety is also a concern, mainly on infrastructure that does not yet conform to the modern Dutch road safety policies of Sustainable Safety. Advance stop lines or otherwise little protection at traffic lights on distributor roads is a major cause of collisions, including the death of a 7-year-old girl under a garbage truck in 2013 on a road which did not include protected cycle paths.https://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/224/BINNENLAND/article/detail/3558259/2013/12/07/De- Pijp-rouwt-om-doodgereden-meisje-7.dhtml Gallery  See also  *Cycling in the Netherlands *Cycling in Copenhagen *Fietsersbond * Outline of cycling  References   External links  *Amsterdamize *Cycling - I Amsterdam *Holland-cycling.com: Practical info on cycling in Amsterdam Category:Transport in Amsterdam Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Dutch culture ","title":"Cycling in Amsterdam"},{"id":"29978243","text":"Line Maheux is a Canadian communications consultant and political strategist.

Habitation of the site has been dated to at least 44,000 years ago, placing it among the oldest radiocarbon dated sites in Australia (known older sites, such as the nearby Madjedbebe, are dated stratigraphically). The oldest rock art was produced more than 28,000 years ago, making it the oldest securely dated prehistoric art in Australia. The cave was still visited by members of the Jawoyn within living memory, possibly until as late as the 1950s, but its existence had been forgotten until its 2006 rediscovery. Description Gabarnmung lies at a remote location on the traditional lands of the Jawoyn people, east of Kakadu National Park, and about west of Maningrida, Northern Territory. The rock shelter was constructed by tunneling into a naturally eroded cliff face that created a sub-horizontal ceiling ranging in height from above floor level, the roof is supported by 36 pillars created by the natural erosion of fissure lines in the bedrock. Investigation has shown that some pre-existing pillars were removed, some were reshaped and some moved to new positions. In some areas ceiling slabs were removed and repainted by the people who used the cave. Tool marks on the ceiling and pillars clearly illustrate that the modifications served dual purposes, to providing a living space and to facilitate the removal of rock which was discarded down a talus slope. The floor is covered with soil, a mix of ash from fires, fine sand, silt, and locally fragmented rock to a depth of approximately which lies in seven distinct horizontal stratigraphic layers. Completely open to the north and south, construction has left the shelter entirely protected from rainfall. The rock shelter features prehistoric paintings of fish, including the Barramundi, wallabies, crocodiles, people and spiritual figures. Most of the paintings are located on the shelter's ceiling, but many are found on the walls and pillars of the site. Excavation and dating  The Gabarnmung rock shelter was re- discovered by Ray Whear and Chris Morgan of the Jawoyn Association while flying by helicopter on 15 June 2006.World's oldest ground-edge implement discovered in northern Australia, Monash University press release, 6 November 2010. The Jawoyn Association found two Jawoyn elders, Wamud Namok and Jimmy Kalarriya, who reported the name of the site as Nawarla Gabarnmang (Jawoyn language \\"place of\\", \\"hole in the rock\\"), and who reported to have visited the shelter when they were children. They also identified the Jawoyn clan Buyhmi as the traditional owners of the site.Bruno David et al., \\"Nawarla Gabarnmang, a 45,180¬±910 cal BP Site in Jawoyn Country, Southwest Arnhem Land Platea\\", Journal of Australian Archaeology 73(1), 2011. The site was first excavated in May 2010. Led by Bruno David of Monash University, the team included Jean- Michel Geneste from the Centre National de Prehistoire of the French Ministry of Culture, Hugues Plisson from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique at the University of Bordeaux, Christopher Clarkson from the University of Queensland, Jean-Jacques Delannoy from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique at the University de Savoie, and Fiona Petchey from the University of Waikato. A fragment of a ground-edge stone axe found by the international archaeological team has been dated at 35,500 years old, which makes it the oldest of its type known in the world. A slab of painted rock which fell to the floor had ash adhering which was radiocarbon dated at which indicates that the ceiling must have been painted before 28,000 years ago. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal excavated from the lowest stratigraphic layer returned a mean age of while the six upper layers had been deposited over the last 20,000 years. The art is the oldest firmly dated rock painting in Australia.David, Bruno, Barker, Bryce, Petchey, Fiona, Delannoy, Jean-Jacques, Geneste, Jean-Michel, Rowe, Cassandra, Eccleston, Mark, Lamb, Lara, and Whear, Ray \\"A 28,000 year old excavated painted rock from Nawarla Gabarnmang\\" Journal of Archaeological Science, 40 (5), 2013, pp. 2493-25011, However, radiocarbon dating of charcoal excavated from the base of the lowest stratigraphic layer of the floor returned a mean age of suggesting the oldest date for the earliest human habitation. Faceted and use-striated hematite crayons have been recovered from nearby locations (Malakunanja II and Nauwalabila 1) in strata dated from 45,000 to 60,000 years old which suggests that the Gabarnmung shelter may have been decorated from its inception. The site also includes panels of recent paintings, radiocarbon dated to between AD 1433-1631 and AD 1658-1952 (calibrated 95% CI), consistent with the reports that the cave was still visited within living memory.Robert Gunn, Bruno David, Jean-Jacques Delannoy and Margaret Katherine, \\"The past 500 years of rock art at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land\\" in: Bruno David, Paul S.C.

DIF's effectiveness has led to a reduction in the need and use of chemical plant growth regulators. Although many common greenhouse plants do react strongly to -DIF, there are some plants which show little or no response to -DIF.Cox, Douglas (2007) \\"Controlling Plant Height Without Chemicals\\" Soil and Insect Sciences University of Massachusetts Amherst Basics DIF refers to the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. DIF is calculated by subtracting the nighttime temperature from the daytime temperature to get a +DIF when the daytime is warmer, or a -DIF when the night time is warmer. When there is a +DIF, elongation rates are normal, but when there is a -DIF elongation rates are lowered. As nights are generally cooler than days, the DIF technique is only actively utilized to slow growth, not to increase growth. Instead of increasing heating all through the night, which can be very expensive, another approach to getting a -DIF response is to decrease the temperature in the greenhouse at dawn for 2-3hours. This temporary decrease in temperature from night to day tricks the plant into responding as if there was a -DIF. An optimal DIF is around -10 when measuring in Fahrenheit or approximately -6 in Celsius.http://hortservicesinc.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/What-is-DIF.pdf Drawbacks DIF treatments can also slow the development rate when the average daytime temperature is decreased.

History Entrance to Chenango Ranch subdivision Chenango, Texas is a town located in Brazoria County at the intersection of State Highway 521 and the International & Great Northern Railroad. The older town of Chenango, New York is namesake for the town in Texas. It was centered on Chenango Plantation, a 1,300-acre plantation carved out of the William Harris Survey during the 19th century. S. Richardson and Joshua Abbott added about 3,000 acres to the plantation. In 1835 (circa) Benjamin Fort Smith bought a portion of the 3,000 acres, along with Monroe Edwards and Christopher Dart, who converted the cotton production of the plantation to sugarcane. Monroe Edwards and Christopher Dart also used the plantation for slave smuggling to Texas from Cuba. It was known as \\"Parker's Point\\" in the 1840s. An officer of the Eighth Texas Cavalry Terry's Texas Rangers, Captain Sharpe, owned the plantation later. A post office was opened in Chenango in 1869 and closed in 1871, reopened in 1877 and closed after 1930. In 1906 Chenango had a white school with two teachers and twenty pupils. It also had a black school with 180 pupils and five teachers. By 1947 the white children attended school in the Angleton Independent School District while the black children continued to attend school in Chenango.

Val√©ry or Valery is a masculine given name in parts of Europe (particularly in France and Russia), as well as a common surname in Francophone countries. Another, much rarer, French masculine form can be Valƒóre. Both feminine and masculine forms have derivatives in many European languages and are especially common in Russian and other Eastern European languages. However, the masculine form is not always a cognate of the feminine: it can have a distinct etymology. Etymology Romance The name is generally of Romance origins. The Latin clan name, Valerius, is masculine and denotes strength, health or boldness. Valeria is simply the feminine form of this. Both masculine and feminine given names are derived via French into other languages. In Catholic Europe, given names always related the individual to a saint, so the popularity of a name often reflected the importance of the cult of a saint. There were several important saints who bore the name and were widely venerated in the Middle Ages, as well as more locally in recent times. St Valerie of Limoges (French Sainte Val√©rie de Limoges) probably exercised the greatest influence in spreading the name. Her cult was practised on the very important Way of St James and, as a cephalophore, she became a favourite subject for the early modern ceramics industry. The majority of the variant spellings are of recent, mainly 20th century, origin, with fashions often following the forms adopted in popular songs. Germanic The modern masculine given name Val√©ry is ambiguous. While generally a cognate of Val√©rie, it can also be development of, or synonym for, the name Walaric(us) (English Walric), which is of Germanic origin and signifies ‚Äúforeign power‚Äù. A notable example is Walric, abbot of Leuconay. Both ‚ÄúSaint-Valery‚Äù [valri] and ‚ÄúSaint-Val√©ry‚Äù [valeri] are common elements in French place-names, often used optionally for the same place. The second form is a modern misspelling for ‚ÄòSaint-Valery‚Äô, that is to say St Walric.

He is currently employed by Joe Gibbs Racing as the crew chief for the Leavine Family Racing No. 95 NASCAR Cup Series car, driven by Christopher Bell. In 2009, he scored his first championship in the Nationwide Series with Kyle Busch. Early life Born on December 8, 1967 in Sumter, South Carolina, Ratcliff moved six times throughout his childhood before settling in Westlake, Louisiana. As a resident there, he began his racing career working on mini Sprint Cars. In 1985, he graduated from Westlake High School. Afterward, he moved to Texas, while he continued to work on mini Sprint Cars for the next nine years. Professional racing career Ten years after graduating high school, Sadler Racing in Nashville, Tennessee hired him. While being employed there he became a mechanic and rear tire changer for drivers Chuck Bown and Gary Bradberry in the Nationwide Series. He worked there for only two years before being employed at LAR Motorsports (headquartered in Columbia, Tennessee) as a chief mechanic for Casey Atwood and Jeff Purvis during the 1997 and 1998 seasons. In 1999, Ratcliff became the crew chief for then Nationwide Series rookie, Casey Atwood while being employed at Brewco Motorsports. After working as the crew chief for him two years, Casey moved to Evernham Motorsports. Afterward, Jamie McMurray became Ratcliff's new driver. During the 2003 and 2004 seasons, he became the crew chief for David Green. While together they won three races, achieved 11 top- fives, 21 top-10s and two pole positions, which resulted in a second place in the final standings, 14 points behind Brian Vickers. By the end of their relationship, they scored seven wins and seven pole positions. In 2005, Ratcliff moved to Joe Gibbs Racing as the crew chief for J. J. Yeley. He remained the crew chief for Yely until 2006. During the two years, Jason Ratcliff was able to achieve 13 top-fives and 34 top-10 finishes.

It is also known as the Jecheon Crisis. Since 2003, hundreds of sexually active men and women around Jecheon, Chungcheong province, have become infected with HIV. The suspect was found to be a 27-year-old taxi driver, arrested on March 11, 2009, on suspicions of stealing women's underwear. Police raided his apartment and found a stash of 400 pairs of women's underwear and several amateur pornographic movies filmed on a mobile phone. An odd rumor started going around while women's underwear were disappearing from homes and adult entertainment establishments in Jeocheon-si. Jeonmo was revealed as the culprit when he broke into one home and stole some women's underwear, and police held him on suspicion of stealing 100 or so pairs of women's underwear, and the truth started coming out. He was merely a burglar, but Mr. Jeon had stolen women's underwear, so there was an issue. Mr. Jeon was having a hard time in life having contracted AIDS from a woman, however, the investigation revealed that revenge was not a motive. Victims have been sought, but there was difficulty in verifying the victims, since they did not cooperate with the investigation. The suspect was later revealed to be HIV positive, having been turned away from military service in 2003.  Cause  Jeonmo (26 years old at the time) was confirmed as having AIDS immediately after being enlisted to the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. However, it is unclear who infected him, as he had sexual relations with a thirty year old homosexual male, a housewife, and a female prostitute in or about 2002. He was unaware for more than a year, and did not know he had contracted AIDS until it was revealed in a physical examination after being conscripted. Mr. Jeon enlisted in June 2003, but was sent home after it was verified that he had contracted AIDS. The victim refused to answer as to why he didn't use a condom. Jeonmo contracted a sexual disease from either girls he had dated during military service, or from a girl at an adult entertainment establishment, and after being discharged, he had pain and pus on his genital, so it is hypothesized that this stirred up a retaliatory spirit towards the girls that had infected him with AIDS. However, subsequently, during the police investigation Jeonmo also testified that he did not have a retaliatory spirit towards the girls who had infected him with AIDS. Jeonmo testified, \\"I did not use a condom.\\" Specifically, police view the fact that Jeonmo sought employment as a taxi driver was for the purpose of irrational revenge against numerous women. At the onset of the incident, sexual assault and violence was assumed, however, it was revealed that sexual relations were consensual with the majority of the women. Post-Arrest There was a stir following the senseless sexual contact of someone who had contracted AIDS in the Jecheon, Chungbuk area on March 13, 2009, and an AIDS scare in neighboring areas as well. In the morning of March 13, the Chungbuk Jecheon Police Agency secured the phone numbers of approximately 70 women from the mobile phone of Jeonmo, who was infected with AIDS, and verified their identities, following an examination of the mobile phone and emails of Jeonmo. Since Jeonmo was AIDS positive, the police maintained high security, and proceeded with the investigation. According to the police, on the same day the suspect was arrested, the initial news brief that was planned for broadcast was that of a simple burglary. However, by afternoon the next day, information of the case was leaked, and the first report went out of \\"someone infected with AIDS\\" at midnight that day, and the incident quickly escalated. There were even predictions that he purposely had sexual relations without using contraception, on a spate of revenge. During the police investigation he testified \\"he did not use a condom,\\" and this shocked the general public, in addition to those he had sexual relations with. However, he did tell the truth to some of the women and men, before and after having sex, and told them to go to a clinic. Police proceeded to investigate Mr. Jeon on March 13, and called Ms. A (29 years old), who was verified as having had sexual relations with Mr. Jeon in mid-October of last year. Mr. Jeon typically had sexual relations with female workers at adult entertainment establishments, who finished work late at night. The women, who were Mr. Jeon's taxi passengers, were typically drunk, and it is hypothesized that they were easily tempted by his distinguished appearance. The pornographic movies he had filmed at his one- room apartment showed female adult entertainment establishment workers, but also featured housewives, women in their 30s to 40s. He had sexual relations by luring female passengers, such as those as alcohol servers from adult entertainment establishments, drunk females, and housewives in their 30s and 40s. Police revealed that there were more than 10 females who were filmed having sexual relations. Jeonmo was verified as a bisexual, since there were also relationships with men, and the scare was expanded from female prostitutes, to men. The fact that he even had sexual relations with housewives in their 30s to 40s expanded the scandal. Upon until that time, Mr. Jeon had become infected, but did not show any symptoms of AIDS. The probability of becoming infected from sexual acts is only 1-4/1000, however, in the case that the women who had sexual relations with Mr. Jeon had sexual contact with other men, the risk of infection would increase exponentially, and an AIDS scare descended upon Jecheon. The AIDS scare spread to various places in Korea, and following a press inquiry, a police spokesperson said, \\"We have made a request to the telecom company to verify the identity of approximately 260 phone numbers that were stored on Mr. Jeon's mobile phone, and called the numbers one by one to verify identities,\\" adding, \\"as a result, we secured the phone numbers of approximately 70 individuals.\\"  See also  * Miryang gang rape * Jhindo AIDS Crime  References   External links  * Ï†úÏ≤ú, ÏóêÏù¥Ï¶à 20ÎåÄÎÇ® 6ÎÖÑÍ∞Ñ ÏàòÏã≠Î™ÖÍ≥º ÏÑ±Í¥ÄÍ≥Ñ ÏΩîÎ¶¨ÏïÑÏúÑÌÅ¥Î¶¨ * 'ÏóêÏù¥Ï¶à ÏÇ¨ÌÉú' Ïó¨ÏÑ±Ï†ÑÌôî 70Ïó¨Í∞ú ÌôïÎ≥¥ * Arrested Taxi Driver Knowingly Spread AIDS in Korea *AIDS Fear Spreads in Jecheon County *S.

It was published by Trident Press in October, 1969. The title is a play on the Making of the President books by Theodore White. The book describes the marketing of Richard Nixon during the 1968 presidential campaign. It has been described as \\"a classic of political journalism\\" and a \\"classic of campaign reporting that first introduced many readers to the stage-managed world of political theater.\\" It was reprinted in 1988 under the title The Selling of the President. McGinniss became an overnight success when the book, his first, landed on The New York Times bestseller list. He was 26 years old, making him the youngest living writer with that achievement. The book was on the New York Times non-fiction bestseller list for 31 weeks from October 1969 to May 1970. The idea for the book came to McGinniss almost serendipitously: > [He] stumbled across his book‚Äôs topic while taking a train to New York. A > fellow commuter, had just landed the Hubert Humphrey account and was > boasting that 'in six weeks we‚Äôll have him looking better than Abraham > Lincoln.' McGinniss tried to get access to Humphrey‚Äôs campaign first, but > they turned him down. So he called up Nixon‚Äôs, and they said yes.\\". After becoming a staff White House reporter McGinnis had full access to Richard Nixon. The book is written as a first hand account of the taping of television ads for the 1968 Presidential Campaign. It gives a first hand account of Roger Ailes marketing genius along with some colorful language used by Nixon. The book was very well received by both critics and the public. It \\"spent more than six months on best-sellers lists, and McGinniss sold a lot of those books through television, appearing on the titular shows of Merv Griffin, David Frost and Dick Cavett, among others.\\" Conservative writer William F. Buckley \\"assumed McGinniss had relied on 'an elaborate deception which has brought joy and hope to the Nixon-haters.' But even Buckley liked the book.\\" In 1972, the book was adapted into a short-lived Broadway musical.The Selling of the President The Internet Broadway Database. Retrieved 2012-04-03.

It is the capital of the Mai dima Subregion. It lies to the west of Mendefera. The area is primarily agricultural and contains 20 kebabis (residential areas). History During the 18th century, the hereditary chiefs (Midriwedisebera) of Machew ruled from Maydima. They faced much opposition during the 19th century from the Seraye. During the reigns of Emperors Tewodros II and Yohannes IV, the chiefs sought to enhance their authority by forming family alliances through marriage with the Tsazzega and the Hazzega. However, by the 1880s they lost control to the Ras Alula and sided with the Italians, who established a colonial post at Mayduma in 1890. The town grew in regional importance in the 1940s when the building of a dirt road to Barentu saw it develop as a market town. Tension mounted in the region in the 1960s and 1970s with the establishment of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). They eventually liberated the town from the Ethiopian authorities in 1977 until July 1978 until recaptured and appointed as a military post by the Derg. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) occupied the vicinity in the 1980s, and in June 1981, the first of a series of battles took place in the area, particularly near Mai Dima and along the road to Tokombia. The initial fighting took place in the Mayduma area during Ethiopia's May 2000 offensive, especially around the well-guarded village of Adi Nifas and the town of Mai Dima.

Founded in 1926, The Winchendon School has an average classroom size of eight students, an enrollment of approximately 290 students, and a student to teacher ratio of 6:1  One School, Two Campuses  The Winchendon School is composed of two campuses; a main campus located in Winchendon, Massachusetts, and a newly opened campus in Brooklyn, New York City. The School's flagship campus in Winchendon, MA serves boarding and day students in grades 9-12 and PGs. The picturesque setting and extensive facilities provide a safe environment while also enjoying easy access to Boston, Providence, NYC, and the rest of the northeast. The close proximity and good transportation options allow families from Boston to Springfield and from Providence to Portsmouth to consider the five-day boarding option and regularly enjoy a meal, event, or contest with their students. The NYC satellite campus is in the heart of Brooklyn, within walking distance of some of the world's great resources, including universities and libraries, athletics and arts facilities, museums, and potential employers. The NYC campus is also closely connected with local neighborhoods through its partnership with the CDSC (Child Development Support Corporation).  The Winchendon School MA Campus  Nestled on several hundred acres of fields and woods, but within walking distance of town, Winchendon's flagship campus is a great place for students to find the ‚Äúspace‚Äù they need to flourish, while also keeping them connected to the world around them. All academic and other major facilities have been either newly built or significantly refurbished within the last 10 years. The town of Winchendon offers a range of shops and food within walking distance, and Boston is just over an hour away. The MA campus includes six academic and lab buildings, six dorms, a theater, a two-story arts studio, and a music room. Its athletic facilities feature the Ritchie Ice Arena, the LaBelle Athletic Fields, Boomhower Field, six tennis courts, and two basketball and volleyball courts and a fitness center. MA  The Winchendon School NYC Campus  Winchendon's NYC campus is purposefully located in the center of Brooklyn, in a building owned by the CDSC, a long-time provider of services for the BedStuy, Clinton Hill and Fort Greene neighborhoods. Students can be tackling quadratic equations or the next draft of an essay one period, and 10 minutes later, moving downstairs to help in the food pantry or the hydroponic garden. With a subway stop less than 200‚Äô from our door, commuting and access to all of NYC is easy. Facilities near the New York City Campus include: * Brooklyn Museum * Transportation Museum * Pratt Institute (2 blocks) * NYU * LIU * BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music) * Mark Morris * BRIC * YMCA * Brooklyn Bridge and Prospect Park * Barclays Center * Thousands of potential employers, laboratories, artist studios and other potential ‚Äúclassrooms‚Äù The MA campus is from Mount Monadnock, one of the most-climbed mountains in the world. 350x350px  Students  Winchendon students come from all across the world. Numbers change year-to-year, but a typical student body represents over 15 countries and approximately 15 US states. The school community includes students in 9th grade to students in 12th grade, as well as post-graduates (PGs). The Winchendon School offers a total of $3 million in needs-based grants to its students every year.  Special academic programs  The School is recognized for three academic programs: Global Dynamics, Service Learning, and ColLABS,. Global Dynamics is a four-year sequence of courses that provides students with an integrated, multicultural survey of different regions of the world: Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, Africa, and the United States. Students examine history, art, literature, political science, economics and sociology to grapple with the forces of human nature - what unites and divides us - both in centuries past and as events became news yesterday. Contemporary challenges require interdisciplinary solutions, and Global Dynamics is based on that model. In addition to comprehension, expression, and problem-solving skills, students develop increasingly robust critical thinking and collaborative skills. Service Learning is a year-long, student-led, project-based curriculum in which students identify a problem or issue in the community around them and then work to fix it in collaborative groups. Service Learning is another element of the Winchendon experience where student interests reign supreme: from the theater to animal rights, from the impact of addiction to protecting the environment - whatever it is that our students feel the world needs. They put together the ideas, resources, and plan to make it happen. Service Learning is as important as any course of study at Winchendon, as not only are the students practicing the core disciplines of problem solving, comprehension and communication, but they also have the opportunity to develop empathy, resourcefulness, adaptability, resilience and collaborative skills‚Äîand SL may be the single greatest opportunity for teens to develop leadership skills. ColLABs, or collaborative laboratories, are immersive, interest driven learning opportunities open to all Winchendon students. Twice a year, Winchendon students engage in two week intensive courses, collaborative projects, and internships. Short for Collaborative Laboratory, these Courses are elective-style workshops based on one of three types of learning experiences: * Faculty-led, immersive classes with extensive project and field-based learning * Student-designed (with teachers as mentors) independent projects in areas of specific interest * Internships Regular classes are set aside for the last two weeks of each semester so that students can pursue ColLABs of their choosing - all of which emphasize fundamental skills and habits central to The Winchendon School: character, collaboration, resilience, resourcefulness, and adaptability, just to name a few. Risk-taking is encouraged, and the design process and experience are often as important as the actual ColLAB itself. The Winchendon School website contains more information on the ColLAB program: https://winchendon.org/collabs-project-based-learning-and-electives/ Immersive learning through ColLABorative studies at The Winchendon School means our students have achieved subject mastery and personal growth through our experience-based learning. This can look different for different students. For some students, it may look like an internship at a non-profit learning how to fundraise, while for another student it may be writing a research paper on The Detection Mechanism of Gravitational Waves Emitted from a Type 1A Supernovae. thumb Winchendon's athletic teams are known as the Wapitis, and their colors are dark green and white. The following competitive sports are offered at The Winchendon School: * Ice Hockey (boys and girls) * Basketball (boys and girls) * Soccer (boys and girls) * Cross Country (boys and girls) * Badminton (boys and girls) * Tennis (boys and girls) * Baseball (boys) * Softball (girls) * Ultimate Frisbee (boys and girls) * Volleyball (girls) * Golf (boys and girls) * Lacrosse (boys and girls) Winchendon is a part of New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC). History Williams College alumnus Robert Marr's experience at Deerfield Academy, and earlier at Vermont Academy, provided him knowledge to take The Winchendon School into its permanent home. As new headmaster in Newport at The Hatch School in 1959, Marr maintained its tutorial model while introducing his own leadership brand. Finding a new campus emerged as a focus for the new Head. Marr settled on Winchendon's current location. The school moved in the summer 1961 to Winchendon, Massachusetts. Teachers like Charles Dillaway and Clifford Eriksen provided teaching in the traditional Hatch mold. The seasoned leadership of Bob Marr and his assistant head (and former Vermont Academy colleague) Frederick L. Zins enabled newly arrived students to sense the great traditions of Hatch- Newport ‚Äì while also experiencing a revitalized school and its own setting. During the early to mid-1980s, the school faced financial difficulties, which drew attention to the failures of the school. This led to many successful and grateful alumni donating to The Winchendon School. In the late 1980s, a rolling capital campaign was started that led to the addition of new dorms, a gymnasium and additional classrooms. Much of this attention happened during Headmaster LaBelle's tenure and pushed the school onto its feet, and it has been financially healthy ever since. The Winchendon School has only had six headmasters. Marr's tenure (1959‚Äì1973), was followed by Lewis V. Posich, Stephen V.A. Samborski, J. William LaBelle, John A. Kerney, and current Head of School Laurie Lambert.

It is played on all levels, from children to middle-aged men. Liga 1, the Indonesian domestic league is popular. The national body is the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI). The Indonesian football league started around 1930 in the Dutch colonial era. Indonesia Football Association The governing body is the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI). PSSI organises the men's, women's, and futsal national teams, as well as the Indonesian League. Indonesian League System In 1993, PSSI combined the existing \\"Galatama\\" which was A Semi-Professional competitions and an amateur competitions \\"Perserikatan\\" (Union, Bahasa Indonesia) to be a single professional competition for football clubs, known as the Indonesian League (Liga Indonesia). From 1994 to 2007, the format of the top division competition was a combination of double round-robin format and a single eliminations second round for several top teams of the table to decide the champions. Starting from 2008-09 season onwards, the competition format changed into a more common system that also being used in most European football leagues. The single elimination round was removed and the competition has become a full double round-robin league system. The name also changed into Indonesia Super League. Since 2017, the top league is named Liga 1. Men's team On the international stage, Indonesia experienced limited success despite being the first Asian team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup. In 1938, they played as the Dutch East Indies. Losing 0‚Äì6 to Hungary in a then-direct knockout stage and has never qualified again since, Indonesia became the only country to play only one match in the World Cup. In 1956, the football team played in the Summer Olympics and earned a hard-fought 0‚Äì0 draw against then footballing superpower Soviet Union, led by the legendary Lev Yashin playing under the goal for them, before losing 0‚Äì4 on the replay match. On the continental level, Indonesia won the bronze medal in the 1958 Asian Games. Indonesia's first appearance in Asian Cup was back in 1996. With a draw against Kuwait in their first match and two defeats in the following two matches against Korea Republic and the host, UAE, Indonesia finished bottom of group A with a solitary point. In 2000, they again forced a draw against Kuwait, but then lost to China and the Korea Republic. In 2004, the national team recorded their first-ever win in the Asian Cup against Qatar, but the dreams of the nation of going to the second round were shattered due to the defeats against China and Bahrain in the following group games. Indonesia beat Bahrain in 2007 AFC Asian Cup as one of the four co-hosts but the qualification dream was again shattered after two defeats by Asian superpowers Saudi Arabia and for the third time against the Korea Republic. However, Indonesia failed to qualify to the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar after finishing bottom of Group B in the qualifiers without winning any single match. The youth teams occasionally qualified for the AFC U-19 Championship (U-19 team) and AFC U-16 Championship (U-16 team). The U-19 team is the only Indonesian team to ever win continental-level tournament, share-winning the U-19 Championship in 1961 with Burma.

Since the 1990s, the Indonesian football league has had 74 fan related deaths. On the world stage, Indonesia also has a very heated rivalry with Malaysia. The two fan bases regularly have fights, with the recent case happened during the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC) in which Indonesia harassing and provoking the Malaysian fans during their defeat at their home ground, Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. After the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, Indonesian fans also took to social media to insult, harass, and send death threats to Vietnamese players, and even their family, in response to the loss in the final to Vietnam, as well as a dirty play by Vietnamese player, ƒêo√†n VƒÉn H·∫≠u. Even worse, Indonesian fans went to ƒêo√†n VƒÉn H·∫≠u‚Äôs club, Dutch side SC Heerenveen‚Äôs Instagram, to spam hate, and even visited Heerenveen player's pages to hate, despite them having absolutely nothing to do with ƒêo√†n VƒÉn H·∫≠u. More confusingly, angry Indonesian fans are spreading hate towards Heerenveen player's girlfriends, as well as calling black Heerenveen players racial slurs. It is not surprising that Indonesia have been warned and banned several times by FIFA due to their act of hooliganism and, sometimes, having their government intervention on PSSI.

It is the first published screenplay written by McCarthy, who primarily writes novels but has also written two plays and had four of his novels adapted into feature-length films.Davies, Adam Lee. \\"Brace yourself, more Cormac McCarthy adaptations are coming down the road\\". The Guardian, January 11, 2010. Retrieved December 5, 2010. The story is based around a strange murder in Graniteville, South Carolina in 1876 that is without many details. At the request of director Richard Pearce, McCarthy wrote the screenplay for a two- hour episode of the television series Visions that was broadcast by PBS on January 6, 1977. The story focuses on a young man embittered by the changes in his community due to the capitalist ways of the owner of the town's cotton mill. His anger grows until his rage consumes both himself and the families caught up in it. The episode was nominated for two Emmy awards and the screenplay has gone on to be published in book form.\\"A Guide to the Cormac McCarthy Papers\\".

Beginning in early 1975, and armed with only \\"a few photographs in the footnotes to a 1928 biography of a famous pre-Civil War industrialist William Gregg as inspiration,\\" he and McCarthy spent a year traveling the South in order to research the subject matter.\\"Novelist reimagines Graniteville murder\\".

Plot summary Act one William Gregg, the owner of The Graniteville Manufacturing Company and patriarch of the Gregg family, is near death. After a visit by Dr. Perceval, he and Marina Gregg, wife of William, go to see Robert McEvoy, the son of Patrick McEvoy, a worker at the mill who tends the gardens. Robert has a broken leg due to an accident which may have been the fault of James Gregg, William‚Äôs son. Robert is convinced by Mrs. Gregg to have surgery to remove the leg, which demonstrates the ‚Äúquasi-familial‚Äù relationship between owners and workers at the mill under the command of William.Todd, Raymond.

When William Gregg passes away, James takes over the mill and is not as sympathetic to his workers and leaves many of them unemployed without remorse. Robert's hatred for the mill and James continues to grow while he is recovering and he wishes to return to the farm his family once owned. He leaves Graniteville as an act of rebellion against James and the changes he has made to the mill. Act two Two years later, Robert returns after hearing word of his mother's illness but he is too late and finds her being buried on the same property as the mill. This angers him because as he says, \\"She don't belong to the mill.\\" He goes on to find the mill even worse than he left it. His father has been assigned to work in a factory, leaving the once beautiful gardens to turn to weeds. Robert is angry at the capitalist behavior of James and the awful treatment of the workers. While searching for his father in order to discuss the burial of Mrs. McEvoy, he happens upon James in the mill's offices. After a heated conversation, he shoots and kills Gregg. At once, the factory goes silent, \\"as if Robert has shot the factory itself, the very system, in the abdomen, bringing capitalism's exploitation of its workers to a temporary halt.\\"Canfield, J. Douglas. \\"Oedipal Complexities in Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs The Stonemason and The Gardener‚Äôs Son\\". The Cormac McCarthy Journal. Retrieved December 6, 2010. Many citizens believe Robert's actions to be because of James‚Äôs rumored bribe and seduction of Robert‚Äôs sister, Martha, when they were younger, though she claims that he is not aware of the incident. Nobody is ever able to determine Robert's motives and he is unable to speak in order to defend himself or expose the true character of James. Robert remains this way and continues to be an outsider to the community until he is hanged as a punishment for his crime.

A language model is constructed for each document in the collection. It is then possible to rank each document by the probability of specific documents given a query. This is interpreted as being the likelihood of a document being relevant given a query. Calculating the likelihood Using Bayes' rule, the probability P of a document d, given a query q can be written as follows: : P(d|q) = \\\\frac{P(q|d) P(d)}{P(q)} Since the probability of the query P(q) is the same for all documents, this can be ignored. Further, it is typical to assume that the probability of documents is uniform. Thus, P(d) is also ignored. : P(d|q) = P(q|d) Documents are then ranked by the probability that a query is observed as a random sample from the document model. The multinomial unigram language model is commonly used to achieve this. We have: : P(q|M_d) = K_q \\\\prod_{t \\\\in V} P(t|M_d)^{tf_{t,q}} ,where the multinomial coefficient is K_q = L_q!/(tf_{t1,q}!tf_{t2,q}!...tf_{tN,q}!) for query , and L_q = \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq N}tf_{t_i,q} is the length of query given the term frequencies in the query vocabulary . In practice the multinomial coefficient is usually removed from the calculation. The reason is that it is a constant for a given bag of words (such as all the words from a specific document d). The language model M_d should be the true language model calculated from the distribution of words underlying each retrieved document. In practice this language model is unknown, so it is usually approximated by considering each term (unigram) from the retrieved document together with its probability of appearance. So P(t|M_d) is the probability of term t being generated by the language model M_d of document d. This probability is multiplied for all terms from query q to get a rank for document d in the interval [0,1]. The calculation is repeated for all documents to create a ranking of all documents in the document collection. Christopher D.

Rado is known for having coined the term \\"schizotype\\" in 1956 as an abbreviation of \\"schizophrenic phenotype\\". These writings played a foundational role in modern conceptualizations of schizotypy, and the genetic etiology of schizophrenia and psychosis. Life Having qualified as a doctor, Sandor Rado met Sigmund Freud in 1915 and decided to become a psychoanalyst. He was analysed first by a former analysand of Freud, E. Revesz, and then, after his move to Berlin, by Karl Abraham. Among his own distinguished analysands were Wilhelm Reich and \\"Heinz Hartmann, the most prominent among the ego psychologists.\\"Gay, p. 402n and p. 463.

Otto Fenichel considered that \\"the paper by Rado [1928] unmasked the self-reproaches as an ambivalent ingratiation of (the object and ) the superego\\", and that \\"the differentiation of the 'good' (i.e., protecting) and the 'bad' (i.e., punishing) aspects of the superego was used for clarification of the aims of the depressive mechanisms.\\"Fenichel, p. 412. Rad√≥ also wrote seminal papers on the question of addiction: \\"His concept of 'alimentary orgasm', which replaced genital supremacy in pharmocothymia, has been widely quoted.\\"Alexander.

The brand is sold in more than 700 shops around the world, as well as in Rag & Bone retail stores. History Rag & Bone was founded in 2002 by Nathan Bogle and Marcus Wainwright. In 2004 the label launched with a men's line and a women's line followed in 2005. In 2006, Bogle left the company and David Neville, who joined the company in 2005, became partner with Wainwright. With the help of footwear designer Tull Price, former owner of Royal Elastics and current co-owner of FEIT, Rag & Bone Footwear was founded in 2008. Created in Spring 2011 for Rag & Bone /JEAN, the D.I.Y. Project sought to flip the traditional photo shoot on its head. An ongoing creative initiative, each girl is given a digital camera, a bag of clothes and the same remit ‚Äì to interpret Rag & Bone /JEAN in their own individual way. Models such as Miranda Kerr, Jessica Hart, Lily Aldridge, Poppy Delevingne, Abbey Lee Kershaw and Candice Swanepoel have been a part of this. It was in New York in 2001 that Wainwright had the idea to try to make a pair of men's jeans which ultimately took him to Kentucky where he worked with a factory for over 18 months to perfect his product. That experience, he cites, as informing the brand‚Äôs philosophy. Today, Rag & Bone offer men's and women's ready to wear, jeans (under rag & bone/JEAN), footwear and accessories. Rag & Bone's footwear line includes the Newbury boot. For their SS15 menswear collection, in lieu of a fashion show, they enlisted friends of the brand, including Jerry Seinfeld, Carmelo Anthony, Camille Rowe and Alex McWatt for a portrait photo series shot by Andreas Laszlo Konrath. In October 2015, Wainwright and Neville, who previously spoke at the WWD Menswear Summit, were guest speakers at the WWD CEO Summit where they discussed the brand's trajectory and retail footprint, including their newly opened NY concept store, the General Store. In October 2016, Rag & Bone expanded into the world of fragrance with the launch of a line of eight unisex Eau de Parfums. Scents included Oddity, Amber, Cypress, Rose, Encens, Oud, Bergamot and Neroli. In October 2016 Rag & Bone also signed its first licensing deal for eyewear with Italian eyewear creator, Safilo Group, beginning in January 2018. Ad campaigns Kate Moss starred in the brand's first ever advertising campaign for FW 2012 and also shot their SS 2013 campaign. American actor Michael Pitt fronted their first men‚Äôs campaign for FW 2013 with French actress L√©a Seydoux appearing in their women‚Äôs campaign. For SS 2014 they cast actors Emile Hirsch and Stacy Martin. For FW14 Michael Pitt and Winona Ryder star in their campaign. The SS15 campaign featured a Rag & Bone film called The Driver, starring Michael Pitt and Astrid Berges-Frisbey. Directed by Pitt, it won the Best Production Award in the Established Talent category at the Milan Fashion Film Festival in September 2015. This 1983 Porsche 911SC is similar to the 1979 model destroyed in the brand's FW15 campaign. The brand had raised controversy after an attempt at shock advertising backfired, when it commissioned an advertisement where the body of a vintage Porsche 911SC, widely considered a work of art by design enthusiasts, was crushed. However the Porsche used in the advert had actually been a shell of a car that was salvaged from a scrap yard for the shoot. In February 2016, Rag & Bone launched a serial Photo Project ad campaign. The photographs, shot by Glen Luchford, featured women representing the diversity and breadth of the brand.Lisa Lockwood, Rag & Bone Unfurls Serial Photo Project Women's Wear Daily February 11, 2016 Later that year, the Men‚Äôs Project featured an eclectic cast of men from various artistic backgrounds.

The pyramid, begun in 1993, at the 1,200th anniversary of Wemding, will take another years to complete and is scheduled to be finished in the year 3183. As of , the first of its scheduled 120 concrete blocks have been placed.Conception Official Zeitpyramide website, accessed: 14 December 2010Die Stadt der Zeitpyramide (The city of the time pyramid) Official Wemding website, accessed: 14 December 2010  Concept  The town of Wemding dates back to the year 793 and celebrated its 1,200th anniversary in 1993. The time pyramid was conceived by Manfred Laber (a local artist) in June 1993 to mark this 1,200-year period and to give people a sense of what the span of 1,200 years really means. One block is scheduled to be placed every ten years, taking 1,190 years (see Fencepost error) in total. The material of the blocks used is not fixed and may be altered in future generations depending on availability.Zeitpyramide Official Zeitpyramide website, accessed: 14 December 2010  Artist  Manfred Laber was born in Wemding in 1932 and studied painting at the Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste in Berlin in the 1950s. He has other artwork on permanent display on the Isla San Antonio, and in Alcanar, Spain, and Mormoiron, France. Alcanar is also his part-time place of residence.Biographie Manfred Laber Official Zeitpyramide website, accessed: 14 December 2010  Construction   Current progress  The pyramid, as far as it exists today, is on a concrete pad on a rounded hilltop, the Robertsh√∂he,Ein Wolf an der Wiege und ein Geb√§ude mit 1200 Jahren Bauzeit Augsburger Allgemeine, published: 4 September 2010, accessed: 14 December 2010 on the northern edge of Wemding.

Der dritte Dekadenstein auf der Wemdinger Robertsh√∂he ist gesetzt, Helmut Bissinger The project's initial financing was mostly achieved through donations by local companies, which, for example, supplied the materials for the concrete slab for free. The project is administrated by a foundation based in Wemding.Stiftung Wemdinger Zeitpyramide Official Zeitpyramide website, accessed: 14 December 2010  Speculative future progress  A model of the final artwork is exhibited at Wemding, at the Haus des Gastes. It is unknown if or how the project would be continued if the administrative foundation stopped existing. Assuming the project proceeded according to plan, it would naturally fall into stages by tier.  Base tier  The planned base layer, measuring , consists of 64 blocks arranged in 8 rows and 8 columns with a presumptive stage completion date of 2623‚Äîsome decades after Wemding's hypothetical bimillenary.  Second tier  The planned second layer will consist of 36 blocks, in a 6 by 6 format with a presumptive stage completion date of 2983. This is the first layer that requires a block be placed atop another block, which would require a crane or some form of scaffolding such as an earthen ramp used as an incline.  Third tier  The planned third layer will consist of 16 blocks arranged in 4 by 4 with a presumptive stage completion date of 3143.  Fourth tier  The planned final, fourth layer consists of 4 blocks, arranged in 2 by 2, upon completion of which the structure will be finished, having taken just shy of a decade less time to build than Wemding had been in existence at the time the first block was laid.  Completion  The pyramid, when completed in the year 3183, is scheduled to consist of 120 stone or concrete blocks, each measuring long, wide and tall. Adjacent blocks are separated by gaps of half a block or .

Officially dedicated on May 30, 1985, the monument portrays an American soldier, carrying the body of a Holocaust survivor out of a Nazi concentration camp.\\"Art and Architecture of New Jersey,\\" ETTC.net. (inactive link archived at Internet Archive) Background This memorial sculpture was commissioned by the State of New Jersey and sponsored by a coalition of veterans organizations. It was strategically located so that it would face the Statue of Liberty and form a \\"topological triad\\" that would include Liberation, Liberty Island, and Ellis Island.Young, James Edward, The Texture of Memory: Holocaust Memorials and Meaning, 1983, Yale University Press, page 321. According to at least one scholar, the inclusion of the monument in this \\"triad\\" is to recognize the Holocaust as a \\"counterpoint\\" to \\"American democratic and egalitarian ideals,\\" in the same way the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. serves as counterpoint to the values embodied in other national monuments.DeCoste, F.C., and Schwartz, Bernard, \\"The Holocaust's ghost: writings on art, politics, law, and education,\\" The University of Alberta Pres, 2000, page 170. The monument is fifteen feet tall and weighs approximately two tons.U.S. Department of Defense Guide to Observances, Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1987. It recalls America's self-perception in terms of the role of the U.S. military in the liberation of the camps, and as a refuge for many survivors. The Liberty Park Monument Committee, formed by New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean, was tasked with raising funds for a monument \\"to honor American servicemen as liberators of oppressed peoples.\\" The official State resolution issued on the day of the monument's dedication noted that, \\"our service members fought, not to conquer or to be aggressors, but rather to rescue and restore freedom to those persecuted and oppressed by the fascist powers.\\" Department of Defense Holocaust Remembrance Guide The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Guide to Observances for the Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust includes a photo of the monument on its cover, and a description of the monument's message on the inside cover: :[Rapoport's] artistic goal was to embody in bronze a daring vision: in the face of sorrow and tragedies, he asserted that hope can triumph despite atrocity.... Liberation depicts an American soldier carrying a survivor out of a concentration camp. The chests of the rescuer and rescued are joined, as if sharing one heart. The way that the survivor's body is cradled in the arms of his liberator reflects comfort and trust. Liberation is a testament to the Americans who liberated the camps, and it is a memorial to those who perished. But it is also a symbol of the strong helping the weak, not persecuting them. It is a vision of one human being supporting another. It is a tribute to the best of America's dreams: freedom, compassion, bravery, and -- above all -- hope. On April 10, 1988, a copy of the DOD Guide was presented to Governor Kean during a special Holocaust ceremony held at the monument. The book was the idea of U.S. Navy chaplain Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff, who spoke at the ceremony and made the presentation.Emblen, Frank, \\"Holocaust Observances\\", \\"New Jersey Guide,\\" New York Times, April 10, 1988. Retrieved December 9, 2010. At the ceremony, a copy of the Guide was also presented to General Francis Gerard, a veteran of World War II, and Commander of the New Jersey Department of Defense. Meaning beyond the Holocaust Commentators have noted that this monument, although directly linked to the Holocaust as an historical event, has taken on larger meaning as a reminder of America's positive role in the world.Alexander, Jeffrey C., and Jay, Martin, \\"Remembering the Holocaust: A Debate, Oxford University Press, 2009, page 65. Governor Kean's speech at the monument's dedication sought to \\"resist the skepticism about America's place in the world,\\" as he proclaimed that the monument affirmed his \\"American heritage\\" and caused him to feel \\"deep pride in his American values.\\" \\"The monument says that we,\\" he continued, \\"as a collective people, stand for freedom. We, as Americans, are not oppressors, and we, as Americans, do not engage in armed conflict for the purpose of conquest. Our role in the world is to preserve that precious, precious thing that we consider to be a free democracy. Today we will remember those who gave their lives for freedom.\\" References External links *Liberty State Park website, with detailed photographs of the monument. *Photo by Gil Azouri. *Information and map at WW2Museums.com.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 24, 1983. It is also designated as a Michigan State Historic Site. History Adrian's first Roman Catholic congregation was founded in 1840s and the first church constructed in 1852. That structure, however, was quickly outgrown, and in 1853 Father Peter Kindekins, then Vicar General of the Detroit Diocese, purchased land near the edge of town to construct a new church. By 1856, the site had a frame church, rectory, school, and convent. However, these buildings were completely destroyed by fire in 1863. Rebuilding was delayed over a debate on the site of the church. Eventually, the parish purchased this site, closer to the center of town, for a new parish complex. The parish hired renowned Detroit architect Gordon W. Lloyd to design the new church. Construction began in 1872. The current church building was consecrated in 1871 and is recognized as an important landmark of Romanesque Revival architecture. Lloyd engaged Ignace Schott, an ecclesiastic artist, to execute several murals of important saints for the decoration of the interior.Adrain Times & Expositor (Nov 29, 1871) The Catholic Church A new grade school was constructed in 1912, and a high school, Catholic Central High School, was constructed in 1953. The high school closed in 1968, and the grade school closed the following year. The church continues to serve the Catholic residents of Adrian. Description Saint Mary of Good Counsel Catholic Church is a red-orange brick Italian Romanesque structure with stone trim, a sandstone foundation, and a partly projecting, centrally positioned, square, pyramid-roof bell tower. It has wooden cornices. Three front entrances are topped with round-headed, recessed panels with wooden relief carving. On the interior, the church has a main vestibule and two smaller vestibules on the sides. Three sets of doors enter into the nave. In the auditorium, the interior is divided into nave and side aisles by four columns.

In traffic flow theory, the impact of freeway truck lane restrictions is an interesting topic. Intuitively, slow vehicles (e.g. trucks) will cause queues behind them, but how it relates to the kinematic wave theory was not revealed until Newell. Leclercq et al did a complete review of Newell's theory. In addition to the simulation models developed by Laval and Daganzo on the basis of numerical solution methods for Newell's theory to capture the impacts of slow vehicle, Laval also mathematically derived the analytical capacity formulas for bottlenecks caused by single-type of trucks for multi-lane freeway segments. Analytical Solution of the Single-type Truck Problem Truck Trajectory and Induced Traffic States Laval's solution could be summarized as follows: Assuming a one-lane freeway segment obeying the triangular fundamental diagram defined in the figure to the right with free-flow speed u, wave velocity w and jam density kj. Only one truck type is considered. In this scenario, the normalized capacity I of the freeway segment is given asÔºö I=\\\\frac{1}{rHC} where r is the time-mean proportion of trucks in the traffic stream,C = uwnkj/(w+u)is the capacity of the freeway lane without trucks and H is the expected value of headway between two consecutive trucks at the location where trucks begin to slow down It can be shown that, by approximating truck arrivals with Poisson processes, the probability density function (PDF) of H is the equation below, in which œÑ is defined as the clearance time of the queue induced by the slow-moving truck, Œª0=rC, Œª1=rU and œÑ=L(w+v)/wv. Note that Œª0 and Œª1 refer to the mean truck arrival rate at traffic state C or U, respectively. In particular, traffic state D, which corresponds to the downstream of the moving bottleneck, is assumed to be equal to the capacity of the unblocked lanes. f_H(h)=\\\\begin{cases}\\\\lambda_1 e^{-h\\\\lambda_1}, & h\\\\le\\\\tau \\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{\\\\tau(\\\\lambda_0-\\\\lambda_1)}\\\\lambda_0 e^{-h\\\\lambda_0}, & h>\\\\tau\\\\end{cases} According to Newell's moving bottleneck theory, we have: U=D+(\\\\frac{wvkj}{w+v}) Given all the above information, we can conclude that the average truck headway H is H=(1-e‚àíŒª1œÑ)/(Œª1)+(e‚àíŒª1œÑ)/(Œª0) And the above equation gives us all the necessary information to solve the normalized capacity I.

Salazar was dubbed the \\"Second floor Governor\\" due to his influence in the administration of Governor Tom Mabry, and was later considered a nationwide leader of parole reform in the 1970s. As a native of New Mexico, Salazar's career began as a precinct chairman and alternate delegate to the 1944 Democratic national convention. In 1946 he was considered the brain trust behind the election of Democrat Tom Mabry as Governor, and afterwards was appointed the Commissioner of the State Bureau of Revenue. According to Politics in New Mexico by Jack E. Holmes, \\"Salazar was a smart and vigorous administrator and politician, and Governor Mabry tended to turn over much of the dealings with the legislature to Salazar.\\" During this time, New Mexico political columnist Will Harrison dubbed him the \\"Second floor Governor\\" because of his power and influence at the Capitol. Outside the political arena, Salazar was a successful businessman, starting out in petroleum and uranium exploration, then eventually moving onto the insurance and real estate fields. His Albuquerque-based insurance company at one time was considered one of the top agencies in the state. Salazar served as Treasurer for the New Mexico Democratic Party, followed by an unsuccessful run for Lieutenant Governor in 1950. He was rumored to be a running mate with Governor John Burroughs in 1960, but in the end was not. A Democrat campaign cash-raiser, he was also a political advisor to U.S. Senators Dennis Chavez and Clinton Anderson. One of the biggest moments in Salazar's career came in 1962, when President John F. Kennedy appointed him as Special Envoy to represent the United States at the inauguration of Colombian President Guillermo Leon Valencia. Salazar, along with Secretary of the Interior Stuart Udall, US Ambassador to Colombia Fulton Freeman, and Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish, traveled to Colombia on Air Force One for the weeklong assignment. On July 9, 1971, New Mexico Governor Tom King appointed Salazar as Chairman of the newly created State Parole Board, where he led the nation in parole reform. His policy was to inform why prisoners were denied parole, as well as coaching them on how to improve their chances for parole. In his later years, Salazar remained active in politics and business, including serving as President of the Albuquerque Petroleum Association, and Director of the Petroleum Association of New Mexico. Salazar died on October 12, 1985, survived by his wife and four children.

The condition in birds of prey is called frounce.Kennedy, Murry J. \\"Trichomoniasis in Birds\\" Food Safety Division, Alberta Agriculture and Food. http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex4444 It is believed to be an ancient pathogen causing frounce-like symptoms in theropod dinosaurs. The same condition in pigeons is commonly called canker. Microscopically, the protozoa are small (5 to 20 ¬µm size), oval or spherical flagellates with four free flagella found on the anterior aspect of the parasite. They also have an axostyle found on the posterior end as well as an undulating membrane on one side. An important diagnostic feature is the lack of a free posterior flagellum. Life cycle T. gallinae is found in a motile trophozoite and nonmotile pseudocyst stage. T. gallinae is generally found in the oral-nasal cavity or anterior end of the digestive and respiratory tracts. The trichomonads multiply rapidly by simple division (binary fission), but do not form a resistant cyst. They therefore die quickly when passed out of the host. Transmission Transmission of the parasite from one bird to another occurs in one of three ways: # Infected parent feeding young # Contaminated drinking water # Infected bird is a prey meal for another bird (raptors most commonly) In 2005, Trichomonas gallinae was first recognized as a cause of disease in British finches, with greenfinch and chaffinch most affected, although a range of garden birds have been found to be susceptible to the parasite.Region. \\"BTO: Parasite Threatens Britain's Garden Birds.\\" Www.birdguides.com. 18 Aug. 2010. Web. 09 Dec. 2010. . An outbreak in 2017 in Northern France concerned two species, the greenfinch and the goldfinch. Studies have shown that up to a third of adult wood pigeons in Spain may carry the disease. In pigeons, transmission occurs when infected older birds (carriers) feed crop milk to newly hatched squabs. Adult birds, which do not show signs of disease, may carry the infection for a year or more and are a constant source of infection for their young. Turkeys and chickens can become infected through drinking water or food contaminated with feces, saliva or crop secretions. Because the trichomonads do not survive for long outside the bird, transmission must occur rapidly. Newly introduced, unquarantined birds, as well as wild birds may be an important source of introducing the infection to domestic birds and vice versa. The third method of transmission is more common to birds of prey. An infection may be established in a raptor that has fed on an infected prey bird. Pathology Avian trichomoniasis is principally a disease of young birds. T. gallinae varies greatly in its virulence. The severity of the disease depends on the susceptibility of the bird and on the pathogenic potential of the strain of the parasite. Adult birds that recover from the infection may still carry the parasite, but are resistant to reinfection. These birds do not show obvious signs of infection. Infection and mortality rates are not closely linked. The disease varies from a mild condition to a rapidly fatal one with death in 4‚Äì18 days post infection.Becker, Karen Shaw. DVM \\"Trichomonas Infections in Birds\\". In young birds, the early lesions appear as small white to yellowish areas in the mouth cavity, especially the soft palate. The lesions consist of inflammation and ulceration of the mucosal surface. The lesions increase in size and number and extend to the esophagus, crop and proventriculus. The lesions may develop into large, firm necrotic masses that may block the lumen. Occasionally, the disease may spread by penetrating the underlying tissues to involve the liver and other organs. The early lesions in the mouth are small, yellowish, circumscribed plaques on the mucosa. More velogenic (highly virulent) strains can cause caseated abscessation of the oropharynx. Eventually these space occupying lesions obstruct the esophagus and trachea resulting in emaciation and asphyxiation. Although lesions are usually seen in the mouth and oropharynx in raptors, it can also affect other mucus membranes. Jessup reports one owl having eye lesions from infection spreading into the nasolacrimal duct. Bony involvement can occur after soft tissue destruction. The organism does not survive posterior to the proventriculus, except in pigeons. Unlike other birds infected with T. gallinae, pigeons are susceptible to secondary organ invasion by virulent strains of the parasite. The visceral form of the disease involves the liver and gastrointestinal tract, causing organ dysfunction. When observed under a light microscope, samples can be seen rapidly moving in a circular jerky motion. They will appear to be small, translucent flagellates as individuals or in clusters. The undulating membrane may appear to exhibit wave-like motions when higher magnification is used. Clinical signs In acute cases, there may be little indication that the bird is infected, and death may occur quite suddenly. In other cases, infected birds may stop feeding, lose eight, look ruffled and dull, and be unable to stand or maintain their balance. Erosion of the papillae on the palatal flaps is a good sign of infection.Rupiper, David J. \\"Disease That Affect Race Performance of Homing Pigeons. Part II: Bacterial, Fungal and Parasitic Diseases.\\" Journal of Avian Medicine and Surgery Vol. 12, No. 3 (Sep., 1998), 138-148. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30133166 White, sticky plaques may form yellow, necrotic, cheese-like masses on the choana, tongue, or pharyngeal mucosa; there may also be moisture around the beak as well as a foul odor coming from the affected area. Birds may have difficulty swallowing and breathing due to the cheese like deposits in the mouth lining and down the esophagus and trachea. Diarrhea may also occur. Death may occur within three weeks of infection. Greenish fluid or cheesy material may accumulate in the mouth and crop, and this material may exude from the beak. A pendulous crop may develop in turkey poults and chickens. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be accomplished by clinical signs and direct exam or culture. Clinical signs of trichomoniasis include pronounced swallowing motions, excessive salivation and caseous-diphtheritic membranes of the mouth, crop and pharynx. Characteristic yellowish-white nodules in the oral cavity, esophagus and crop strongly suggest trichomoniasis. The infection is confirmed by finding the organism during microscopic examination of the greenish fluids, cheesy material or the lesion. Giemsa staining may aid in identifying the flagellate. T. gallinae can be diagnosed by microscopic examination of a saline wet mount of oral excretions. The presence of a pear-shaped parasite with flagella is diagnostic. In psittacine birds, particularly in the early stages of infection, organisms often are not present on wet mounts of oral excretions. Treatment The nitroimidazole antibiotics (usually metronidazole) are the treatments of choice. Treatment usually is successful after 1‚Äì2 days with early diagnosis. A new culture system called InPouch has practical advantages over the usual in vitro system. There is a risk of uncontrolled bleeding if oral plaques are removed by forceps, holding open the beak can also suffocate the birdhttp://www.pigeonrescue.sirtobyservices.com/commonailments-2/canker/. Prevention Trichomoniasis can be controlled in a commercial/domestic flock by culling or treating carrier birds. Food and water sources, as well as bird baths, should be cleaned regularly and protected from contamination by wild birds. Generally parasitic trichomonads cannot survive drying out. Cleaning feeders and bird baths and leaving them dry for a week may help in decreasing spread of disease although natural infections probably occur in the wider environment. Some related trichomonads do form cysts resistant to drying. Bird diseases such as trichomoniasis rarely, if ever, affect people; but it is sensible to take care when handling bird feeders by good hand washing after tending the feeders, or wearing suitable disposable gloves. From the sources used, there have been no reports of Trichomonas gallinae infecting humans.  Distribution  T. gallinae is found all over the world except in Antarctica, Greenland, and the northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia.

In London Wheatley worked for the London Stock Exchange for 18 years, including six years on its board. He rose to the position of deputy chief executive, and was closely involved with the failed merger with Deutsche Borse which resulted in the resignation of the LSE's chief executive Gavin Casey. Wheatley was also Chairman of the FTSE International and sat on the Listing Authority Advisory Committee of the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA). In 2003, Wheatley earned a salary of ¬£224,000 and a bonus of ¬£318,000. However, he was made redundant in February 2004; he was expected to receive a severance package of at least ¬£210,000. In Hong Kong In June 2004, Wheatley joined Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission, the market regulator which oversees the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, as its executive director for market supervision in June 2004. In September 2005, it was announced that he would replace Andrew Sheng as SFC chairman. Sheng had served in that position since 1998. Wheatley became Chief Executive Officer of the SFC on 23 June 2006. Wheatley is a member of the Financial Stability Board Standing Committee on Standards Implementation, as well as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Technical Committee. Currently, Wheatley chairs the IOSCO Technical Committee Task Force on Short Selling. Wheatley's tenure at the SFC was marked by aggressive anti-insider trading enforcement. These included the conviction of Du Jun, a former Morgan Stanley banker who was sentenced to seven years in prison. Among other things, the SFC won its first convictions and jail sentences for insider dealing and the first director disqualifications for listed company misconduct. He also made waves with the SFC case against Richard Li's attempt to buy out public shareholders in PCCW and take the company private again, describing the shareholder vote on the issue as marked by \\"malpractice and manipulation of voting\\"; the SFC won a case blocking the buyout on appeal. Wheatley's handling of the Lehman Brothers minibond scandal led to protests by investors who did not receive compensation for their losses. Following Lehman's collapse in September 2008, the SFC secured more than HK$6.5bn (US$835m) in investor compensation from 20 banks and brokers seeking to settle allegations of mis-selling of Lehman-related structured products. Nevertheless, Wheatley was quoted as stating, \\"I had people marching on the streets with banners with photos of me on them saying go home, death of justice, disgrace. I had noise all day outside my office where they would camp with klaxons and drums. I had a funeral effigy of me burnt outside the office.\\" Wheatley announced his resignation in December 2010, to be effective in mid-2011, roughly three months before the expiration of his contract. Wheatley's total compensation package in 2010 amounted to HK$9.09 million, including HK$7.2 million in basic salary, HK$1.35 million in discretionary pay, and HK$540,000 in retirement scheme contributions. He stated that he would return to Europe to take up a position with a regulatory agency there. Financial Conduct Authority The FSA on 2 February 2011 announced the appointment of Wheatley as the new managing director of its Consumer and Markets Business Unit. The appointment is effective from 1 September 2011, and at that time he will also join the FSA Board. In a separate announcement made by HM Treasury on the same day, Wheatley was also confirmed as the CEO designate of the Consumer Protection and Markets Authority (CPMA), one of the two successor regulatory bodies that will be formed from the future division of the FSA. The CPMA, which was later renamed Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is expected to be established by the end of 2012. About 3,000 people from the FSA, including virtually all the support functions, will go to the FCA, which will supervise markets, smaller brokers and advisers and will watch how financial institutions of all sizes treat their customers. It is expected to remain in Canary Wharf. The FCA will carry on two of the FSA‚Äôs biggest projects: the retail distribution review, which focuses on investment products and advice for retail customers, and the mortgage market review. The appointment of Martin Wheatley to be CEO of the FCA was not approved by the Treasury Select Committee. \\"The Government did not accept the case for a pre-appointment hearing with the Chief Executive, on the grounds of supposed market sensitivity.\\" https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmtreasy/721/721.pdf In July 2015, Wheatley resigned his post at the FCA following a vote of no confidence by George Osborne. Tracy McDermott took over from Wheatley at acting FCA chief in September 2015. Current FCA chief Andrew Bailey, was appointed chief executive on 26 January 2016.

From there it used to continue via Lamspringe to Bad Gandersheim on the Brunswick‚ÄìKreiensen railway. The surviving section of the railway, which lies wholly within the borough of Bad Salzdetfurth, serves today mainly as a tourist and commuter line. In this area the railway follows the river Lamme, which gave rise to the name of the line. History The line was opened between Gro√ü D√ºngen and Bad Salzdetfurth on 1 October 1900. Wesseln station was opened on 1 November 1901. The extension of the line between Bad Salzdetfurth and Bodenburg followed on 7 November 1901. On the same day, the state railways opened an extension of the Elze‚ÄìGronau branch line, in operation since 1 July 1900, to Bodenburg. The extension between Bodenburg and Lamspringe and to Bad Gandersheim was opened on 1 October 1902. Beginning in 1913, battery electric multiple units of the Wittfeld type were used on the line. On 24 September 1966, the line between Bodenburg and Gronau was closed to passenger traffic. The freight services were closed in two stages, between Sibbesse and Gronau on 17 August 1970, and between Sibbesse and Bodenburg on 25 September 1974. On 27 September 1975, the line was closed to passenger traffic between Bodenburg and Bad Gandersheim, and on 31 May 1980 between Gronau and Elze. On 1 January 1982, freight traffic ceased between Sehlem and Harbarnsen, on 31 May 1985 the section between Harbarnsen and Lamspringe was closed completely, on 30 May 1987 between Bodenburg and Harbarnsen. What little freight traffic had remained between Lamspringe and Bad Gandersheim (sugar beet, other agricultural goods, and wood) ceased 29 May 1994. Freight traffic on the remaining Gronau‚ÄìElze section was also stopped in 1994. Until the late 1980s, some industrial sidings north of Bad Gandersheim were served. The sections Sehlem‚ÄìHarbarnsen and Graste‚ÄìLamspringe were intersected by the high speed line Hannover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg. While the construction of Kassem√ºhle bridge west of Sehlem took the existence of the Lamme valley line into account, no overbridge was provided near Lamspringe. While the remaining section between Gro√ü D√ºngen and Bodenburg was threatened with closure in the 1980s and 1990s, too, it was spared at the instigation of the federal country and of the town of Salzdetfurth. It was renovated between 2001 and 2003, and a new halt was set up at the salt-water baths (Bad Salzdetfurth Solebad). Wesseln station, closed in 1991, was reopened as a halt in 2003. In order to save expenses on a level crossing, the old Bodenburg station was vacated, and a new halt was opened some east as the new terminus of the line. With a combined platform, if offers easy connections to and from the buses to Bockenem and Bad Gandersheim. In 2003, the services on the line were taken over by Eurobahn (Keolis), and NordWestBahn took over in December 2011.  Traffic today  Wesseln halt (2011) Bodenburg halt (2011) When Eurobahn took over the passenger service, bus services in the region were changed to offer better connections and less duplication of services. With an increase of publicly ordered rail passenger services to 160%, the number of passenger kilometres increased to 240% until 2006. Hourly passenger services between Hildesheim and Bodenburg are offered every day except on Sunday mornings. Most trains continue to and from Elze and Hameln via the Elze‚ÄìL√∂hne railway. Services on the Lamme valley line are often affected by track works on the Hildeshem‚ÄìGro√ü D√ºngen section. Nordwestbahn has hired LINT DMUs from Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen to provide the passenger services. In 2012, freight traffic between Hildesheim and Bad Salzdetfurth was operated with locomotives of series 261. The trains continue to and from Hannover-Linden marshalling yard via Lehrte and Sehnde. The Bad Gandersheim‚ÄìLamspringe section is nowadays an asphalted foot and cycle path, passing several sculptures and extensive natural hedges on its course through the Heberb√∂rde, an open, hilly stretch of countryside.

In the U.S, 17,000 people die in alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents each year. A small increase in the blood alcohol content increases the relative risk of a motor vehicle crash.  Effects of alcohol on cognitive processes  Alcohol has a very significant effect on the functions of the body which are vital to driving and being able to function. Alcohol is a depressant, which mainly affects the function of the brain. Alcohol first affects the most vital components of the brain and \\"when the brain cortex is released from its functions of integrating and control, processes related to judgment and behavior occur in a disorganized fashion and the proper operation of behavioral tasks becomes disrupted.\\" In all actuality alcohol weakens a variety of skills that are necessary to perform everyday tasks. One of the main effects of alcohol is severely impairing a person's ability to shift attention from one thing to another, \\"without significantly impairing sensory motor functions.\\" This indicates that people who are intoxicated are not able to properly shift their attention without affecting the senses. People that are intoxicated also have a much more narrow area of usable vision than people who are sober. The information the brain receives from the eyes \\"becomes disrupted if eyes must be turned to the side to detect stimuli, or if eyes must be moved quickly from one point to another.\\" Several testing mechanisms are used to gauge a person's ability to drive, which indicate levels of intoxication. One of these is referred to as a tracking task, testing hand‚Äìeye coordination, in which \\"the task is to keep an object on a prescribed path by controlling its position through turning a steering wheel. Impairment of performance is seen at BACs of as little as 0.7 mg/ml (0.066%).\\" Another form of tests is a choice reaction task, which deals more primarily with cognitive function. In this form of testing both hearing and vision are tested and drivers must give a \\"response according to rules that necessitate mental processing before giving the answer.\\" This is a useful gauge because in an actual driving situation drivers must divide their attention \\"between a tracking task and surveillance of the environment.\\" It has been found that even \\"very low BACs are sufficient to produce significant impairment of performance\\" in this area of thought process. Grand Rapids Dip Studies suggest that a BAC of 0.01‚Äì0.04% would slightly lower the risk, referred to as the Grand Rapids Effect or Grand Rapids Dip,Grand Rapids Effects Revisited: Accidents, Alcohol and Risk, H.-P. Kr√ºger, J. Kazenwadel and M. Vollrath, Center for Traffic Sciences, University of Wuerzburg, R√∂ntgenring 11, D-97070 W√ºrzburg, GermanyNTSB (US) report on Grand Rapids Effect based on a seminal research study by Borkenstein, et al.Robert F. Borkenstein papers, 1928-2002, Indiana U. The role of the drinking driver in traffic accidents (Researchgate link) (Robert Frank Borkenstein is well known for inventing the Drunkometer in 1938, and the breathalyzer in 1954.)Center for Studies of Law in Action, Robert F. Borkenstein Courses, Indiana U. Some literature has attributed the Grand Rapids Effect to erroneous data or asserted (without support) that it was possibly due to drivers exerting extra caution at low BAC levels or to \\"experience\\" in drinking. Other explanations are that this effect is at least in part the blocking effect of ethanol excitotoxicity and the effect of alcohol in essential tremor and other movement disorders, but this remains speculative.  Perceived recovery rate  A direct effect of alcohol on a person's brain is an overestimation of how quickly their body is recovering from the effects of alcohol. A study, discussed in the article \\"Why drunk drivers may get behind the wheel\\", was done with college students in which the students were tested with \\"a hidden maze learning task as their BAC [Blood Alcohol Content] both rose and fell over an 8-hour period.\\" The researchers found through the study that as the students became more drunk there was an increase in their mistakes \\"and the recovery of the underlying cognitive impairments that lead to these errors is slower, and more closely tied to the actual blood alcohol concentration, than the more rapid reduction in participants' subjective feeling of drunkenness.\\" The participants believed that they were recovering from the adverse effects of alcohol much more quickly than they actually were. This feeling of perceived recovery is a plausible explanation of why so many people feel that they are able to safely operate a motor vehicle when they are not yet fully recovered from the alcohol they have consumed, indicating that the recovery rates do not coincide. This thought process and brain function that is lost under the influence of alcohol is a very key element in regards to being able to drive safely, including \\"making judgments in terms of traveling through intersections or changing lanes when driving.\\" These essential driving skills are lost while a person is under the influence of alcohol.  Characteristics of drunk drivers   Personality traits  Although situations differ and each person is unique, some common traits have been identified among drunk drivers. In the study \\"personality traits and mental health of severe drunk drivers in Sweden\\", 162 Swedish DUI offenders of all ages were studied to find links in psychological factors and characteristics. There are a wide variety of characteristics common among DUI offenders which are discussed, including: \\"anxiety, depression, inhibition, low assertiveness, neuroticism and introversion\\". There is also a more specific personality type found, typically more antisocial, among repeat DUI offenders. It is not uncommon for them to actually be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and exhibit some of the following personality traits: \\"low social responsiveness, lack of self-control, hostility, poor decision-making lifestyle, low emotional adjustment, aggression, sensation seeking and impulsivity\\". It is also common for offenders to use drinking as a coping mechanism, not necessarily for social or enjoyment reasons, when they are antisocial in nature and have a father with a history of alcoholism. Offenders who begin drinking at an earlier age for thrills and \\"fun\\" are more likely to be antisocial later in their lives. The majority of the sample, 72%, came from what is considered more \\"normal\\" circumstances. This group was older when they began drinking, came from families without a history of alcoholism, were relatively well- behaved as children, were not as physically and emotionally affected by alcohol when compared with the rest of the study, and had the less emotional complications, such as anxiety and depression. The smaller portion of the sample, 28%, comes from what is generally considered less than desirable circumstances, or \\"not normal\\". They tended to start drinking heavily earlier in life and \\"exhibited more premorbid risk factors, had a more severe substance abuse and psychosocial impairment.\\" Various characteristics associated with drunk drivers were found more often in one gender than another. Females were more likely to be affected by both mental and physical health problems, have family and social problems, have a greater drug use, and were frequently unemployed. However, the females tended to have less legal issues than the typical male offender. Some specific issues females dealt with were that \\"almost half of the female alcoholics had previously attempted to commit suicide, and almost one-third had suffered from anxiety disorder.\\" In contrast with females, males were more likely to have in-depth problems and more involved complications, such as \\"a more complex problem profile, i.e. more legal, psychological, and work-related problems when compared with female alcoholics.\\" In general the sample, when paralleled with control groups, was tested to be much more impulsive in general. Another commonality among the whole group was that the DUI offenders were more underprivileged when compared with the general population of drivers. A correlation has been found between lack of conscientiousness and accidents, meaning that \\"low conscientiousness drivers were more often involved in driving accidents than other drivers.\\" When tested the drivers scored very high in the areas of \\"depression, vulnerability (to stress), gregariousness, modesty, tender mindedness\\", but significantly lower in the areas of \\"ideas (intellectual curiosity), competence, achievement striving and self-discipline.\\" The sample also tested considerably higher than the norm in \\"somatization, obsessions-compulsions, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoia, psychoticism\\", especially in the area of depression. Through this testing a previously overlooked character trait of DUI offenders was uncovered by the \\"low scores on the openness to experience domain.\\" This area \\"includes intellectual curiosity, receptivity to the inner world of fantasy and imagination, appreciation of art and beauty, openness to inner emotions, values, and active experiences.\\" In all these various factors, there is only one which indicates relapses for driving under the influence: depression.  Cognitive processes  Not only can personality traits of DUI offenders be dissimilar from the rest of the population, but so can their thought processes, or cognitive processes. They are unique in that \\"they often drink despite the severity of legal and financial sanctions imposed on them by society.\\" In addition to these societal restraints, DUI offenders ignore their own personal experience, including both social and physical consequences. The study \\"Cognitive Predictors of Alcohol Involvement and Alcohol consumption- Related Consequences in a Sample of Drunk-Driving Offenders\\" was performed in Albuquerque, New Mexico on the cognitive, or mental, factors of DUI offenders. Characteristics such as gender, marital status, and age of these DWI offenders were similar to those in other populations. Approximately 25% of female and 21% of male offenders had received \\"a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse\\" and 62% of females and 70% of males \\"received a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.\\" All of the offenders had at least one DWI and males were more likely to have multiple citations. In terms of drinking patterns approximately 25% stated that \\"they had drunk alcohol with in the past day, while an additional 32% indicated they had drunk within the past week.\\" In regards to domestic drinking, \\"25% of the sample drank at least once per week in their own homes.\\" Different items were tested to see if they played a role in the decision to drink alcohol, which includes socializing, the expectation that drinking is enjoyable, financial resources to purchase alcohol, and liberation from stress at the work place. The study also focused on two main areas, \\"intrapersonal cues\\", or internal cues, that are reactions \\"to internal psychological or physical events\\" and \\"interpersonal cues\\" that result from \\"social influences in drinking situations.\\" The two largest factors between tested areas were damaging alcohol use and its correlation to \\"drinking urges/triggers.\\" Once again different behaviors are characteristic of male and female. Males are \\"more likely to abuse alcohol, be arrested for DWI offenses, and report more adverse alcohol-related consequences.\\" However, effects of alcohol on females vary because the female metabolism processes alcohol significantly when compared to males, which increases their chances for intoxication. The largest indicator for drinking was situational cues which comprised \\"indicators tapping psychological (e.g. letting oneself down, having an argument with a friend, and getting angry at something), social (e.g. relaxing and having a good time), and somatic cues (e.g. how good it tasted, passing by a liquor store, and heightened sexual enjoyment).\\" It may be that internal forces are more likely to drive DWI offenders to drink than external, which is indicated by the fact that the brain and body play a greater role than social influences. This possibility seems particularly likely in repeat DWI offenders, as repeat offences (unlike first-time offences) are not positively correlated with the availability of alcohol. Another cognitive factor may be that of using alcohol to cope with problems. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the DWI offenders do not use proper coping mechanisms and thus turn to alcohol for the answer. Examples of such issues \\"include fights, arguments, and problems with people at work, all of which imply a need for adaptive coping strategies to help the high-risk drinker to offset pressures or demands.\\" DWI offenders would typically prefer to turn to alcohol than more healthy coping mechanisms and alcohol can cause more anger which can result in a vicious circle of drinking more alcohol to deal with alcohol-related issues. This is a not the way professionals tell people how to best deal with the struggles of everyday life and calls for \\"the need to develop internal control and self-regulatory mechanisms that attenuate stress, mollify the influence of relapse-based cues, and dampen urges to drink as part of therapeutic interventions.\\"  Implied consent laws  There are laws in place to protect citizens from drunk drivers, called implied consent laws. Drivers of any motor vehicle automatically consent to these laws, which include the associated testing, when they begin driving. In most jurisdictions (with the notable exception of a few, such as Brazil), refusing consent is a different crime than a DWI itself and has its own set of consequences. There have been cases where drivers were \\"acquitted of the DWI offense and convicted of the refusal (they are separate offenses), often with significant consequences (usually license suspension)\\". A driver must give their full consent to comply with testing because \\"anything short of an unqualified, unequivocal assent to take the Breathalyzer test constitutes a refusal.\\" It has also been ruled that defendants are not allowed to request testing after they have already refused in order to aid officers' jobs \\"to remove intoxicated drivers from the roadways\\" and ensure that all results are accurate. United States Implied consent laws are found in all 50 U.S. states and require drivers to submit to chemical testing, called evidentary blood alcohol tests, after arrest. These laws have thus far been shown to be in compliance with the Constitution and are legal. Implied consent laws typically result in civil law consequences (but applying criminal penalties), such as a driver's license suspension. In order to invoke implied consent, the police must establish probable cause. Field Sobriety Tests (FSTs or SFSTs), Preliminary Breath Tests (PBTs) are often used to obtain such probable cause evidence, necessary for arrest or invoking implied consent. Some states have passed laws that impose criminal penalties based upon principles of implied consent. However, in 2016, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that Kansans who refuse to submit to either a breath or blood test in DUI investigations cannot be criminally prosecuted for that refusal. The court found unconstitutional a state law making it a crime to refuse such a test when no court-ordered warrant exists. In its 6-1 ruling, the court found that the tests were in essence searches and the law punishes people for exercising their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Birchfield v. North Dakota Subsequently, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Birchfield v. North Dakota, held that a breath test, but not a blood test, may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving. The Court stated, \\"Because breath tests are significantly less intrusive than blood tests and in most cases amply serve law enforcement interests, a breath test, but not a blood test, may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving.\\" The Court held that no warrant is needed for an evidentiary breath testing, but that a warrant is required for criminal prosecution for a blood test refusal. Birchfield leaves open the possibility of pseudo-criminal \\"civil\\" penalties for blood test refusals (under implied consent, without a warrant); however most law enforcement agencies are responding to Birchfield by requesting evidential breath tests, due to the criminal status of evidential breath test refusals. Non-evidential testing In the US, implied consent laws generally do not apply to Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) testing (small handheld devices, as opposed to evidential breath test devices). For a handheld field breath tester to be used as evidential breath testing, the device must be properly certified and calibrated, evidential procedures must be followed, and it may be necessary to administer an \\"implied consent\\" warning to the suspect prior to testing. For some violations, such as refusals by commercial drivers or by drivers under 21 years of age, some US jurisdictions may impose implied consent consequences for a PBT refusal. For example, the state of Michigan has a roadside PBT lawMichigan Vehicle Code ¬ß 257.625a that requires motorist a preliminary breath test;Michigan State Police **Breath Test Program and Training Information** however, for non- commercial drivers Michigan's penalties are limited to a \\"civil infraction\\" penalty, with no violation \\"points\\", but is not considered to be a refusal under the general implied consent law. Participation in \\"field sobriety tests\\" (FSTs or SFSTs) is voluntary in the US.DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test, NOLO Press (\\"As a general rule (and unlike chemical testing), there is no legal penalty for refusing to take these tests although the arresting officer can typically testify as to your refusal in court.\\")Findlaw Can I Refuse to Take Field Sobriety Tests? Solutions The introduction of breath testing devices by the police in the 1970s was a very efficient measure, but alcohol remain involved in one quarter of all fatal crashes in Europe Reducing alcohol usage According to experience, various ways help to reduce alcohol usage: * increasing price of alcohol. * restricting the opening hours for buying and consuming alcohol * restricting the places for buying and consuming alcohol, such as banning the sale of alcohol in petrol stations and transport cafes * minimum drinking age, 21 years old in the United States. Separating drinking from driving A tool to separate drinking from driving is Ignition interlock device.http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/sites/roadsafety/files/pdf/ersosynthesis2018-alcohol.pdf This tool is used in rehabilitation programmes and for school buses. Depending upon various studies Ignition interlock device can reduce offense, in a range 35%-90%, including 60% for a Swedish study, 67% for the CDCP, and 64% for the mean of several studies. Designated driver programmes The Designated driver programmes help to separate driving from drinking in social places such as restaurants, discos, pubs, bars. In such a program, the group choose his drivers before going to a place where they will consume alcohol. Those drivers have to abstain from alcohol. Police enforcement Enforcing the legal limit for alcohol consumption is the usual method to reduce drunk driving. * Reduction of legal limit from 0.8 g/L to 0.5 g/L reduced fatals crashed by 2% in some European countries; while similar kind of results were obtained in the United States * Lower rate of BAC (0,1 g/L in Austria and zero limit in Australia and the United States) have helped to reduce fatalities among young drivers * fines appear to have little effect on reducing alcohol-impaired driving * driving licence measures with a duration of 3 months to 12 months. * imprisonment is the least effective remedy Education Education programmes include: * Education programmes in schools and in basic driver training * Driver improvement courses on alcohol (rehabilitation courses) * Public campaigns * Promotion of safety culture Prevalence in Europe About 25% of all road fatalities in Europe are alcohol-related, while very few Europeans drive under the influence of alcohol. According to estimations, 3.85% of drivers in European Union drive with a BAC of 0.2 g/l and 1.65% with a BAC of 0.5 g/l and higher. For alcohol in combination with drugs and medicines, rates are respectively 0.35% and 0.16%  See also  * Driving under the influence  References   Further reading  * Category:Driving under the influence Category:Crimes ","title":"Drunk drivers"},{"id":"29981152","text":"Jiminy Cricket, a character in the 1940 Walt Disney animation Pinocchio, is a typical anthropomorphized insect in film. Arthropods, mainly insects and arachnids, are used in film either to create fear and disgust in horror and thriller movies, or they are anthropomorphized and used as sympathetic characters in animated children's movies. There are over 1,000,000 species of arthropods, including such familiar animals as ants, spiders, shrimps, crabs and butterflies. Early 20th century films had difficulty featuring small insects due to technical difficulties in film-stock exposure and the quality of lenses available. Horror movies involving arthropods include the pioneering 1954 Them!, featuring giant ants mutated by radiation, and the 1957 The Deadly Mantis. Films based on oversized arthropods are sometimes described as big bug movies. Arthropods used in films may be animated, sculpted, or otherwise synthesized; however, in many cases these films use actual creatures. As these creatures are not easily tamed or directed, a specialist known as a \\"Bug Wrangler\\" may be hired to control and direct these creatures. Some bug wranglers have become famous as a result of their expertise, such as Norman Gary, a champion bee-wrangler who is also a college professor, and Steven R. Kutcher, who wrangles a multitude of different types of bugs and who is the subject of over 100 print articles. Horror Film poster for The Deadly Mantis, 1957, directed by Nathan H. Juran. Artwork by Reynold Brown Arthropods are effective tools to instill horror, because fear of arthropods may be conditioned into people's minds. Indeed, Jamie Whitten quoted in his book That We May Live, (talking about insects): > The enemy is already here-in the skies, in the fields, and waterways. It is > dug into every square foot of our earth; it has invaded homes, schoolhouses, > public buildings; it has poisoned food and water; it brings sickness and > death by germ warfare to countless millions of people every year.... The > enemy within-these walking, crawling, jumping, flying pests-destroy more > crops than drought and floods. They destroy more buildings than fire. They > are responsible for many of the most dreaded diseases of man and his > domestic animals.... Some of them eat or attack everything man owns or > produces-including man himself.Belveal, Dee, Today's Health, Feb. 1996. > Quoted in Whitten, Jamie L. That We May Live,\\" D. Van Norstrand Company > 1996. Print. Thus, insects and other arthropods are dangerous to humans in both obvious and less obvious ways. Undoubtedly, arthropods are dangerous for their potential to carry disease. Somewhat less apparently, arthropods cause damage to buildings, crops, and animals. Since arthropods can be harmful in so many ways, using insects and other arthropods to frighten people in movies was a logical step. Aside from a natural fear or aversion to arthropods, reasons for using such creatures in movies could be metaphorical. Many of the most famous \\"Big Bug Movies\\" were made in the 1950s in the aftermath of World War II, when the world was introduced to the cataclysmic destruction inflicted by nuclear bombs. The bomb was unapproachable, remote, and terrifying; spiders and ants mutated by nuclear radiation to become huge were terrifying, but thanks to the competent government officials, soldiers, policemen, and detectives, the bugs were stopped and safety was restored. Nuclear terror was conquered without expressly facing a nuclear bomb. In this way, big bug movies could be cathartic and liberating to the general public. Big bug films may symbolize sexual desire. Margaret Tarrat says in her article \\"Monsters of the id\\" that \\"[Big bug movies] arrive at social comment through a dramatization of the individual's anxiety about his or her own repressed sexual desires, which are incompatible with the morals of civilized life.\\"Margaret Tarratt, \\"Monsters from the Id\\" (1970), in Film Genre Reader, ed. Barry Keith Grant (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986), 259. By this theory, gigantic swarming insects could represent the huge, torrential‚Äîbut repressed due to the demands of society‚Äîsexual desires possessed by the creator and viewer of the Big Bug movie. On gigantic arthropods, Charles Q. Choi stated that, if the atmosphere had a higher percentage of oxygen, arthropods would be able to grow quite a bit larger before their trachea became too large and could not grow any more. In fact, in the early years of the earth, when the atmosphere was more oxygen- rich, dragonflies the size of crows were not an uncommon sight.Choi, Charles Q., LiveScience, 11 Oct. 2006, \\"Giant Insects\\", 8 Dec. 2010. Animation Winsor McCay, one of the founders of animation, made the first animated film about insects in 1912, titled How a Mosquito Operates. In the early 20th century, it was technically easier to include insects in animated films, which are drawn, over live-action films which would require more advanced techniques to film insects, due to their small size, necessitating better lenses and exposure techniques than those available at the time. One filmmaker, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Starewicz, found that when filming live stag beetles, they tended to stop moving under the hot lights. To solve this problem, he killed his film subjects and attached wires to their bodies in order to puppeteer them. His films were successful, and he eventually abandoned real insects in favor of puppets of his own creation. One of the best-known animated insects is Jiminy Cricket, whose initial design was more realistic and insect-like, but eventually evolved into an elf-like creature. Computer-animated films have proven particularly suited for depicting insects, beginning with Pixar's 1984 short film The Adventures of Andr√© and Wally B. Early computer animation was successful at depicting rod-like appendages and shiny metallic surfaces, lending itself to the depiction of insects. By 1996, films like Joe‚Äôs Apartment achieved rendering hundreds of photorealistic insects. Other animated films continued to depict more anthropomorphized characters, such as A Bug's Life and Antz, both of which came out in 1998, and the 2007 Bee Movie. One reason insects are used successfully in such animations could be that an insect or other arthropod's small size makes it seem heroic and sympathetic when faced against the big, big world. Another reason is counterpoint to the reason for using arthropods in horror films: whereas horror movies play upon the instinctive negative reaction humans have towards insects and arachnids, these animation films make something that is different and strange seem real, approachable, and sympathetic, thus making it comforting.Leskosky, R.J. and M.R. Berenbaum. \\"Insects in Animated Films: Not All 'Bugs' are Bunnies.\\" Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America. 1988. 34: pp.55-63.

History Edgard Frankignoul applied for the production patent for the Franki pile in July 1909. He then co-founded the geotechnical company Frankipile (Soci√©t√© des Pieux Arm√©s Frankignoul) with Li√®ge aristocrat Edmond Baar with the goal of commercializing the Franki piling system. By 1929, the technique had been implemented by 34 international subsidiaries and license holders. The Franki pile process has undergone several reformations since it was conceived. The dry concrete plug was not introduced to the design until 1926. Before this innovation, the casing had to be top-driven and equipped with a lost bottom plate. The Franki pile with vibrated shaft and hydraulic vibrating hammer were manufactured starting from 1960 and 1971 respectively. Applications Franki piles can be used as high-capacity deep foundation elements without the necessity of excavation or dewatering. They are useful in conditions where a sufficient bearing soil can only be reached deeper in the ground,FRANKIPILE FRANKI Grundbau, Retrieved December 7, 2010 and are best suited to granular soil where bearing is primarily achieved from the densification of the soil around the base. They are not recommended for use in cohesive soils where compaction of the base is not possible. The Franki piling system is the quietest of the driven cast-in-place systems, and so is used in conditions where high noise levels could cause environmental problems.

The book puts into context Florida's urban development theories, with the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, to describe the future of cities. The Great Reset looks at the economic incentives which have driven American society in the past. Florida compares the recession to two similar periods in recent history, the 1870s and the 1930s. The book is divided into three parts, how past resets have shaped development, how different cities are positioned, and what trends will emerge from the reset. Part 1: Past as Prologue Florida claims the 1870s reset best mirrors the American economic situation in the 2010s. The 1870s changed the organization of production, creating the American system of manufacturing, which paved the way for unprecedented growth and innovation. During the first great reset there was a mass migration of people from the countryside to urban areas, and significant development of new transportation structures. The second great reset laid our current foundation. Florida cites historian Alexander Field, calling the Great Depression of the 1930s, the \\"most technologically progressive\\" time of the 20th century.Field, Alexander J. ‚ÄúThe Most Technologically Progressive Decade of the Century.‚Äù American Economic Review 93 (September 2003): 1399‚Äì1413. The second reset, through a combination of public policy, economic incentives, and a shift in social preferences started the move towards suburbs. Consumption habits were significantly altered as people spent less on basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing and began to spend more on appliances and other household items. The second reset created the \\"ownership society\\"; our new economic model is more dynamic and will require increased flexibility. There is a pattern, common to both of the previous resets, which Florida expects to recur over the next few decades. Initially, old institutions break down and businesses and consumers cut back their spending. This transitions into the emergence of new innovations, which are developed into new technologies and forged together into bigger and better systems. This coincides with public and private investments in: energy, transportation, and communication infrastructure, to give the broad skeleton of a new economic landscape. These create a new spatial fix that is more closely in sync with the improved productive capacities of the underlying economy. Part 2: Redrawing the Economic Way This section examines the potential impact that the recession and the reset will have on different types of cities. The higher a city's exposure to the creative economy, the better it will do in the great reset. Cities like London and New York City, despite their exposure to the financial industry, have the diversity and global reach to prosper. Cities that are major or regional hubs will also thrive as they become the beneficiary of increased consolidation. Smaller cities heavy on particular aspects of the economy, for example those overly exposed to manufacturing or the FIRE economy (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) will need to adjust their economic model and demographics. Government and college towns will prosper because of their ability to attract and maintain members of the creative class. Part 3: A New Way of Life Two types of jobs are growing in size and salary: creative class jobs and routine service jobs. The geographic sorting of people based on ability and educational attainment is the highest ever. Cities with cosmopolitan bases such as Austin, Boston, and San Francisco are seeing large increases in population, with a heavy concentration of creative people. Former industrial cities such as Buffalo or Akron are falling behind by both measures. Consumption habits are changing drastically, particularly with the younger generation. Young people tend to have a negative perception of owning a car, and are less likely to purchase luxury goods. They are more likely to spend on experiences or social activities. Florida sees enormous potential for the mega region, a combination of major cities located close together. He lists several notable ones around the world including the BosWash corridor which encompasses Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington D.C., and ChiPitts which contains the major cities in the American Midwest. He argues that these mega regions are becoming spikier and are creating a disproportionate amount of productivity and wealth for the global economy. As the cities in these regions become more connected their dominance will increase. The suburb versus city debate will not produce a winner; the solution is a complex mixture of the two. They will both become part of mega regions, with many of the suburbs emerging into mix use communities. He cites the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington DC as early examples of this. Big cities with a diverse demographic and creative base have proven that they are the most capable of attracting young people and new talented graduates. Cities like New York City, Chicago and San Francisco are where the most graduates flock each year. Florida argues that cities benefit from economies of scale and produce the most efficient systems for the economy, environment, and transportation. He sees this scale as an advantage as cities become smarter and more versatile.  Reaction  Florida has drawn criticism for taking an overly academic and elitist point of view. Critics argue that he overstates the size and potential impact of the creative class, neglecting many economic and social realities. They also argue that he ignores many factors that people consider when they are choosing a place to live.Kay, Jonathan. \\"The Problem with Richard Florida.\\" National Post.McDowell, Adam. \\"Critics lambaste urban guru Richard Florida.\\" National Post 06 January 2010.

Unlike the professional Seattle Symphony Orchestra, the personnel of the Seattle Civic Symphony Orchestra received no compensation.Seattle Musicians Association, Minutes, Meeting of the Board of Directors, 5 April 1921. Starting in the fall of 1921, rehearsals were held on Thursday evenings in the assembly room on the ninth floor of the Arctic Building in space made available by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce.\\"To Give Five Concerts,\\" Seattle Times, 4 November 1921, p. 2. After three successful seasons, Mary Davenport Engberg announced her intention to transform the Seattle Civic Symphony Orchestra into a union orchestra in which the players were compensated.Seattle Musicians Association, Minutes, Meeting of the Board of Directors, 21 August 1923. Compensation was apparently $8.00 per session.Seattle Musicians Association, Minutes, Meeting of the Board of Directors, 13 May 1924. The orchestra thereafter boasted \\"21 musicians who played formerly in the Seattle Symphony Orchestra during its existence\\" out of a total of 62.Seattle Civic Symphony Orchestra, Program, 16 March 1924. Despite such a large representation of players, this statement implies that the Seattle Symphony Orchestra was still defunct. The Seattle Civic Symphony Orchestra was nevertheless able to attract violinist Efrem Zimbalist, Sr. to solo with the orchestra for its concert on November 25, 1923, and pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch for its concert on May 4, 1924, both at the Metropolitan Theater.Seattle Civic Symphony Orchestra, Program, 25 November 1923, 4 May 1924. Despite these artistic successes, the May 4, 1924 concert marked the final appearance of the Seattle Civic Symphony Orchestra, apparently due to financial problems.Seattle Musicians Association, Minutes, Meeting of the Board of Directors, 1 April 1924, 23 April 1924, 6 May 1924. The Seattle Symphony Orchestra was revived in 1926 under the direction of Karl Krueger after a five-year hiatus.\\"The Musician and the Playgoer,\\" Town Crier, 13 November 1926, p. 11. Despite subsequent embellishments that Mary Davenport Engberg was the Seattle Symphony Orchestra's first female conductor, she in fact was never the director of the Seattle Symphony Orchestra.

This nematode has been shown to interfere with the parasitic activity of the coffee berry borer by increasing the mortality of its progeny.Jaramillo J, Borgemeister C, Baker P (2006) Coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Curculionidae): searching for sustainable control strategies. Bulletin of Entomological Research 96:223-233 M. hypothenemi life cycle  Geographical distribution  M. hypothenemi has only been identified in coffee plantations in Chiapas, Mexico and Honduras.Poinar, G., Vega, F., Castillo, A., and Infante, F. (2004). METAPARASITYLENCHUS HYPOTHENEMI N. SP. (NEMATODA: ALLANTONEMATIDAE), A PARASITE OF THE COFFEE BERRY BORER, HYPOTHENEMUS HAMPEI (CURCULIONIDAE: SCOLYTINAE). J. Parasitol. 90: 1106-1110 Its only known host is the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei), which is originally native to Angola, Africa. This raises the question of whether M. hypothenemi was brought over to the New World with the coffee berry borer or if it is native to Mexico and Central America and only found the coffee berry borer as a host when it was brought to the New World.  Biocontrol agent  Coffea canephora In order to alleviate the economic burden the coffee berry borer has on the coffee cash crop, parasitoids of the borer have been used. Most notably Bethylid parasitoids, Eulophyd parasitoids (Eulophidae), and Braconid parasitoids (Braconidae) have been introduced in an attempt to reduce the beetle‚Äôs efficacy in destroying coffee plants. However, while these parasitoids improve the situation, they are not successful in eliminating the economic damage. Additionally, evidence suggests that the beetle is capable of developing resistance against the common pesticide endosulfan.Brun, L., Marcillaud, C., Gaudichon, V. and Suckling, D. (1989). Endosulfan Resistance in Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) in New Caledonia. Journal of Economic Entomology, 82: 1311‚Äì1316 Therefore, use of Metaparasitylenchus hypothenemi to induce disease in borer populations has been considered. It is prudent to explore such a course of action because use of the Metaparasitylenchus hypothenemi nematodes provides a method with which to sterilize female borers. Depending on how many parasitic females are present, sterilization can range from being partially derailed to being completely shut down. Though sterilization fails to ward off a current generation of infection, by arresting the reproductive capabilities of these beetles the worm will ultimately curtail beetle infestation. Loss of reproductive capabilities through Metaparasitylenchus hypothenemi parasitization is tied to the lifecycle of the nematode. Mature parasitic females are carried through the beetle‚Äôs lifecycle. During this time, eggs hatch within the female and proceed through to stage J3 (see Lifecycle) and at this point are ready to exit the host beetle. Exit occurs through the GI tract or the reproductive tract and expulsion involves arrest of the beetle‚Äôs own reproductive capabilities.

It is an open, spreading shrub with large heads of sharply scented yellow flowers and is only known from areas in and near to the Cooloomia Nature Reserve, near the Murchison River. Description Verticordia cooloomia is an openly branched shrub with a single stem at the base, growing to a height of up to and a width of up to . The leaves near the base of the plant are linear in shape, approximately circular in cross section and long, those further up the stem are lance-shaped, dished and long and those near the flowers are almost circular with a pointed end and are in diameter. The flowers are sharply scented and arranged in corymb-like groups on erect stalks long. The floral cup is broadly top-shaped, long, glabrous and slightly warty. The sepals are a golden-yellow colour, long, with 11 to 13 lobes which have a short fringe of hairs. The petals are also golden-yellow, , almost circular in shape with an irregularly toothed margin. The style is long, straight and glabrous. Flowering time is from October to November. The species is somewhat similar to Verticordia nitens, V. aurea and V. patens but is easily distinguished from them by the larger size of its leaves and flowers. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia cooloomia was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 and the description was published in Nuytsia from specimens collected at Murchison House Station by George and others in 1986. The species had previously been discovered by Stephen Hopper in 1979 in the Cooloomia Nature Reserve. The specific epithet (cooloomia) is from the name of the reserve where the species was discovered. In the same paper, George placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma and as the only species in section Cooloomia. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows on sand ridges in heath and shrubland in and near the lower reaches of the Murchison River in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. It forms a part of the Shark Bay tree heath. Conservation Verticordia cooloomia is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture Verticordia cooloomia is variously described as \\"very ornamental\\" and \\"a spectacular shrub, especially when plant in association with large rocks\\". It is usually propagated from cuttings and has been grown in a wide variety of soil types and climatic conditions although full sun is required for good flowering. The species is intolerant of phosphorus-containing fertiliser but is drought tolerant and responds well to pruning after damage by severe frosts.

It is designed as a converging point of various forms of public transportation, such as local and long distance buses, metro rail and inland water transport. It is planned over an area of in Vyttila, making it one of the largest bus termini in India. The foundation stone for Mobility Hub in Vytilla was laid by the Chief Minister of Kerala V. S. Achuthanandan on 7 June 2010. Construction of the first phase, consisting of the terminal for long distance buses and the basic amenities, started in December 2010; the first phase was opened on 26 February 2011. When fully implemented, it will have facilities to integrate all modes of public transportation, as well as for shopping, entertainment and hospitality. History A panoramic view of Vyttila Mobility Hub A fast- growing city like Kochi requires a comprehensive plan to meet the demands and requirements in Traffic and Transport. Travelling in the city is a Herculean task due to congested roads and traffic jams. The large number of long- distance (mofussil) buses contributes to the present chaos. The number of vehicles in Ernakulam District has increased an average annual growth rate of 13 percent. The Comprehensive Study for Transport System for Greater Kochi Area by Rites Ltd, 2001, NATPAC Traffic Report, 2006, and City Development Plan by Kochi Corporation, 2007, had pointed towards the shifting and integrating of main mofussil bus stands in the city and converting it to a mobility hub at a strategic location near Kochi Bypass. With the support of these studies, the Confederation of Indian Industry(CII)-Kerala and the Centre for Public Policy Research are coming up with a new plan to set up a mobility hub in Vyttila and will transform it into the Gateway of Kerala. The hub project aims to reduce traffic congestion due to the expected increase in traffic flow at Kochi in the coming years with the commissioning of the International Container Transshipment Terminal and other allied projects connected with it. Service The site for the mobility hub in Vyttila is well-connected with all routes. It serves as a meeting point for all intercity and intra-city roads. The site is connected to Edappally, Kundannoor, Palarivattom, Vytilla junction through Kochi Bypass and exit road links with Ettumanoor road connecting it with Tripunithura, Pettah, Ambalamugal etc., providing free transition in various directions of the city. It is connected to Kochi Metro and Kochi Water Metro. Kochi Metro Vyttila Mobility Hub is connected to Vyttila Metro Station of Kochi Metro Line 1(Aluva to Thykoodam). It is a 160 metres walk to the metro station by Vyttila Mobility Hub Road. Train Towards Thykoodam 1st train-6:41 a.m. Last train-10:39 p.m. Train Towards Aluva 1st train-6:02 a.m. Last train-10:01 p.m. Kochi Water Metro Vyttila Mobility Hub is connected to Kochi Water Metro.Ferry terminal is on the east side of the mobility hub.It is located by Kaniyampuzha river.It is a 76 metres walk to the ferry terminal by Vyttila Boat Jetty Walkway. Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has also launched boat services between Vyttila and Kakkanad as \\"City Water Bus\\" recently. The service is expected to be extended to more areas like Thevara soon. Future The project is estimated to cost around 121 crore and will be implemented in two phases. The project will have facilities for parking 175 buses, 2,000 to 6,000 cars, and 2,000 to 10,000 two-wheelers. Three boat jettys and green zone would also be set up on the eastern side of the hub. An air-conditioned tube too has been planned, to connect the terminal to the western side of Vytilla junction.Passengers can easily get down at the bus terminal at the hub and use the Mass Transit System like the inter-city bus, auto, ferry, taxi or metro train to enter the city. It has the potential to host a worldclass mega shopping mall, food courts, cultural centre and health club, a hotel and a 50m swimming pool in a total built-up area of 150,000 sq m. Construction  KITCO, the consultants, is entrusted with total implementation of the project. (The feasibility study of the project too was conducted by KITCO). The tenders for the construction of first phase was granted to Nagarjuna constructions from among seven companies which submitted tenders. The selection was on account of quoting the lowest amount for the execution of the project and the first phase of the project was completed in February 2011.

The common and upland bully are freshwater fish of New Zealand that C. parvum uses as its definitive host. C. parvum is a hermaphroditic freshwater trematode that can omit its definitive host and produce eggs by selfing or progenesis inside its amphipod second intermediate host (Lagrue et al., 2001)  Life cycle  The life cycle of C. parvum begins when eggs are released into the water and hatch into free-swimming miracidia. The miracidia then penetrate the first intermediate host, Potamopyrgus antipodarum (the New Zealand mud snail), where they multiply and develop into sporocysts. Next, free-living cercariae are asexually produced from the sporocysts and shed by the snails. These shed cercarial larvae then penetrate the hemocoel of the second intermediate host, Paracalliope fluviatilis (amphipod) and encyst as metacercariae (Kelly, 2009). At this stage, the metacercariae have two options: 1) to wait for the bully (the definitive host) to eat the amphipod or 2) to undergo selfing (progenesis). C. parvum will take up residence in the bully intestine where it will mature and reproduce eggs sexually (if it finds a partner) or via self-fertilization (since trematodes are hermaphroditic). However, if the amphipod is not eaten, the C. parvum metacercariae mature within the amphipod where they produce viable eggs within the cyst in the hemocoel (body cavity) (Lefebvre, 2005). Eggs produced in this fashion remain enclosed in the cyst until the amphipod dies. After amphipod death, the eggs are released into the water where they hatch into miracidia and are infective to the snail (Kelly, 2009). The process of maturing within the intermediate host and eliminating the need for the definitive host is known as progenesis (Lagrue, 2001)  Life cycle choice  The progenetic life cycle choice is dependent upon opportunities for transmission and the risk of dead-end transmission. The worm can use cues from the amphipod caused by the presence of the predatory definitive host to interrupt its growth cycle in wait to be eaten. However, under low amounts of stress cues from the amphipod, the worm responds by adopting the progenetic lifecycle (Lagrue & Poulin, 2007). Another factor involved in the choice of progenesis is the competition with other interspecies and intraspecies competition. In the case of interspecies coinfection, competition with Microphallus sp. (avian definitive host) favors progenesis in order to ensure C. parvum egg production. Intraspecies coinfection is when more than one C. parvum larvae infects the amphipod, and whoever reproduces faster is going to ensure passage of its genetic information (Lagrue and Poulin, 2008)  Progenesis  The progenetic ability of C. parvum is evolutionarily advantageous for this trematode. While inbreeding or selfing is evolutionarily disadvantageous, because it decreases the ability for genetic diversity to adapt to new hosts, this worm utilizes progenesis for reproductive insurance.

It was released on December 8, 2010 for free as one of the finalists of the Doritos- sponsored \\"Unlock Xbox\\" competition for 2010, alongside Doritos Crash Course. Originating from a hybrid racing/shooting game concept by Ogden, Utah gamer Justin Carpenter, this game has a wasteland-like setting and feeling, similar to Borderlands. On December 29, 2010, it was announced that Harms Way lost to Doritos Crash Course in the second \\"Unlock Xbox\\" competition. However, due to positive feedback on both games, Frito-Lay decided to give both Carpenter and competition winner Jill Robertson the same US$50,000 consultation prize each. The soundtrack for the game was provided by Austrian thrash metal band Die Mognstuambuam. On May 6, 2017, the game was added to the backwards compatibility programme, making it playable on Xbox One.https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-more-games-added-to-xbox-one- backwards-compat/1100-6449817/ Gameplay In Harms Way, players take on the role of either driver or shooter. Driver Drivers ride across one of three courses in a three-lap race with power-ups and shortcuts to help lead them to their victory. To win, a driver must finish in first place out of 4 ranks. Drivers can drift to earn nitro boosts and do barrel rolls for shields, which prevent drivers from receiving damage and may ricochet gunfire back to snipers. The time it takes for drivers to finish a race can represent their ranks in the leaderboards. There are four vehicles, each with three attributes: speed (which affects top speed and acceleration), armor (which affects the amount of damage the vehicle can take), and handling (which affects steering and drifting). *Buggy - Has good speed and handling, but the worst armor. *Pickup - Has average speed and armor, but the best handling. It is recommended for beginners. *Truck - Also has average speed as well as handling, but the best armor. *Bus - Has the best speed and good armor, but the worst handling. Shooter Shooters can snipe other vehicles and damage them. The shooters' goal is to damage and destroy the vehicle as badly as possible. A fatal hit to the windshield of a vehicle will instantly destroy it, giving the shooter 5000 points. Shooters can also hit wheels to stop or slow down a vehicle for 250 points. Shooters can also shoot at power-ups on the track to either prevent drivers from using them or to upgrade their own turrets with new weapons. The number of points snipers earn can represent their ranks in the leaderboards. There are four weapons for each shooter, each available after certain number of upgrades: *Sniper rifle - A powerful single shot from a sniper rifle can cause windshield kills and flat tires. Also has good zooming capabilities and a laser pointer that's also visible to drivers, though it's slow to reload. This is the weapon that shooters start out with. *Burst Shot - A machine gun which rapidly fires relatively weak rounds. Has some zooming capabilities and is prone to overheating. This is the first weapon that shooters receive from upgrading. *Air Strike - Launches a group of land mines from the air and onto the track, detonating automatically if untouched for five seconds. This weapon is earned after two upgrades. *Missile launcher - A rocket launcher that can lock onto moving targets and cause heavy damage, which is strong enough to knock down objects that can fall onto drivers and block the road. It fires in straight lines by default. This is the last weapon that shooters can earn, requiring three upgrades. Power-ups There are five power-ups in the game that affects both drivers and shooters: *Nitro - Give vehicles a small amount of nitrous that allows drivers to gain speed when they want to use it. *Shield - Give vehicles temporary invulnerability and may cause gunfire from shooters to ricochet back to them. *Smoke - Drops a smoke bomb on the nearest turret, making it harder for that shooter to see. *Turret Upgrade - Can be earned from either a shooter or a driver, this power-up upgrades all sniper turrets for the team who gets it. It is not available in single-player driving mode. *Turret Downgrade - Like the Turret Upgrade, but causes all teams' turrets to be downgraded except for the team that collects it. It is only available in multiplayer. Reception The game holds an aggregated review score of 65 on Metacritic, based on four reviews.

In 2005 BOMAG was acquired by the Fayat Group and since then also sells asphalt pavers and cold planers under the BOMAG label. Bomag MPH 121 Bomag Compactor  Company history  BOMAG was founded in 1957 by Karl Heinz Schwamborn in Boppard. In the same year he developed a new design for compaction technology for a model of a double vibratory roller with all-drum drive. In 1962 the first 7t double vibratory roller in the world was launched. The first branch office abroad opened in 1961 in Austria, followed by branches in China, the USA, France, Italy, Great Britain, Canada, Japan and Hungary up to 2002. In 1970 Schwamborn sold the company to the American company Koehring. The original site in Boppard was no longer adequate, so the company moved in 1969 to the Hellerwald industrial estate in the district of Buchholz (Boppard) where it remains today. A research centre was added seven years later. In 1982 production and steel engineering operations on the 7,000 m¬≤ site were expanded. Four years later a further 10,000 m¬≤ were developed for assembly, testing and painting heavy machinery. A powder coating plant was installed in 1997, and the site expanded again by 9,000 m¬≤ in 1998. Koehring sold its interest in BOMAG in 2001 to the American company SPX Corporation, which in turn sold the company again in 2005 to the French corporate group Fayat. In July 2009, BOMAG shed around 320 jobs worldwide, 160 of which were in Boppard, due to an unprecedented 50 percent drop in turnover that year.  Company information  BOMAG produces a range of 20 product groups and has 500 dealers in more than 120 countries. With around 1200 employees (as of 2010) in Boppard, the company is one of the largest employers in the region.
