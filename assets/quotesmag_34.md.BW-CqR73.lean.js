She was a key member of the Heide Circle around Sunday and John Reed. Later she was based in London, but travelled widely Although she and sister in law Sunday Reed had a bitter split after Cynthia Reed and Sidney Nolan married in 1948, John Reed described her on her death in 1976 as ‚ÄúSunday's best friend‚Äù In the later 20th century, Reed Nolan was mostly remembered as the cause of the high-profiled public feud between her husband and Australian author Patrick White.  Early life  Born into a wealthy, landed family at Mount Pleasant, outside of Launceston, Tasmania, Cynthia Reed's childhood and adolescence was materially secure, but she found the evangelical Christianity and patriarchal sternness of her family life highly disturbing. Themes of childhood alienation are threaded through her fiction, informed by her experience of psychoanalysis and reading of Freudian theory and textbooks. After some years as a boarder at the Hermitage Girls' School, Geelong she lived with her sister Dr Margaret Reed in Melbourne. An affair with orchestral conductor Bernard Heinze during the late 1920s expanded her cultural and intellectual milieu, and she moved in a group of avant garde artists and patrons in Melbourne centred around her brother John Reed. Both Cynthia and Sunday Reed had affairs with Heinze in the late 1920s that broke up unhappily and Reed-Nolan entered her first session of psychoanalysis. Reed Nolan travelled overseas in 1929, seeking out contemporary theatre, art, design and music in London and then moved to Europe, staying with well-off families in Germany and Austria, including in Konigsberg East Prussia, Berlin and Vienna. Because she moved among Jewish intellectuals, she discussed the Weimar Republic's rising Antisemitism in letters home to Australia. Returning to Australia by 1931, she spent time in Sydney with Mark Anthony Bracegirdle and his family, who introduced Reed-Nolan to radical politics. She. in turn, influenced John Reed's uptake of communist ideas at this date. However Melbourne, where she was treated as a celebrity in the social pages of the local newspapers, became the site of her greatest success. She was the only bridesmaid at John and Sunday's wedding in January 1932 and the three lived together for some time in South Yarra, before John and Sunday moved to [Heide], establishing the repeated pattern of the married couple needing close emotional investment with a third party to form a triangulated family unit. Amongst the Heide circle, Reed-Nolan's first hand experience of international contemporary art and design stood out and enriched those who had not left Australia. Although later estranged, Sunday and Cynthia Reed shared many tastes and habits in common and constantly exchanged letters and gifts such as clothing or seeds and plants for the Heide garden.  Business  In late 1932, Reed-Nolan began mounting exhibitions in the furniture shop established by Frederick Ward, who had shared a house with her brother John in the 1920s. Artists ranging from Thea Proctor to Ian Fairweather were presented at her gallery. The display of Sam Atyeo's disqualified entrant in the 1932 National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship in the front window of Reed-Nolan's Collins Street shop attracted much attention protested the official censorship of artistic innovation by Australian art museums and government art schools and established Reed Nolan as a leading modernist advocate. She later moved from Ward's former premises to an address in Little Collins Street Her business offered modernist interior design services to clients, with furniture by Ward and Atyeo, fabrics by Michael O'Connell and wallpapers imported from Germany. Reed-Nolan herself designed at least one piece of furniture. Another high profile opportunity was providing the furniture and accessories for Alleyne Clarice Zander's 1933 exhibition of British Modern Art in the Herald Building. Young Melbourne artists including Moya Dyring were employed to paint contemporary murals on commissions organised by Reed Nolan. Her business was one of the most high-profiled conduits for promoting modern art and design in 1930s Australia and brought her in contact with many art patrons including Maie Casey and Mary Alice Evatt, who became longstanding friends.  Film and nursing career  By 1935, she had left the gallery and moved to Sydney, where she adopted the pseudonym, Miss Liesl Fels, and studied contemporary European style dance. At the same time she took an unsuccessful screen test with Ken G. Hall's Cinesound Studio, having sought auditions in London in 1929, and apparently was cast in a large scale Pat Hanna production in Melbourne, that began filming, but was left uncompleted when Hanna left Frank W, Thring's company. In 1936 she left Sydney by passenger ship in the company of a visiting American theatre producer, whom she named in letters to John and Sunday Reed as Michael, without identifying him further The couple separated in Hollywood, where Reed Nolan stayed for six months, again seeking to break into film acting. At this time she underwent a number of medical procedures, including aesthetic dentistry and a double mastectomy. However she also abandoned her desire to become a film star, in order to enroll in nursing training in Chicago, but was forced to leave within six months due to United States immigration law and she continued her training at St Thomas' Hospital London. She remained in contact with Australian expatriates including Clarice Zanders and Sam Atyeo. At the outbreak of World War Two, she was working at the American Hospital in Paris and moved to New York, where she studied psychiatric nursing at the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, but returned to Melbourne when she discovered that she was pregnant. Sunday Reed wished to adopt the child, prompting Reed Nolan's return to Sydney with her infant daughter in 1941 where she established a home in then rural Wahroonga.  Marriage to Sidney Nolan and later career  During the 1940s, Reed-Nolan concentrated on writing novels, producing two autobiographical novels, Lucky Alphonse, 1944 and Daddy Sowed A Wind! 1947 in a highly modernist style, unlike the social realism that was the norm in Australian literary fiction. The first was mildly well received. In March 1948 she married artist Sydney Nolan, who had left the Reed household at Heide, after a brief 3 month courtship. Almost immediately Reed-Nolan's network of contacts within both art circles and high society in New South Wales established Sydney Nolan as a prominent and successful artist and his reputation grew rapidly, even more than under John and Sunday Reed's promotion. Reed Nolan's previous talent as a gallerist was now devoted to Nolan alone. Of their marriage M.E.McGuire wrote \\"They were constant companions, their lives and works so intertwined as to be interchangeable\\" and Underhill wrote \\"[Sidney Nolan] achieved a settled home life. Cynthia gained a partner and a cause. Above all, they considered each other intellectual equals, respecting and supporting their individual work habits.\\" [p. 199] In 1952, the Nolans left Australia, and rented accommodation in Britain, interspersed with extended international travel, until they bought a home in Putney, London in 1960. Reed Nolan authored a number of travel books based upon the lengthy journeys undertaken by her husband to various countries, often displaying early awareness of Postcolonial themes and illustrated by her husband. Reed Nolan undertook much of the work of promoting and organising her husband's exhibitions. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Reed Nolan knew many of the most significant creative talents in Britain, counting figures such as Kenneth Clark and Benjamin Britten among her acquaintances. During two years in the United States 1958-9, when her husband was awarded a Harkness Fellowship, Reed Nolan was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which was successfully cured in New York. Much of her previous poor health could be accounted by this long term undiagnosed illness. However the later 1960s and 1970s were marked by tensions in her marriage whilst her psychiatric health grew increasingly fragile. Nevertheless she made meticulous preparations for the organisation and disposal of her estate, which included papers and artworks, before taking an intentional overdose of sleeping pills in a London hotel on 24 November 1976. (p. 184-6).  Later impact  Reed Nolan was increasingly forgotten until Patrick White's autobiography Flaws in the Glass, which presented an extended description of her character and achievements and equally a savage attack upon both her husband and the jealousies and hostilities directed towards her by mediocre Australian contemporaries. This passage, which provided the first high-profiled documentation that she had taken her own life, prompted a massive public feud between White and Nolan. In 1994 an anthology of her travel writings, Outback and Beyond, with some excisions of her more unconventional and political content was published. Two scholars collected first hand accounts from surviving relatives, friends and colleagues in the 1990s, presented in a PhD in 2002 by Grant, and a biography in 2016 by McGuire. Nancy Underhill in her biography of Sidney Nolan established the case for Reed Nolan's importance as a foundation of the Heide mythology, and the manager of her husband's career.

Background  The Neville family in England go back to at least the 11th century, and the historian Horace Round speculated that they were part of the pre-Norman aristocracy of Northumbria. By the 13th century, the Nevilles had become, through shrewd marriages and royal patronage, major landholders, and concomitantly rose to a position of regional hegemony regularly being appointed to the important royal offices. By the time Neville reached adulthood, and for the rest of his life, English politics was in a state of partisanship; the King, Henry III was increasingly unpopular with his nobility and the tension between them, never resolved, erupted in constitutional crisis and eventually civil war. Simon de Montfort, previously a favourite of Henry's, who had married his sister Eleanor, led the opposition.  Early life  Robert de Neville was the eldest son of Geoffrey fitz Robert (later Geoffrey de Neville, d. c. 1242), and the grandson of Robert fitz Meldred, Lord of Raby. The identity of Robert de Neville's mother, however, is disputed among scholars. A. F. Pollard, for example, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography in 1894 suggested that she was Margaret, daughter of Sir John de Longvillers. However, this Margaret was married until 1285, and there is evidence from a Lincolnshire fine of 1247 which refers to one Robert de Neville, knight, and his mother, Joan. Robert had younger brothers, Geoffrey‚Äîwho was to start a cadet branch of the family in Hornby, Lancashire‚ÄîJohn, and Hugh.  Inheritance and estates  Robert possessed estates in Burreth, Lincolnshire by 1242 and on his father's death in 1254 he succeeded to his patrimony, including the Lordship of Raby and Brancepeth in Durham; he performed fealty to the king on 7 May that year following the deaths of his grandmother and grandfather, from whom he received further lands. They probably included the manors of Ulnaby and Carlbury. However, notes Young, the nature of the surviving evidence‚Äîmostly existing in the form of the inquisition post mortem taken after his death‚Äîis not sufficient for scholars to make anything other than \\"an approximate estimate of their wealth\\".{{refn|Specifically, the IPMs list de Neville as holding Schyrrevehoton (Sheriff Hutton) in Yorkshire, The medievalist Matthew Holford described de Neville as having \\"united the inheritances of Bulmer and Meldred\\".  Northern and national politics  De Neville became increasingly important in the politics and society of northeastern England during the mid-1250s, and by 1258 he had been appointed Sheriff of Northumberland. The strategic proximity of Northumberland to the border with Scotland made this an important post for pushing the boundaries of English influence into Scottish affairs, as well as escorting and receiving embassies; accompanied by William de Latimer, then Sheriff of York, he travelled to Scotland on royal business in April 1258 with orders to assist the Scottish king in crushing a revolt by his own nobles. De Neville attended a large assembly in York between the 7th and 26 September 1268 with the King. This was the official setting for a meeting between Henry III and his son-in-law, the King of Scotland; with the latter came Henry's daughter, Margaret, Queen of Scotland. During this meeting, de Neville witnessed a large number of both royal and private charters. De Neville played a leading role in the administration of border society, including the organisation of truces, resolution of disputes and collecting protection money. He was also close to the Bishops of Duham, Robert and Antony, for whom de Neville witnessed many charters over the years, and with whose steward, Guichard de Charron, de Neville was an itinerant justice in 1278‚Äì1279, although this was the only time he held the office. In 1263, de Neville was entrusted with the defence of York and all of England north of the River Trent, as well as being appointed Sheriff of Yorkshire. and was also appointed governor of Norham and Werk castles, which had previously been held by Robert de Ros and the Bishops of Durham respectively.  Royal service  Even before his father's death, Robert was performing minor services for King Henry III in the North of England; in 1251, for example, he was dispatched to gather buck deer from the royal forest of Galtres for Henry's Christmas feast at Westminster Palace. In return, the following year de Neville was granted the right to enclose land for his own harvesting at nearby Sutton in Galtres. This was followed by further grants over the next few years, which included deer for his park and a license to hunt hares, foxes and cats with his dogs. In August 1257 he fought on campaign in Wales. At various points in his career de Neville was custodian of royal castles in the north, including Bamburgh, Newcastle, Scarborough and York; de Neville calculated that the constableship of Bamburgh cost him 1,200 marks alone, although the historian Charles Young calls this figure \\"somewhat inflated\\". De Neville's primary use to the King at this time was diplomatic, however, rather than military. With conflict looming, as constable of York and Bamburgh Castles, de Neville promised to \\"surrender it to the king and his heirs and to no other, and this by the council of the king and not otherwise\\". In 1261 de Neville was appointed Chief Justice of forests beyond the Trent, with responsibility for hearing forest pleas replacing John d'Eyvill.  Civil War  With the decline in relations between King Henry and a number of his barons, led by Simon de Montfort, de Neville's role was to become a military one. De Neville, as constable of Bamburgh Castle, is mentioned \\"incidentally\\" on the rebel barons' Provisions of Oxford, which they promulgated in 1258, as an acceptable royalist whom they could trust with custody of royal castles; the rebels also appointed him Sheriff of Northumberland, where they were strongest in the north. In 1263‚Äîat the time, constable of Devizes Castle‚Äîde Neville was part of the group of barons sympathetic to the King in his struggle with Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester over political reform. Neville sought the intervention of King Louis IX of France to arbitrate in December 1263. The first violence took place in June 1263 when de Montfort and his men led a chevauch√©e through the lands of the KIng's favourites, collectively nicknamed the Savoyards on account of where they had come from. King Henry‚Äî\\"belatedly\\", comments the historian Fergus Oakes‚Äîorganised his military response, making de Neville responsible for the royal lands in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Durham, whom Young notes had \\"remained a King's man\\". He was personally instructed to deal vigorously with those who \\"devastate the lands of the king‚Äôs faithful men by fire, plunder and other means\\". Oakes calls de Neville's prospects of doing so \\"daunting\\", not least on account of the sheer extent of the region he was now responsible for‚Äîaround one-third of the Kingdom. This led to de Neville writing to the Chancellor, William of Merton, protesting that his task \\"not possible without great expense\\" and that he had \\"been led...to beg your counsel and help...in order to signify to me where and from whence...I shall be able to acquire the money for the custody of the aforementioned county and castle of York\\". De Neville also wrote to King Henry personally, complaining that \\"many I meet with are tepid in their responses to the conservation of the peace of your majesty's dignity\\", and he implored Henry to send his nobility \\"in these parts your letters...that they may be appointed to aid my person...to resist the evils of the before said rebels\\". The civil war had impacted substantially upon de Neville's ability to perform his royal duties, he claimed in 1269, and he had been unable to regularly collect‚Äîand so could not be held responsible for ‚Äîthe royal farm thanks to the criminal activities of John d'Eyville. D'Eyville, a firm and energetic supporter of de Montfort, with other barons, had severely disrupted local society, said de Neville, from Michaelmas 1263 until the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264, after which de Montfort appointed anther man sheriff. Following de Montfort's victory at Lewes, de Neville was summoned to meet in London with the earl on 3 June 1264 to provide the new regime with counsel; he was back in London the next month, having been summoned with a force of men to repel an expected French invasion which did not, in the event, occur. King Henry had been captured at Lewes, and was now effectively a puppet King for de Montfort, but de Neville appears to have remained openly defiant to de Montfort's rule and refused to surrender Bamburgh or York Castles to the new regime, reflecting his earlier promise to the crown. De Neville's position, says Young, \\"is especially noteworthy in that other barons in the north, including John d'Eyvill, who had preceded Robert as Chief Justice of the Forest and had been associated with him in other royal service, now gave their allegiance to the Montfort government\\". This period has been described as \\"excessively demanding\\" for de Neville, who was repeatedly threatened with the confiscation of his estates if he did not surrender the castles. The historian Helen M. Jewell has noted that on top having to support the King during the civil war, de Neville also had to carry out his usual military and official duties, such as the Welsh campaigns of the 1250s and 1260s (which resulted in the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267 and attendance at parliament in 1265. Young suggests that de Neville was tangentially the cause of de Montfort's eventual defeat at the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265 through what Young describes as a chain reaction. The Earl of Gloucester was standing surety for de Neville's good behaviour, and the new government tried to force him to bring de Neville to London; de Clare not only refused, but proceeded to change sides. Gloucester's support was essential to Edward's later victory at Evesham as a result.  Later career  Although de Montfort had been defeated and killed at Evesham, and Henry restored to independent rule, a groundswell of support for him and his reform movement remained; much of both the crown's and de Neville's energies over the following few years was devoted to neutralising it. He was reappointed Chief Justice of the Northern Forests and also made a Keeper of the peace for Cumberland, Lancashire, Northumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire. He was also appointed to repeated judicial commissions, and in 1276‚Äîhaving pledged his homage to the new kIng, Henry's son Edward I‚Äîde Neville was commissioned to hear the pleas of the so-called \\"Disinherited\\" rebels with Henry de Bratton. They included de Neville's cousin, Hugh de Neville, who had fought with de Montfort at Lewes, where he commanded a troop. De Neville has been described as a \\"staunch royalist\\" during the civil war, and Cokayne says de Neville \\"stood firmly\\" with the royal party. However, Jewell notes that, in 1267, he was required to meet with the King at Kenilworth Castle and there make his peace. This act that, she says, \\"jars\\" with his presumed loyalism. Kenilworth‚Äîde Montfort's chief residence until his death, and now holding out against the King‚Äîwas almost impregnable, being surrounded by a river and a moat, and de Neville assisted the King's efforts in dislodging the remaining rebels. In what Young has called de Neville's final service for the KIng against the rebellion, on 17 September 1267, he was appointed an executor of the Dictum of Kenilworth in the East Midlands and the Thames Valley, which officially made the final peace between the crown and the last of de Montfort's followers. One of his roles involved witnessing the charters of mortgage that the rebels made in order to receive back their lands. De Neville continued to perform administrative duties, however, sitting on various commissions of Oyer and terminer and responsible for the collection of the fifteenth and tenth tax in Northumberland and Westmorland in 1275. The following year he was at the Council of Westminster as a member of the Royal council that declared Llywelyn ap Gruffudd a rebel, leading to the invasion of Wales the following year. The same council also heard Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester's claim to Bristol Castle, traditionally claimed by the de Clares but held by the crown, and dismissed it for good.  Illness and death  The invasion of Wales continued into 1277, and de Neville was summoned to join the King's army. However, de Neville sent the King his son John to fight in his place. Summoned again the following year, he claimed exception on account of physical infirmity; he was dead by 20 August 1282. It is not known where he was buried, although Jewell notes that both Greyfriars and Blackfriars in York, and Staindrop Church have all been suggested as likely sites. His will was executed by his brother, Geoffrey; by the time of his death he was the most powerful noble in Durham.  Marriage and family  Robert de Neville is known to have married twice. His first marriage, to Isabel de Byron, took an active part in her husband's legal affairs and provided him with children, all sons, although his heir, also a Robert, predeceased his father in 1271. Robert the younger's son, Ralph, thus inherited his grandfather's titles and lands, and was elevated to the peerage as the first Baron Neville. Robert the younger had married Mary fitz Ranulf (or Fitzrandolph), who inherited Middleham Castle from her father and so brought it to the Neville family. Robert the elder's second wife was Ida, daughter of Sir Robert Bertram of Mitford. She remarried in 1285 to Robert Lumley.

It includes RNA viruses that encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; and, it includes reverse-transcribing viruses (with either RNA or DNA genomes) that encode an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also called RNA replicase, produces RNA (ribonucleic acid) from RNA. RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp), also called reverse transcriptase (RT), produces DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from RNA. These enzymes are essential for replicating the viral genome and transcribing viral genes into messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation of viral proteins. Riboviria was established in 2018 to accommodate all RdRp-encoding RNA viruses and was expanded a year later to also include RdDp-encoding retroviruses. These two groups of viruses are assigned to two separate kingdoms: Orthornavirae for RdRp-encoding RNA viruses, which encompasses all RNA viruses, and Pararnavirae for RdDp-encoding viruses, i.e. all reverse- transcribing viruses. Both groups are likely descended from non-viral elements that encode reverse transcriptase, though the exact origin of Orthornavirae is unclear. While the realm has few prokaryotic viruses, it includes most eukaryotic viruses, including most human, animal, and plant viruses. Many of the most widely known viral diseases are caused by viruses in Riboviria, which includes coronaviruses, ebola virus, HIV, influenza viruses, and the rabies virus. These viruses and others have been prominent throughout history, including Tobacco mosaic virus, which was the first virus to be discovered. Many reverse transcribing viruses notably become integrated into the genome of their host as part of their replication cycle. As a result of that, it is estimated that about 7‚Äì8% of the human genome originates from these viruses. Etymology Riboviria is a portmanteau of ribo, referencing ribonucleic acid, and the suffix -viria, which is the suffix used for virus realms. Characteristics A general scenario of RNA virus evolution All members of Riboviria contain a gene that encodes for an RNA-dependent polymerase, also called RNA-directed polymerase. There are two types of RNA-dependent polymerases: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also called RNA replicase, which synthesizes RNA from RNA, and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp), also called reverse transcriptase (RT), which synthesizes DNA from RNA. In a typical virus particle, called a virion, the RNA-dependent polymerase is bound to the viral genome in some manner and begins transcription of the viral genome after entering a cell. As part of a virus's life cycle, the RNA- dependent polymerase also synthesizes copies of the viral genome as part of the process of creating new viruses. Viruses that replicate via RdRp belong to three groups in the Baltimore classification system, all of which are in the kingdom Orthornavirae: single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, which are either positive (+) or negative (-) sense, and double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA). +ssRNA viruses have genomes that can functionally act as mRNA, and a negative sense strand can also be created to form dsRNA from which mRNA is transcribed from the negative strand. The genomes of -ssRNA viruses and dsRNA viruses act as templates from which RdRp creates mRNA. Viruses that replicate via reverse transcription belong to two Baltimore groups, both of which are in the kingdom Pararnavirae: single-stranded RNA (ssRNA-RT) viruses, all of which belong to the order Ortervirales, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA-RT) viruses, which belong to the family Caulimoviridae, also in Ortervirales, and the family Hepadnaviridae of the order Blubervirales. ssRNA-RT viruses have their positive-sense genome transcribed by RdDp to synthesize a negative sense complementary DNA (-cDNA) strand. The +RNA strand is degraded and later replaced by RdDp with a +DNA strand to synthesize a linear dsDNA copy of the viral genome. This genome is then integrated into the host cell's DNA. For dsDNA-RT viruses, a pregenomic +RNA strand is transcribed from the relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA), which is in turn used by RdDp to transcribe a -cDNA strand. The +RNA strand is degraded and replaced in a similar manner as +ssRNA-RT viruses to synthesize the rcDNA. The rcDNA genome is later repaired by the host cell's DNA repair mechanisms to synthesize a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) genome. The integrated genome of +ssRNA-RT viruses and the cccDNA of dsDNA-RT viruses are then transcribed into mRNA by the host cell enzyme RNA polymerase II. Viral mRNA is translated by the host cell's ribosomes to produce viral proteins. In order to produce more viruses, viral RNA-dependent polymerases use copies of the viral genome as templates to replicate the viral genome. For +ssRNA viruses, an intermediate dsRNA genome is created from which +ssRNA is synthesized from the negative strand. For -ssRNA viruses, genomes are synthesized from complementary positive sense strands. dsRNA viruses replicate their genomes from mRNA by synthesizing a complementary negative sense strand to form genomic dsRNA. For dsDNA-RT viruses, pregenomic RNA created from the cccDNA is retrotranscribed into new dsDNA genomes. For +ssRNA-RT viruses, the genome is replicated from the integrated genome. After replication and translation, the genome and the viral proteins are assembled into complete virions, which then leave the host cell. Phylogenetics Phylogeny of Orthornavirae. The five colored branches are the five phyla of Orthornavirae. Both kingdoms in Riboviria show a relation to the reverse transcriptases of group II introns that encode RTs and retrotransposons, which are self-replicating DNA sequences, the latter of which self-replicate via reverse transcription and integrate themselves into other parts of the same DNA molecule. Reverse transcribing viruses, assigned to Pararnavirae, appear to have evolved from a retrotransposon on a single occasion. The origin of the RdRps of Orthornavirae is less clear due to a lack of information, but two scenarios have been suggested. The most likely scenario is that the RdRps of the RNA viruses originated from the reverse transcriptase of a bacterial group II intron shortly before the emergence of eukaryotes. The other possibility is that the RdRps of Orthornavirae originated before the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and that they preceded the retroelement reverse transcriptases. With regard to the second possibility, it has been noted that the capsid proteins of leviviruses, which infect bacteria, have no homologues with cellular organisms and other viruses. Furthermore it has been claimed that the RdRps of other RNA viruses are more similar to reverse transcriptases than they are to the RdRps of leviviruses and their relatives in the phylum Lenarviricota. From that, it has been proposed that numerous lineages of prokaryotic RNA viruses may have gone extinct when they lost competition with prokaryotic DNA viruses, after which RNA viruses reemerged once they began to infect eukaryotes. It is also probable that there are RNA viruses that infect archaea based on metagenomic samples. Phylogenetic analysis of extracted sequences suggests that they are the most divergent RNA viruses and that they may be ancestors of eukaryotic RNA viruses, especially those of Pisuviricota, Kitrinoviricota, Duplornaviricota, and Negarnaviricota, which do not have an apparent prokaryotic ancestor. The discovery of these viruses could change the ideas about the origin of RNA viruses. Classification Riboviria contains two kingdoms: Orthornavirae and Pararnavirae. Orthornavirae contains multiple phyla and unassigned taxa, whereas Pararnavirae is monotypic down to the rank of class. This taxonomy can be visualized hereafter. * Kingdom: Orthornavirae, which contains all RdRp-encoding RNA viruses, i.e. all dsRNA, +ssRNA, and -ssRNA viruses, collectively called RNA viruses * Kingdom: Pararnavirae, which contains all RdDp-encoding viruses, i.e. all ssRNA-RT and dsDNA-RT viruses, collectively called reverse transcribing viruses ** Phylum: Arterviricota *** Class: Revtraviricetes Additionally, Riboviria contains two incertae sedis families and four incertae sedis genera. Additional information about them is needed to know their exact placement in higher taxa. They are listed hereafter (-viridae indicates family and -virus indicates genus). * Polymycoviridae * Sarthroviridae * Albetovirus * Aumaivirus * Papanivirus * Virtovirus Riboviria partially merges Baltimore classification with virus taxonomy, including all RNA viruses and all reverse transcribing viruses in the realm. Baltimore classification is a classification system used for viruses based on their manner of mRNA production, often used alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history. All members of five Baltimore groups belong to Riboviria: Group III: dsRNA viruses, Group IV: +ssRNA viruses, Group V: -ssRNA viruses, Group VI: ssRNA-RT viruses, and Group VII: dsDNA-RT viruses. Realms are the highest level of taxonomy used for viruses and Riboviria is one of four, the other three being Duplodnaviria, Monodnaviria, and Varidnaviria. Most identified eukaryotic viruses are RNA viruses, and for that reason most eukaryotic viruses belong to Riboviria, including most human, animal, and plant viruses. Prokaryotic RNA viruses are seemingly rare as only two such families have been identified: +ssRNA Leviviridae, whose origin is unclear, and dsRNA Cystoviridae, who appear to be related to reoviruses, which infect eukaryotes. Other major branches of eukaryotic viruses include herpesviruses in Duplodnaviria, the kingdom Shotokuvirae in Monodnaviria, and various viruses in Varidnaviria. Interactions with hosts Disease Viruses in Riboviria are associated with a wide range of diseases, including many of the most widely known viral diseases. Notable disease-causing viruses in the realm include: * coronaviruses * Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus * Dengue virus * Ebolavirus * hantaviruses * Hepatitis B virus * the human immunodeficiency viruses * Human orthopneumovirus * influenza viruses * Japanese encephalitis virus * Lassa mammarenavirus * Measles morbillivirus * Mumps orthorubulavirus * Norovirus * Poliovirus * Rabies lyssavirus * Rhinoviruses * Rift Valley fever phlebovirus * Rotavirus * Rubella virus * Tick-borne encephalitis virus * West Nile virus * Yellow fever virus * Zika virus Animal viruses in Riboviria include orbiviruses, which cause various diseases in ruminants and horses, including Bluetongue virus, African horse sickness virus, Equine encephalosis virus, and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus. The vesicular stomatitis virus causes disease in cattle, horses, and pigs. Bats harbor many viruses including ebolaviruses and henipaviruses, which also can cause disease in humans. Similarly, arthropod viruses in the Flavivirus and Phlebovirus genera are numerous and often transmitted to humans. Coronaviruses and influenza viruses cause disease in various vertebrates, including bats, birds, and pigs. The family Retroviridae contains many viruses that cause leukemia, immunodeficiency, and other cancers and immune system-related diseases in animals. Plant viruses in the realm are numerous and infect many economically important crops. Tomato spotted wilt virus is estimated to cause more than 1 billion USD in damages annually, affecting more than 800 plant species including chrysanthemum, lettuce, peanut, pepper, and tomato. Cucumber mosaic virus infects more than 1,200 plant species and likewise causes significant crop losses. Potato virus Y causes significant reductions in yield and quality for pepper, potato, tobacco, and tomato, and Plum pox virus is the most important virus among stone fruit crops. Brome mosaic virus, while not causing significant economic losses, is found throughout much of the world and primarily infects grasses, including cereals. Endogenization Many reverse transcribing viruses, called retroviruses, in Riboviria are able to become integrated into the DNA of their host. These viruses become endogenized as part of their replication cycle. Namely, the viral genome is integrated into the host genome by the retroviral enzyme integrase, and viral mRNA is produced from that DNA. Endogenization is a form of horizontal gene transfer between unrelated organisms, and it is estimated that about 7‚Äì8% of the human genome consists of retroviral DNA. Endogenization can also be used to study the evolutionary history of viruses, showing an approximate time period when a virus first became endogenized into the host's genome as well as the rate of evolution for the viruses since endogenization first occurred. History Diseases caused by viruses in Riboviria have been known for much of recorded history, though their cause was only discovered in modern times. Tobacco mosaic virus was discovered in 1898 and was the first virus to be discovered. Viruses transmitted by arthropods have been central in the development of vector control, which often aims to prevent viral infections. In modern history, numerous disease outbreaks have been caused by various members of the realm, including coronaviruses, ebola, and influenza. HIV especially has had dramatic effects on society as it causes a sharp decline in life expectancy and significant stigma for infected persons. For a long time, the relation between many viruses in Riboviria couldn't be established due to the high amount of genetic divergence among RNA viruses. With the development of viral metagenomics, many additional RNA viruses were identified, helping to fill in the gaps of their relations. This led to the establishment of Riboviria in 2018 to accommodate all RNA viruses based on phylogenetic analysis that they were related. A year later, all reverse transcribing viruses were added to the realm. The kingdoms were also established in 2019, separating the two RNA- dependent polymerase branches. When the realm was founded, it mistakenly included two viroid families, Avsunviroidae and Pospiviroidae, and the genus Deltavirus, which were promptly removed in 2019 because they use host cell enzymes for replication.

Its premiere was given on 19 January 1991 in New York by Ensemble Continuum directed by Joel Sachs. The symphony is scored for: oboe, trumpet, tuba, wooden cube, violin and reciter. The wooden cube is a percussion instrument designed by Ustvolskaya. It consists of an enclosed chipboard cube 43 cm x 43 cm, struck with wooden hammers or mallets. A typical performance lasts approximately 13 minutes. The text may be spoken in Russian, English or German. Despite some assertions, the text is not a \\"free interpretation\\" of The Lord's Prayer, but this Prayer as it is. The composer stressed that the receiter should pronounce it praying to God. Ustvolskaya gave specific instructions in the score that the reciter, a man, should be dressed in black and not wearing jewelry.

They are distributed in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa. Taxonomy The senior synonym Fidia Motschulsky, 1860 has priority over the name Lypesthes Baly, 1863. However, Lypesthes is the preferred name for the genus used by some authors, because the name Fidia is also used by the genus Fidia Baly, 1863, despite the latter name being a junior homonym of Fidia Motschulsky, 1860. An application to suppress Fidia Motschulsky, 1860 and conserve usage of Fidia Baly, 1863 and Lypesthes Baly, 1863 was submitted to the ICZN in 2006, but was rejected by them in 2009.

He was the seigneur of Belleville and a Marmouset at the court of King Charles VI. Jean was the only son of the English knight John Harpeden and his French wife, Jeanne, daughter of Olivier IV de Clisson and Jeanne de Belleville and thus a younger sister of Olivier V. Jean was born in the 1360s and was raised in the household of Olivier V. Jean, who was by language and upbringing a French Poitevin, is unlikely to have seen his father after 1372, when his father was captured in battle by the French. Jean came into possession of his father's estates around Belleville in Poitou in 1372, although he was under the control of his uncle at that time. He is the source for the story that Olivier V de Clisson, while serving as constable of France, would annually remind the minor-aged Charles VI that he was a year closer to assuming full powers By 1385, Jean had become prominent at the royal court. In that year he served as seneschal of P√©rigord. His descendants would continue to serve in the French military into the 20th century. Jean supported Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans, in the dispute over the regency for Charles VI after the latter was declared insane in 1393. He became Louis's chamberlain and in 1399 Louis appointed him seneschal of Saintonge. In 1402, during a period of lucidity, Charles VI dismissed his uncle, John, Duke of Berry, from the regency and appointed Louis. According to the Grandes Chroniques de France, the duke learned about his dismissal from Jean Harpedenne. When Louis was preparing to march on Paris in August 1405, Jean recruited troops in the Pale of Calais and joined Louis at Melun. Jean married Joan, daughter of Raimond de Montaut, lord of Mussidan and Blaye, a short time before her father's death in July 1406. By his will Raimond had designated Joan's unmarried sister Marie as his heiress and required her to remain loyal to the English crown. Her mother, Margaret of Albret, was the cousin of the constable of France, Charles d'Albret. She had custody of her daughter and took refuge in Mussidan, which her cousin soon besieged. An arrangement was negotiated by Jean by which Mussidan came under a French garrison. Jean was still living in 1413‚Äì15, when he reached agreements with Isabeau, the sister and heiress of Amaury II de Clisson.

This operation formed part of the Allied Air raids on Japan, and destroyed 21.5 percent of the city. B-29s also dropped naval mines near Fukuoka harbor on seven occasions between May and July 1945, and the city was attacked twice by American fighter aircraft. 19 June 1945 raid The single bombing raid on Fukuoka formed part of a campaign by the USAAF's XXI Bomber Command targeting medium-sized Japanese cities which began in mid-June 1945 and continued until the end of the war. These attacks used firebombing tactics to destroy the cities, and were conducted as a follow-on from raids which had devastated most of Japan's major cities. Fukuoka, with a population of 323,200, was the largest city targeted in this campaign. Most of these raids were conducted by a single wing of B-29s, which allowed XXI Bomber Command to attack four cities a night. However, Fukuoka and ≈åmuta (on 26 July) were targeted by two wings due to their size. The 73rd and 313rd Bombardment Wings were assigned to attack Fukuoka. These units dispatched a total of 239 B-29s. Of these, 223 bombed the primary target. Another four bombed targets of opportunity in Tomitaka, Chichijima, Miyazaki and Fukuoka. All of the B-29s returned to base. On 20 June, four American B-29 airmen who were being held as prisoners of war at Fukuoka were murdered by Japanese soldiers. These killings were motivated by the casualties and damage caused by the raid and a belief among the personnel involved that Japan would soon be invaded. Another 29 captured American airmen were murdered at Fukuoka in August 1945. Minelaying Fukuoka harbor was targeted as part of a large-scale aerial minelaying campaign. The first minelaying operation targeting the harbor took place on 25 May 1945. 15 B-29s from the 9th Bombardment Group were dispatched, of which 14 laid mines. All of the bombers returned to base. The 9th Bombardment Group dropped further mines off Fukuoka harbor on 27 May. Fukuoka harbor was targeted again in June. On 7 June, ten B-29s of the 505th Bombardment Group were dispatched, and six laid mines. Eight 505th Bombardment Group aircraft dropped further mines off the city on 15 June. The 505th Bombardment Group struck again on 23 June, with nine B-29s laying mines. One of these aircraft was lost during the operation. Further operations were conducted in July. On 13 July, three B-29s of the 6th Bombardment Group were dispatched to lay mines near Fukuoka harbor. Historian Robert Mann has written that it is not known how many of these aircraft dropped mines. Another minelaying operation was conducted by six B-29s from the 504th Bombardment Group on 29 July, but Mann also notes that the number which actually dropped mines is not known. Other operations Fukuoka was attacked twice by USAAF fighter aircraft. On 23 June, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters from the Seventh Air Force attacked an airfield at Hakata in Fukuoka. North American P-51 Mustang fighters of the Fifth Air Force attacked Fukuoka harbor on 3 July. The fighters destroyed several floatplanes. On 17 July a B-29 from the 39th Bombardment Group conducted a radar reconnaissance mission against Fukuoka. Results The 19 June raid destroyed 1.37 square miles of Fukuoka's urban area, representing 21.5 percent of the city.

Chang was born in Hsinchu and raised in Taipei. He specialized in criminal investigation while attending Central Police University, from which he graduated in 1965. Chang began his law enforcement career as a detective within the National Police Agency's Criminal Investigation Bureau. He subsequently led precincts within Taipei City Police Department, served as TCPD's deputy commissioner, led Hualien Police Department, and served as Third Peace Preservation Police chief. In 1999, Chang became head of the Aviation Police Bureau, which he had served previously as second-in-command. As police bureau chief at Chiang Kai- shek International Airport, Chang worked to stop drug smuggling and took part in the care of political asylum seekers. In October 2002, Chang and the National Immigration Agency's Tseng Wen-chang were questioned by Control Yuan members Lee Shen-yi and Lin Shih-chi regarding the defection of Republic of China Army Lieutenant Wang Yi-hung. On 1 July 2003, Chang succeeded Wang Ginn- wang as director-general of the National Police Agency. That same month, Chang participated in a drug raid of the largest nightclub in Taiwan, alongside interior minister Yu Cheng-hsien and Criminal Investigation Bureau commissioner Hou You-yi. A few days after the raid, Chang and over 400 police officers were transferred to Hualien County to form an investigative force targeting electoral fraud during a by-election for county magistrate. Less than a week after the investigations began, Chang stated that 119 cases of possible vote buying had been reported. As head of the National Police Agency, Chang commented on police efforts to track , a member of the Kaohsiung City Council who stood accused of vote buying dating to December 2002. In December 2003, Chang was invited to serve on a task force focusing on electoral fraud. Days before the Police Duties Enforcement Act came into effect on 1 December 2003, Chang spoke highly of the bill, stating, \\"This new law will protect both human rights and the police themselves.\\" That month, Chang announced that the National Police Agency would house Chinese illegal immigrants in detention centers on Kinmen and Matsu as part of the government's Hunting Snake task force against illegal immigration. The 2004 Taiwanese referendum and presidential election were beset by several issues, including misplaced ballots. On 19 March 2004, Chang convened a meeting to discuss law enforcement during the 2004 Taiwan presidential election, to be held the next day. On the day of the meeting, Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu of the Democratic Progressive Party ticket were shot in Tainan. Following a Pan-Blue Coalition challenge of the electoral results, Chang stated that the National Police Agency would be available to provide security. Mayor of Taipei Ma Ying-jeou criticized the interference of Chang and the National Police Agency, stating \\"I think it was illegal, unfeasible and unnecessary for the NPA to intervene in the dispersion\\" of demonstrators protesting the presidential election results along Ketagalan Boulevard. Chang resigned as director-general of the National Police Agency on 5 April 2004, to take responsibility for the attack on Chen and Lu. The resignation of interior minister Yu Cheng-hsien for the same reason was approved prior to Chang's, leaving Yu's successor Su Jia- chyuan to decide Chang's status.

The Australian Institute of Architects‚Äô Paula Whitman Leadership in Gender Equity Prize is named in her honour.  Biography  Australian by birth, Whitman began studying architecture as an undergraduate at the (then) Queensland Institute of Technology (now, Queensland University of Technology (QUT)). She graduated in 1983; winning the Board of Architects of Queensland Prize, the QIT Medal and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects‚Äô QIA Medallion. Following a decade in architectural practice, Whitman returned to study a Masters in Architecture, and was appointed a lecturer at QUT in 1993. She remained there throughout her academic career. Whitman was also a member of the Australian Institute of Architects until her death in 2006.  Professional career  Whitman contributed to popular media publications, academic journals, industry reports, and conferences; and also sat on numerous architectural juries. Whitman was also a member of the National Association of Women in Construction, and awarded the 2004 Year of the Built Environment Award in recognition of her significant efforts to improve the place of women in architecture. Her landmark comprehensive study, Going Places: The Career Progression of Women in the Architectural Profession - Findings of a National Study Examining the Careers of Women in the Architectural Profession in Australia, connected the lack of workplace policies and flexible working arrangements as a key obstacle for women contributing to Australian architectural practice as early as 2005. The study grew out of Whitman‚Äôs realisation in 2002 that though nearly half of al architecture students and graduates in Australia were women, only 16% of registered architects across the country were female. Whitman‚Äôs report and recommendations were key to the emergence of another significant Australian gender research project ‚Äì Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work and Leadership ‚Äì as it became clear that those strategies had failed to be taken up by industry nearly 10 years later. Adept at working across academic research and architectural practice, she was also known for her care and support of graduate students, and women architects in the profession more generally. In 2016, ten years after her death, she was recognised posthumously with the Australian Institute of Architects Paula Whitman Leadership in Gender Equity Prize‚Äîa prize established to acknowledge ‚Äúexceptional leadership and outstanding contribution to the advancement of gender equity in architectural practice, education and governance‚Äù.

Childhood and education  Knudsen was the son of Frederik Thomas Knudsen and Annelis Johanne Marie Lie. After finishing his training as a painter and lithograph at the Bergen Academy of Art and Design, he happened on a missionary festival on a hike through the Rhineland, thereupon taking on his missionary calling. He joined the Rhenish Missionary Society in Elberfeld- Barmen in 1836, and upon completing his training at the missionary institute was dispatched in 1841 to South West Africa to further the work of Heinrich Schmelen, who had been based at what is now Bethanie, Namibia.  In South Africa  After a short sojourn with Schmelen in Komaggas in Namaqualand (at the time called Little Namaqualand), Knudsen took his post in Bethanie in November 1842. Successful from the beginning at preaching to the local Nama people, he baptized most converts in a few months and in 1847 boasted a congregation of 760. Though he still needed an interpreter to communicate in Nama, he built enough rapport to be trusted with codifying tribal laws previously held in oral tradition to reduce arbitrary caprices in their execution. The resulting code was adopted as tribal law in October 1848. The Nama in Berseba and Rehoboth adopted the same code with amendments. Although some provisions proved unworkable, the core of the legal corpus remains in force today and provided a foundation for agreement among the three subtribes based in the above towns and for further cultural development.  In South West Africa  Knudsen traveled through the tribal territories around Bethanie and Berseba, writing their observations in diaries and reports. Although photography was unheard of in South Africa at the time, Knudsen drew and painted portraits of distinguished chieftains, scenes of village life, and ordinary Herero in Windhoek. He was the first European artist based in South West Africa. Save for a few examples, his works were published in the mission magazine and are currently displayed in the mission archives. The only works of his remaining in Southern Africa are two portraits of Khoikhoi at Stellenbosch University. Knudsen's diaries attest to his already studying in depth the language and customs of the Nama, Damara (Herero), and San peoples. His findings conflict with those of the explorer Sir James Edward Alexander, especially in the 1844-1845 entries where he claims the Nama to be descended from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. The poor attendance and transient lifestyle of his original parishioners concerned Knudsen; however, the Oorlam Nama under chief Paul Goliath eagerly recruited his ministry and he established the mission of Gudbrandsdalen to serve them in an area that reminded him of his childhood home in the eponymous region. Knudsen rebuilt in 1842 the stone cottage Schmelen had built in Bethanie in 1814 to reside until his 1834 departure, which had been razed in the interim. Still known as the Schmelen House, it has long been considered the oldest stone building in existence and the second ever built by Europeans on Namibian soil. The first, built by Wesleyan missionaries in 1806 in Warmbad, was destroyed by Jager Afrikaner, father of Jonker Afrikaner.  Travel to Europe and marriage  Knudsen took leave to Europe in June 1847, presenting on his work at missionary festivals and ultimately publishing Gross-Namaqualand(\\"Greater Namaqualand\\", Barmen, 1848). On a visit to Bergen, he married Elise Christiansen.  Return to Norway  On his return to Bethanie in 1849, he found his congregation abandoning Christianity and joining the raids of Jonker Afrikaner against the Herero. Boycotting the raids in protest, he was banished by the chief of Bethanie. Bitterly disappointed, Knudsen roamed around missions in the Northern Cape, ending up in Tulbagh in 1852. Struggling to adapt and coping with his wife becoming mentally ill, he left the ministry in 1854 and returned to Norway. There, his wife died in an asylum and made a meager living as an itinerant preacher, dying on a winter mountain hike. His two sons were adopted and raised by family.  Writings  Knudsen's first publication was Nama A.B.Z. kannis (Cape Town, 1845), a short book of prayers and readings with a glossary, English translation, and part of the catechism, the Ten Commandments, and other parts of the Holy Scriptures. Around the same time, he published an alphabet of sorts in the Nama language. Copies of both appear in the Grey collection in the National Library of South Africa Cape Town campus, complete with Knudsen's handwritten notes. The same collection includes his handwritten S√ºdafrica: Das Hottentot-Volk: Notizzen (\\"South Africa: The Khoikhoi: Notes\\"), Stoff zu einer Grammatik in der Namaquasprache (\\"Fundamentals of Grammar in the Nama Language\\"), and Namaquasprache. These cover the geography and ethnography of Great Namaqualand as well as Khoekhoe syntax. Knudsen's translation of the Gospel of Luke and the two aforementioned Cape Town publications were key sources for RMS Inspector J.C. Wallmann's Vocabular der Namaqua Sprache nebst einem Abrise der Formenlehre derselben (\\"Vocabulary of the Nama Language and Fundamentals of its Grammar,\\" Barmen, 1854). His Gospel of Luke in Khoekhoe was published in Cape Town with some hymns in 1846 after a few productive years of learning the language with the help of two Nama translators. Though slightly proofread on spelling from the earlier publications, Wallmann's copy was rendered so meticulously that it was virtually free of printing errors, and Wilhelm Bleek described it in 1858 as \\"so far the best and most reliable source on [Khoekhoe]\\". Though somewhat rigid, it rendered idioms accurately. Ironically, chief David Christiaan Goliath and the local congregational school forbade pupils from being educated in their mother tongue, opting instead to teach in Dutch, the language of the local white settlers and the Oorlam.  Assessment  He was a refined, sensitive artist and a born researcher. Though he tirelessly spread the faith to his nomadic parishioners at great difficulty, he was so temperamental and impulsive that he could not cope with the disappointments life sent his way. He lacked the practical austerity of the classic pioneer missionary in some ways, therefore.  Sources  * Evangelical Lutheran Church Complex, Bethanie.

Her practice explores aspects of the social media, photography, and the post internet. She lives and works in Taipei and New York City.  Early life and education  Chiang Yu-Yi was born in Taipei. She studied Fashion Design with a Bachelor of Arts/Science at the Shih Chien University. Since the beginning of her career, she has had a significant online presence, on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Before working as an artist, John Yuyi worked as an intern for Jason Wu, an assistant editor at a fashion magazine, and as a model.  Style   Early work  In a 2014 swimwear collection project, John Yuyi connects her fashion design education with graphic content creation. For this project, she chooses not to categorize herself purely in either mediums of fashion or photography.  Recent work  Marie Claire Taiwan describes her style as fashionably exaggerated. John Yuyi focuses on millennial culture, and utilizes the internet as a medium to increase her online presence. Her process in creating artworks is usually rather simple. In some of her works, she uses a lot of temporary body tattoos on her skin, and then documents the result. John Yuyi describes her style as fun, unpredictable, and bizarre. Regarding the strong performative action in her projects, she said that she has difficulties translating her thoughts to words. Most of her projects allow her to \\"ease [her] anxiety\\". She agreed that the products that she sells go beyond the product itself, and that they are symbols and documentations of her artistic actions. Yuyi has been invited for collaboration with international brands for creative campaigns and commercials projects such as Gucci, Nike, Maison Margiela, and Carven.  Work   Skin on Skin, 2016  Skin on Skin is a photo piece where John Yuyi pastes temporary tattoos of nude self portraits on the skin of pork cuts. John Yuyi described the art making process as \\"random‚Ä¶ tricky and fun\\", similar to her experience making an earlier piece Face Post, 2015.  GUCCI meme, 2017  In March 2017, Gucci and John Yuyi released a collaborative campaign photo series on Instagram where John Yuyi utilized her temporary tattoos in reference to the apparatus of Gucci's Instagram page. Gucci writer Samantha Culp describes the photo series \\"expanded to include 'likes', messages, avatars and logos, inking our very flesh, even temporarily, with the digital structures we inhabit and are now a part of us.\\" The collaboration caught widespread internet attention, and in an interview with BBC regarding the project, she further discusses the nuances of being an artist of the post- internet world, and also how art making helps with her anxiety and bipolar disorder.  I Tree To Call You, 2018  I Tree To Call You is a site specific installation work with temporary stickers of John Yuyi's text message conversations applied upon the leaves of a live tree. The usage of a live tree in an artificial human space reflects John Yuyi's experience engaging in the virtual world. Taipei Dangdai writes \\"the carried messages on the fallen leaves then become an aphorism in the destiny of someone else in another relationship.\\" I Tree To Call You was first shown during her Gallery Vacancy in 2018, and was later a feature installation at Taipei Dangdai in 2019.

Story The pair met and subsequently fell in love in the 1930s. They chose to elope due to their relationship being against tribal law. They spent approximately forty years living nomadically in the Gibson Desert. Attempts were made by Warri and Yatungka's tribe to find the pair but these attempts proved futile. They were left to live in the desert as they had moved into the territory of the neighbouring Budijara tribe. In 1976, local Aboriginal elders in Wiluna approached Australian explorer Stan Gratte to mount an expedition to rescue the couple. Gratte led a search with tribal elder Mudjon for the couple which managed to locate them and bring them to Wiluna where they would both die two years later. At the time, Warri and Yatungka were thought to be the last people living nomadically in the Australian desert. In reality there were several more nomadic Aboriginal people who came out of the desert after Warri and Yatungka, with the final group being the Pintupi Nine, who first contacted the western world in 1984. Legacy  Warri and Yatungka have been referred to as \\"star-crossed lovers\\" by the press, who saw their story as Romeo and Juliet-like. Peasley's The Last of the Nomads (published 1990) is an international best-selling non-fiction book that documents the life of Warri and Yatungka. In 1997, Matthew Kelley produced a documentary inspired by Peasley's book that described Peasley's journey to find Warri and Yatungka. The documentary, that shares the name of Peasley's book, received a nomination for the 1997 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Television Documentary. Warri and Yatungka's names were used by Paul Jarman as a song title for a piece he composed in 2002 to commemorate the year of the outback. The phrase \\"Last of the Nomads\\" was again used in 2007 as a monument was built in Wiluna to commemorate the life of Warri and Yatungka.

Early life and education  Wight studied painting at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (1954‚Äì57) and after a short time as a fabric designer and high school art teacher, later studied printmaking at Central School of Arts and Crafts, London (1962‚Äì63). Upon returning to Australia in 1964 she moved to Sydney, then Mittagong, New South Wales. She returned to Melbourne in 1967 to teach at the Preston Institute of Technology.  Career  Wight's initial work focused on abstract forms in fields of bright colour. In 1967, Wight's work came to the attention of Brian Finemore and John Stringer, co-curators of the seminal exhibition The Field at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968. Wight is one of three women artists to have work included in The Field, the others being Janet Dawson and Wendy Paramor. Wight was represented by a large painting in two parts hung vertically, 'Untitled' 1968 (cat. no. 74). She later had to destroy the work as it was too large and awkward to store. Wight's minimal abstraction was then largely forgotten for three decades until gallerist David Pestorius shone a light on it in the exhibitions Queensland Art 2009 and Normana Wight: Minimal Painting at his Brisbane gallery in 2009 and 2010 respectively. In 2017, Wight remade her work for The Field for the National Gallery of Victoria's exhibition 'The Field Revisited' 2018, and the remade work was acquired by the Gallery. In the early 1970s, Wight shifted focus from and began using photographic sources for her works. Whilst she had produced prints in conjunction with her abstract paintings in her earlier works, printmaking soon became her primary medium, and through her production of postcards and books she sought to challenge ideas of commodification and elitism. Between 1981-1986, Wight was printmaking lecturer at the University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba. Wight later became interested in computer-generated imagery. In 2000, she collaborated with the Victorian Tapestry Workshop on their first portrait commission, a portrait of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, AC, DBE for the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra. The image was composed by painter Christopher Pyett, adapted on computer by Wight and woven by Merrill Dumbrell. Wight has lived and worked in Brisbane since 2001, and is represented by Grahame Galleries + Editions, Brisbane.

The film stars Ajay Chourey, Shilpi Marwaha, Bilal Ahmad, and Noorjahan. It was released on 9 December 2018. This film premiered at the 24th Kolkata International Film Festival on 12 November 2018 after debuting at the Busan International Film Festival in October 2018.  Plot  Aasiya is a young trainee nurse staying in a Kashmiri village with a young daughter and an ailing mother-in-law. Her husband went missing seven years ago, and after numerous futile visits to the police station, she now wants to get on with her own life. For this she desperately needs a death certificate from the local registrar, a corrupt government official who has no qualms about exploiting women who line up outside his office every day. Rebuffed time and again, the registrar tries to force himself on Aasiya while she is on night-duty at the hospital, and gets more than what he bargained for. Set against the stunning autumn landscape of north Kashmir, the film casts many local non-professional actors who play their own role in real life. For instance, the poetic and cheerful taxi driver, Bilal, drives buses for a living.  Cast  * Shilpi Marwaha as Aasiya * Ajay Chourey as the Registrar * Bilal Ahmad the driver, as himself * Noorjahan as Aasiya's daughter  Critical response  Widow of Silence has received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The New York Times wrote that \\"‚ÄúWidow of Silence‚Äù is a movie with a cool head and a sharp eye ‚Äî one that sees greater hope in the flamboyantly jeweled tones of a carmine head scarf than in the entrenched absurdities of a broken bureaucracy. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the least compromised by sentimentality, it packs an unsettling message of empowerment very rare in the social injustice genre. Roger Ebert.com has a highly praise for the film - \\"The final four minutes turn what was already a fine picture into an unforgettable one, affirming Morchhale‚Äôs status as one of the most exciting figures of the Indian new wave.\\" Devarshi Ghosh wrote on Scroll.in that \\"Hope is a running theme in Morchhale‚Äôs films\\". According to her, \\"In Widow of Silence, Aasiya‚Äôs hope leads to a jarring poetic justice. ‚ÄúThe end signifies not just the end of the villain but also of the system‚Äù\\". Reviewing the film for the Asian Movie Pulse (AMP), Joanna KO≈ÉCZAK noted that \\"Morchhale has undoubtedly brought up important issues and gave the voice to the people of the Valley, dwelling on their suffering and sorrows without a preachy tone and exaggerated melodrama. It is very rare for Indian filmmakers to take on the Kashmiri case in such an emphatic and problem-focused manner.\\" Belgian distributor MOOOV has picked up Benelux rights from Oration Films to Praveen Morchhale‚Äôs Kashmir-set Widow Of Silence. The deal for all rights excluding airlines marks the first for the film.

ZeroRanger is a primarily a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up, with side scrolling in some levels. The player operates one of two spaceflight-capable fighter aircraft. Players unlock new weapons and abilities after defeating bosses, including the ability to transform into mechas.  Gameplay  ZeroRanger takes place on an Earth-like planet called Daikon, where aliens known as Green Orange have invaded with the intent of destroying all life. The aliens take control of Daikon's planetary defense force with the exception of two fighters. These two remaining fighters must combat their planet's possessed defense force before they can reach and destroy the main Green Orange vessel. The game has a central theme of enlightenment that is communicated to the player through riddle-like interludes.  Development  Gameplay of ZeroRanger. Development of the game started with a piece of concept art in February 2008. The game was named FINAL BOSS and revealed in November 2009. The game was later given more unique names so that the game would be easier to search for on Google; the game was first renamed to FINALBOSS, and in April 2018 it was again renamed, to ZeroRanger. The first idea during development was to create a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up like Guxt by Studio Pixel. The idea later evolved to become a mash-up of elements from many different shoot 'em up games. Taking inspiration from the limited blue and white color scheme of Guxt, ZeroRanger has a limited green and orange color scheme. The weapon collection system was at first taken from Guxt, where players can collect weapons during stages, and through trial and error evolved to the current system where two weapons are dropped by defeated bosses and players choose one of them. In 2011, the developers were particularly inspired by the \\"pure energy and spirit of adventure\\" from Eschatos. Other influences cited by the developer include Cho Ren Sha 68K, Ikaruga, and Flame Zapper Kotsujin. From Cho Ren Sha 68K, the developers tried to incorporate its \\"feeling of intimidation before you're actually facing the danger\\". In Ikaruga, \\"every enemy pattern is distinct from one another\\"; feeling the impact of this, the ZeroRanger developers aimed to minimize repetition. The release of the role-playing video game Undertale reinforced the developer's desire to make a game with a good soundtrack. Accessibility was a big goal during the last few years of development. The developers became concerned about how beginners would think about the basic concepts of shoot 'em ups. Concepts such as \\"continues\\" were tailored for players new to shoot 'em ups; continues must be earned, and players using a continue must start at a checkpoint within the stage, ensuring that they are learning how to play that part of the game. The developers believed this system caused players to feel more invested in the game and more serious about completing it. The aim was for ZeroRanger to be a very approachable \\"pick up and play\\" game, where players would not need to read guides to understand how to play the game. Scoring was a secondary goal during development. The developers did not want players to feel that they had to plan everything perfectly in order to maintain the game's combo-based score multiplier, or that there is only one correct weapon to use in each situation. The developers intended to release patches if players were to discover any issues that \\"break\\" the scoring. ZeroRanger was developed using GameMaker Studio as the game engine. Development started with GameMaker 6, then moved to GameMaker 8, and later to GameMaker Studio. Switching between these versions caused thousands of compilation errors that were time-consuming to fix. Justifying the effort, the developer cited GameMaker Studio's performance improvements and its introduction of shaders that allowed colors to be easily changed during post-processing, letting the developer make color palettes for the game without having to create new sprites for each palette. Sprites were created using Microsoft Paint. With the exception of two commissioned tracks, all of the game's music was composed by Eero Lahtinen. Sound effects were created using Sfxr, Bfxr and Audacity, as well as free sound libraries. Several music tracks and two game modes were not finished before the release of the game. The soundtrack to an earlier version of the game was released in February 2017.  Reception  Both of the reviews aggregated by Metacritic gave ZeroRanger a score of 90/100, indicating that the game was received positively, though this is inconclusive due to a low quantity of aggregated scores. Reviewers noted that ZeroRanger was densely packed with references to other shoot 'em ups while still having its own identity. Dominic Tarason of Rock, Paper, Shotgun called ZeroRanger a \\"lovingly assembled mix-tape featuring the best bits across all of shmup history\\". Marc Golding of HonestGamers called the game's green and orange color scheme a strange design choice that helped it stand out from other games in the genre; Golding also recognized the game's references to shoot 'em ups developed by Qute. ZeroRanger was praised for being relatively friendly to casual players, while still having the difficulty expected of arcade-style shoot 'em ups. According to Gabriel Jones of Cubed3, players are \\"sufficiently challenged, but never frustrated\\". Players may die often but are awarded extra lives often as well. Players can earn continues, and can start the game on any stage they have previously reached. Gabriel Jones observed that the game has a dynamic difficulty \\"rank\\" system, ensuring that players are treated to gameplay appropriate for their skill level. Flawless controls and a lack of undeserved deaths further contribute to making the game frustration-free. The response towards the game's difficulty was not universally favorable, as Miia Lyyra of V2.fi criticized ZeroRanger for not including selectable difficulty in the initial release. She warned that the difficulty is not attractive to beginner shoot 'em up players, and will leave experienced players thirsting for a greater challenge. Lyyra noted that the developers promised two more difficulty modes in a future update to the game, and suggested that beginners wait for that update. Lyyra felt that the game was otherwise perfect, and awarded it a high rating. Steven Wright of Variety placed ZeroRanger fourth on a list of the best indie games for 2018. Reviewers found themselves surprised by the deceptive length of the game.

Early life Auldearn Church Covenanters Grave, Auldearn Symbolic Panels in Auldearn Graveyard thumb|The Scottish Parliament on 8th May, 1685, have recorded the following : Our sovereign Lord, considering the obstinacy of the fanatical party who, notwithstanding all the laws formerly made against them, still keep their house and field conventicles, which are the nurseries and rendezvouses of rebellion; therefore His Majesty, with consent of Parliament, ordains that all such persons who shall hereafter preach at such house or field conventicles, also those who shall be present as hearers, shall be punished by death and confiscation of their goods. Alexander Dunbar was born about 1645, the same year as the Battle of Auldearn. He was probably son of John Dunbar, minister of Edinkillie. He graduated from King's College, Aberdeen, with an M.A. in 1661. He was a school master at Auldearn from 1666 to 1670. He became chaplain and tutor at Kilravock. Ministry Having completed his student curriculum, he was licensed by a few of the ‚Äúouted ministers,‚Äù at Edinburgh, in 1682. He was ordained before 13 July 1678. Immediately, after being licensed, he began preaching which he assiduously carried on until the beginning of 1685, when he was apprehended. The indictment, which was a somewhat serious one, charged him with ‚Äúkeeping conventicles, withdrawing from the ordinances, inculcating seditious doctrine, plotting against the Government, supplying and harbouring rebels, and other public crimes and irregularities.‚Äù When examined before a Committee of the Privy Council, at Elgin, in the beginning of the year 1685, he admitted that he had not attended the Parish Kirk and had officiated several times in private houses. He also refused to take the oath of allegiance to King James. Dunbar was, therefore, sentenced to penal servitude amid the plantations of the West being banished by the Privy Council 2 March 1685. His transportation, however, never was carried into effect. In lieu thereof, he was conveyed a prisoner to the Bass, in February 1685, where he remained one full year, after which he regained his liberty on the ground of the impaired state of his health. After the toleration On 6 July 1687 he was acknowledged by the Presbyterian ministers of Lothian at their first meeting after the Toleration. He was admitted to Auldern in 1689. Dunbar was a member of Assembly in the years 1690 and 1692. He died after an illness of three years, on 29 October 1707. Macdonald said his life and ministry in Auldearn were in thorough consistency with the testimony which he bore for the truth in imprisonment and in bonds. Sir Hugh Campbell of Cawdor refers to him in his book on the Lord's Prayer, as \\"the holy Mr Alexander Dunbar, minister of Auldearn.\\" He left 200 merks to provide silver communion cups for the parish.

These protests, without precedent since the Algerian Civil War, were peaceful and led the military to insist on Bouteflika's immediate resignation, which took place on 2 April 2019. By early May, a significant number of power- brokers close to the deposed administration, including the former president's younger brother Sa√Ød, had been arrested. The rising tensions within the Algerian regime can be traced back to the beginning of Bouteflika's rule which has been characterized by the state's monopoly on natural resources revenues used to finance the government's clientelist system and ensure its stability. The major demonstrations have taken place in the largest urban centers of Algeria from February to December 2019. Due to their significant scale, the protests attracted international media coverage and provoked reactions from several heads of states and scholarly figures.  Background   Abdelaziz Bouteflika  Abdelaziz Bouteflika, The former President of Algeria from 1999 to 2019. Abdelaziz Bouteflika had been president of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria since 1999. Two amnesties (via referendum) for former combatants in the Algerian Civil War had taken place during his presidency (1999 and 2005). A complex \\"dirty war\\" between Islamic guerrillas and the government had claimed a contested number of approximately 200,000 lives between 1991‚Äì2002. Nearly half of the Algerian population was born after the end of the conflict, amidst the din of repeated corruption scandals. With Bouteflika's accession to power in 1999, he began a diplomatic mission to rehabilitate Algeria's image abroad. He set about consolidating power, especially after his re-election in 2003. During his tenure as president, the power center in Algerian politics shifted from the east to west, most particularly to Tlemcen, where some became highly placed figures in the media, administration, and police. Roughly $10 billion of public funding flowed to the city for construction projects, including a university, hotels, museums and airports. ‚Ç¨155m was spent on a state residence, which remains incomplete. Many of the public works contracts were given to Chinese companies, by whom local contractors were allegedly not always paid. Oil-rich during the Arab Spring, the government was able to quiet dissent during the 2010‚Äì2012 protests with increased spending. University of Abou Bekr Belka√Ød in Tlemcen. The constitutional revision of 2016 limited the number of presidential terms that could be served to two, but nevertheless allowed Bouteflika to seek a fifth term, because the law was not retroactive. Since 2005, and especially after his stroke in 2013, Bouteflika's ability to govern the country was called into question: rumors of his death were frequent as he was often hospitalized, no longer spoke and made very few written statements. In this context, some Algerians considered his announced candidacy for the presidential election, originally scheduled for 18 April 2019, 4 July 2019 or 2020, to be humiliating.  Corruption  Members of Bouteflika's administration have been accused of engaging in corrupt practices in several instances. In 2010, Sonatrach, the state-owned oil and gas company, suspended all of its senior management after two of the company's vice-presidents were imprisoned for corruption. Algeria's Energy Minister Chakib Khelil announced that the president of the company and several executives have been placed under judicial supervision. In 2013, Khelil was also accused of receiving a bribe from a subsidiary of the Italian energy company Eni. According to El Watan, overbilling for public works and misleading descriptions of imported goods are two common corrupt practices, facilitated by cronyism at the highest levels. On 26 June 2018, Bouteflika dismissed Abdelghani Hamel as head of the national police (DGSN), despite the latter being part of his inner circle. This news came after one of Hamel's drivers had become a suspect in Cocainegate, which led a general of the gendarmerie, four judges and two public prosecutors to be tried for bribery. Monumentalism Djamaa el Djaza√Ør, a large mosque under construction in Algiers, is nicknamed the Great Mosque of Bouteflika. Its minaret is 55m higher than the Hassan II Mosque in Morocco. Though its construction was touted as an Algerian job-creater, immigrant workers did most of the work for China State Construction Engineering while living in prefab shantytowns around the construction site. The project still came in 2.5 times over-budget. The cost of the mosque's construction has been estimated to be between $1.4 and $2 billion. A doctor quoted in Le Monde complained that \\"with $4 billion [sic], 200 hospitals could have been built.\\" Converting the mosque into a hospital has been suggested. For the Algerian press, it became a symbol of the mismanagement of public funds and of the \\"capricious megalomania\\" of the former President. Broadly, cumulative grievances and aspirations were at the heart of the protest movement. Decade-long economic stagnation, unemployment, labour market segmentation, and chronic corruption fueled discontent. Plummeting oil and gas prices weakened the regime's capacity to continue buying off some sections of the lower classes and youth, and to contain discontent.  Timeline   Early days  In December 2018, calls for demonstrations in the neighborhood of Bab El Oued against the fifth term went unheeded, except by the police, which mobilized a significant dissuasive force. Algiers Central Post Office. The protests were at first, following the 10 February formal announcement of Bouteflika's candidacy, limited geographically to northern Algeria. The first major demonstration took place on 16 February 2019 in Kherrata, at the eastern end of the wilaya of Bejaia in the Kabylie region, after the distribution in Kherrata and its surrounding villages of posters calling for \\"a peaceful march against the fifth term and against the existing system\\" on that date. In Khenchela, on 19 February, a giant poster of the President of the Republic was torn down from city hall and trampled. Two days later, another suffered a similar fate in Annaba. This form of protest was related to the recent practice of offering gifts to a framed portrait of Bouteflika in the latter's absence.  Week 1: 22‚Äì28 February  22 February 2019 in Algiers Protests were organized via social media in major and mid-sized cities on 22 February. Those in Algiers‚Äîwhere street protests had been illegal since a demonstration on 14 June 2001, \\"when hundreds of thousands of demonstrators from Kabylie converged on the capital\\"‚Äîwere the biggest in nearly 18 years. Smaller protests, with slogans like \\"There is no president, there's a poster,\\" had been taking place in Algiers since 11 February. On 22 February, the portrait of the President was torn down from the landmark central post office. There are no official government numbers published, but one expert put the number of demonstrators at 800,000 on 22 February 2019. Regularly hospitalized for \\"periodic medical examinations\\", Abdelaziz Bouteflika was admitted to the University Hospital of Geneva (Switzerland) on 24 February 2019. Another large-scale demonstration took place on 24 February at the call of the Mouwatana movement (\\"citizenship\\"), On 28 February, a dozen journalists were arrested during protests against press censorship.

Manifestation contre le 5e mandat de Bouteflika (Batna).jpg|Protesters in Batna. Three million people were estimated to have demonstrated on 1 March 2019, though no official figures were given. The private channel Dza√Ør News reported that one million people demonstrated across Algeria on 1 March, which was also the first time state television broadcast images of the protests. 183 people were injured and Hassan Benkhedda, son of former interim government president, Benyoucef Benkhedda, died of a heart attack. Speaking as Interior Minister, Noureddine Bedoui confirmed that it was related to police action against \\"thugs unrelated to the protestors.\\" On 2 March 2019, Abdelaziz Bouteflika replaced his campaign director, the former prime minister Abdelmalek Sellal, who had actively campaigned for the President since 2004, by the virtually unknown , a career provincial administrator. Considered to be a response to the ongoing protests, this dismissal followed the disclosure of a recording between Sellal and Ali Haddad in which the former is heard making threats. The deadline for submitting candidatures for the presidential election was 3 March 2019. The idea of postponing the election was put forward. On 3 March, the candidacy of Bouteflika was filed by his campaign director, though the law stipulates that the candidate must be physically present for this process. Another signed message announced that if re-elected, a national conference would be convened to adopt reforms as well as a new Constitution ‚Äì to be approved by referendum ‚Äì and that he would not take part in the next presidential election which he promised would be held early. After the confirmation of Bouteflika's candidacy on Sunday, 3 March, and the withdrawal of several opposition candidates, including Ali Benflis and Louisa Hanoune, an anonymous call to strike was made the next day, as well as a call to protest on 8 March. 1 March 2019 in Algiers Even before the candidacy was formalized, tens of thousands of protesters were out on the streets. From Sunday night to Monday morning, hundreds of protesters marched peacefully, calling his candidacy a \\"provocation\\", an \\"insult\\" and a \\"masquerade\\". The next day, many students boycotted their classes. The opposition, meeting at the headquarters of the Justice and Development Front, called for candidates to withdraw from the election. On the same day, following the example of the resignation the day before of Khaled Tazaghart, an elected representative (d√©put√©) from the El Moustakbal party, & former minister Sid Ahmed Ferroukhi (FLN), resigned from the party. Zahir Kherraz, FLN mayor of Oued Amizour, also said he did not support a fifth term. Amar Benadouda (1931), doyen of the mayors of the country, resigned from the town hall of Guenzet. On Tuesday, protests and student strikes continued, thousands were in the streets of Algiers, Constantine, Oran, Annaba, Bejaia, Tizi Ouzou, Bouira, Blida, Setif, or Tlemcen. On Thursday, a thousand lawyers demonstrated in Algiers. The \\"Pacifist and Civilized Walkers' 18 Commandments\\", written by , were widely circulated on social media prior to the 8 March demonstration.  Week 3: 8‚Äì14 March  In reaction to the Friday demonstrations, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research moved the spring university holidays forward to the next day (10 March) and extended them by two weeks in an effort to calm matters down. On 10 March, the Army Chief of Staff Ahmed Gaid Salah, close to Bouteflika, gave a speech to officer cadets saying the \\"army and the people had a common vision of the future\\". This speech was front-page news in El Khabar. A 5-day general strike was begun the same day. The day after the announcement that Bouteflika would not seek a new term, that Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui had replaced Ahmed Ouyahia as prime minister, and that the presidential election was to be postposed sine die, university students protested for the third consecutive Tuesday across the country chanting \\"No Tricks, Bouteflika.\\" On Wednesday, teachers protested. On Thursday, lawyers and judges were on the streets in several cities. On 14 March, Djamila Bouhired encouraged the younger generation demonstrating, saying: \\"Your elders liberated Algeria from colonial domination, and you are giving back to Algerians their liberties and their pride despoiled since independence\\" The protests on 15 March were estimated to have been larger than those the previous Friday. The Guardian reported that hundreds of thousands were in the streets, La Croix put the number at over a million. Protesters carried a banner criticizing France's comments that the cancellation of elections should lead to a \\"transition of reasonable length\\" saying, \\"It's the people who decide, not France!\\". Other signs included \\"Macron, deal with your yellow vests\\" and \\"Elys√©e, stop! It's 2019, not 1830.\\" Manifestation contre le 5e mandat de Bouteflika (Blida).jpg|Protesters in Blida (March 10). Manifestation d'Alg√©riens √† Montr√©al 2019.jpg|Protesters in Montreal Canada (March 10).  Week 4: 15‚Äì21 March  On 16 March, twenty women created the group Femmes alg√©riennes pour un changement vers l‚Äô√©galit√© (FACE), calling for full equality between men and women, proposing the creation of a regular feminist square in front of Algiers 1 University and calling for equal representation of men and women in citizens' initiatives resulting from the Hirak protests. On 17 March, the newly appointed Prime Minister announced the intention of forming a government of politically unaffiliated experts, which would \\"reflect the demographics of the Algerian society\\". Students were again in the streets on Tuesday, 18 March demanding that Bouteflika step down by the end of his term (28 April). The army chief of staff said that the army needed to deal with the crisis.  Week 5: 22‚Äì28 March  On 26 March, in a speech given in Ouargla and covered live on Algerian television, Ahmed Gaid Salah urged the Constitutional Council to declare Bouteflika unfit. The Council began deliberations the same day. When the sitting president is removed, the president of the Council of the Nation‚Äîat the time Abdelkader Bensalah‚Äîbecomes acting president for a maximum of 90 days while elections are organized. On 27 March, Ahmed Ouyahia called on Bouteflika to resign. The same day the Workers' Party announced the resignation of their elected members of the People's National Assembly.  Week 6: 29 March‚Äì4 April  On Friday 29 March, the Algerian authorities denied Reuters' reports that there were a million protesters in the capital, but did not put forward numbers of their own. Bouteflika named a new government on 31 March 2019 two days before his resignation. Investigations were opened into a dozen oligarchs who were prevented from leaving the country. Ali Haddads resignation from the FCE‚Äîan employers federation, which had seen a wave of recent resignations over his remarks about the protests‚Äîand his subsequent arrest at the Tunisian border were widely reported. Bouteflika made a statement promising to step down by the end of his term, but equivocating as to the actual date. The following day, the Army Chief of Staff (who had been appointed by Bouteflika to replace General Mohammed Lamari after his 2004 election) insisted both privately and publicly that he resign immediately, which he did. As provided for under Article 102 of the Algerian Constitution, Abdelkader Bensalah became acting interim President. His term can last for a maximum of 90 days while a presidential election is held. By law, he cannot participate in this election. James McDougall wrote that the military had \\"recognized that radical measures were needed to save the system.\\" Though it had regained some power at the expense of the \\"clan\\" centered around Sa√Ød Bouteflika‚Äîincluding the Armed Forces chief of staff‚ÄîMcDougall added that \\"[s]ome observers and activists believe that the army as an institution now wants to stay out of politics and might even support the \\"clean-up\\" of corruption that protesters demand.\\"  Week 7: 5‚Äì11 April  The streets were again exuberant and crowded with hundreds of thousands on Friday 5 April, with marchers carrying signs demanding further resignations, specifically mentioning the 3B: Noureddine Bedoui (prime minister), Abdelkader Bensalah (who was officially appointed acting interim president on 9 April), and Tayeb Belaiz (head of the constitutional council); as well as the Army Chief of Staff. Tear gas and a water cannon were used repeatedly to prevent more than a thousand students chanting \\"Silmiya, Silmiya\\" (peaceful, peaceful) from going through the Tunnel des Facult√©s in Algiers on the 8th successive Tuesday of student demonstrations.  Week 8: 12‚Äì18 April  The Friday protests, of the same size as previous weeks, were more conflictual, with police blocking access to the city and parts of the city. On 16 April, the president of the constitutional council, Tayed Belaiz‚Äîone of the three Bs whose ouster protesters sought‚Äîinformed the council that he had submitted his resignation.  Week 9: 19‚Äì25 April  The size of the protests on 19 April was similar to previous weeks. Ennahar TV reported that five billionaires were arrested on 22 April 2019: four brothers from the Kouninef family, close to Sa√Ød Bouteflika, and Issad Rebrab, the CEO of Cevital. The head of Cevital's communications department denied the reports. A judge also called in the former prime minister and the current finance minister for questioning.  Week 10: 26 April-2 May  On Friday 26, thousands of protesters gathered in Algiers for the tenth week despite attempts by the authorities to close all entrances to the capital. Banners auch as \\"The system must go\\" and \\"We are fed up with you,\\" were raised in city centre. Earlier, Algeria's richest businessman and three other billionaires were arrested in an on-going investigation on the grounds of corruption.  Week 11: 3‚Äì9 May  10 May 2019 in Bejaia Province For the eleventh consecutive week, tens of thousands of people, according to al-Jazeera, demonstrated on Friday 3 May and raised banners that read: \\"You must go\\" and \\"Thieves you have destroyed the country\\". Protesters also continued to insist on the peaceful character of their demonstrations, chanting \\"Peaceful, peaceful,\\" while marching in central Algiers. It was also reported that the power broker military chief Ahmed Gaid Salah called for \\"dialogue\\", but the president of Rally for Youth Action, a civil society organisation, expressed his refusal to negotiate with \\"symbols of the old system.\\" 7 June 2019: Demonstrators from the Aures 9 June 2019 in the town of B√©ja√Øa On Saturday 4 May, the former president's younger brother, Sa√Ød Bouteflika, was arrested along with former secret service head General Mohamed Mediene (\\"Toufik\\") and intelligence chief (\\"Bachir\\"). Berber flag banned from demonstrations  June 2019  On 19 June 2019, Lieutenant general Salah reiterated that no flags other than the \\"national emblem\\" would be tolerated during demonstrations. In so doing, he was targeting the Amazigh flag, a frequently-seen flyer during the Hirak (movement). 17 March 2019: Demonstration at Ohio Statehouse (Columbus)  July 2019  On 17 July, Abderrahmane Arrar, President of the Civil Forum for Change (FCPC), proposed a committee of former politicians, lawyers and human rights activists with reputations for neutrality, without political ambitions, who would mediate decision-making for organising a presidential election and a political transition. The aim was to first obtain wide consensus on the list of mediators.  September 2019  On 15 September, the government announced a presidential election to take place on 12 December. Demonstrations continued, calling for Ahmed Ga√Ød Salah and other members of the former Bouteflika governmental clique to resign. The authorities blocked road entries to the capital Algiers and arrested prominent protestors in preparation for the following Friday. Protestors called for a general strike each Tuesday starting 24 September. Protests continued for the 31st Friday on 20 September, with two thousand protesting in B√©ja√Øa and two thousand in Bou√Øra, calling for Salah to resign, for the peaceful revolution to continue, and stating that it would be better to go to prison than to vote in the 12 December 2019 presidential election. Detentions of prominent opposition members around 20 September included that of barrister Abdelhak Mellah from Boumerd√®s, who supports boycotting the 12 December presidential election; Karim Tabbou; Samir Belarbi; Fodil Boumala, accused of \\"attacking the integrity of national territory\\" and \\"attacking national unity\\"; Lakhdar Bourega√¢; and 77-year old Garidi Hamidi, an \\"icon\\" of the protest movement.  November 2019  On 1 November, the metro was shut down in Algiers and trains into the city were canceled as a result of a social media campaign calling for demonstrations. Police roadblocks also caused traffic jams. For the 37th weekly Friday protest, which coincided with the celebration of the 65th anniversary of the start of the Algerian War for independence from France, tens of thousands of demonstrators called for all members of the system of power in place to be dismissed and for a radical change in the political system. They rejected the 12 December election, with slogans describing it as \\"an election with the gangs\\" and as an \\"election organised by a corrupt power [which] is a trap for idiots\\" (). On 15 November, the 39th successive Friday of protests included objections to the 12 December presidential election and calls for arrested protestors to be freed. On 17 November, the day that the presidential election candidates opened their campaigns, protestors objecting to the election, perceiving it as a continuation of the same group of people retaining political power, posted sacks of garbage on panels allocated for presidential candidates' campaign posters. Protestor Smain described the symbolism by stating that the election \\"is completely rejected ... as garbage\\".  December 2019  On 6 December, crowds in Algiers, Constantine, Oran, and in Kabylie were massive, calling for a boycott of the elections scheduled for the following week and for a general strike starting on 8 December. The presidential election was held on 12 December 2019, despite wide popular opposition, with a turnout of 8% according to the Rally for Culture and Democracy or 39.88% officially, with Abdelmadjid Tebboune officially elected in the first round with 58.13% of the valid votes. During the three days around the election, 11‚Äì13 December 1200 protestors were detained by the authorities according to the CNLD. Later in December, the CNLD estimated that according to its records, 180 prisoners of conscience remained in prison, either under remand or serving sentences.  January 2020  Demonstrators in Berlin, Germany, 19 January 2020 In the first week of January 2020, the new president elected in the mostly boycotted election, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, appointed Abdelaziz Djerad as prime minister and the rest of his cabinet mostly consisting of ministers of the previous government under Bensalah as acting president and Ahmed Gaid Salah as de facto leader of Algeria. On 2 January, 76 prisoners of conscience detained because of their protest actions were released, some of them conditionally. Protests continued. On 15 January, 13 detainees held in since 1 March 2019 started a hunger strike, with the aim of getting a fair trial. Their cases had rested frozen for 10 months and their court appearances were scheduled for 16 March 2020. In the 17 January Hirak protest marches, twenty of the first protestors to arrive in the morning were arrested in Algiers. , (RAJ) estimated that a total of at least 100 Hirak prisoners of conscience were being held in Algerian prisons, while the CNLD estimated that 120 or more Hirak prisoners remained under detention.  February 2020  In early February, close to the anniversary of the first protests on 16 and 22 February 2019, President Tebboune signed a decree pardoning several thousand prisoners, who were released from jail, but the Hirak protest prisoners of conscience were not included in the pardon.  March 2020  On March 20, 2020, Algerian protesters heeded a presidential order over the coronavirus, and the pleas of some of their own leaders, by not staging their weekly demonstration against the ruling elite on Friday for the first time in over a year. Leading supporters of the protest movement, including imprisoned activist Karim Tabbou, human rights lawyer Mustafa Bouchachi and former minister Abdelaziz Rahabi, had urged the protesters to suspend their marches.  April 2020  Abdallah Benadouda, an Algerian exile in the US with experience in Algerian public radio and private television (Dza√Ør TV), started Radio Corona International April 21, 2020 to keep the Hirak flame alive during the lockdown. Benadouda encourages comparison to pirate radio in Europe in the 1970s and has discussed government crackdown on journalists (Khaled Draini) and opposition figures (Karim Tabbou).  October 2020  On 5 October, Algerian protesters marked the 32nd anniversary of a pro-democracy movement, with hundreds of protesters gathering in the streets of the capital, Algiers. On 9 October, following the rape and killing of a teenage girl, protests erupted in several cities across Algeria, decrying gender-based violence. The body of Cha√Øma, 19, was said to have been discovered in an abandoned petrol station in Thenia, 50 miles east of Algiers, earlier in the month. Cha√Øma‚Äôs family revealed that she went missing after going out for a walk to pay her phone bill, and was subsequently stabbed, raped and allegedly burnt alive. A constitutional referendum had previously been announced in July that was to be held in November as a result of the protests earlier in the year, but critics said it fails to address popular concerns of overreach by the government. Context Protesters These are the largest protests in Algeria since 2001. The demonstrators are primarily young people who did not experience the \\"Black Decade\\". One observer lauded the millennials' reappropriation of corporate branding to their own uses, as well as their respect for their living space through peaceful demonstrations, saying: Women's active role in the protests was credited with minimizing violence, and marked a sharp contrast with the 1988 protests predominantly led by salafists. An old mother of five unemployed children told the BBC: \\"There's nothing for the young generation,\\" she said. \\"No jobs and no houses. They can't get married. We want this whole system to go.\\" Demonstrations also took place abroad, particularly in France, where 10,000 demonstrated in Paris on 8 March. Manifestation_d'Alg√©riens_√†_Montr√©al_2019.jpg|Demonstrators in Montr√©al (March 10). Anti-Bouteflika_Paris_2019.jpg|Demonstrators, Place de la R√©publique, Paris (March 17).  Goals  Originally the protesters wanted Abdelaziz Bouteflika to withdraw his candidacy for a fifth term and wanted Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia to step down. More generally, they called for massive housecleaning from the government of the ruling clans, known collectively as le pouvoir (\\"the power\\"). In conjunction with the president's withdrawal, the protesters called more and more for democracy, liberties and the rule of law, goals which many protests argue are unrealized and which continue to attract Algerians into the street.  Slogans, songs and symbols  Some slogans referred to the incumbent president as \\"the Moroccan\\" because of his birthplace and his reputed membership in a shadowy second Oudja Clan. Others, such as \\"bring back the commandos of the army and the BIS, there will be no fifth term\\" alluded to the baltaguias. By April, common slogans, placards, chants and hashtags included: \\"Leave means Leave\\" and \\"Throw them all out\\". Protesters in the capital chanted: \\"Bouteflika get out, and take Gaid Salah with you.\\" Songs such as \\"Lib√©rer l'Alg√©rie\\", written by artists supporting the movement, \\"All√¥ le syst√®me!\\" by Raja Meziane and \\"La libert√©\\" by Soolking, became hits with the protesters upon their release. Yetnahaw Gaa !, often written Yetnahaw ga3 !, or, in Algerian Arabic, (Ÿäÿ™ŸÜÿ≠ÿßŸà ⁄®ÿßÿπ), means \\"they should all go\\" and became a rallying cry after Bouteflika renounced his run for a fifth term. Cachir, an emblematic Algerian sausage, was brandished and tossed around during demonstrations as a reminder of the 2014 elections when the press reported that Bouteflika's re-election committee was increasing attendance at their meetings by handing out free sandwiches filled with the sausage. In the protestor's eyes, cachir had become a \\"symbol of corruption and of the 'buying of votes and souls.'\\" The Algerians have also employed humour and comedy to express dissent and discontent. Algerian activist Hamza Hamouchene captured the following on his iPhone: \\"Algeria, country of heroes that is ruled by zeros\\", \\"System change ... 99 percent loading\\", \\"We need Detol to kill 99.99 percent of the gang\\" [referring to members of the regime] And this one from a medical student: \\"We are vaccinated and we have developed anti-system IgGs (antibodies) ... and we keep getting boosters every Friday\\" \\"The problem is the persistence of idolatry and not the replacement of the idol\\" Some slogans were directly targeting French complicity and interferences: \\"France is scared that if Algeria takes its independence it would ask for compensation for the metal it used to build the Eiffel tower\\" \\"Allo Allo Macron, the grandchildren of November '54 are back\\" In reaction to calls by Gaid Salah to apply article 102 of the constitution, so the leader of the upper house would take over with elections to be held 90 days after the presidency is declared vacant by the constitutional council, people replied: \\"We want the application of article 2019 ... You are all going\\" \\"We asked for the departure of the whole gang, not the promotion of some of its members\\" \\"Batteries are dead so no need to squeeze them\\" \\"Dear system, you are a piece of s*** and I can prove it mathematically\\" \\"Here Algeria: the voice of the people. The number 102 is no longer in service. Please call people's service at 07\\" (in reference to article 07 stipulating that the people are the source of all sovereignty). In Bordj Bou Arr√©ridj, a city 200 km east of the capital Algiers, every Friday protesters have been hanging a new tifo since the fifth Friday. Displayed on an unfinished building renamed \\"The People's Palace\\", the banners bear cartoons and slogans, and as more Algerians from other cities have been pouring in every Friday the town has been named \\"The Capital of the Hirak\\" (The capital of the popular movement). The idea of the tifos is borrowed from the ultras groups which, according to sociologist Mark Doidge, were political protests in the 1960s and 1970s Italy.  Rioting  Although the rallies were generally peaceful, some vehicles were burned and shops were vandalized in the evening of demonstrations. On 1 March, clashes took place between the police and groups of young people throwing stones at them. 41 arrests were recorded on 23 February and 45 on 1 March including five men caught trying to haul away a safe. The police reported that \\"the majority of the people arrested were under the influence of psychotropic or hallucinogenic substances\\".  Media coverage  Until 1 March 2019, public television, radio, and press totally ignored the demonstrations, while private television channels linked to power dealt with them in a limited way. A boycott campaign was launched against the media. The editor-in-chief of , Meriem Abdou, resigned on 23 February as a protest against the treatment of the movement on the government-run radio station. Several journalists were arrested. A hundred journalists and the NGO Reporters Without Borders publicly denounced the censorship practiced by the Algerian executive. When state TV channels did begin mentioning the protests, they were critical of the protesters and did not refer to their motives. In contrast, the private print media and news sites reported widely on events from the beginning. Despite the opening of the audiovisual media to competition in 2011, off-shore channels can be shut down at any time because of their precarious legal status. One foreign media outlet, Al Jazeera, has been banned from Algeria since 2004. On 4 March, Nadia Madassi, Canal Alg√©rie's nightly news anchor for the past 15 years, resigned because she had been required to read a letter attributed to the president on the air. On 5 March, Echorouk and El Bilad were sanctioned by the Ministries of Communication for having covered the demonstrations, and were cut off from advertising by the ANEP (national publishing and advertising agency).  Results  Alliances of citizens' groups and dialogue Women created the feminist collective Femmes alg√©riennes pour un changement vers l'√©galit√© on 16 March 2019, which pioneered the feminist square in the Friday Algiers protests to strengthen the political role of women in the protests. Citizens' associations and individuals created the Dynamiques de la soci√©t√© civile alliance on 15 June, which was later joined by trade unions, with the aim of coordinating proposals to reorganise the political structure of the Algerian state. On 26 June, political parties and the created the Forces of the Democratic Alternative alliance with similar aims, including the organising of a constituent assembly for a new political system with an independent judiciary. On 6 July, the Forum civil pour le changement, created on 9 March 2019 by 70 citizens' groups and led by Abderrahmane Arara, and the Forces du changement held a conference at which they proposed the creation of a panel to dialogue with the government and in favour of the holding of a presidential election. The 13-person dialogue panel, the Instance nationale de dialogue et de m√©diation, was created and led by . The dialogue panel and the holding of the election were widely criticised by the protestors and by the Forces of the Democratic Alternative, who stated that the arrests of protestors for political reasons and the lack of basic conditions of democracy were conditions unsuitable for an election. Citizens' groups to monitor the detentions of protest participants and call for their release were formed. The Network for fighting against repression was created on 1 June 2019 to call for the release of prisoners including Louisa Hanoune, the first woman to run for President of Algeria, and Hadj Ghermoul, a member of the . The National Committee for the Liberation of Detainees (CNLD) was created on 26 August 2019. In late December, several weeks after the presidential election won by Abdelmadjid Tebboune, the CNLD had documentation of 180 \\"Hirak\\" prisoners under remand or sentenced, and saw \\"no sign\\" of the government ceasing its frequent arrests of the protestors. On 25 January 2020, 400 people from various political parties and citizens' associations participated in Algiers in a meeting organised by Forces of the Democratic Alternative. The conclusion of the meeting was to hold another meeting to organise the detailed methods and rules for implementing a democratic transition during which existing \\"illegitimate\\" institutions would be dismantled and for organising a constituent assembly. Governmental institutions On 11 March, it was announced that President Bouteflika would not seek re-election; that Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia had resigned and been replaced by Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui; and that the April 2019 presidential election was postponed indefinitely. Inquiries were announced into \\"corruption and illicit overseas capital transfers\\" on 1 April 2019. Ali Haddad was arrested trying to cross the border into Tunisia after liquidating stock worth ‚Ç¨38m. On the same day, Bouteflika promised to step down by the end of his term on 28 April. On 2 April 2019, Bouteflika resigned as president, after being pressured by the military to step down immediately. Under Article 102 of the Algerian Constitution, he was succeeded as interim President by the President of the Council of the Nation, Abdelkader Bensalah, who was ineligible to run in the election for a successor, which according to law had to be held in the next 90 days. The presidential election was finally held on 12 December 2019, despite wide popular opposition. The Rally for Culture and Democracy estimated the turnout in the election at 8% of the eligible electorate, interpreting the low turnout as a result of wide rejection of the election. The official turnout was 39.88%, with Abdelmadjid Tebboune officially elected in the first round with 58.13% of the valid votes, leaving it unnecessary to hold a second round of the election.  Constitutional amendment  On May 7, 2020, the preliminary draft of the constitutional amendment was published. It provides for the replacement of the post of First Minister by Head of Government, responsible to the Assembly, which can overthrow it by a motion of censure, the possibility for the President of the Republic to appoint a vice-president, the replacement of the Constitutional Council by a Constitutional Court, the retention of the limit on the number of presidential mandates to two, consecutive or not, or the limitation of the mandate of deputy to one re- election. In addition, the Hirak is inscribed in the preamble of the Constitution and the army is authorized to participate in theaters of operation abroad. Finally, the National Independent Election Authority (ANIE) is constitutionalised, the presidential third of the Council of Nation is abolished and the possibility of legislating by ordinance during parliamentary recess is abrogated. On September 8, 2020, the final draft of the constitutional amendment was published. It revokes both of the vice-president post and the abolition of the presidential third of the Council of Nation.  Influence  The weekend after Bouteflika stepped down, protestors in Sudan called upon the army to take their side against sitting president Omar al- Bashir. Despite the state of emergency and the emergency courts the President created to treat the protests, demonstrators staged a sit-in in the public space outside the Khartoum headquarters of the Armed Forces.  Commentary  Demonstrator wrapped in the Algerian flag. On 28 February 2019, the economist Omar Benderra asserted that a deep separation exists between civil society and the Algerian government, which outlawed street protests twenty years ago, and which he wrote is controlled by \\"warlords\\". Public opinion, Benderra continues, is suspicious of official government communication and has also begun to show signs of frustration with spiritual leaders urging the people to stay off the streets. In Le Figaro on 1 March 2019, the Algerian writer Boualem Sansal said: \\"Such demonstrations in all the cities of the country and even in the capital, not far from El Mouradia (the district of the presidential palace), the Tagarins (the district of the Ministry of Defense), of Alger Centre (the district of the palace of the government), is an unbearable humiliation for the president, his brothers, his army, his police, his deputies, his senators, his oligarchs, his officials, his extra militias, in short, the \\"revolutionary family\\" (that's the name they give themselves), whom no one has ever disrespected without paying for it with his life.\\" Writing on openDemocracy, Hamza Hamouchene, a founder of the London-based Algeria Solidarity Campaign, summed up his view of the context of the revolt: Fahad Nabeel from the Centre of Strategic and Contemporary Research was less optimistic about the movement's success, suggesting that either the pouvoir or the military would consolidate control. \\"The protests did emerge in part in response to elements of Algerian social life,\\" wrote Amir Mohamed Aziz, \\"but they need to be situated in a broader context of African, Mediterranean and transnational political-economic dynamics.\\" Algerian journalist Ghada Hamrouche doubted whether it was even possible to hold elections as promised by the interim president. Hamrouche considered elections within the current constitutional set up a diversion. Army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah and \\"the ruling class,\\" she wrote, \\"are counting on the lure of elections to divide and weaken protesters' calls for a transition outside the framework of a constitution that keeps the regime in the driver's seat.\\" Ahmad Al-Sholi thinks that the Algerian regime is very entrenched and enjoys a good leverage generated by the revenues of the oil industry, a 'surplus' with which it could \\"co-opt large swaths of the population and oppositional forces. Despite the plummeting oil prices in the world market, the regime argues Al-Sholi, could attract foreign investment and still refill its coffers. On the other hand, although the Algerians showed an impressive energy and perseverance in mobilisation, \\"it would be a mistake to expect hundreds of thousands of people to show up to protest indefinitely.\\" Reactions National * : On 5 March, the (the powerful organization of veterans of the Algerian War of Independence) announced by press release that they supported the demonstrations, lamenting \\"the collusion between both influential parties in the seat of power and unscrupulous businessmen who have profited illicitly from public money\\". International International reactions were cautious: most countries and international organizations remained silent until 5 March. * : The European Commission called for respect for the rule of law, including freedom of expression and assembly. * : The US State Department issued a statement saying that the country \\"supports the Algerian people and their right to demonstrate peacefully.\\" * : Speaking in Djibouti on 12 March, French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Bouteflika's decision not to seek reelection and applauded the Algerian government's plan for a constitutional conference validated by a popular referendum after a \\"transition of reasonable length.\\" * : Newly- appointed deputy prime minister Ramtane Lamamra began a diplomatic tour in Moscow, where he met with Sergei Lavrov, who said in a joint press conference on 19 March that \\"Moscow does not meddle in the internal affairs of Algeria\\", adding that it was \\"up to the Algerian people to determine their destiny on the basis of their constitution and international laws.\\" *: Although Tunisia's president Beji Caid Essebsi has stated that the Algerian people are \\"free to express themselves on their own governance as they wish\\", no further comment regarding Tunisia's government's stance on the events was made. Demonstrations were organized on March 9 during which Tunisian civilians showed their solidarity to their Algerian counterparts. *: Given the tense relations between Algeria and Morocco, the Moroccan government has not issued any official statement regarding the protests. *: The Council President Giuseppe Conte advises listening to \\"requests for change from civil society\\" and believes that \\"Algeria will be able to guarantee a democratic and inclusive process with respect for its people and for its own benefit\\".

Khalid is one of a generation of artists from Pakistan who have transformed the tradition of miniature painting into an internationally celebrated form of contemporary art. In recent years, Khalid‚Äôs practice has extended to significantly larger paintings, murals and installations. She is a member of what has come to be called the Pakistani 'neo-miniature' school. Biography Khalid graduated from the National College of Arts, Lahore in 1993 and completed her post-graduate degree Fine Art degree from Rijksakademie, Amsterdam in 2003. Khalid was schooled in classical miniature painting and has become a leading figure in developing the contemporary miniature. She has described her two-year fellowship at the Rijksakademie as a real learning experience, due to the culture shocks she encountered. She has described how the reaction from audiences in Amsterdam to her miniatures differed compared to reactions in Pakistan: > My miniatures were considered beautiful and exotic but beyond that the > viewers could not read anything significant in them. They would ask me, is > it about religion, ethnicity or typical oriental traditions? It was > surprising to discover the difference in perception, in Pakistan my > miniature was labeled as unconventional and modern while western audiences > considered them archaic. As a result, her experience in Amsterdam led her to change her style and adopt more contemporary mediums to make her work more accessible to her hosts.  Work  Khalid works with paintings, murals, video, installations, and textile works. She was initially trained as a traditional miniaturist, and is known for reviving old techniques in contemporary ways.  Themes  Many of Khalid's works deal with the theme of gender. Her work has been described as having a 'feminine sensibility', coming partly from references to traditionally feminine crafts such as textiles and needlework. This comes both from her use of textiles in her work, but also from her focus on repeated geometric patterns, taken from traditional Islamic patterns, combined with floral motifs. In keeping with the theme of gender, she has also made repeated use of the theme of the covered or uncovered female figure, using motifs such as curtains, burqas, and flowers. This theme took on a new dimension after her fellowship at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, where she encountered familiar patterns of male dominance and female submissiveness, but with new dimensions. Her flower and curtain symbols took on new meanings: the red-light district, for example, had different types of curtains, drawn to indicate the conduct of business. After 9/11, a new political dimension appeared in her work. Conversation, for example, is a video installation made during Khalid's time at the Rijksakademie. The work was about her response to the violence inflicted on Afghanistan in the name of counter-terrorism. Throughout the work, a rose is slowly embroidered by a brown-skinned hand, while at the same time another rose is unpicked, removed, and subsequently erased by a white hand using a needle. Awards Khalid received the Alice Award (artist book category) in 2012, and was a finalist for the Jameel Art Prize in 2011, winning the People‚Äôs Choice Award in 2011. She is among a handful of Pakistani artists who have had solo shows of their work, including 'Two worlds as one' Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen (2016); Garden of ideas, Aga Khan Museum, Toronto (2014); Larger Than Life, Whitworth Art Gallery, United Kingdom (2012); Larger Than Life, Corvi-Mora, London (2012); Pattern to Follow, Chawkandi Art, Karachi (2010); Conversations, Pump House Gallery, London (2008).

Approved on 5 February 2019, through its seven chapters and thirty-nine articles, Also at Asamblea Nacional the Transition Statute \\"governs the installation of a provisional Government and the convocation of free elections\\", and \\"establishes the election of new rectors of the National Electoral Council, new magistrates of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice and new representatives of the Citizen Power.\\" It also establishes that ‚Äì in the absence of a constitutionally elected president ‚Äì the National Assembly President is the Acting President of Venezuela. According to constitutional law professor Juan Manuel Raffalli, the Transition Statute \\"establish[es] rules that organize the process of restoration of constitutional order that (...) was broken on 10 January 2019\\", referencing the date of the second inauguration of Nicol√°s Maduro which led to the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis. According to El Universal, the Statute \\"rescues\\" the electoral process with the aim of free elections. It also establishes budgetary and financial governance with respect to CITGO and PDVSA, and the use and recovery of these petroleum industry assets. The pro-Maduro Supreme Tribunal did not recognize the Transition Statute and declared it void. Purpose Raffalli states that the National Assembly and the Transition Statute declare that Nicol√°s Maduro has occupied the Presidency since 10 January \\"without having submitted to a legitimate electoral process\\". Article 333 of the Constitution of Venezuela calls for citizens to restore and enforce the constitution if it is not followed; Juan Guaid√≥ and the National Assembly argue that a transitional government must restore Venezuela's rule of law and hold democratic elections, but Raffalli explains that Article 333 \\"does not contain specific details\\" about how to \\"restore the constitutional order\\", and that the statute was formulated \\"to give a rational order to the process of political transition to which [Article 333's] content refers\\". According to Raffalli, \\"the Statute clearly states that the rescue of popular sovereignty and the restoration of constitutional order will be definitively achieved by holding free, authentic, transparent, competitive and fair presidential elections. It provides that these elections be convened within 30 days after the date on which the usurpation [of the presidency] ceases, and will be made as soon as technically possible, but within a maximum period of 12 months.\\" ‚Äì National Assembly deputy representing Carabobo state and president of the Commission for the Defense of the Constitution ‚Äì drafted the statute. He says the statute \\"establishes the legal framework for action of the Acting President and the National Assembly to enable the rescue of the rule of law\\", and that the purpose of the statute \\"is to legally frame the transition process within the 1999 Constitution\\". He explained that the statute allows the National Assembly to advance towards elections even with Maduro present, stating that \\"... some actions that can be carried out while the usurpation exists, and others are reserved for when the usurpation ceases.\\" Articles 6 and 20 provide for the National Assembly to advance electoral processes while a provisional government is formed, and until a new National Electoral Council can hold full elections. Transition to elections Matheus explains in an article for Tal Cual entitled \\"12 questions and answers on the Statute that governs the transition to democracy\\" () how the Transition Statute provide for ultimately restoring constitutional order and naming a President of the Republic in free elections. He says the purpose of the statute is laid out in Article 2 as the three steps towards restoration of democracy: 1) end the usurpation of the office of the presidency, 2) form a provisional government, and 3) hold free elections. Article 3 aims to reverse the \\"complex humanitarian crisis\\" by restoring constitutional order. Articles 8‚Äì12 hold that there has not been a legitimate president elected to the 2019‚Äì2025 term, nullify all acts of Nicol√°s Maduro since 10 January, and provides for the end of duty for public officials and members of the Armed Forces to obey Maduro. Article 13 states that the National Assembly's constitutional term ends on 4 January 2021. Article 14 defines the office of acting president and its timing, in accordance with Article 233 of the Venezuelan Constitution, as the President of the National Assembly. He writes, until \\"the usurpation ceases, Juan Guaid√≥ is simultaneously President of the National Assembly and Acting President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\\"; the \\"thirty days begin within which Juan Guaid√≥ must be separated from the Presidency of the National Assembly to exercise only and exclusively as Acting President (...) and proceed to adopt the necessary measures for the realization of free and competitive elections. During these thirty days the deputy Juan Guaid√≥ will be replaced by the vice- presidents of the National Assembly, in accordance with the Internal Regulation and Debates.\\" Article 26 defines a provisional president; after the 30-day period of Article 233 has passed \\"without it being possible to hold free and competitive elections, the National Assembly may ratify the acting President as provisional President (...) for the purpose of forming a government of national unity until free elections are held and there is a President-elect who can complete the 2019‚Äì2025 period\\". Then elections must be held within at most twelve months or the shortest possible time allowed by technical conditions. The person elected will be sworn in as soon as possible, and serve the remainder of the 2019‚Äì2025 term.  Other provisions  The Transition Statute establishes budgetary and financial governance for CITGO and PDVSA, and the use and recovery of these petroleum industry assets. It authorizes the National Assembly to \\"appoint the directors of the state-run PDVSA petroleum company and its affiliates [and] control recovered assets\\".

She is a graduate from the Department of Fine Arts at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Her art explores the relationship with the urban environment, domestic space, and impact of condition.

Ko has exhibited at the Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA) Art Museum in Beijing, 8th Vladivostok Biennale of Visual Arts, Para Site in Hong Kong, and the Art Museum of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, amongst other locations.  Biography  She graduated from Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2009. Ko works as an art teacher on a part-time basis to support herself.

In her solo exhibition, Underground Construction: Failed at Edouard Malingue Gallery in 2015, Ko looks at the future of the high-speed railway connecting Hong Kong to Mainland China and explores the personal repercussions of this major development project. She has commented that she is not convinced of the economic value of the rail project and believes it to be part of a plan to assimilate Hong Kong into China. ‚ÄúThe government is abusing popular imagination. It makes something look nice on the surface ‚Äì in this case, the railway link ‚Äì and tries to convince everyone it is good for Hong Kong,‚Äù she told South China Morning Post. Artsy editors have said of the exhibition: \\"For Ko, contemporary urban life is pervaded by disappointment and alienation as much as it is by expectation and hope for a sense of belonging.\\" Ko has rejected the label of a \\"political artist\\", as she believes her work should be about inner processes rather than political and social commentaries, but admits that the line is blurry.

She was one of the pioneers of conceptual photography in Hong Kong, experimenting with Photoshop to create composite photographs that were reminiscent of oil paintings. Her work has been collected by the Hong Kong Heritage Museum and M+ Museum. Holly Lee has worked as a professional photographer since 1980. She was one of the founders of Dislocation, a monthly photography journal in Hong Kong active from 1992 to 1998. In 1997, she re-located from Hong Kong to Toronto, Canada where she and Lee Ka Sing, an artist-photographer, set up INDEXG (a gallery and art studio space). The duo now publishes online on a weekly periodical, Double Double by Ocean Pounds.  Career  In her first photography series, Pictures of My Friends, Artists and Others, Holly Lee photographed many artists and creatives in Hong Kong including Antonio Mak and Ann Hui. She was inspired by the portraits by Richard Avedon, which she described as \\"naked and intense\\". This series of black-and-white portraits featured the subject in the foreground against a white background. Holly Lee is best known for her works in the Hollian Thesaurus project. The project consists of twelve portraits created between 1994 and 2000, contemplating and exploring a period of change in Hong Kong leading up to the handover of Hong Kong. Lee explores themes of East and West cultural dialogues and identities, often juxtaposing historical and contemporary elements. Using digital manipulation, Lee combined photographs, sourced imagery and 19th-century export painting from Guangdong to create the Hollian Thesaurus portraits. The portraits are reminiscent of Renaissance oil paintings‚ÄîLee added fine lines to mimic the cracks in old oil paintings, creating an air of nostalgia. Her most recognised portrait, The Great Pageant Show, presents a Miss Hong Kong beauty pageant winner in the style of Queen Elizabeth II presented in front of a Qing court painting.

It was one of the many \\"kinship wars\\" (Heimosodat) fought by the newly independent Finland during the Russian Civil War. Although both expeditions were unsuccessful, Petsamo was handed over by Russia to Finland in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu.  The expeditions  The goal of these raiders was to take Petsamo for Finland, which had previously been promised to Finland by Tsar Alexander II in 1864, in exchange for land around the Sestra River on the Karelian Isthmus transferred to Russia to build a weapon factory. The Bolsheviks were opposed to fulfill the Russian Tsar's earlier promises, which contributed to a deterioration in relations between the newly independent Finland and the recently formed Soviet Union. The 1918-expedition, still during the First World War, was composed of about 100 men and was led by doctors Thorsten Renvall and Onni Laitinen. They were opposed by the British Navy, who wanted to prevent the German Army from following in the wake. The British sent HMS Cochrane with naval Infantry and 40 Red Army soldiers. After some fighting, the expedition had to return without reaching its destination. The 1920-expedition, some 60 men headed first by General Kurt Martti Wallenius and then by Major Gustaf Taucher, met with resistance from Soviet troops, and also returned without accomplishing its goals.  Aftermath  In the Treaty of Tartu, signed on 14 October 1920, Petsamo was handed over by Russia to Finland and became the Petsamo Province.

She is known for her research-based projects, which blends art with science.  Early life and education  Wong was born in Hong Kong in 1983 and raised in the New Territories, a rural region of Hong Hong. She received a BA from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and an MFA from Yale University, where she studied closely with Jessica Stockholder and Jim Hodges. She currently teaches New Media and Film at the State University of New York at Purchase.  Key concepts  Wong Kit Yi works through the mediums of video, sculpture, and performance. Exploring biological answers to metaphysical questions, she deals with odd scientific findings and the dysfunctional relationships between what is considered science and pseudoscience. Her interests include genetics, DNA technology, mythology, Japanese manga, models of ownership/leasing, trade history and the biology of aging and immortality. Wong investigates the dynamics of ownership, working with such ideas as patron collaboration, and the 99-year leases for her artworks. Her recent films are structured in the artist's signature karaoke- inspired sing-along format, switching between documentary and music-video- style content.

She is considered as \\"Turkey's first woman illustrator.\\" Bozcalƒ± is known for her portraits, landscapes, still lifes, as well as her illustrations that circulated in advertising, publishing, and through major institutions such as banks and government departments. Her work gained more visibility after she worked as one of the main illustrators of ƒ∞stanbul Ansiklopedisi, a major encyclopedic work on Istanbul culture, written by historian Re≈üad Ekrem Ko√ßu. In 2015‚Äì16, Istanbul- and Ankara-based research institution SALT organized a major exhibition focusing on her practice. SALT currently holds her personal archive, which includes images of her sketches, portrait and landscape paintings, as well as her design work.  Education  She started painting at a very early age. At the age of five, she began getting tutored by Ali Sami Boyar who was a painter and a museum director. She started studying abroad at 1919. She worked at studios of prominent artists of the early 20th century‚Äîwith Lovis Corinth in Berlin between 1918‚Äì20, with Moritz Heymann and Karl Caspar in Munich between 1921‚Äì24, with Feyhaman Duran and Namik Ismail in Istanbul between 1928‚Äì29, with Paul Signac in Paris between 1930‚Äì33, and with Giorgio de Chirico in Rome between 1947‚Äì49. Between 1928‚Äì29, she also attended the State Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul. Giorgio de Chirico described her as \\"talented, having sensibility that painting requires, and entirely dedicated [‚Ä¶] to difficult working conditions of this profession.\\"  Works  In the late 1930s and early 1940s, she participated in the government program called \\"Yurt Gezileri,\\" which aimed to document the process of modernization in Turkey. She was the first woman to participate in this program. She was sent to Zonguldak, a city in northern Turkey, to document industrial developments in the country and focused on painting factories. In the early 1950s, she started working as an illustrator for several newspapers, such as Milliyet, Yeni Sabah, Herg√ºn, Havadis, Cumhuriyet, and Terc√ºman. She also worked with institutions such as Yapi Kredi Bank and Inhisarlar Idaresi (Directorate of Monopolies) that changed its name to TEKEL in 1946. Between 1953‚Äì72, she illustrated nineteen books, including Osman Gazi‚Äôden Atat√ºrk‚Äôe (1953), Daƒülar Kralƒ± Bal√ßƒ±klƒ± Ethem (1955), The Turkish Twins (1956), Anadolu Evliyalarƒ± (1958), Eski ƒ∞stanbul Yosmalarƒ± (1959),Topkapƒ± Sarayƒ±, Osmanlƒ± Padi≈üahlarƒ±, Tarihimizde Kahramanlar (1960), Forsa Halil, Erkek Kƒ±zlar, Daƒü Padi≈üahlarƒ± (1962), Ha≈ümetli Yosmalar (1963); T√ºrk Zaferleri, Yeni√ßeriler (1964), La Fontaine Masallarƒ±, Patrona Halil (1967), Kabak√ßƒ± Mustafa (1968), T√ºrk Giyim Ku≈üam ve S√ºsleme S√∂zl√ºƒü√º (1969), and K√∂sem Sultan (1972).

O. Hill and R. Adamson thumb|The Scottish Parliament on 8th May, 1685, have recorded the following : Our sovereign Lord, considering the obstinacy of the fanatical party who, notwithstanding all the laws formerly made against them, still keep their house and field conventicles, which are the nurseries and rendezvouses of rebellion; therefore His Majesty, with consent of Parliament, ordains that all such persons who shall hereafter preach at such house or field conventicles, also those who shall be present as hearers, shall be punished by death and confiscation of their goods. James Fithie was a chaplain at Trinity Hospital in Edinburgh. He was imprisoned on the Bass Rock for about a year between 1685 and 1686. Early Life James Fithie graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an MA on 9 July 1656. He was made a prisoner for holding conventicles, and ordered to be liberated from the Edinburgh Tolbooth 4 July 1679. Fithie was chaplain of Trinity Hospital, Edinburgh, a situation to which he was elected by the Town Council on 20 January 1671. He had attended his own parish church, and received baptism for his children from the regular incumbent of the parish. But his sympathies being on the side of the persecuted Presbyterians, he had given evidence of this in several ways, and on various occasions. On this account he was apprehended, and lay in one of the jails of Edinburgh for some time previous to July 1679, when he was released. He was again arrested about the beginning of the year 1685, and imprisoned in the Bass in April. He was allowed liberty to walk on the rock, with an allowance of eightpence a day, on account of his poverty, by an order of 19 September 1685. Release He made a petition to the Council after his wife became sick and some of his children died. He was released in March 1686 by an order of the Council, in consideration of his own ill health, and the afflicted condition of his family. After he was set free he had to periodically reappear before the Council to retain his liberty.He was admitted to Peebles 17 November 1687. He died 25 December 1689, aged about 53. Other names Wodrow, in his History, (vol. iii. p. 151,) calls him by mistake \\" James Forthie.\\" This has led Dr Crichton, in his list of the Bass prisoners annexed to his Memoirs of Mr John Blackadder, erroneously to suppose that the person whom Wodrow calls in that place \\" James Forthie,\\" is different from \\" James Futhy,\\" whose imprisonment in the Bass in 1685, is recorded by that historian in vol iv. p. 215. It is the same person who is spoken of in both places. Crichton is also mistaken in representing \\"James Forthie\\", or more correctly \\"James Fithie\\", as imprisoned in the Bass in 1679. That he was not imprisoned there at that time, is evident from what is stated in M'Crie's Appendix, No. I. pg 379. Porteous calls him James Fithy. Family He married Elizabeth Reid, who survived him, and had children: Elizabeth, served heir 3 November 1691 (married, pro. 20 November 1691, John Elliot, writer, Edinburgh: Edin.

It aimed to be integrated into Finland, but no such arrangements were made and it collapsed less than a year after its formation. It only ever controlled a small northern part of the region, which gave it its name of the Republic of North Ingria.  Prelude  After the Great Northern War ended in 1821, Russia acquired the large region of Ingria. There were a large number of Ingrian Finns in the region, and by 1917 there were more than 140,000. However, tensions were high under the Bolshevik rule. Following the October Revolution in St Petersburg, the Grand Duchy of Finland had immediately began preparing to declare its independence. On December 6, 1917, the Senate adopted the Declaration of Independence by a vote of 100 to 88. This, combined with the Estonian War of Independence, inspired many Ingrians to thoughts of rebellion.  Rebellion  alt= Despite the complaints of many cautious Ingrian leaders such as Kaapri Tunny who said such an action could \\"lead to disaster\\", Colonel Georg Elfengren and his North Ingrian Regiment crossed the border from Finland into North Ingria on June 27, 1919 and occupied the villages of Kirjasalo, Mikkulainen, Lembolovo and Vaskelovo. He was soon defeated by red forces and forced to retreat back across the border. However, in September he crossed back over again and occupied the same villages. After being defeated yet again, Georg decided to instead retreat to Kirjasalo and proclaimed the Republic of North Ingria, also known as the Republic of Kirjasalo after its capital. The new country had a population of roughly 15,000 and an area of 30 km2 (12 sq. miles). It also printed stamps to give the state legitimacy and a source of revenue. Elfengren became chairman, a post he kept until May. He was surprised to find that a large proportion of the populace were passive towards his cause, and did not support him as actively as they could. This seriously hindered Elfengren's efforts.  Collapse  Finland had not offered significant support over the year to the rebellion, not wanting to sabotage its peace negotiations with the RSFSR. When it signed the Treaty of Tartu with the Soviets, part of the treaty was the handover of Kirjasalo. The North Ingrian regiment crossed the border into Finland to be disarmed, and Elfengren soon resigned from his station in the Finnish military to fight with the White Russians in Crimea. Villagers evacuated Kirjalaso, and red forces moved into the four villages controlled by the Republic and retook them.  Aftermath  It is thought that a small number of the North Ingrians involved with the rebellion never reached Finland, and decades later appeals were put out in newspapers asking after them. Due to the policy of national delimitation in the Soviet Union, the area was given a certain degree of autonomy until 1939, when that was abolished and the area was joined to Pargolovo District.

It aims to offer support to survivors of abuse suffered at various institutions. Providing the abuse occurred at an institution that has opted into the scheme, survivors may apply to receive monetary compensation and/or psychological counselling. According to an ABC report, some 60,000 survivors might be eligible. Procedure and compensation Survivors of child sexual abuse are invited to call NRS to request an application form be mailed to their nominated address or they can create a myGov account to complete the form on-line. The applicant is required to fill-in details of the assault, the assailant(s), and the institution(s).National Redress Scheme, Application for Redress form, Question 44 A further one-and-a-half-page space is allotted to ‚Äúdescribe the impact of sexual abuse across your life‚Äù. National Redress Scheme, Application for Redress form, Question 58 The process does not involve face-to-face assessment meetings. Victims of child sexual abuse who are currently in jail are not eligible to apply. According to the NRS website, payments range between less than $10,000 to $150,000, and earlier payments related to abuse are deducted from that sum. Applicants may be eligible for free counselling Participating institutions In order for an applicant to receive compensation for abuse that happened while they were at an institution, that institution must have opted to join the NRS. Applicants are able to search for participating institutions on the NRS website. By late February, 2019, many institutions had still not joined the scheme. In response, the Department of Social Services released a list of 100 institutions that had not signed up.  Catholic Church participation  There has been confusion over the Catholic Church‚Äôs participation in the scheme. Although they were one of the first to announce they would join, they announced in December 2018 that they would not, and it was left up to individual organisations within the Catholic Church to decide if they wish to participate. Of the Department of Social Services‚Äô list of 100 institutions yet to join the scheme, most are Catholic institutions. Criticism of NRS The National Redress Scheme has attracted criticism from abuse survivors, survivor advocate groups, lawyers, representatives of the Anglican Church, and politicians. Much of this criticism has focused on the ‚Äòmatrix‚Äô used by the scheme to calculate compensation. Whereas the Royal Commission's recommended matrix was based on a 100 point system - 40 points for the abuse severity, 40 for impact, and 20 for institutional factors - to determine payments up to a maximum of $200 000, the Guardian reported that: ‚ÄúThe national scheme ...imposes a hierarchy of abuse in which claimants who suffered penetrative abuse (level 1) are the only survivors who can possibly be granted the maximum payment of $150,000. Even in these cases, the amount reduces to $100,000 (or less) unless there were additional ‚Äúextreme circumstances‚Äù, such as institutional vulnerability and related non-sexual abuse.\\" For those survivors who suffered non-penetrative sexual abuse (which may include oral sex), the maximum payout under the scheme is $50 000, regardless of the number of times they were abused, the number of institutions in which they were abused, or the impact of the abuse. Tasmania's Anglican Bishop, Richard Condie said: \\"There certainly won't be many people that qualify for the $150,000 because of the way the matrix is constructed.‚Äù Lawyer, Dr Judy Courtin described the matrix as ‚Äúgrossly unfair and not based on evidence\\". In her Guardian article, Courtin gave the example of a child who was sexually exploited by a priest on a more-or-less weekly basis for five to six years: ‚ÄúThis abuse also involved physical and psychological abuse. This man, who has attempted suicide on several occasions, has alcohol abuse problems, cannot study or work and lives alone. Because the priest did not ‚Äúpenetrate‚Äù this boy, the maximum amount he can be awarded by the redress scheme is $50,000.\\" By comparison, Rebel Wilson was awarded $650 000 by the Victorian supreme court for \\"hurt and distress\\" after a jury found \\"Bauer Media had defamed her in a series of magazine articles that said she had lied about her age, real name and childhood\\". The ABC reported that details of the NRS matrix were not made public until after the bill had passed both houses of Parliament. West Australian Greens Senator, Rachel Siewert, said: \\"Many times people asked for the matrix, to be able to see it, to be able to understand the basis on which these decisions were made, but that was not available at the time we voted on the bill.\\"' Bishop Condie said the Anglican Church tried unsuccessfully to get the Federal Government to make changes to the matrix: \\"We also wrote expressing our dismay about this to the department and also to the Prime Minister (but) we were told right from the beginning that it was a non-negotiable part of the deal.\\" In The Herald, survivor and barrister James Miller called for ‚Äúurgent reforms, including changes to a controversial assessment ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù linking financial payouts to types of abuse‚Äù, which he claimed ran contrary to the Royal Commission recommendation for assessment to be calculated according to severity and impact.  Response to criticism  Regarding criticism of lowering the maximum compensation to $150 000, The Catholic Weekly responded: ‚ÄúIn truth, if the Commonwealth government had agreed to the $200,000 recommendation, the Church would have stood ready to meet this obligation too. But the government didn‚Äôt, because ‚Äì however distasteful it sounds ‚Äì the government needs to take into consideration the affordability of the scheme. To do otherwise could lead to unfairness for some survivors.‚Äù In terms of projected compensation payouts, it's estimated that 62% of the estimated 60,000 survivors experienced their abuse in Catholic institutions. The Anglican Church is second with 14.7%, followed by The Salvation Army with 7.3%. The Catholic Weekly likened survivor advocates to the character in the Jim Carey movie, ‚ÄòLiar Liar‚Äô. It added: ‚ÄúDespite the countless lawyer jokes that treat ‚Äòlawyer‚Äô and ‚Äòliar‚Äô as synonymous, lawyers have a duty to not mislead or misrepresent.‚Äù The article concludes: ‚ÄúThose who criticise the Church in relation to redress are obviously free to do so ‚Ä¶ But those criticisms should be based on facts, not just for fair treatment of the Church, but because it does survivors no favours if ‚Äì even when significant progress on redress is made, as happened this week ‚Äì they are told by those supposed to be their ‚Äòadvocates‚Äô that once again they should be disappointed.‚Äù References Category:Government of Australia Category:Child sexual abuse in Australia ","title":"National Redress Scheme"},{"id":"60180502","text":"Dinello or DiNello is a surname.

Debussy wrote the first and third songs in 1898 and finished the second in 1908. He premiered the piece in 1909 and Trois Chansons is his only composition for unaccompanied choir. History Using the poetry of medieval poet Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans, the first and third songs were revised from an earlier version composed in 1898 for a choir belonging to his friend Lucien Fontaine. He finished the second song in 1908 and the completed Trois Chansons was published by Auguste Durand the same year. The first performance was in March 1909 with eight singers from the Engel-Bathori choir. The following month, he conducted the piece at Concerts Colonne along with his composition La Damoiselle √©lue. Dying nine years after the premiere of Trois Chansons, it is his only composition for unaccompanied choir. Texts and music All songs are scored for a four- part unaccompanied mixed chorus, except for Quand j'ai ouy le tambourin sonner, which is set for alto soloist and alto-tenor-bass. His choice of Renaissance song techniques and use of romantic texts from the past was a neoclassical trend at the time of composition. The Renaissance devices he integrated into this twentieth-century composition includes the modality and equal-voice polyphony. Each piece is in ternary form, the beginning of each is repeated at the end and features Debussy's signature use of non-functional dominant seventh chords and half-diminished seventh chords (functioning as an incomplete dominant ninth). The poetry is set in ballade form, consisting of three or four stanzas and a refrain. There is an unchanging meter and equal number of syllables in each piece. Thematically, the poems are unrelated. I. Dieu! qu'il la fait bon regarder! The key signature features five sharps, normally indicating a B major or G-sharp minor scale. However, due to Debussy's oscillating harmonies between F-sharp major and C-sharp minor, the music is in neither key. Debussy asserts the tonic is F-sharp and the minor dominant is C-sharp, with the Mixolydian mode beginning on F-sharp. The poem is a lovers expression for his mistress. II. Quand j'ai ouy le tambourin sonner The key is F-sharp minor with the dominant chords inflections being largely based on an Aeolian mode. The tempo gives the feeling of a romantic dance piece. The alto-soloist is singing about how they would \\"rather stay warm in bed while everyone else is out enjoying May-time celebrations\\" while the other three voices mimic the percussion sound of a tambourin. The speaker in the poem is presumably male, so there is a mystery in the differences of the published edition assigning the solo to a contralto, whereas the manuscript designates it for tenor. III. Yver, vous n'estes qu'un villain The key signature is E-minor. The poem is a denunciation of winter's harsh cold and the musical mode is Mixolydian.

Through a labour-intensive re-working of materials and objects, she explores ideas of belonging, cultural heritage, identity, decoration and failure. Her work uses a variety of mediums including ceramics, drawings, video, photography and installation.  Early life and education  Bing√∂l was born in G√∂rele, Turkey, and raised in Ankara. She received a PhD in Ceramics from Hacettepe University in 2008. She also studied music at Ankara State Conservatory (1985-91) and photography at The New School in New York (2008-9). Following her academic career, she began to focus on \\"rethinking the Ottoman ceramic heritage and completely devoted herself to its practice.\\"  Works and special projects   Broken II (2013)  The artist's \\"Broken\\" series uses ceramics to transform the products of mistakes, accidents, and even disasters, into products of success. Her second work in the series, Broken II (2013) entered the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York in 2016. The work, composed of a three-dimensional square panel composed of irregularly broken pieces of stonepaste, includes a video of objects such as bottles and tiles violently dashed on the floor, which were later reassembled and decorated by the artist with colourful flower patterns connecting to centuries of traditional ceramics from the Islamic world. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, \\"This method of deconstructing a traditional Turkish art form or medium ‚Äì then reassembling it into a contemporary object calls both to the artistic Ottoman and Islamic heritage and questions the idea of \\"what is art?\\"\\" is Bing√∂l‚Äôs response to Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs concept of ready-made art.  Seyir (2014)  Seyir, a large-scale ceramic work replicating the front of a truck, is an example of the way Bingol \\"strips objects of their original identity and function.\\" Using traditional tile motifs, the work was made from terracotta with the moulds of an asphalt-pouring truck in Istanbul.  Lady Dior (2018)  In 2018, Bing√∂l was among eleven women artists invited by the fashion house Dior to reinterpret the Lady Dior bag as part of the brand's Lady Dior Art Project.  Exhibitions and Accolades  Bing√∂l has participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions in Turkey and overseas. In 2004 she was a guest artist in the Second International Contemporary Ceramic Sessions in Buenos Aires and Obera. In 2006, Bing√∂l produced a solo exhibition ‚ÄúSyste- matic‚Äù at the end of an artist residency at Hunter College in New York.

It was founded in 2007 and is run by a board of trustees.  About  Its main objective, stated in its governing document, is \\"to relieve, either individually or generally, persons who are in conditions of need, hardship or distress on a National basis‚Äù. The Homeless Foundation believes that a safe and secure home is a fundamental human need and the personal foundation from which people can build an independent life and fulfil their true potential. It does this via providing advice, move-on accommodation and move-in grants. In addition, it also works with a number of partners across the Midlands including St Paul‚Äôs, YMCA Worcestershire, and St Basil‚Äôs. Since 2015, it has also provided a target information programme and assistance for 18-25 year olds and has also developed a schools programme to provide education on homelessness. Official figures from the UK Government, via coordinated street counts of rough sleepers conducted in autumn 2018, revealed there were 420 rough sleepers across the West Midlands, up from 289 in 2016.  Move-on accommodation  The Homeless Foundation tackles homelessness in a number of ways, but one of the main issues is the lack of ‚Äòmove-on accommodation‚Äô for individuals to make a transition to independent living. ‚ÄòMove-on accommodation‚Äô in the form of shared housing or apartments enables individuals to gain important life skills, have the support of trained resettlement advisors, and secure confidence and the means to secure accommodation. The Homeless Foundation provides grants from its own funds to assist with ‚Äòmove-on accommodation‚Äô and has helped more than 150 people from this scheme, with 85 per cent of those no longer categorised as homeless. The shortage of affordable accommodation is recognised as one of the biggest challenges nationally, with Homeless Link noting 30 per cent of its clients were unable to do so. This has been acknowledged as a major issue by the UK government in solving homelessness. In August 2018 it announced a ¬£50 million Move On Fund package until 2020/21 as part of its Rough Sleeping Strategy.  Move in grants  The Homeless Foundation offers grants of up to ¬£250 for people living in Worcestershire and who are moving from hostels or resettlement houses into their own independent tenancies to provide essentials that will ensure the success of the move. Working with referral organisations, on average, seven single people each month move on from homelessness into their own secure homes.  Campaigns   Hi Homie  The Homeless Foundation established the HiHomie campaign in 2015, specifically to provide advice to young people (16-25 year olds) in Worcestershire regarding homelessness. The campaign adopted a turtle as its logo ‚Äì based not only its resilience but the fact that with its shell it is never without a home.  iKozie mini-home  In 2017, the Homeless Foundation had the UK‚Äôs first iKozie built and delivered to a property in Worcestershire. The iKozie is a purpose-built property just 186 square feet in size that provides move-on accommodation. It was designed by Kieran O‚ÄôDonnell, a trustee of the Homeless Foundation, and Andrew Eastabrook of Eastabrook Architects. The design was to enable the micro-home to be constructed offsite and lifted into place. The micro-home was described by O‚ÄôDonnell as a potential solution to the housing and homeless crisis in the UK. The UK‚Äôs first iKozie micro-home was designed as a ‚Äòmove-on‚Äô home and was in the garden of the Homeless Foundation, on 29 August 2017.  Financial information  The charity does not actively fundraise to support its activities. It secures funding via rents on its charitable properties and one investment property and direct donations. In its most recent accounts (financial year end 30 November 2017), it had an income of ¬£59,521 and spending of ¬£40,879.

It offers its passengers panoramic views of the Alzette River valley. The Pfaffenthal elevator, together with the Grund public elevator, and the Pfaffenthal- Kirchberg funicular, form Luxembourg City's three cable transport modes connecting its elevated city with city quarters located in the Alzette and Petrusse river valleys. History Background In 2006, Luxembourg City planners, noting the city's topography of plateaus and deep gorges, began exploring the possibility of a mechanical link to facilitate greater pedestrian and bicycle mobility between the historical city-centre, Ville Haute, on the Luxembourg plateau, and the Luxembourg City quarter of Pfaffenthal in the Alzette valley. Additionally, such a link would increase tourist footfall to Pfaffenthal and complement the existing public elevator connecting Ville Haute to the Luxembourg City quarter of Grund, to the South of Pfaffenthal. This would promote the use of various city walking and bike trails, businesses in the quarter, and improve accessibility to Luxembourg City's UNESCO World Heritage former fortifications, including, amongst others, the B√©inchen (de) ‚Äî a 17th century, Vauban-designed fortified bridge over the Alzette River. A 2007 study considered various options, including a funicular, escalators and aerial cable cars before settling on an elevator. The primary reasons for this choice included building costs, maintenance costs, spatial constraints imposed by the existing street layout in Pfaffenthal, and the need to not encroach on designated UNESCO World Heritage sites. Construction Funding of 7,573,950 euros was approved for the project by the Luxembourg City Communal Council on 16 February 2009, with the ground-breaking ceremony being held on 10 December of that year. Construction was delayed for four years due to geological issues in securing the hillside cutting. On 2 June 2014, municipal legislators decided to allocate an additional 2,959,564 euros of funding for the elevator's construction. The enclosed footbridge connecting the elevator shaft to Pescatore Foundation Park was constructed between May and September 2015. The elevator cabin arrived for installation on 3 March 2016. Separate to the elevator's construction budget, on 26 January 2015 a tranche of approximately 1 million euros was approved by the Luxembourg City Communal Council for landscaping and renovation of the Pescatore Foundation Park for the elevator's arrival. This included the construction of a 220 m long bicycle path leading from Boulevard Robert Schuman, immediately prior to the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, to the footbridge of the Pfaffenthal elevator. Inauguration The elevator was opened to the public following an official inauguration ceremony on 22 July 2016. In its first year of operation, the Pfaffenthal Panoramic Elevator is estimated to have carried more than 33,000 persons. In December 2017, Lydie Polfer, Mayor of Luxembourg City, announced a desire for the construction of a third public elevator in the city, between the Petrusse Valley and Ville Haute, modelled on the success of the Grund and Pfaffenthal elevators. Design Main Structure The main vertical structure consists of a 74.77 m tall, 2.6 m wide, 2.6 m deep hollow tower constructed out of reinforced concrete, which contains the elevator counterweight. The valley facing side of the tower acts as the backing for the 60 m tall elevator shaft, open on its face and nearly completely open on its sides, topped by a protrusion encasing the elevator machine room. Vertical steel guide rails for the elevator are attached to the main tower via horizontal steel braces at 5 m intervals along the height of the elevator shaft. The tower is set into a 20 m deep, 28 m high and 13 m wide cutting in the Cote d'Eich hillside. To stabilise the terrain, the excavated cutting is lined with sprayed concrete, secured by 72 anchor bolts driven as far as 30 m deep into the hillside, with a 16 m high reinforced concrete retaining wall at its base . The top of the elevator shaft is connected to a small reinforced concrete enclosed entrance located in Pescatore Park in Ville Haute via a 72.27 m long, 3 m wide and 3 m tall enclosed steel through-truss footbridge. The bridge passes over the Cote d'Eich road, carved into the hillside. The sides of the enclosed footbridge are lined with a thin wire mesh. The footbridge, being placed laterally to the elevator shaft, protrudes 9 m beyond it over the Alzette valley. At the end of the bridge, large glass floor-to-ceiling panels on its sides and face and a small sheet of glass flooring enable its use as a panoramic observation platform. Finally, the whole combined structure is reinforced via a 618 mm diameter diagonal steel cylindrical strut embedded in the hillside which intersects the tower and footbridge. Cabin and technical details The elevator cabin is 2.3 m wide and 3.7 m deep. The front of the cabin consists of a 1.65 m deep panoramic section, with glass face, sides, floor and ceiling, offering passengers panoramic views during their journey. To the rear of the cabin, on both sides is a set of 1.6 m wide 2.1 m tall automatic sliding doors, with the North facing door providing access to the footbridge, and the South facing door used for accessing Pfaffenthal. The stainless steel floor at the rear of the cabin prevents erosion during winter from salt grit brought in on the feet of passengers, and excess liquid exits the cabin through drains hidden in the door mechanism. Technicians designed the cabin to be able to load and unload pedestrians and dismounted cyclists at rate of 1.5 and 4 seconds respectively. The cabin travels the 60 m height at a maximum speed of 2.5 m/s with each journey lasting 30 seconds. The maximum time for passengers awaiting a lift is 153 seconds. The cabin weighs 8.5 tonnes and is designed to carry a maximum payload of 5 tonnes. This equates to a maximum theoretical capacity of 66 pedestrians. However, the cabin was designed to comfortably accommodate a much more modest mixed load of 5 cyclists and 10 pedestrians per journey, with the total time needed to load, descend/ascend and unload such a payload only taking 94 seconds. Traction power for the elevator is provided by a 75 kW gearless motor, itself weighing 7.6 tonnes, housed in protruding motor room at the top of the tower. The motor operates at over 75% efficiency and can act as a generator able to inject approximately 50 kW back into the energy grid during light ascents or heavy descents. The traction cables are made out of steel which has been galvanised for outdoor use. Due to the elevator's open exposure to the elements, technicians decided to supply power to the cabin via the steel rail elevator guides, rather than using a wired connection. This powers, amongst other services, the cabin lighting, the onboard information screen, and anti-condensation heating for the glass panels. Meteorological sensors continuously monitor wind strength and guide the elevator to a particular level and immobilize it if conditions are unfavourable. In the case of serious mechanical issues, resulting in the elevator becoming stranded, a rescue platform, with its own independent power supply and motor is stored at the top of the elevator shaft, hidden by the main motor housing. Approaches The Pfaffenthal level entrance to the elevator is located at the end of rue Pont. Here, two public toilets, installed in the pavilion at the base of the tower where the elevator docks, a Vel'Oh! bicycle rental station with five bicycles, and a single disabled parking space can be found. Located a short walk from the elevator's lower entrance across the Alzette River on the opposite side of the valley is Pfaffenthal-Kirchberg railway station and funicular, opened on 10 December 2017. At the top of the elevator, the enclosed footbridge leads out into Pescatore Foundation Park, located at the intersection of the Boulevard Robert Schuman and Avenue de la Porte Neuve, and is connected to the rest of Ville Haute via the various bicycle paths and footpaths within. At the elevator's base is located national Cycle Path 1, which encircles the city centre, whilst the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, accessible via the bicycle path leading from the top of the tower, marks the start of national Cycle Path 2, heading towards Echternach.

He has been called \\"eccentric and religiously fanatical\\". Life He was born at Bredfield, Suffolk, the son and heir of John Purcell who in 1818 changed his surname to Fitzgerald. In 1858 he took the surname Purcell-Fitzgerald. He was one of eight children of Purcell and his wife and cousin Mary Frances Fitzgerald. Robert Bernard Martin describes him in relation to his siblings as \\"easily the most eccentric of a peculiar lot\\". Fitzgerald was a pupil of Benjamin Heath Malkin at Bury St Edmunds Free School. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1822, graduating B.A. in 1826 and M.A. in 1829. Venn writes that when young he \\"had suffered from brain-fever which had had the effect of so weakening his sight, that it became impossible for him, as had been intended, to take Orders in the Church of England.\\" Martin comments that he \\"had been strange all his life, sufficiently so at Cambridge to warrant special attention for eccentricity\\". He had a speech impediment, described as \\"a bad \\"sissing\\" or whistling ... that alternated with a clicking of his teeth\\". Nonetheless he took up preaching, and attracted audiences in the 1840s to hear his views on biblical prophecy. He was valued by evangelicals. Property owner Seaford John Fitzgerald the elder became by inheritance a wealthy landowner. He built in 1826 Castle Irwell on the edge of Pendleton in Lancashire, on one of his estates. It was close to the site of Pendleton Colliery, which he also owned, but which was a loss-making venture. In Northamptonshire was the Naseby Wooleys estate. He suffered bankruptcy in 1849. With numerous family properties in Ireland and England, John Fitzgerald the younger resided at some point at Little Island in County Waterford. He inherited Boulge Hall in Suffolk. The \\"History of Parliament\\", calling Fitzgerald a \\"highly eccentric and grossly fat lay preacher\\", states that the family properties, including also an estate at Seaford, passed to him; and that he resided for much of his time at Castle Irwell. He had additions made to that house in 1861. His Letter of Earnest Remonstrance (1870) to W. E. Gladstone, on the appointment as Bishop of Exeter of Frederick Temple the previous year, was signed as from Castle Irwell. Religious associations Timothy Richard Matthews In 1847 Fitzgerald published a funeral sermon for the Rev. Timothy Richard Matthews of Bedford. Matthews had a chapel in Bromham Road, and Fitzgerald assisted him for some services. In the Manchester area, Fitzgerald arranged for the hire of lecture halls, and speakers at them. Involved were Robert Baxter (1802‚Äì1889) of Doncaster the former Irvingite, Edmund Gardiner Fishbourne, and Joseph Samme. Family Fitzgerald married twice. His first wife, married in 1832, was Augusta Jane Lisle Phillipps, daughter of Charles March Phillipps of Garendon Hall. After her death in 1837, he married in 1843 Hester Haddon. Gerald Charles Fitzgerald (1820‚Äì1879) and Maurice Noel Ryder Fitzgerald (1835‚Äì1877) were sons of the first marriage.

Concerns for the endangered species of Sumatran orangutan at a time when routine open heart surgery was being performed in human babies, combined with a collaboration between San Diego Zoo and the UC San Diego Health, led to the planning of repairing the large hole in the heart in two-year-old Karen. The operation and after-care required the co-operation of more than 100 volunteers and the resulting procedure was successful and widely publicised. Karen became a favorite with zoo visitors, surviving more than 25 years. Karen is the subject of a book by Georgeanne Irvine titled Karen‚Äôs Heart: The True Story of a Brave Baby Orangutan, published by Blue Sneaker Press in 2018. Background Wild Sumatran orangutans are critically endangered. In the 1970s, UC San Diego Health (UCSD) pathologist Kurt Benirschke, persuaded zoo trustees to establish a research department, at the zoo's Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Species, which he subsequently led, providing the collaboration between the University and the zoo. Orangutan and human hearts have much similarity, and open heart surgery had become routine in human babies. Early life and family Karen, also known as \\"Kare-Bear\\", a Sumatran orangutan, was born at San Diego Zoo on 11 June 1992 to nine-year-old mother Karta and father Otis. After 1995, Karta lost six infants over the course of 15 years. Observations eventually led to the discovery of Karta's difficulties in breastfeeding due to her small nipples. Her babies were either stillborn or could not latch on and therefore failed to thrive. The zookeepers observed that Karen was not being nursed in the first few days of life and she was therefore removed from Karta. On reintroducing her back to Karta, no change was seen and Karen was removed again to be handraised. Karta was subsequently sent to Adelaide Zoo in November 1992 and Karen was adopted by orangutan Josephine. Karen was found to have a heart murmur at a health check-up at the age of two, after it was noted that she was not growing at the appropriate speed. Tests then confirmed a penny-size hole in the heart. At the time, Karen weighed and her condition was considered fatal without surgical correction. Heart surgery A surgical team led by cardiothoracic surgeon Stuart W. Jamieson from UCSD repaired the defect by opening Karen's chest and heart and stitching the hole to close it. Despite some structural variation between Karen's chest wall and that of a human, once inside the chest cavity, the surgeons felt familiar with the heart surgery. The whole procedure required the co-operation of a number of surgeons, nurses, anaesthetists, medical technicians, veterinarians and animal keepers and lasted seven hours. Jamieson reported that \\"If Karen were human, I'd tell her parents that everything went fine, and her prognosis is excellent\\". She became the first orangutan to have open heart surgery. Following the operation, Karen required carefully co- ordinated care, which involved more than 100 volunteers. Although she suffered a lung complication, it was managed successfully and she survived to make headlines, receiving get-well cards from all over the world. Life after surgery Karen subsequently became a favorite with zoo visitors. She has been described as \\"stubborn and willful, just like her mum\\", and is said to have a signature move, where she rolls rather than walks. Although not usually housed together, Karen, like some other orangutans is found to get along well with siamang gibbons. A book about Karen was published in 2018, titled Karen‚Äôs Heart: The True Story of a Brave Baby Orangutan.

It acts as a memorial to the 25 young women who drowned in a ferry accident on their way to work in the nearby export processing district.  History  On the morning of September 3, 1973, a small ferry capsized carrying over 70 passengers (despite a maximum capacity of 13) from Cijin Island to Kaohsiung City. Twenty-five of the passengers, all of whom were unmarried young women and most of whom were laborers in the export processing zone drowned. The reason the victims were all young, unmarried women is likely because The Taiwanese economic development of 1973 allowed for many families to provide better education opportunities for their children. Since boys were typically the priority recipients of these opportunities, girls entered the workforce immediately after middle school in order to support their families. Many girls and young women in the area thus ended up with jobs the export processing district. Due to the expansion of the Kaohsiung port in 1967, there were few transportation options between Cijin Island and Kaohsiung City. Residents relied on ferries run by both the Kaohsiung city government and private companies. The 1973 investigation found that the ferry had passed a recent safety inspection although it did not have lifesaving equipment and the captain did not have a license. The central supervising government agency, the Port of Kaohsiung, was subsequently found negligent in its duties to protect ferry passengers.File:Cemetery of Twenty-five Ladies.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Twenty-five Ladies‚Äô Tomb‚Äù Traditional Taiwanese superstition dictates that unmarried women cannot be buried in their patrilineal ancestral shrines. Instead, most families will choose to arrange a spirit marriage for the deceased or create a separate shrine where the spirit can reside. Chuang Chin-Chun, the father of one of the victims, urged the other families not to bury their daughters separately but to have them buried together. The Kaohsiung City Government, most likely because of its responsibility in the tragedy, helped find a plot of land to bury the victims together between the Zhongxing and Zhonghe boroughs. This site was named the Twenty-five Ladies‚Äô Tomb. Due to the construction of the Fourth Container Storage Center, it was then relocated to the current location. In 2004, the Kaohsiung Association for the Promotion of Women‚Äôs Rights (KAPWR) began lobbying for the Kaohsiung City government to remodel the site from a place of mourning into a memorial celebrating the contributions of women to the economy. The association hoped to raise awareness for gender-related labour issues. On April 28, 2008 (Worker's Memorial Day) the Kaohsiung City government formally renamed the Twenty-five Ladies‚Äô Tomb the Memorial Park for Women Labourers. The city remodelled the site to include a lotus flower shrine, plaques with each victim's name, and a brief introduction on the contributions women labourers have made to Taiwan's economy. Every spring, the Kaohsiung City government Department of Labour hosts an annual service to commemorate the young women, as well as to raise awareness for gender-related labour issues.  Superstition  Of the over 70 passengers, the 46 that survived were married men and women, and the 25 that drowned were single women. According to urban legend, young men's cars stall or break down in front of the memorial due to the drowned women feeling lonely and seeking revenge. According to another legend, a young woman in a white dress can be seen walking the area at night. Frequent drownings at the Cijin beach are often blamed on the spirits of the victims. These superstitions led gamblers to visit the tomb in search of winning numbers. If they lost, the gamblers sought revenge by destroying the photos of the women placed on their headstones. The families of the women deny these superstitions and feel they disparage the names of the victims. The superstitions were a primary catalyst in the advocacy by feminists and KAPWR for the Kaohsiung City government to take action in order to restore dignity to the memory of the victims.

It was designed by C. H. E. Blackman of the colonial Public Works Department under the aegis of William Wardell, built in 1876, and occupied in 1878. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  A postal service was established in Hamilton (formerly the 'Grange') in 1844, and the first formal post office was constructed in 1861. This timber structure was replaced in 1864 by a two-storey bluestone building, which fell quickly into disrepair. By 1875 the Department of Public Works had prepared plans for a new building which was to house a lands office and treasury as well as the post and telegraph offices. It was designed by C. H. E. Blackman under the aegis of William Wardell. Construction of the new building was finished in 1876, and formal occupation of the post office occurred in 1878. A clock tower was added in 1890. A new entry arch and counter were added to the original postal hall in 1907. The district officer was accommodated in the building between 1914‚Äì19, probably requiring changes to internal planning. The entry was originally through an open, recessed loggia, though these openings appear to have been glassed in at an early date. The post office exterior had been repainted by the early 1920s with a contrasting, darker colour to ground floor areas. In 1933-35, unspecified repairs and repainting took place, probably internal works, as historic photographs of the rear of building taken in 1941 indicate that the building still largely maintained its Victorian form and footprint at the time. By 1941 the rear yard also contained at least one other weatherboard shed or store buildings constructed on a long rectangular plan and a small amenities block. A small timber-framed porch had also been constructed over a rear access door to the wing at the northwest corner of the building. Unspecified repairs and renovations again took place in 1948. It would appear that the extension of the mail room at the southwest corner of the building may have occurred at this time, which included opening up the southwest corner of the original mail room and installation of supporting steel beams. Around this time bays of private letter boxes were installed within the arched former window openings of the front loggia; this work may have included re-paving of the loggia with terrazzo. Extensive works in the 1960s included a large side stair block with a flat roof and window-wall facing Gray Street, backed by an L-shaped brick wall, and to the rear, the ablutions block and a fire escape. The area to the north of the original building bounded by the northern boundary and the new stair wing was concrete paved and six public telephone booths and a seat are installed; this work includes demolition of the original front fence. Further bays of private letter boxes are added to front loggia. An original single door opening at the northeast corner of the original post office was infilled and signage installed above the first floor window arches. By this time a first floor window opening in the south elevation was altered to a doorway and a steel gantry is installed, cutting into the original roof alignment above. The roofscape was further altered by the removal of the chimneys. Internal alterations included refurbishment of fixtures and finishes, replacement of original counter joinery, construction of timber-framed partition walls at first floor level, refurbishment of kitchenettes and amenities. The first floor rooms at the southern end of the building were fully refurbished with acoustic treatment for telegraph exchange. By 1980, posting slips had been installed in the entrance doorway from the southern end of the loggia. The central section of the first floor had been repartitioned for use as a district office. In 1985, the former postmen's room (battery room) at the southeast corner of the building was converted to accommodate additional private letter boxes. This involved construction of a timber-framed partition wall throughout the space. Around this time a roofed loading dock and mail handling area was constructed between the southwest corner of the mail room and the relocatable building used for the API recreation room. The adjoining basement areas was converted to contractor's rooms and an earlier mail conveyor area was enclosed. The rec room was later converted to a contractor's parcel area. The first floor manual exchange was converted to a conference and training centre. During the 1990s, conservation works and repainting of the exterior were undertaken. In 1998, the former post office interior was refurbished as retail post shop and the offices to the west were reconfigured. The interior was reoriented with counters across the western end of the room, display joinery was constructed, the ceiling is relined with plasterboard and fittings are upgraded. As part of this work the public telephone booths to the north of the building are removed and the area is converted to a ramped entrance to the post shop. This involved conversion of an original ground floor window in the north elevation to a door opening with automatic sliding door.  Description  Hamilton Post Office is at 57 Gray Street, Hamilton, comprising the whole of Lot 2 LP222082. Hamilton Post Office is similar in size to the Castlemaine Post Office and those at Warrnambool and Echuca, and most of the current building dates from the same period. It is located at the southern edge of the main shopping precinct in Gray Street, the principal commercial street. The original building is constructed to the eastern (street) boundary of the deep rectangular site and the rear yard is largely covered by freestanding and interconnected sheds and amenities blocks. The original side driveway along the southern side of the site from Gray Street has been subsumed by a loading ramp and covered dock area; rear access is now via the adjoining site to the south which is also used for truck turning and staff carparking. The rear of the original site contains an automatic exchange building dating from the 1960s, which has since been subdivided. As it presents to the street, the two-storeyed building is a symmetrically composed, hipped roofed Victorian palazzo form in mass, with a central recessed loggia and a four-arched entrance, flanked by two breakfront pavilions and a modern stairwell wing set back on the north side. The original roof cornice is supported by regularly spaced moulded brackets, whereas the roofs of the later additions are defined by enclosed eaves. Raised course lines for the ground and first floor divisions provide the springing points for all arches. The original basement areas are defined by coursed rock-faced bluestone walling. The loggia provides access to bays of private letter boxes and the entrance doors at each end of the loggia space have been replaced. Added in 1890, the central four-stage tower has clock faces surmounted by pediments with a small mansard roof behind. The tower has coffered corner piers, and the clock panels are topped by pediments to all sides surmounted by ball urn finials. Below the clock, the lower tower face is bracketed by two diagonal consoles and includes a paired window with round arches and accentuated voussoirs to Gray Street. The upper tower is slightly recessed behind the first floor fa√ßade, and linked compositionally to a widening pattern consisting of four central arched windows on the first floor and a more widely spaced set of entrance arches on the ground floor. Externally, all ground floor arches are segmental and those on the first floor are rounded Italianate. The main window elaboration is in the arch mouldings and keystones. The window reveals have two steps each but no aedicules and timber-framed double-hung sash windows. Masonry panels with vermiculated treatment under each first floor window hint at balustrading. To the rear, the original form is partly concealed by a series of basement and ground floor alterations and additions. Above these at the centre of the complex is the original mail room area, roofed by a hipped form with central ridge lantern and weatherboard cladding to the sides. In plan form, the post office has three main sections which relate to the original design for a post and telegraph office, land office and sub-treasury. While the loggia provides the principal formal address, the northeast side provides ramped access to the retail shop via an altered window bay and to the 1960s stairwell. The southern side of the building provides for a separate access to the building for staff and to the original stairwell, as well as a private letter box room and tea room. The central ground floor mail hall's original double-height volume with exposed trusses and ridge lantern remains intact. This remains in use as a sorting area but has been opened up to the original counter area to the east and non-original mail room and offices to the southwest and west. It has two levels plus basement at front, one plus basement at rear; and the four level clock tower.  Condition  Externally, the building's ability to demonstrate key aspects of its original design is good when considered from the principal north, east and south vantage points and overall form. Major alterations associated with the 1940s mail room extension, 1960s additions and 1980s loading dock and handling facilities, however have diminished the integrity of the rear of the building. Internally, the plan form and fabric of the building retains limited aspects of the original design and detail of the place due to the multiple changes to the building program. This is largely confined to the overall structure defining the general wings, some room layouts and floor levels as well as general joinery detail. While the western side of the mail hall has been opened to later areas, its full double-height, lantern roof structure and fabric remain clear. Generally, the building appears to be in relatively sound condition throughout, though there is evidence of extensive water damage in the southern parts at both floor levels. Like most facilities of a similar period, original fabric and detail in areas of high traffic flow have suffered from mechanical damage. The accessible basement areas also appear sound, although contain extensive obsolete records and equipment. The roof space and clock tower were not inspected.  Heritage listing  Hamilton Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 with the following rationale: As one of a concentrated suite of mid to late nineteenth century buildings in the area, the 1870s Hamilton Post Office helps demonstrate the development of Hamilton as an important regional centre in Victoria's Western District; the building is also an important component of the town's commercial and civic centre. Its formal composition, grand scale and high quality are markers of Hamilton's status as one of the Colony's significant permanent settlements built on the means of pastoral wealth. This is further demonstrated by the inclusion of sub-branches of multiple government departments within the complex. Additionally, the Hamilton Post Office is representative of a significant phase of public works in Colonial Victoria, when a great number of post offices were constructed to serve the rapidly growing communications requirements of the developing Colony. Typologically, Hamilton Post Office is an example of a large regional post and telegraph office combined with an equal measure of integrated government offices. The separate components are fully integrated within the overall composition, but were originally clearly demarcated within the internal planning, now largely obscured. The building nevertheless demonstrates the principal functional and aesthetic characteristics of the type including an accomplished application of style and endowment of monumental civic form; incorporation of frontal components such as accessible offices, clock tower, loggia and porch; and increased size to reflect increased volume of a rapidly developing region and additional functions. Stylistically, Hamilton Post Office is an impressive Italianate palazzo design, then popular in the government department and further afield, which fully embodies the mid-Victorian Renaissance mode and a symmetrical composition with restrained yet bold detail. The weight and quality of the design is enhanced by its imposing siting and landmark clock tower. Architecturally, Hamilton Post Office is an example of the competent Public Works Department architect, CHE Blackman (1873 to 1877) under the aegis of enduring and highly regarded Chief Architect, William Wardell. The 1876 and 1890 elements of the Hamilton Post Office are a fine example of Victorian post office design which belong to a suite of substantial Italianate post offices constructed in between 1870 and 1878. Displaying strong Italianate features with modest ornamentation and a broad colonnaded loggia, it is a handsome example of its type. The landmark qualities of the large building are enhanced by the two level clock tower. In association with other prominent nineteenth century buildings in Gray Street, the post office makes a major contribution to the historic nature and aesthetic of the local streetscape and broader historic precinct. Postal services have been provided from the site for over 140 years and the present building has been a key and prominent component of the historic townscape for over 130 years; the building also demonstrates an enduring quality which is identified with the town's origin and prospective future, and in this way is considered to have social value to the community. The curtilage includes the title block/allotment of the property. The significant components of Hamilton Post Office include the main 1876 postal building and the clock tower of 1890. The weatherboard gabled-ended outbuilding from the interwar period is of contributory significance.

Biography  Edward Caruana Dingli was born on 10 August 1876 in Valletta to Raphael Caruana Dingli and Martha n√©e Garroni. He followed his father in embarking on a career in the civil service, where he was commissioned to the Royal Malta Regiment of Militia, and later he transferred to the Royal Malta Artillery. He left military service in 1913 and became a full-time artist at the age of 37. He married Charlotte Marietta Giovanna Falzon for thirteen years, with whom he had two children, when he was 24. Following his separation from Falzon in 1913, he had a reputedly scandalous relationship with Olga Galea Naudi n√©e Barbora, a long time acquaintance of Caruana Dingli and wife of an ex-military man Carlo Galea Naudi. He would go on to paint various portraits of Olga throughout his career. Due to being born into an artistic family and being well connected with the Maltese elite as well as British government in Malta, Caruana Dingli found work as an artist through his family connections with the art scene in Malta as well as the political class of the country. He was the director of the Government School of Arts in Malta between 1919 and 1947. A number of his students later became notable Maltese artists, including Willie Apap, Anton Inglott, Emvin Cremona and Esprit Barthet. Edward Caruana Dingli is brother to Robert Caruana Dingli and great-uncle to Debbie Caruana Dingli, both of whom are notable Maltese painters.  Artistic Work  Caruana Dingli's work incorporates portrait paintings in oil where his main subjects were prominent Maltese figures such as politicians, clerics and prelates. On the other hand, Caruana Dingli also painted folkloristic watercolour and gouaches paintings depicting Maltese landscape, countrysides and local street scenes with merchant sellers, farmers and children playing traditional Maltese games. Giuseppe Cal√¨, who was Caruana Dingli's mentor and close friend, encouraged Caruana Dingli to focus his work on realism whilst holding a romantic idealism. His work may be found in a number of collections such as the Casino Maltese, the National Museum of Fine Arts (nowadays known as MU≈ªA) at Auberge d'Italie, and the Museum of the Order of St John. He also designed the label for the first Maltese beer in 1928, the Farsons Pale Ale.

Although never charged with the murders, he left a note confessing to the crimes when he committed suicide in New Mexico. Biography Early life Born as the son of a 22-year United States Air Force veteran, Rodriguez attended several different schools while growing up in Florida, Georgia and Alabama. He graduated high school in Fort Walton Beach, later attending the Okaloosa-Walton Junior College before enrolling at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where he became a Mormon. After spending two years in Guatemala as a Mormon missionary, Rodriguez earned a law enforcement degree from Brigham Young University and was later hired by the Portland Police Bureau in March 1975, but resigned only two years later. Rodriguez then moved to Tallahassee, Florida with his mother and attended the Florida State University, working as a sign-painter and janitor. He was also an active member of the Unity Church, occasionally delivering sermons there. Murders In June 1984, 22-year-old Valerie Hunt, a student from the Tallahassee Community College, disappeared from a shopping center. No trace was found of her until three months later, when her skeletized remains were located at a sinkhole in Wakulla County. On March 27, 1992, two 16-year-old girls from Thomasville, Georgia named Megan Carr and Cherish DeSantis, were found dead at a secluded Alligator Point beach by a police officer and his wife. The girls, who had travelled for a simple day on the beach and were still in their swimsuits, had been shot twice in the head. The bodies showed no signs of a struggle, as well as neither of them being sexually assaulted or robbed, as their purses and valuables had been left untouched. Investigation, suicide and discovery When they discovered the bodies, the Alligator Point Homicide Task Force went on to pursue more than 100 possible leads. During this time, Rodriguez's mother had passed away, with him disappearing from his apartment on May 5, shortly after he was interviewed for his car, which carried a stolen Utah license plate. He then proceeded to write two letters addressed to the FDLE and another to the Arizona Daily Sun, before eventually taking his own life using cyanide at an I-40 stop in New Mexico. Eventually, authorities decided to check out his car concerning his license plate. In their search, they found Rodriguez's body, as well as a glass vial containing white powder and a warning note on the car. The car was similar to one seen during the day of the girls' murder. His detailed confession in one of the letters, given to FDLE agent Delbert McGarvey, explained his reasonings for the murder: he had failed to rape his victims, and in order to not get caught, he killed them. In the media The Investigation Discovery program Swamp Murders has an episode detailing the crimes committed by Rodriguez.

When he does get to an interview, and thanks to his rickshaw-man father Subbaiah is in the know of the password that will fetch him a job at last, at long last, he ends up with the dhaanam of his job to another Raja (Raja), in his opinion more needy candidate. And as if this was not enough, for a month he is giving his people to understand that he has taken the job.

German knights identified by their coats of arms include Wernher von Homberg at the center, killing a Torriani leader and Konrad von Gundelfingen of the Teutonic Order leading the charge into the enemy knights, besides Leopold of Austria and Amadeus of Savoy. An uprising of the Guelph faction in Milan led by Guido della Torre (hence also known as the Torriani faction) on 12 February 1311 was crushed by the troops of king Henry VII still on the same day. Background Henry had arrived in Milan some weeks earlier, on 23 December 1310,Barthold (1830), p. 437. and had been crowned King of Italy on 6 January 1311.Jones, Michael, The New Cambridge Medieval History, Vol. VI: c. 1300-c. 1415, Cambridge University Press, 2000, 533f. The Tuscan Guelphs refused to attend the ceremony, and began preparing for resistance. Henry also rehabilitated the Visconti, the ousted former rulers of Milan, who returned from exile. Guido della Torre, who had thrown the Visconti out of Milan, objected and organised a revolt against Henry. Uprising Around noon of 12 February, Duke Leopold of Austria, returning from a pleasure ride with few companions, was passing the Torriani quarter on his way back to his camp outside of Porta Comasina, northwest of the city, when he heard unusual noise of voices, weapons and horses, and through an open door he could see a congregation of men in full armour. Leopold sent his men back to his camp with the command to arm his followers, and went to king Henry, who was residing in the city palace, to warn him of the impending attack. Henry sent his brother Baldwin to fetch the German troops camped outside Porta Romana, southwest of the city, while a group of knights led by Henry of Flandres and John of Calcea rode to the Visconti palace and from there to the Torriani quarter, where they were immediately engaged in heavy combat. Henry remained in the palace, and ordered the palace gates to be barricaded, just in time before the arrival of an armed mob. At the same time, the contingent of Teutonic Knights arrived, and in a single charge killed or dispersed most of the rebels. The German chronicles are unanimous in praising the bravery and valour of the knights in this attack, and especially their leader, the commander of Franconia and later Deutschmeister Konrad von Gundelfingen. The Austrian reinforcements had been delayed by barricades erected by the rebels at Porta Comasina. The Visconti reinforcement likewise arrived suspiciously late, in what was afterwards taken to imply at least passive support of the uprising. When the reinforcements arrived in the Torriani quarter, the fight there was mostly over. The soldiers now went on to loot the Torriani residences in a massacre that continued until nightfall.Georg Irmer, Die Romfahrt Kaiser Heinrich's VII im Bildercyclus des Codex Balduini Trevirensis (1881), 43-46. Aftermath Guido della Torre escaped, and was condemned to death in absence by Henry. Archbishop Cassone della Torre was exiled. Matteo I Visconti was also accused of supporting the uprising, mostly by his enemy John of Cermenate. Unlike Guido della Torre and his sons, who had escaped the city, Matteo Visconti appeared before Henry to receive judgement. The fact that his son Galeazzo had supported Leopold against the rebels counted in Matteo's favour. Both Matteo and Galeazzo were still briefly exiled from the city, suggesting that Henry was not fully convinced of their loyalty. The Visconti were soon returned to power, however, with Henry appointing Matteo I Visconti as the Imperial vicar of Milan. He also imposed his brother-in-law, Amadeus of Savoy, as the vicar-general in Lombardy. Wernher von Homberg was given the title of lieutenant general of Lombardy, and was given the right to collect the imperial tax at Fl√ºelen. In the aftermath of the uprising, the Guelph cities of Northern Italy were turned against Henry, resisting the enforcement of his imperial claims on what had become communal lands and rights, and attempted to replace communal regulations with imperial laws.Christopher Kleinhenz, Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, Volume 1, Routledge, 2004, p. 495. Nevertheless, Henry managed to restore some semblance of imperial power in parts of northern Italy. Cities such as Parma, Lodi, Verona and Padua all accepted his rule. Historiography While German chronicles (such as Codex Balduini and Gesta Treverorum) emphasise the valour of the German knights in the fight against the rebels, Milanese historiography tended to depict the reprisals as the Germans unexpectedly assaulting the Torriani in their own homes.\\"I Torriani sono inaspettatamento assaliti dalle truppe Tedesche nelle proprie case, e scacciati per sempre da Milano\\" Francesco Pirevano, Nuova Guida di Milano (1822), 26f. An 1895 drawing by Lodovico Pogliaghi with the title \\"Assault on the houses of the Torriani in Milan\\" (assalto alle case dei Torriani a Milano, nel 1311) was included in Francesco Bertolini's Storia d'Italia. The Torriani houses damaged or destroyed by the Germans gave rise to the name case rotte (\\"broken houses\\") of that part of the city (modern Via Case Rotte, ).

She is known for her mixed- media sculptures and site-specific works that inquire into Hong Kong culture and history. Lam often uses recycled materials such as found fabric or wood from construction sites. She began focusing on community engagement and socially responsible art at the time of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003. And since then, she has created many community-driven projects in Hong Kong and abroad. In 2006, she received the Asian Cultural Council's Desiree and Hans Michael Jebsen Fellowship. Her works have been acquired by public institutions, including Hong Kong Museum of Art, Hong Kong Heritage Museum, and Chinese University of Hong Kong. Lam is also known as an educator. She currently teaches at the Hong Kong Art School as senior lecturer and programme coordinator.  Early life  She was born in 1973 in Fujian, People's Republic of China. She migrated to Hong Kong in 1985 (at 12 years old) and continued her study there. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts, Master of Fine Arts, and postgraduate diploma in education from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.  Selected works  Lam's practice focuses on socially engaged art. She stated, \\"During SARS in 2003, I felt strongly the power of collective sadness and anxiety, and I decided to respond this feeling.\\" Speaking about her projects that involve workers from different industries in Hong Kong, the artist says, \\"I'm neither a fighter nor a social activist. . . What I do is only raising attention [. . . for] invisible people.\\" Micro Economy (2009-ongoing) is a community-driven project that involves garment and crate wood workers. The project features large-scale sculptural objects using discarded or recycled materials such as old fabric, leftover crate wood, and scrap metal. It questions the economy shaped around the idea of \\"use.\\" Bleaching is another collaborative work, where Lam worked with members of the Hong Kong Women Workers' Association, using pieces of fabric to create surfaces that act as tents and projection surfaces at the same time. Jaffa Lam Laam Collaborative: Weaver (2013) is a community art project that involves women from grassroots organizations as co-creators of artworks. Hosted at the Hong Kong Arts Centre in 2013, the project includes seventeen works, including wood, fabric and found objects as well as her collaborative work with marginalized skilled laborers in Hong Kong. The project explores the relationship between traditional craft and traditional gender norms, as well as labor and class for women in Hong Kong. This project was shown to represent Hong Kong at the Setouchi Triennale in 2013. Christina Yuen Zi Chung, a PhD scholar in Feminist Studies at the Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies Department of the University of Washington, discusses how Lam creates work with a feminist consciousness and uses her work to reimagine a language for feminism for Hong Kong-based artists.

He is best known for his trial following his confession under the torture of the boot and resulting in his hanging at the Grassmarket in Edinburgh after he attempted to murder Archbishop Sharp. Early life He graduated in Divinity at Edinburgh University on 9 July 1656, and at the same time signed the National Covenant and the Solemn League and Covenant. He attached himself to the party of remonstrator presbyterians, and studied popular divinity under David Dickson. He was refused a position by the presbytery of Dalkeith on the grounds of insufficiency, and appears to have become ‚Äòa preacher, but no actual minister,‚Äô in or near Edinburgh. In 1661 he was recommended to some ministers in Galloway by Robert Traill, a minister in Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh, as suitable for teaching in a school or as private tutor. He entered the house of the Laird of Dundas as domestic chaplain and tutor to his children, but was dismissed for immoral conduct. Returning to Edinburgh he made the acquaintance of Major Weir, who procured for him the post of chaplain in a ‚Äòfanatical family, the lady whereof was niece to Sir Archibald Johnston of Warriston. Armed rising, flight and return He resigned his post in November 1666 in order to join the rising of the covenanters in the west, at Ayr. He was in Edinburgh on 28 November, when the rebels were defeated at Pentland, but was pronounced guilty of treason in a proclamation of 4 December 1666, and on 1 October 1667 was excluded from the pardon granted to those engaged in the rising. About four to six weeks after the defeat, he went over to Flanders on mercantile transactions, where he joined a cousin, a factor in Rotterdam. He stayed there around 9 months, and then returned to Scotland in a Dutch vessel, bringing with him a cargo of goods for sale. While abroad, he had opportunities of meeting and conversing with Mr John Livingstone, and the other ministers who had been banished for their adherence to Presbytery. His attempt upon the life of Archbishop Sharp was made not many months after his arrival from the continent. After wandering in England and Ireland he returned to Edinburgh in 1668. There he married, and opened a shop for the sale of tobacco and spirits. Assassination attempt Mitchell became convinced that Archbishop James Sharp was the sole barrier that stood between him and the clemency of the Government; and, also that this recreant was the \\"prime cause\\" of all the trouble in Scotland. Mitchell therefore made an attempt at the assassination of the bishop. He was lodging in a house on the Cowgate with his later infamous friend, Major Weir and Weir's sister, Grizel. He was aware that Bishop Sharp lived nearby on Blackfriars Wynd. On 9 July 1668 he tracked down the Bishop who was in his coach on the Royal Mile at the head of the Wynd. He fired a pistol into the coach, but instead of hitting Sharp, hit his friend, Bishop Andrew Honeyman, bishop of Orkney, in the arm.Grants Old and New Edinburgh vol.2 p.259 Mitchell then ran down Niddry's Wynd on the opposite side of the road, without opposition, and escaped. Apprehension The Boots from Scots Worthies Early in 1674 he was recognised in the street by Sharp, whose brother, Sir William Sharp, obtained a confession from him, after the archbishop had pledged himself that no harm should come to him. But he was imprisoned at the Bass RockGrants Old and New Edinburgh vol.2 p.259, and, at the instigation of Sharp, brought before the council on 10 February 1674. He made a full confession on 12 February on receiving a promise of his life. Mitchell was indicted before the High Court of Justiciary and sentenced to have his right hand out off by the common executioner, at the \\"Mercat Cross\\" of Edinburgh. Indicted afresh, before the High Court in 1675, for his participation in the Pentland Rising and the attempt on the Archbishop's life, he retracted his Confession and pleaded \\"Not Guilty.\\" Having no other proof in support of the latter charge except his Confession (and that having been recanted) the Court ordered the \\"torture of the Boot,\\" with the view that he might be constrained anew to adhere to it. However, no amount of torture could induce him to incriminate himself; and he was accordingly sent to the Tolbooth Prison where he lay until the beginning of 1677, when he was transferred to the Bass Rock. On 6 March the council framed an act, in which they declared themselves free of any promise made. On 25 March Mitchell was again brought before the court, but there being no evidence against him beyond the confession, since retracted, the lords of justiciary deserted the diet, with the consent of the lord advocate, Sir John Nisbet, Lord Dirleton. Mitchell was then returned to the Tolbooth and afterwards removed to the Bass Rock. He was sent there along with James Fraser of Brea and James Drummond. The attempted murder was an act that met with no sympathy from the great body of the Covenanters, who rather repudiated everything approaching to private revenge and assassination. On 18 January 1677 he again in the presence of a committee of justices, of which Linlithgow was chairman, denied his confession. A further attempt was made on 22 January with the same result, despite a threat of the ‚Äòboots.‚Äô On 24 January, in the Parliament House, he was examined under torture as to his connection with the rebellion of 1666 This accusation he also denied, and reminded those present that there were two other James Mitchells in Midlothian. The torture and questioning continued till the prisoner fainted when he was carried back to the Tolbooth. Final Trial In December 1677 the council ordered criminal proceedings against him for the attempted assassination of the archbishop. On 7 January the trial commenced. He was ably defended by Sir George Lockhart, Lord Carnwath and John Elies. His confession and the testimonies of Bishops Sharp and Honeyman were the main evidence against him. Most of the discussion focussed upon the \\"promise of life\\" by the Bishop. Rothes swore to having seen Mitchell sign his confession, which was countersigned by himself. But both he and the archbishop denied that the promise of life had been given. Mitchell's counsel produced a copy of the Act of Council of 12 March 1674, in which his confession under promise of life was recorded, but a request that the books of the council might be produced was refused. The trial was remarkable for the number of witnesses of high station, and the perjury of Rothes, Halton, and Lauderdale has rarely been paralleled. Mitchell was judged guilty. The following day, 10 January, sentence was passed. The death sentence adjudged him \\"to be taken to the Grassmarket of Edinburgh, upon Friday, the 18th day of January instant, betwixt two and four o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, and there to be hanged on a gibbet till he be dead, and all his moveable goods and gear to be escheat (confiscated) and inbrought to His Majesty‚Äôs use.\\" It appears that, after the passing of this sentence, the unprincipled Lauderdale was ill-at-ease. He had great searchings of conscience and was anxious to obtain a reprieve for Mitchell, in the hope that the King might grant him his life. But Sharp was inexorable and insisted that the \\"extreme penalty\\" should be inflicted, alleging that for \\"favour to be shown to such an assassin was, upon the matter, to expose his person to any man who would attempt to murder him.\\" \\"Then,\\" said Lauderdale, with a profane and heartless jest, \\"let Mitchell glorify God in the Grassrmarket.\\" (Dickson pg 224). He was hung, as proposed, on the afternoon of 18 January 1678. Halton was eventually indicted for the perjury on 28 July 1681, the evidence against him being two letters that he had written on 10 and 12 Feb. 1674 to the Earl of Kincardine [see Bruce, Alexander, second Earl], in which he gave an account of Mitchell's confession, ‚Äòupon assurance of his life.‚Äô The letters are printed in Wodrow, ii. 248-9. Mitchell is described as ‚Äòa lean, hollow-cheeked man, of a truculent countenance‚Äô (Ravillac Redivivus, p. 11). He himself attributed his attempt on Sharp as ‚Äòane impulse of the spirit of God‚Äô (Kirkton, History of the Church of Scotland, p. 387). Family Mitchell was married. His son James, who graduated at the university of Edinburgh on 11 Nov. 1698, was licensed by the presbytery there on 26 July 1704, ordained on 5 April 1710, and became minister of Dunnotar in the same year. He was summoned to appear before the justices of the peace on 24 March 1713 to answer for the exercise of church discipline in the session. He died on 26 June 1734.

It was founded in 2012 and closed in 2018. History Pioneer High School for the Performing Arts was founded by a group of performing artists living in the region: Caleb Chapman, a saxophonist and youth band director, who became music director; Mindy Smoot Robbins, owner of a Broadway theatre academy; Kymberly Mellon, an actress and director; Sam Payne, another musician; and Derryl Yeager, director of Odyssey Dance Theatre, who became vice chairman of the governing board. Their objectives in founding the school were to reduce the stress of artistic students trying to combine their arts training with a conventional school day and to train performing artists more thoroughly. It opened in 2012 with operations in both American Fork and Lehi and a target enrollment of 1,000. The school started out contracting with Lincoln Interactive, a Pennsylvania company, to provide academic courses entirely online, with mornings reserved for the arts training. The Utah State Charter School Board placed the school in warning status in 2013 and on turnaround in 2015. In 2016 the state gave it an F grade, but in June 2017 the Charter School Board reduced the school's warning and probation status. By November 2017 the state assigned the school a C grade. Enrollment was at one point over 450 but fell to 120 after the school terminated the contract for online classes, at that time with Harmony Educational Services; it rose to approximately 140 in the 2016‚Äì17 academic year, 70 more students were successfully recruited for 2017‚Äì18, and for 2018‚Äì19 numbers had been raised from 108 to approximately 120. Retention between 2015‚Äì16 and 2016‚Äì17 was 42.4%, the lowest of the more than 25 charter schools in the county; it subsequently rose to a high percentage. To boost enrollment, the school had advertised online and on billboards and students had marched in parades. The academic programs were housed until 2017 in a building at 704 S. 600 East St. shared with Aristotle Academy, another charter school that also opened in 2012 but closed in 2017; plans for a new building were not realized. Gil Jarvie became executive director (principal) in January 2017; he was succeeded in May 2018 by Dallyn Bayles, an actor and singer. On August 1, 2018, after it was discovered that in order to be financially viable Pioneer High would need 169 students, not the 150 previously estimated, plus additional funds, the governing board decided not to reopen the school for the fall term later that month as planned. Demographics In the 2015‚Äì16 school year, Pioneer High had a minority enrollment of 13% (predominantly Hispanic), with a diversity score of 0.24. 2% were eligible for a free lunch. The graduation rate was 80-89%.

L√©opoldine's death in 1843, shortly after her marriage, would cause great distress to her parents, and inspired many of her father's poems, especially those in Contemplations. Another son, Charles, was born in 1826, followed by Fran√ßois-Victor in 1828, and another daughter, Ad√®le Hugo, in 1830. By this time Hugo had made his reputation as a poet and novelist.

Appointed director-general of the National Police Agency after Yao Kao- chiao stepped down in the aftermath of the murder of Pai Hsiao-yen, Ting assumed the role in September 1997, and faced the Alexander family hostage crisis in November 1997. In January 2000, Ting participated in discussions that led to the formation of an \\"action initiative\\" against black gold politics.

Her television career began at the BBC where she worked as secretary to Michael Barrie, head of drama for BBC Television, and later joined producer Dennis Vance as his assistant. In 1955 she left the BBC along with Vance to work at Highbury Studios where she was a production assistant for programmes such as Theatre Royal and TV Playhouse, before joining ABC in 1956. At ABC she produced programmes such as Moment of Fame as well as various children's shows. Vance soon joined her there, and she helped him to organise ABC‚Äôs drama department, before she became a producer in her own right. One of the programmes Willett produced for ABC was State Your Case, a show that invited viewers to write in for a chance to win ¬£100 to help them fulfil a personal dream. Letters would typically be from parents wishing to visit their children overseas, young couples in need of a deposit for a house, or individuals with business ideas, including one viewer who wanted the money to build a rocket ship capable of reaching outer space. State Your Case began in ABC's northern region, but was aired nationally from February 1957. Willett also produced The Sunday Break, a religious programme for younger people that aired on Sunday evenings and which was presented by Julie Stevens. In March 1961, the programme aired \\"A Man Dies\\", a controversial Passion Play depicting Jesus Christ dressed in a pair of jeans. On 11 April 1961 Willett was treated at the West Middlesex Hospital after Vance stabbed her in the shoulder during an incident at ABC's Teddington Studios. Filming for \\"Dance with Death\\", an episode of The Avengers had been underway at the studios at the time. Vance, who had experienced a mental breakdown the previous year, was charged with grievous bodily harm later the same day after giving himself up to police. At his subsequent trial, held at the Old Bailey on 27 April, Vance was found guilty due to diminished responsibility and sentenced to three years' probation, after a psychiatrist successfully argued in his defence. He was ordered to spend twelve months of this sentence as a patient at London's St Luke's Hospital. Vance was dismissed by ABC, but later worked for Associated Television. Willett left ABC in 1962 to join the Central Office of Information, and little is known about her life after that. She married composer and writer Norman Kay in 1969, and the couple had a daughter. Norman Kay died in 2001. A long-term resident of Richmond in southwest London, in her later years Willett became involved with the Richmond Society and took over responsibility for their publicity.

Craig Asberry (July 15, 1865 ‚Äì November 17, 1968) was an African- American leader, music teacher, and centenarian who helped to found the Tacoma NAACP and was active in the Washington State Association of Colored Women's Clubs. Early life in Kansas Asberry was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, the daughter of Violet Craig, a former slave, and William Wallingford, who owned the plantation where Craig had been enslaved. Asberry was the youngest of Craig's six children, and the only one who was born free. She started studying piano at age eight. Taking advantage of the free tuition at the time, she enrolled and graduated from the University of Kansas and then earned her Doctorate of Music from the Kansas Conservatory of Music and Elocution in Leavenworth, Kansas, on June 12, 1883, a month before her eighteenth birthday. It is possible that she was the first African-American woman to earn a doctorate degree. From Kansas to Seattle and back After college, Asberry taught music and performed in choirs in Nicodemus, Kansas, Kansas City, Missouri, and Denver, Colorado. She married Albert Jones, and the two of them moved to Seattle, Washington to take advantage of the opportunities available there in the midst of the rebuilding of the city after the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. Shortly after arriving, Asberry became first organist and music director for the First African Methodist Episcopal Church. When Albert Jones died in 1893, however, she returned briefly to her family in Kansas. Settling in Tacoma After her husband's death in 1893, Asberry moved to Tacoma with her family. This was where she became one of the founding members of the Tacoma Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter. She tried to fight segregation in Tacoma and Fort Lewis and established the Tacoma City Association of Colored Women's Clubs before traveling around to promote similar ideas, and was provided a federation throughout the state. Asberry was a longtime resident of Tacoma and taught children music and was a choir director, which she was able to do using her PhD. It has also been considered that she was the first African American woman to ever receive a PhD.

She set a Guinness World Record for the largest bubble blown, in diameter, in 1994. Early life Susan Montgomery was born in National City, California, and grew up in the San Joaquin Valley. As a student at Roosevelt High School in Fresno, she discovered and developed her bubble- blowing talent. She did not graduate from high school and later qualified for disability insurance due to epilepsy. Bubblegum-blowing In 1994, Williams set a Guinness World Record for bubblegum-blowing with a bubble. Williams claimed that she could pop her gum louder than any competitors. In October 1989 she was arrested at the Fresno Fair after her loud popping disturbed attendees at an outdoor Smokey Robinson concert and she refused to desist. Those charges were dropped in February 1990, but while in the courthouse to answer those charges, Williams' popping in the hallway disturbed jury selection in a murder case. Bailiffs at first believed the noise came from a .38 caliber pistol shot. Though protesting that no law forbids gum chewing in hallways, Williams was arrested, fined $150, and sentenced to serve 30 days in jail. The sentence was suspended \\"on the condition that she never snap or pop gum in the courthouse again\\". Williams made television appearances in Spain, Germany, England, Japan, and the United States, including on The Johnny Carson Show and The Jay Leno Show. In July 1990, a Smithsonian magazine article on bubblegum featured a photo of Williams blowing a bubble. Williams maintained a Myspace page, \\"ChewsySuzy\\", which explained: \\"She learned that she could touch a bubble without popping it. Then she found she could begin a bubble by holding it with her fingers and holding it away from her nose and chin.\\" Personal life She married Joseph C. Williams Jr., with whom she had two children. They later divorced. In September 2008 Williams suffered a stroke. She died of an aneurysm at the age of 47 on October 1, 2008, in Fresno.

In May 1936, at the √âcole normale de musique de Paris, accompanied by the Orchestre F√©mininin de Paris and its conductor Jane Evrard, she presented the Concertos in E major by Bach and E flat by Mozart in the first part. Then, in the second part, she played the \\"Romance\\" in F by Beethoven, pieces by Paradis, Kreutzer, Kreisler: Belonging to the same generation as Ginette Neveu (1919-1949), Lephay-Belthoise was considered by Henri Rabaud as \\"one of the most brilliant representatives of our beautiful French violin school\\". Her repertoire included works emblematic of French music like E. Chausson's Po√®me, the Sonates for violin and piano No 1 and No 2 by Faur√©, Ravel's Tzigane, Lalo's Rapsodie norv√©gienne and Symphonie espagnole and Saint-Sa√´ns' Havanaise.

On these occasions, she performed concertos from the repertoire, French music and gives lectures on French composers. Invited every year, the Scandinavian press unanimously consecrated her as a world-class violinist. A member of the Orchestre symphonique de Paris under the direction of Pierre Monteux, she was one of the first female musicians admitted to national orchestras and joined the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France at the request of D√©sir√©-√âmile Inghelbrecht.

Among the new ships built for the Dutch navy Heiligerlee was the first true monitor: a ship with shallow draught, only a few (heavy) guns and decent armor. These characteristics made her very suitable to operate way inland in the Dutch delta. Construction and handover Heiligerlee was originally named Panter. She was ordered from Laird Brothers in May 1867, and was to be delivered in 9 months. On 14 January 1868 Panter was launched. On account of the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Heiligerlee she was renamed for the 1568 Battle of Heiligerlee. This renaming was published on 23 May, the actual anniversary of the battle. On 20 May 1868 Paddle steamer HNLMS Valk commanded by Captain-lt J.F. Koopman had already left the Netherlands to transport the prospective crew of Heiligerlee to Birkenhead, where Heiligerlee would be taken into service. In the evening of 24 May the Valk arrived in Liverpool. Heiligerlee was taken into service on 26 May 1868, when the yard handed over control to Lieutenant 1st class H.A. Ridder van Rappard. By 10 June 1868 the English press mentioned that Heiligerlee had completed her trial cruise. During this cruise she had on board her guns and ammunition, 75 officers and men, their luggage, six weeks of stores and 5 days of coal. Her quarters were described as very spacious and well ventilated. In the afternoon of the 10th Heiligerlee left Birkenhead for the Netherlands.  Service record: 1st Term 1868‚Äì1877  Initial voyages in the Netherlands  In the early afternoon of the 15 June 1868 Heiligerlee arrived in the Nieuwe Diep near Den Helder. On 5 July the Secretary for the Navy arrived to see the new ship. With some ceremony he made a short trip on the monitor on the 6th, sailing on the Marsdiep. On 8 September Admiral Prince Hendrik arrived in Den Helder. He also made a trip to the Marsdiep on Heiligerlee. On 10 September Heiligerlee left Texel to sail to Delfzijl. On the 11th Heiligerlee arrived in the harbor of Delfzijl. While there, the ship was visited by the Secretary for War, the governor of Groningen province, and a lot of local dignitaries and civilians. On 19 September Heiligerlee was back in Den Helder.  Heiligerlee is based in the south  On 11 October Heiligerlee left the Den Helder dockyard Willemsoord. She steamed along the coast and reached Hellevoetsluis in the morning of the 12th. Some subsequent trips show that the Heilgerlee could indeed penetrate way inland: From Hellevoetsluis she would steam on the 'Kanaal door Voorne' to reach its new base at Rotterdam. On 21 October the royal yacht 'Leeuw' with the Queen and Prince Alexander on board made a small detour to view Heiligerlee while she was stationed across the park on the Meuse. On 27 October Heiligerlee was back in Hellevoetsluis. From there she left for Brouwershaven on the 31st, and returned to Hellevoetsluis on 2 November. On 6 November she left for Dordrecht. From there she left for Rotterdam on the 11th, got stuck for some time and had to be pulled loose by tugboats. On 16 March 1869 Heiligerlee arrived in Hellevoetsluis from Rotterdam. She would go into the drydock to be checked and cleaned. While in Hellevoetsluis, she was inspected together with the Schorpioen on 21 April. On 5 June the Heilgerlee left for Rotterdam. She sailed upstream as far as Gorinchem and left there on 21 June. By sailing to Gorinchem, Heiligerlee demonstrated that monitors could play a role in defending the new Water Line. Heiligerlee next went to Hellevoetsluis and from there to Brouwershaven. In August Heiligerlee and Ram Turret ship Schorpioen exercised on the Haringvliet. Later Heiligerlee steamed to Rotterdam, and from there to Dordrecht, where she got stuck again. In October she went into the dry dock to clean and paint the hull.  During the Franco-Prussian War  On 30 April 1870 Commander Ridder van Rappard abandoned the command of Heiligerlee, and was replaced by Lieutenant 1st class J.A.E. Dinaux. This might have to do with the navy opting to have a commander experienced with monitors to command the new Cerberus. In effect, the drastic increase in Dutch defense spending was vindicated when the Franco-Prussian war started. It created the severe risk that it would provide one of the parties with a pretext to invade the Netherlands if it could easily do so. To prevent this the garrison of Hellevoetsluis was reinforced and Heiligerlee and Tijger were posted before the harbor.  Maneuvers in a squadron  In May 1871 Heiligerlee steamed from Rotterdam to Dordrecht and hit one of the bridges over the Meuse. Later she made a trip from Werkendam to Willemsdorp on the Nieuwe Merwede. In August 1871 it sailed to Zierikzee with the Tijger and the Krokodil. On 16 August the same ships left Hellevoetsluis again, and sailed to Vlissingen The Heilgerlee was part of the Squadron under Rear Admiral J.J. Wichers consisting of the Ram Turrets Buffel and Schorpioen, the monitors Heiligerlee, Krokodil and Tijger, and Peddle Steamer Valk. The squadron arrived in Antwerpen on 18 August 1871 to repatriate the bodies of soldiers killed in the 1832 Siege of the Citadel of Antwerpen. After visiting the Moerdijk the squadron reached Hellevoetsluis, where it was disbanded. In March 1872 Lieutenant 1st class W.F. Meijen became commander of Heiligerlee. After an uneventful year the monitor wintered in Rotterdam. In August 1873 Heiligerlee was near Tiengemeten with the Krokodil and the Tijger. The squadron was to test a barrier of ropes that would bar the 'Hitsertsche Gat' north of the island. The test was successful: The Tijger got stuck in the ropes and had to be pulled back to Hellevoetsluis, where divers removed the ropes. J.A. Ro√´ll was appointed to replace Meijen by 31 March 1874. In August 1875 the monitor Adder collided with Heiligerlee. The ram of Adder hit Heiligerlee on the port side between the first mast and the turret, and made a big hole below the waterline / armor. The double bottom and compartimentalization made that Heiligerlee stayed afloat and reached Hellevoetsluis under its own power. The damage was fixed in a few days in the dry dock. On 15 October 1875 Heiligerlee was taken out of service, and Ro√´ll relieved of his command., a measure probably meant to economize on the fleet. On 16 May 1876 Heiligerlee would be taken into service again under Lieutenant 1st class K.W.E. von Leschen. After being taken out of service again later in the year, Heiligerlee went to Feyenoord, where she got new boilers and other repairs.  Heiligerlee is laid up: 1877‚Äì1887 In April 1877 Heiligerlee went to Hellevoetsluis to be laid up. On 15 September 1884 Heiligerlee arrived in Amsterdam under tow.  Re-armament  In 1886 the Heilgerlee was re-armed at the Rijkswerf in Amsterdam. The two 23cm muzzle-loading armstrong guns were replaced by a single 28 cm breech loading Krupp gun, known in Holland as '28 cm A. No 1', 22 calibers long.  Service record: 2nd Term 1887‚Äì1895 To all appearances Heilgerlee had not been in service for 10 years when she was taken into service on 21 June 1887, under lieutenant 1st class A.J. Krabbe. One of its first actions was to experiment with an electrical light of 25,000 candles. The ship then went to Ijmuiden from where she left for Hellevoetsluis on 8 July. From there she participated in maneuvers near Willemstad in August. In late August she steamed from Hellevoetsluis to Rotterdam. While there in the evening of 27 August, the demonstration of its electrical search light made a huge impression on the locals. In October 1887 the Heilgerlee was decommissioned in Amsterdam 'in the usual way' On 1 May 1892 Heiligerlee was commissioned again. Captain O.C.A.J. Moreau would command Heiligerlee, three other monitors and 4 gunboats. In early May the Heilgerlee, the Cerberus and the gunboats Wodan, Thor and Brak left Amsterdam for Terschelling, where they exercised. After returning to Amsterdam Heiligerlee made several cruises on the Zuiderzee. While sailing on the Zuiderzee and exercising with the turret, a leg of one of its sailors got stuck and was crushed. Heiligerlee next visited Harlingen, where one of its sailors saved a 4-year-old from drowning. On 21 July 1892 Moreau's squadron, consisting of Heiligerlee, Panter, Tijger, Krokodil and gunboats Wodan, Thor and Hadda, arrived in Nieuwe Diep from the Zuiderzee. In September 1892 Vice-Admiral Mac Leod organized exercises near Enkhuizen. Due to the use of electrical light these were viewed by hundreds of spectators. Heiligerlee was planned to decommission in October 1892. In 1893 Heiligerlee seems to have remained in dock.  An embarrassing incident near Urk  In March 1894 Heiligerlee went into dry dock. It was August when she was put into service again under Captain-Lt W.G. van Nes. On 1 September she arrived in Nieuwediep. She later sailed to Terschelling for some shooting exercises. On 11 October 1894 the Heilgerlee lost its course on the Zuiderzee. Meeting the Urk fisherman UK-152, the fisher demanded 10 guilders to point out the direction to Urk. After some haggling this was brought down to 5 guilders, and so the fisherman led the way to Urk.. On 16 November Heiligerlee was again decommissioned..  Heiligerlee is laid up again 1896‚Äì1905  In April 1896 Heiligerlee went into dry dock in Amsterdam. She would not sail again for 10 years. Service Record: 3rd term 1905‚Äì1909  Some uneventful cruises  On 1 January 1905 the Heilgerlee was again brought into service under Captain- lt P.C. Swaan. By 18 March 1905 Swaan was replaced by G. Witsen Elias. On 8 July Elias was in turn temporarily replaced by Lieutenant P.H. Cool. On 24 July Captain-Lt J.A.A.C. Ridder van Rappard became the new commander of the Heilgerlee. By 3 July 1906 Captain-lt J.W. Termijtelen became commander of Heiligerlee. He made some uneventful cruises.  A strike in Rotterdam  On 16 January 1907 Captain-Lt H.M. van Straaten became the new commander of Heiligerlee. On 4 June 1907 she got stuck near Urk. Later that year she sailed to Harlingen and Nieuwediep. In September 1907 Heiligerlee sailed to Rotterdam together with the Piet Hein. She was ordered to assist the authorities and the monitor Matador in keeping order during a large strike by the dock workers. During the conflict Heiligerlee was in the Spuikanaal and guarded a ship housing workers from Germany, who had been hired to break the strike. While the Heilgerlee was in the Spoorhaven, a rowboat tried to reach the ship with the foreign workers in the evening of 26 October. The Marines guarding the harbor noticed this, and some shots were exchanged. According to the socialist news the rowboat was sunk by the guard stationed at Heiligerlee. After the authorities were convinced that the conflict had been resolved, Heiligerlee left Rotterdam for Hoek van Holland on 25 November 1907. On 29 November Heiligerlee arrived in IJmuiden  Towards the end of her service  On 16 January 1908 Captain-lt K.J. Karseboom became the new commander of Heiligerlee Heiligerlee made its usual trips, including a visit to Harlingen. It seemed that Heiligerlee was on her way to even more unevetnful years of service, when in late November 1908 the Algemeen Handelsblad started an influential serie of articles called 'the battle-worthiness of our fleet'. The series ended with a recommendation to decommission the Heilgerlee and Renier Claeszen. The specific complaint about Heiligerlee was that 111 men were employed to operate one outdated gun.  Decommissioned and broken up  On 8 December 1908 the government decided to decommission Heiligerlee on 6 January 1909. This news did not imply that the Heilgerlee would be decommissioned, but this was soon thought. In late 1909 the proposed budget for 1910 stated that Heiligerlee would be sold. This was planned for 21 April 1910 The auction was won by the Ship breakers Company R. Bos Pzn. from Dordrecht for 42,000 guilders. The Heilgerlee was then towed from IJmuiden to Dordrecht by the tugboat Gouwzee from L.

Education From 1970 to 1974, Brey attended La Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas San Alejandro. In 1974, Brey enrolled at La Escuela Nacional de Arte, a prestigious art school in Havana focused on craft and developing the technical skills of the profession. 1977‚Äì1981: early career In 1977, Brey collaborated with Volumen I, a group of young artists committed to artistic experimentation in Cuba, opposed to the socialist-realism artistic mandates of the Cuban Revolution. The group organized itself as a discussion forum for community-building among young Cuban artists.Sandra Sosa Fern√°ndez, The Futility of Good Intentions (Gent: MER. Paper Kunsthalle, 2014), p. 124. During this period, Brey produced works on paper referencing late-18th-century Spanish painting traditions, stylistically utilizing frottage and collage as methodologies in his drawings. Brey also worked as an educator at Casa de la Cultura, Jaruco, with fellow artist Gustavo P√©rez Monzon leading outdoor drawing workshops for the institution's visitors, which primarily consisted of children and the elderly. At this time, Brey began to explore the writings of anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss, whose theories on the formations of culture influenced Brey for years to come. In 1981, Brey organized the landmark Volumen I exhibition at the Centro de Arte Internacional, Havana, along with fellow artists Jos√© Bedia, Juan Francisco Elso, Jos√© Manuel Fors, Flavio Garciand√≠a, Israel Le√≥n, Rogelio L√≥pez Mar√≠n, Gustavo P√©rez Monz√≥n, Tom√°s S√°nchez, Leandro Soto, and Rub√©n Torres Llorca. In two weeks, the exhibition drew over 8,000 visitors and ushered in a new era of conceptual art in Cuba, referred to as the \\"Cuban Renaissance.\\" 1982‚Äì1989: travels and developments At the invitation of Luis Camnitzer, Brey traveled to the United States for the first time in 1985 to be an artist-in-residence at SUNY Old Westbury. The same year he exhibited The Structure of Myths, an early installation work combining recreations of Giovanni da Verrazzano's logbooks with traditional Santer√≠a offerings at SUNY's Amelie A. Wallace Gallery.Alex Santana, Ricardo Brey: Doble Existencia/Double Existence (New York: Alexander Gray Associates, 2019), p. 71 Also in 1985, Brey traveled to Native American reservations in South Dakota, a trip organized by Jimmie Durham. Brey spent a month with the Lakota indigenous community. Brey then visited and lived in Mexico City for 11 months from 1986 to 1987. During this time, he produced a series of stenciled and illustrated drawings based on natural elements. 1990‚Äìpresent In 1990, Brey was invited by Belgian curator Jan Hoet to participate in the exhibition Ponton Temse in Belgium. He temporarily moved to Belgium to prepare for his inclusion in the exhibition. At this time, he dropped \\"Rodriguez\\" from his surname to honor his mother's memory, and continues to use the name \\"Ricardo Brey.\\"Sandra Sosa Fern√°ndez, The Futility of Good Intentions (Gent: MER. Paper Kunsthalle, 2014), p. 132 The following year, following a brief return to Cuba, Brey permanently settled in Ghent, Belgium. Brey was also included by Jan Hoet in Documenta IX in Kassel, (Germany), where he produced a large-scale installation. Incorporating materials like Coca-Cola, glass panes, tattered window blinds, soiled pillows, and strewn feathers, this work evoked a sensation of disaster and was conceptually in line with the principles of multiculturalism of the time. Hybrid ambiguity became a catalyzing force in Brey's practice. Brey began to experiment with small-scale drawings of natural flora and fauna. Produced over 1,000 drawings over a period of six months and titled the series Universe. As Brey describes, \\"That is how \\"Universe\\" (2002‚Äì2006) came about. I wasn't creating the universe, just my universe, with all my anxieties, my dreams, my leitmotifs. All the techniques I‚Äôve used, and even some I invented at the time, were in the drawings.\\"Sandra Sosa Fern√°ndez, The Futility of Good Intentions (Gent: MER. Paper Kunsthalle, 2014), p. 148 In 2009, Brey began his series Every Life is a Fire, consisting of archival boxes that unfold to reveal books, drawings, sculptures, and performative proposals. Brey points out \\"The project with the boxes, Every life is a fire, is my most metaphysical work, and it came to me as an obligatory answer to the beauty and the consideration of the small space.\\"Sandra Sosa Fern√°ndez, The Futility of Good Intentions (Gent: MER. Paper Kunsthalle, 2014), p. 153 Brey was included in All The World‚Äôs Futures, the 56th Venice Biennale, curated by Okwui Enwezor in 2015. In 2019, Brey's work will be exhibited in solo exhibition in Museum de Domijnen, Sittard, Netherlands and Gerhard-Marcks-Haus, Bremen, Germany.

One of the most common types, Pitting Enamel Hypoplasia (PEH), ranges from small circular pinpricks to larger irregular depressions. Pits also vary in how they are occur on a tooth surface, some forming rows and others more randomly scattered. PEH can be associated with other types of hypoplasia, but it is often the only defect observed. Causes of PEH can range from genetic conditions to environmental factors, and the frequency of occurrence varies substantially between populations and species, likely due to environmental, genetic and health differences. The most striking example of this is in Paranthropus robustus, with half of all primary molars, and a quarter of permanent molars, displaying PEH defects, thought to be caused by a specific genetic condition, amelogenesis imperfecta. Pitting enamel hypoplasia, in an individual with amelogenesis imperfecta. It is not always clear why PEH forms instead of other hypoplasia types, particularly linear enamel hypoplasia. However, the position on the crown, the tooth type and the cause of the disruption are all likely contributing factors. It has been suggested that because it is relatively rare to have both linear enamel hypoplasia and PEH, these types of defects may be commonly caused by different factors. Each pit is linked to the ceasing of ameloblasts at a particular point in enamel formation. Sometimes, only a couple of ameloblasts stop forming enamel, leading to small PEH defects, with large pits forming when hundreds of these enamel-forming cells stop production. This does not occur in other forms of enamel hypoplasia, such as linear and plane-form, in which all ameloblast activity is affected. Typically with PEH described in archaeological reports, researchers can not specify a cause, with a non- specific stress often concluded. However, in modern clinical studies it is often possible to suggest a cause and these can include the following conditions: * hypocalcaemia * vitamin D deficiency * amelogenesis imperfecta * nutritional deficiency * maternal diabetes mellitus * congenital syphilis * premature birth * low birth weight * hypoparathyroidism * neonatal tetany * kernicterus  References  Category:Developmental tooth disorders Category:Dental enamel ","title":"Pitting enamel hypoplasia"},{"id":"60182921","text":"Kyle John Forti (1989 ‚Äì March 3, 2019) was an American political consultant, active in Colorado.

It joined the Dublin‚ÄìRosslare railway line at Woodenbridge halt. The single track line closely followed the course of the Aughrim River to Aughrim and then the Derry River to Shillelagh. A short spur from Aughrim served the Aughrim Flour Mills. Passenger services ended in 1944 due to coal shortages which became critical during The Emergency, and though there were hopes of it re-opening this never happened. However, the line remained open for goods as far as Aughrim until 1952, serving Forgarty's Flour Mills. The line was officially closed and lifted the following year. A walking trail was developed in 2005 on a 2.7km section of the old alignment near Tinahely. Fitzwilliam connection In order for the DW&WR; to continue its main line to Wexford it needed around 1860 to purchase lands from Earl Fitzwilliam. As part of those negotiations Lord Fitzwilliam hinted he desired a branch line to his home at Shillelagh on his Coolattin Estate. Following his agreement to donate land and other resources, the relevant Bill was passed and construction of the branch line commenced in March 1864. For obvious reasons the line was also known as The Fitzwilliam Railway. Operations The line was often allocated weaker or non-standard locomotives, in the period 1925 to 1930 the 0-6-0 No. 50, was allocated to the line. Stations Woodenbridge Woodenbridge Junction station (1865-1964) was originally an exchange platform between the Dublin to Rosslare main line and the start of the Shillelagh branch. It included its own branch platform, foot bridge, sidings, goods shed and turntable. Only the semi-derelict 1876 station house survives. By 1993 it had been relaid as a single track. Aughrim The railway to Aughrim was reached in January 1865. The station included a passing loop, goods shed, signal box, cattle pens and a short spur to Aughrim Flour Mills. Both the station building and the goods shed have survived, as respectively, a private dwelling and a car dealership. Ballinglen Although the line reach Ballinglen by 1865, the station itself wasn't built until 1876, some eleven years later. This followed a complaint from the Fitzwilliam estate that the railway had reneged on a promise to build a station there. It was built for a cost of ¬£90 and consisted of a modest station house and platform with no other facilities. The station house survives as a private dwelling. Tinahely Tinhely station was a candidate for a branch to Hacketstown but in the end this did not come to pass. It included a passing loop, signal box and goods shed. The station house survives as a private dwelling. Shillelagh Station Shillelagh station opened on 22 May 1865 as the terminus. The Fitzwilliam Family of the Coolattin Estate had exclusive use of a private waiting room at the station. The station included a signal box, goods shed, engine shed, sidings and two turntables. The substantial station house survives as a private dwelling, as do some more modest staff cottages.

Content The fourteen-track album was released digitally and on compact disc with Nine Mile Records, on October 18, 2011. It was produced and engineered by Stephanie Morgan in her basement studio, mixed by Jeff Knor at Collapseable Studios in Asheville, North Carolina, and mastered by Seva at Soundcurrent Studios in Knoxville, Tennessee. The cover art is by Jenny Greer at Sound Mind Media. Five or six of the songs of starfruit arose from an art project assignment she shared with friends. Morgan explains that \\"we gave each other assignments every week[,] writing a song in a particular tempo or rhythm, or one inspired by a movie. And it made us do things we might not normally do.\\" Songs from starfruit were posted online for fans, and the collection of singles formed the nucleus for the album. Conceptually, Morgan describes the album as a \\"universe [that] leapt out of the grayness\\", adding \\"track by track, a mouthwatering other-world materialized, hovering a few feet above some cheap microphones, a laptop and the pit of the stormy sea.\\" The album is described as \\"lush, sophisticated pop, hip-hop [with] jazzy atmospherics.\\" It draws comparison to the music of Massive Attack, Tune-Yards, and Janet Jackson. The CD release party for starfruit was held at the Lexington Avenue Arts & Fun Festival, on September 3, 2011, where they performed on the Arts2People electric stage. The album was digitally reissued with Mint 400 Records, in 2015. Reception A review by Ryan Snyder in Yes! Weekly says the album is \\"both a tribute to and a product of the most impulsive part of the psychic apparatus, a romantic notion in theory, but rarely consonant in praxis.\\" He commends their rendition of Dream Academy's \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", saying that it is an \\"infectious and uplifting recitation of the once carefree middle-class lifestyle, and it's a rarity in pop music where tasteful jazz drums can push a song from good to great\\", however notes the \\"overdubbed vocal tracks and misplaced outbursts obscure and complicate Morgan's dynamic range and the band's driving rhythm on \\"Life of Pi.\\"\\" In comparison with their prior albums, Top40-Charts notes \\"the sprawling fourteen-track effort touches on all of the band's many influences [and] has a much looser, more organic feel[,] while retaining the band's penchant for intricate arrangements, unusual textures, and virtuosic playing.\\" A The Daily Times reviewer says, \\"with vocals as smoky and sultry as a glass of red wine[,] starfruit drips with a complex weave of layers and studio bells and whistles that give the album a lush, expansive sound.\\" San Antonio Express- News says starfruit \\"takes Morgan's precious confessional talents and mashes them with a ghostly, childlike quality, amplified by toy pianos and bell-like interludes that would feel at home at a rave, alt-rock club or mix-tape party.\\" Tracklisting Personnel *Stephanie Morgan ‚Äì vocals, guitar and synths *Chuck Lichtenberger ‚Äì piano, rhodes, synths and backing vocals on \\"so low\\" *Tim Haney ‚Äì drums Additional musicians *Susanne Hackett ‚Äì additional vocals on \\"cinematic\\" *Sarah Hurd ‚Äì violin orchestra *Jonathan Pearlman ‚Äì guitar *Justin Ray ‚Äì flugelhorn and trumpet *Jon Reid ‚Äì marimba, rhodes, melodica, ukulele and bass on \\"house of many colors\\" *Matthew Richmond ‚Äì vibraphone, bells and percussion *Jacob Rodriguez ‚Äì baritone and tenor sax, bass clarinet and hand claps References Citations Bibliography   * Category:2011 albums Category:Indie pop albums by American artists Category:Mint 400 Records albums Category:stephanies«êd albums ","title":"Starfruit (album)"},{"id":"60183223","text":"Jona Rizvanolli (born 2 May 1992) is an Albanian professional racing cyclist.

In 1145, Alp conspired to kill Zengi‚Äôs deputy Na≈üƒ´r al-Dƒ´n Jaqar and take control of Mosul. His co-conspirator was likely Farrukh-ShƒÅh ibn Mahm≈´d, who provided assurances that the army would support Alp. Na≈üƒ´r was killed by Alp, Farrukh or their followers (according to different sources), and his head thrown for effect towards Zengi‚Äôs forces. Qadi Taj al-Din Yahya ibn Shahrazuri encouraged Alp to take control of the citadel at Mosul, escorting him there, where he and his followers were arrested by Zengi loyalists. Zengi dispatched his commander Zain-ad-Din ‚ÄòAli K√ºch√ºk to control the situation. The conspirators were executed and Alp was kept close to Zengi until his death in 1146. Alp Arslan was then replaced by Zengi‚Äôs son Saif ad- Din Ghazi I who had him imprisoned.

It is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization funded by private donations, earned revenue, memberships and grants.  Main Street Well Field History A source of drinking water since at least 1885, the Main Street Well Field site was constructed in the early 1900s and serves as the primary water supply for Elkhart residents. Groundwater contamination resulting from industrial manufacturing runoff was identified at the site in 1981. Over the following decade, Superfund measures were put in place to correct these issues to the satisfaction of the EPA and state authorities. There are currently 15 active wells that continue to be monitored. The Wellfield Botanic Gardens In 2002, the Rotary Club of Elkhart conceived of the gardens as a community service project to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Rotary International. Modeled after the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the goal was to create a community asset that served locals and tourists alike, preserving the natural habitat and contributing positively to the local economy. The project was officially handed over to the Wellfield Botanic Gardens Board of Directors in 2005 and construction began in 2006. Budgeted at approximately $11 million, construction was planned to take place in 7 phases over 10 years. The well field land remains the property of the City of Elkhart, and Wellfield Botanic Gardens signed a 99-year lease in 2005 to operate the not-for-profit botanic garden. Garden Collections Wellfield Botanic Gardens features over 20 individual gardens including an English-style garden, a waterfall garden, and an \\"Adventure Path\\" for children. The Conversation Garden Walkway trail includes memorial pavers that can be purchased in memory of a loved one or to commemorate a special event.

Polynesian multihull terminology , such as \\"ama\\", \\"aka\\" and \\"vaka\\" (or \\"waka\\"\\") are multihull terms that have been widely adopted beyond the South Pacific where these terms originated. This Polynesian terminology is in common use in the Americas and the Pacific but is almost unknown in Europe, where the anglo-saxon terms \\"hull\\" and \\"outrigger\\" form normal parlance. Outriggers, catamarans, and outrigger boats are a common heritage of all Austronesian peoples and predate the Micronesian and Polynesian expansion into the Pacific. They are also the dominant forms of traditional ships in Island Southeast Asian and Malagasy Austronesian cultures, where local terms are used. Etymology The term vaka or waka means \\"boat\\" or \\"canoe\\" in most Polynesian languages. It comes from Proto-Austronesian *aba≈ã , meaning \\"ship\\" or \\"canoe\\". Cognates in other Austronesian languages include Ivatan Awang, Tagalog bangka, Malay wangkang, and Fijian waqa.  \\"Ama\\", \\"aka\\" and \\"vaka\\" The term ama is a word in the Polynesian and Micronesian languages to describe the outrigger part of a canoe to provide stability. Today, among the various Polynesian countries, the word ama is often used together with the word vaka (Cook Islands) or waka (MƒÅori) or va'a (Samoa Islands, Tahiti), cognate words in various Polynesian languages to describe a canoe. The Polynesian term vaka is the main hull, the ama is the outrigger, and the aka or iako (Hawaiian) is the support connecting the two (not three) hulls. The term ama and aka have been widely applied to modern trimarans. In modern sailing, the term is sometimes used to refer to the outrigger on double-outrigger canoes (trimarans), or the two sections of a catamaran. However, calling the two sections of a catamaran by the word ama is not technically correct since they are of equal size. A catamaran is technically a wa'a wa'a or double canoe connected by an aka. Men carve a paopao (canoe) on Nanumea Atoll in Tuvalu. Function On a proa, the ama may provide lift or ballast, depending on whether it is designed to be used to leeward or windward; on a trimaran it is designed primarily to provide lift. There are many shapes of ama; those used in proas are generally laterally symmetric, as the proa is designed to sail with either end forwards, while trimaran ama are one-directional and may have no axis of symmetry. The most advanced ama are composed of highly curved surfaces that generate lift when driven forward through the water, much like an airplane wing. This lift may be directed to the windward, used to counter slipping to leeward, or may be oriented vertically to counter heeling forces from the sailing rig. These highly curved structures are much more difficult to manufacture than traditional ama and are therefore more expensive. The Bruce foil is an example of a type of leeboard often attached to an ama to assist in producing lift. Use of the term in other cultures Even though double-outrigger ships (trimarans, sometimes informally referred to as \\"proas\\" historically) of other related Austronesian groups in Island Southeast Asia, Island Melanesia, and Madagascar didn't reach Polynesia or Micronesia, they may also sometimes use Polynesian terminology in modern times, especially when used in sport sailing.

For Color Fields, she created \\"walls\\" of stretched, hand-dyed yarn dipped in scented oils and strung at angles across corners or between walls and floors in an exploration of perceptual space, mood, and memory.

The show also featured a series of recurring images of transience (a bouquet, a sunset), mounted with different materials and arrangements that investigated the relationships between symbol, sentiment, experience and context. In her most recent work, Wolfe-Suarez engages feminist and process-based traditions, using experimental materials such as wax, scents, and dyes extracted from ocean plants, saltwater and shells.

She is married to Mehdi Khalaji, the Libitzky Family Fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and an advocate of economic sanctions against Iran.  Media activities  She started as a journalist in reformist newspapers in late 1990s, including covering the parliament at Hambastegi newspaper. Later in mid 2000s she directed a news agency linked to Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran, which was headed by Hamid Baghaei, a Vice President and confident to President Ahmadinejad.  Political involvement  As a member of the main reformist party, Islamic Iran Participation Front, she ran an unsuccessful campaign for a seat in Tehran in 1996 Iranian legislative election. In 2008, she switched sides and was endorsed by allies of the President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the 2008 Iranian legislative election to no avail. In 2014, she cofounded Idea Center for Arts and Culture LLC with her husband Mehdi Khalaji and published a web magazine, Ghalamro. The company was dissolved in 2017.  Corruption charges  In two separate cases, she is accused of embezzling public funds in Iran. In 2010, as the international sanctions against Iran intensified, she founded various companies in Iran and Turkey to help Iran bypass the sanctions and sell its petrochemical products. In March 2019, Marjan Sheikholeslami Aleagha was formally accused of being involved in a giant embezzlement court case of a value of 6.6 billion EU of the assets of Iran National Petrochemical Company while attempting to bypass Iran sanctions. Marjan Sheikholeslami Aleagha fled Iran in and took asylum in Canada. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Sheikholeslami is accused of working closely with Reza Hamzehlou, the then CEO of Iran's Petrochemical Commercial Company which was just privatised by Ahmadinejad's government, to embezzle ‚Ç¨6.6b of petrochemical exports under the sanctions. The case is described by Shargh newspaper as the biggest corruption case in Iranian history. She is charged with ‚Ç¨7,065,529 in one case and $8,710,384 embezzlement in another by an ongoing trial in Tehran. In another case, Sheikholeslami is accused of receiving funds from Sepanir Oil and Gas Energy Engineering Company, which is owned by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, to import goods which she never delivered and escaped Iran to Canada. The amount is not disclosed yet. Personal life While being in a political and journalism and trading career in Iran, Sheikholeslami Aleagha changed her lifestyles drastically from wearing Chador, a conservative veil or Hijab type, to being unveiled while pictured abroad after fleeing from Iran. She also got divorced and remarried, latest with Mehdi Khalaji. The interesting point about her brand new life is that she as a 'helping hand to Iranian government in sanctions bypass' is now married to a right-wing political activist vehemently in favor of sanctions against Iran. This contradiction has attracted a lot of attention in Persian language media, describing the couple as 'one makes sanctions and the other, bypasses them'.

The station opened in 1878 and was closed in January 1951, well before the Beeching Axe took effect. History The line between Garforth and Castleford was opened by the North Eastern Railway (NER) on 12 August 1878. The two intermediate stations on the line ( and Ledstone) opened to passenger traffic at the same time (though goods had started in April 1878). The station was equipped with only one platform on the eastern side of the line (Kippax having the same arrangement). The station was noted in the original NER architects drawings as being Allerton Bywater, but the NER had a common practice of not repeating station names across its network; they already had an Allerton station on the Harrogate to York line. So it is believed that the station took its name from nearby Ledstone Hall, an estate a to the north-east. Even so, in 1915, the spelling was changed again to Ledston. The station was laid out with a single track at the one platform; the entire line was without a passing loop. Services in 1914 were usually six trains each way, four of which ran through to Pontefract. By 1949, this had been curtailed to just three services a day which all terminated and started at . The station, and indeed the line, served a sparse population and so in 1951, just three years after Nationalisation, the station was closed to passengers. Goods traffic continued in the station sidings until September 1963 and the line remained open through the station for freight trains to the adjacent Allerton Bywater colliery. Passenger excursion trains still used the station until the mid-1960s and advertised passenger trains were also diverted over the line and through Ledston when necessary. The station buildings were still in situ in 1983 and the signal box was not demolished until 1988.

Initially, the militia units were centered on the 35 counties that then existed in the Province of North Carolina. The units fought against the British, Loyalists, and Cherokee Native Americans that aligned themselves with British forces. The units included military district brigades established in 1776, county regiments, four battalions, and one independent corps of light horse. Four regiments were located in counties that became part of the Southwest Territory in 1790 and later Tennessee in 1796. The size of brigades could be up to a few thousand volunteers. Brigades were commanded by a brigadier general. Regiments were commanded by a colonel and made up of a number of companies commanded by captains with about 50 men in each company. During engagements, one or more companies of regiments may have been involved in actions and commanded by the regimental or brigade commander. In 1778, Major General John Ashe was selected to command all North Carolina militia and State Troops. Brigade commanders reported to him. Separate from the North Carolina militia, the state provided 10 numbered regiments to the Continental Army that were referred to as the North Carolina Line. Background In August 1775, the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress of North Carolina delegates appointed Cornelius Harnett the head of the Council of Safety which oversaw resistance to British rule. They also divided the colony into six military districts for the purpose of organizing militia and arranging representation in the executive body of the Council of Safety. At the county level, there were Committees of Safety, including the Rowan, Anson, Mecklenburg, Surry, and Tryon counties. Many members of these committees of safety became the officers of the regiments of militia. The North Carolina Provincial Congress authorized 35 existing county militias to be organized on September 9, 1775. Some counties had already established their militias earlier than 1775. The Rowan County regiment was split on October 22, 1775 into two distinct regiment, the 1st Rowan County Regiment and the 2nd Rowan County Regiment. On December 22 that same year, the North Carolina Provincial Council split the Pasquotank County Regiment into two separate and distinct regiments, the 1st and 2nd Pasquotank County regiments. The two additional regiments brought the total number of county regiments to 37 by the end of 1775. Units The following are the North Carolina militia brigades and regiments with their subordination, along with the dates established and disestablished, as well as the original commander when the unit was established by the Provincial Congress. Many counties started mustering and training militia before the Provincial Congress got around to it, as early as October 1774 (Johnson County Regiment). Regiments were subordinated to named brigades after brigades were established in 1776. Brigades were headed by a brigadier general and subordinate to the state militia headed by a major general officer, who reported to the Governor of North Carolina. As new counties were created by the legislature, new regiments were created and some were disbanded. At the time of the Battle of Kings Mountain in October 1780, there were 50 counties and 51 regiments of militia. Many regiments had two colonels. Soldiers and officers from these units were engaged in battles and skirmishes, primarily in North Carolina and South Carolina, but a few engagements were in Georgia, Virginia, and East Florida. As militia units, the soldiers did not serve full-time and returned home between engagements, musters, and drills. {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" summary=\\"Militia units, showing

This part is narrower and shorter than the posterior part of the worm which has thirteen to fifteen segments. On the underside of the posterior part there are two hard brown chitinous plates forming a shield, the margins of which are rimmed with bundles of long chaetae. A number of long, semi-coiled, thread- like gills arise from the base of the shield. Distribution and habitat The range of S. scutata includes the Mediterranean Sea and the western Atlantic Ocean as far north as the English Channel; the type locality is the Gulf of ƒ∞zmir on Turkey's west coast. It prefers depths between . Records of individuals at greater depths are likely to refer to other, as yet undescribed species. [S. scutata: p. 44‚Äì47] It is extending its range and becoming more abundant along the south coast of England. Its typical habitat is mud or other soft sediment, where it lives close to the surface of the substrate. Behaviour This worm lives buried in the sediment with its head down and with its filamentary gills at the surface, presumably to enhance oxygen uptake. It is a detritivore, scooping up and swallowing quantities of mud with its eversible pharynx, and absorbing nutrients as the bulk of material passes along the long, convoluted gut.

Gashry was the son of Francis Gascherie, perfumer, of Lamb's St, Stepney and his wife Susanna. Gashry's parents both originated from La Rochelle, France and his father was naturalized in 1709 as ‚ÄòGascherye‚Äô... Gashry was Inspector of the captains‚Äô journals and secretary to Sir Charles Wager in 1737, when Wager was first Lord of the Admiralty and was himself commissioner for sick and hurt seamen. He continued in Wager's service when Wager was assistant secretary to the Admiralty in 1738. Wager brought Gashry in as Member of Parliament for Aldeburgh at a by-election on 30 March 1741 and promoted him as a commissioner of the navy in 1741. At the 1741 British general election Gashry was returned unopposed as Wager's candidate at East Looe on the interest of Edward Trelawny. In 1742 he appeared before a secret committee appointed to inquire into Walpole's Administration to give evidence on the payment of secret service money during Wager's election for Westminster in 1741. He was appointed comptroller of victualling accounts in 1744. In 1747 he resigned his office which, under the Place Act of 1742, was about to become incompatible with a seat in the Commons. At the 1747 British general election he was returned unopposed again for East Looe. When Trelawny went to Jamaica as governor, Gashry became the intermediary between the Government and the Trelawny family, and also personal agent for the governor. Gashry married before 1747, Martha Bolton, widow of Charles Bolton, who was a nephew of Admiral Charles Wager. Through his wife, Gashry succeeded to manor of Rotherhithe, and to Kilmenath, near Looe, when Wager's widow died in 1748. He became a director for the South Sea Company in 1749 and was appointed treasurer and paymaster of the Ordnance in 1751. Gashry was returned unopposed as MP for East Looe at the 1754 British general election. As director of the South Sea Company and Treasurer of the Ordnance, he was consulted by Newcastle on financial matters and subscribed to Government loans. He was returned unopposed at the 1761 British general election. There is no record of his having spoken in Parliament. Gashry died without issue on 19 May 1762 having long been in a declining state.

Cash coins (Indonesian: Uang Kepeng or Oeang K√®p√®ng: Malay: Uang Keping or Pitis; Balinese: Pis Bolong; Javanese: Picis, Pitjis, or Gobok) were introduced by the Chinese based on their imperial coinage to what is today called Indonesia during the Tang dynasty era in China when they were introduced by traders, but they didn't become popular with the local population until the 13th century during the reign the Majapahit empire in the archipelago. Chinese cash coins continued to circulate in the archipelago for centuries, when the Ming dynasty banned trade with the region many local rulers started creating their own imitations of Chinese cash coins which were often thinner and of inferior quality. Cash coins produced in Indonesia were made from various materials such as copper-alloys, lead, and most commonly tin. In Indonesia cash coins are often used in various forms of superstitions and rituals which earns them the nickname \\"magic coins\\", local cash coin-based amulets (Gobog Wayang) based on these cash coins serve a similar place in Indonesian culture as their Chinese counterparts do in Chinese culture, these amulets also date back to the Majapahit period and are used by both the ethnic Chinese and the native population.De Munten van Nederlandsch Indi√´, by Netscher and Van der Chijs Batavia, Dutch East Indies - 1863) (in Dutch). The ceremonial usage of cash coins is most prevalent on the island of Bali where they can often be found sewn onto clothing as well as made into forms of jewelry and statuary objects. Cash coins in Bali are often sold at shops that cater to tourists, the \\"junk\\" and \\"antique\\" section of local traditional markets (known as pasar), and in specialised cash coin stores.Living in Indonesia - Living in a Rupiah World.

On Java the Chinese picis (cash coins) replaced local gold and silver coins during the Majapahit period, the reason why copper cash coins replaced them was the fact that the size of the local gold and silver coins were too small, so they could easily fall and disappear. While the Chinese picis money has a hole in the middle so they could be strung together with rope with 200 pieces per string and be practically carried around everywhere with ease making them harder to lose. Local gold and silver coins would remain for large transactions while copper picis became the norm for smaller transactions. During the colonial period the Chinese population were important for the local economy and used picis for their daily transactions in the smaller villages of the countryside which were both imported from China and locally produced, during the period of VOC rule these copper, tin, and lead picis circulated in small villages in lieu of the copper VOC duit pieces.Imexbo.nl, Imexbo.org, Imexbo.eu Chinezen en/in Indi√´. by Imexbo.

According to a popular legend Chinese cash coins (Balinese: Pis Bolong) were introduced to Bali around the year 12 AD when the ancient Balinese King Sri Maharaja Aji Jayapangus married the Han dynasty princess Kang Cin Wei and the princess asked the King if Chinese cash coins could become a part of all rituals in Bali, which at the time were considered to be one of the most important things in the daily lives of the Balinese people. After which Chinese cash coins would become a part of the Balinese monetary system replacing barter. Another popular story claims that a Chinese traveler named Fa-Hien introduced cash coins to the region when he went on a journey to what are today called India and Sri Lanka but in 414 AD his ship was stranded on Java after his ship was attacked and damaged by storms. The reliability of these stories is questionable as Chinese cash coins only started appearing in the rest of Nusantara around the 13th century, while Dutch historian R. Gorrid claims that cash coins were already known in Bali around 882 AD. In Bali it is believed that dolls made from cash coins (or Pis Bolong in Balinese) strung together by cotton threads would guarantee that all the organs and body parts of the deceased will be in the right place during their reincarnation.Australian Museum Kepeng (Chinese coins) Bali, Indonesia.

When the Portuguese and Dutch arrived around the 17th century to the Bali Kingdom, European influence did not suppress the circulation of Balinese cash coins but were supplanted with additional European coinages. After Indonesian independence cash coins would remain in the daily usage of the Balinese people well after the introduction of the Indonesian rupiah. Cash coins were used by the Balinese people in their day- to-day lives up until the year 1970, where they was used to buy things like household essentials at marketplaces as well food at schools for children.  Modern usage  Ceremonies in Bali are often considered \\"incomplete\\" without the presence of cash coins, however despite their omnipresence in Balinese Hindu rituals the quality of Chinese cash coins has been steadily decreasing while the demand for them has been increasing rocketing sky-high levels due to the explosive population growth the island has experienced. Another reason for this decline in stock is because during certain Balinese rituals and ceremonies such as the Ngaben cremations (also known as Pitra Yadyna or Pelebon) or rituals for the Butha kala (the lower deities of Hinduism), the cash coins cannot be re-used for other ceremonies. The higher demand met with a lower stock of authentic Chinese cash coins have prompted many local Balinese to produce their own rough duplicate cash coins which are often diminutive in size and weight, thinner, and the Traditional Chinese characters on them are often vague or have even completely disappeared. These local duplicates usually sell for 200 rupiah per coin in the year 2008 while authentic Chinese cash coins go for around 1500 rupiah around that time. Because many people simply don't have a choice many people will buy the modern duplicates while for other people their relatively low price might be the main motivation for their preference because in a minor ritual in a small local temple the quantity of cash coins needed may amount to many thousands of rupiah making it an expensive endeavour if they would prefer authentic Chinese cash coins. Despite this, the usage of imitation cash coins is actually not recommended becoming a rather big problem for many of these rituals, this has become such a big problem that it has come to the attention of the Indonesian government. As a response to this situation Bali Cultural Office formed the Bali Heritage Trust with a vision to keep the local Balinese culture \\"pure\\" and in 2004 launched a programme to make localised Balinese versions of Chinese cash coins which was initiated in the Tojan village, Klungkung Regency building a factory there that mass-produces cash coins for Hindu rituals and accessories which is positioned there alongside a showroom for these cash coins and the UD Kamasan Bali, these coins sold for 750 rupiah in 2008 which was higher than other imitations but cheaper than authentic Chinese cash coins. This project was also facilitated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The cash coin factory in Tojan has equipment to forge and merge different types of metal in its basement while the front of the factory features the showroom, and at the top floor of the factory is where the cash coins-based accessories are made. This factory produces cash coins which differ greatly from the original Chinese cash coins, one of the ways these new cash coins are different is by the fact that they are produced from an alloy known as Panca Datu (which translates as the \\"Five Strengths of Life\\") made from 5 distinct types of metal, these are bronze, copper, iron, silver, and gold which have all have unique meanings in Balinese culture. According to Sukma Swacita (the manager of UD Kamasan Bali in 2008) these cash coins are additionally made from recycled household materials such as broken water taps, second-hand irons. Another feature which sets these cash coins apart from the originals is the fact that instead of having Traditional Chinese characters around the square centre hole these cash coins feature the Balinese characters representing the strength in the four corner points of the compass (\\"Sa\\", \\"Ba\\", \\"Ta\\", and \\"A\\"), over these a Hindu lotus symbol is shown. These cash coins are asked for holy blessings in Penganugerahan ceremonies in Pura Besakih and at the Pura Ulun Danu Batur temple in the hopes that this will convince more people to use these cash coins instead of Chinese cash coins, because of these ceremony Hindu priests have started recommending using these new cash coins calling them \\"a ritual necessity\\". Other than just the cash coins, this factory also produces small statues made from them such as statues of Bhatara Rambut Sedana who is worshipped by the Hindu people of Bali as the God of Wealth. Despite this push for these newly made cash coins by the government some people hold on to the older Chinese cash coins for ritualistic purposes because they believe that such coins have divine powers, this is due to their symbolism and association with Wayang characters. Some people believe that cash coins Rejuna (the local name for Arjuna) symbolic markings will supposedly bestow its carrier with the charm and agility of this legendary figure. As of 2008 many people who perform Balinese rituals still prefer original Chinese cash coins over the locally produced versions.

She is best remembered for the character and mood she conveyed in her portraits and for the realism in her pen-and-ink drawings for the Rainy Lake Chronicle, a weekly Minnesota newspaper with an international readership.  Early life  Genevieve (Gene) Ritchie was the daughter of an electrician. She graduated from Denfeld High School in Duluth, Minnesota, in 1927. She hoped to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Although she was able to pass the entrance exam, the cost was too expensive. Instead she signed up for art lessons with local painters David Ericson and A. E. Schar. One of Ritchie's earliest works was a self-portrait that earned her first place in the Duluth Art Institute's annual Arrowhead Art Exhibition. The painting garnered attention from national art critics, leading the portrait to be featured on the cover of Art Digest. The magazine described her as \\"the find of the year\\" in 1930. Ritchie earned a teaching certificate at Duluth State Teachers College and then transferred to the University of Minnesota. She taught art at the Phyllis Wheatley Settlement House. She also gave private lessons and opened a painting studio to sell her portraits and teach classes. University student George Monahan was an early customer and married her a year and a half after she finished his portrait. Monahan's husband joined the Army just before World War II. This prompted her to enroll in the University of Minnesota's graduate program in art education, partly in case something happened to him. She supported her children during the war by working as supervisor of art for Faribault Public Schools. She had three children.  Art career  In 1955, Monahan's family moved to New York City, where she opened the Studio Gallery in Greenwich Village. She received a scholarship to study and teach at the National Academy School of Fine Arts. Although pressured by other Village artists to work in the abstract style, she refused. Her paintings were praised by Village Voice art critics for their light-filled natural tones and confident brushwork. Friends and family drew the couple back to Minnesota in 1960. They bought a home in Ranier, Minnesota, in 1963 and spent time on the Rainy Lake islands of conservationist Ernest Oberholtzer.Gene Ritchie Monahan papers, 1884‚Äì1993. Manuscripts Collection, Minnesota Historical Society, St. Paul. Monahan continued her work as part of a colony of local artists. She expanded her portfolio to include silk screening and bookbinding, and experimented with sculpture and pottery using local clays. In the early 1970s, Time magazine's bureau chief, Ted Hall, left New York City and moved to Ranier to establish the Rainy Lake Chronicle. He called on Monahan to illustrate stories and create cover art. Monahan's drawings and paintings came to represent the people, places, and natural elements of the border lakes region. Author and environmentalist Sigurd Olson said her work \\"caught the details of the changing seasons, the little things that appear almost without expecting them, the flash of a gull's wing in the early spring, the freezing of the lake, the sounds and rumbles, the thawing in the spring.\\" Throughout her career, Monahan received national acclaim. In the late 1950s, she was elected president of New York City's branch of the National League of American Pen Women. She won first prize in portrait art at a Smithsonian National Gallery of Art exhibition in 1962. She was invited to present the first one-woman show in the Little Gallery at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (1964). For two summers in the late 1960s, she was invited to paint and teach art to members of the Sandy Lake First Nation in Ontario. Among those who sat for Monahan's portraits were pianist Van Cliburn, Canadian First Nations artists Norval Morrisseau and Carl Ray, Minnesota governor Rudy Perpich, conservationists Ernest Oberholtzer and Frances Andrews, and the wife of O. Meredith Wilson. Her work is held in public, corporate, and private collections worldwide. Monahan died on February 12, 1994, at the age of 85. Her work continues to be exhibited, and was shown in Duluth in 2015, Grand Marais in 2016,\\"Gene Ritchie Monahan: Retrospective.\\" Art exhibit brochure.

Life and career  Ross was born in Ottawa, Ontario, to William Lebreton Ross and Caroline Stewart Lapman. She studied art at the Winnipeg School of Art under the tutelage of Group of Seven artist Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald. She later studied under the direction of another Group of Seven artist, Frederick Horsman Varley, at the short-lived British Columbia College of Art ‚Äì forerunner of the Vancouver School of Art which later became the Emily Carr University of Art and Design. She studied ceramics under Rex Mason, Carleton Ball, Konrad Sadawski, and Kyllikki Salamenhakra at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Ross was the recipient of several awards in ceramics including the Canadian Handicrafts Guild, 2nd best group of entries in 1953; the UBC Art Gallery Purchase Award in 1954; Prize for bowl from the Canadian Handicrafts Guild in 1955; the Independent Order of the Daughters of the Empire (IODE) at the British Columbia Potters 8th Annual Exhibition of 1956; and Gold at the Prague International Exhibition in 1962. During her career she also exhibited widely both in Canada and abroad. Major exhibitions include the Canadian Pavilion at Expo 67, the Universal and International Exhibition in Brussels in 1958, the 3rd International Exhibition of Ceramic Art in Prague 1962, and the Department of Trade & Commerce Exhibitions in Berlin and Florence 1964.  Ross and BC pottery  Ross was instrumental in the growth of pottery as an artistic practice in British Columbia. With Molly Carter, in the late 1940s she taught pottery at Gordon House in West End, Vancouver, which were some of the first independent pottery classes taught in the city. In 1948, Ross, Carter, and Zoltan Kiss took over teaching ceramics classes at UBC's Extension Department in what was the Fine Arts Gallery in the library basement. At the time, the ceramics program was funded by the University Branch of the IODE. In 1952, the classes were re-located to a more permanent home, when the faculty retrofitted a former army barrack that they nicknamed the Pottery Hut. Ross taught part-time at the new facilities along with her former teacher, Rex Mason, as well as Kiss, Sasha Makovkin, Reginald Dixon, and Alice Bradbury. Ross also helped studio potters find viable sources of clay. In 1958, Ross, Olea Davis, Reg Dixon, and Stan Clarke used a grant from the Leon and Thea Koerner Foundation to prepare a report on British Columbia clays for the UBC Extension Department. In 1949, after a visit to the Canadian Guild of Potters in Ontario, Ross, Davis, Avery Huyghe, and Stan Clarke decided to found the Potters Guild of British Columbia. This was accomplished in 1955 with Davis as the first president.

It follows a suburban family beset by unexplainable events that may be linked to the recent disappearance of a young boy. The film premiered at the 2019 SXSW Film Festival and was released on December 6, 2019, to generally positive reviews. Plot Ten- year-old Justin Whitter is abducted while riding his bicycle through a local park. Greg Harper (Jon Tenney) is made lead detective on the case. Evidence in the form of a green pocket knife is found connecting this case to a previous series of abductions which resulted in the conviction of another man many years prior. Harper's family is shown to be going through its own troubles based on an affair his wife, Jackie (Helen Hunt), had been engaged in. Their son, Connor (Judah Lewis), is very resentful toward his mother because of the affair. Mysterious events begin plaguing the house; all the silverware goes missing, several pictures are removed from their frames, Jackie's favorite coffee mug goes missing, and a window repairman is let in by someone inside the house while the family is away. Jackie goes into Connor's room to pick up laundry, and notices a strange mask under his bed. She doesn't ask about it. One day, Jackie's former lover, Todd (Sam Trammell), arrives at the house, and while Jackie is telling him she can't see him anymore, Jackie's coffee mug comes from somewhere and strikes him on the head. Jackie hides him in the basement so she can take Connor to school. While looking around the basement, Todd is hit over the head by an unknown assailant and Jackie comes home to find him dead. She panics and assumes that Connor has killed Todd. She and Greg take the body to a wooded area and bury his body, hoping to give Connor an alibi. While Connor is on the computer, someone sends him a link to a video of someone walking around his own house. We see someone wearing the strange mask in the doorway to his room. Greg and Jackie return home to find Connor tied up in the bathtub with a green pocket knife nearby. Jackie drives Connor to the hospital while Greg searches the house and is attacked with an ax by the frog-masked figure. The film then jumps back in time and reveals that the mysterious happenings in the house are caused by two people, Mindy (Libe Barer) and Alec (Owen Teague), who have been \\"phrogging,\\" hiding in a house unbeknownst to the owners, in the Harper home. Mindy, an experienced phrogger, tries to keep a very low profile so that she never gets caught, while novice phrogger Alec decides he wants to make the family believe they are going insane. Every mysterious occurrence in the film is shown to have been caused by Alec, including the missing silverware and Todd's incapacitation. However, while Todd is in the basement, Mindy witnesses Greg killing him. She goes to alert Alec, only to see him putting Connor in the bathtub. She argues with Alec, who accidentally pushes her down the stairs, knocking her out. Alec hides her in Greg's car. Greg and Jackie return and find Connor in the bathtub; Jackie takes him to the hospital. After Jackie leaves, Greg takes his own car, unknowingly taking Mindy with him. Mindy awakens in the car and when she finds a bag of green pocket knives and Justin Whitter's shirt, realizes that Greg is the kidnapper. When Greg parks the car in the forest, Mindy sneaks out of the car and calls 911, but doesn't have good enough reception for them to hear her. Mindy finds an old trailer with all the abducted children trapped in makeshift closets. As Mindy tries to free them, Greg ambushes her and takes her back to his house. He forces her to stand up before shooting her dead. Greg finally discovers Mindy and Alec's things in the attic room. Alec gets Greg's attention with the record player and attacks him with the ax. Greg knocks Alec out, then stabs himself to make it appear that he's been attacked. Alec reappears holding Greg's gun and tells him he knows he's the kidnapper. Greg recognizes Alec and attempts to explain himself, but Alec makes it clear he doesn't care and shoots and kills Greg. Greg's partner Spitzky arrives and seeing Alec holding the gun, shoots Alec. But when Alec says, \\"Detective Spitzky?\\" he recognizes him. Spitzky finds the bag of evidence in Greg's trunk. The trapped boys are rescued from the trailer.

He was the ninth of ten children born to Mary (n√©e Nevett) Steele (1769‚Äì1836) and James Steele (1760‚Äì1816). Among his many siblings was brother U.S. Representative John Nevett Steele; and sister Mary Nevett Steele, who married John Campbell Henry (the eldest son and heir of Gov. John Henry); Ann Billings (n√©e Steele) Upshur; James Billings Steele; Henry Maynadier Steele; Catharine Sarah Maria (n√©e Steele) Ray; Sarah Maynadier Steele. His paternal grandparents were Anne (n√©e Billings) Steele and Henry Steele, a native of England who emigrated from Whitehaven (on the west coast of Cumbria) to Oxford, Maryland in 1730 and served as a representative of Dorchester County at the convention which met at Annapolis in June 1774. Steele was educated at the Cambridge Public Academy under Rev. Nathaniel Sheldon Wheaton and prepared at St. John's College in Annapolis (formerly known as King William's School) until the age of sixteen when he entered Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut (then known as Washington College). Career Steele began studying the law at the age of eighteen in the offices of Alexander Contee Magruder and David Hoffman, a law professor at the University of Maryland. After he was admitted to the bar in 1830, he quickly became an undisputed leader of the Maryland bar and ranked as one of the foremost lawyers in America. In 1839, he was appointed Deputy Attorney-General for the Baltimore County Court under Josiah Bayley. He held the position under Bayley's successor, George R. Richardson, until 1849.  Charg√© d'Affaires, Venezuela  In December 1849, Steele was appointed Charg√© d'Affaires to Venezuela by U.S. President Zachary Taylor, a member of the Whig Party from Kentucky, during a recess of the U.S. Senate. He presented his credentials in Caracas on January 7, 1850 and was recommissioned on June 24, 1850 after confirmation. He remained in his post after Taylor's unexpected death seven months later in July 1850 when Millard Fillmore became president, and served until October 18, 1853, when he was succeeded by Charles Eames, several months after Democrat Franklin Pierce was sworn in as the 14th president after his defeat of Whig candidate Gen. Winfield Scott. While in his post, he had to contend with Venezuela radical Narciso L√≥pez, who led repeated filibustering expeditions in an attempt to conquer the island of Cuba, then a colony of Spain. The annexation of Cuba was the object of fascination among many in the South, who saw in Cuba a potential new slave state, and L√≥pez had several prominent Southern supporters. L√≥pez made several generous offers to American military leaders to support him, but Taylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, viewed the enterprise as illegal, issuing a blockade, and later, authorized the arrest of L√≥pez and his associates for breach of the Neutrality Act, although they were eventually acquitted by friendly Southern juries. During Fillmore's presidency, L√≥pez began another expedition which ended with his execution by the Spanish, along with several Americans, including the nephew of Attorney General John J. Crittenden, which led to riots against the Spanish in New Orleans. Fillmore and his Secretary of State, Daniel Webster, worked out a series of face-saving measures with the Spanish that settled the crisis without armed conflict. Many Southerners, including Whigs, supported the filibusters, and Fillmore's response helped divide the Whig party in the 1852 election. Reportedly, Steele narrowly escaped death when a band of robbers broke into the United States legation at Caracas in an attempt to steal the money of diplomatic representatives held for safe-keeping by the charg√© d'Affaires. While in Venezuela, he was able to secure settlement of several American's substantial claims which \\"had been so long postponed as to be regarded as hopeless.\\" Later career Upon his return to the United States in 1853, he resumed his legal practice and was involved in nearly all of the most prominent cases before the Maryland courts with his name appearing \\"more frequently in the pages of Maryland reports than any other lawyer of his time.\\" Steele was noted for \\"the clearness of his statements, the strength and force of his logic and his power as a cross-examiner\\" and appeared before the Supreme Court of the United States. From 1872 to 1874, he served as the attorney of Baltimore City. Steele was one of the charter members of the Maryland Club (founded in 1857), and served as one of its first governors. He was also a member of the Maryland Historical Society. Personal life On January 22, 1849, Steele was married to Rosa Londonia Nelson (1825‚Äì1894) in Washington, D.C. She was a daughter of the late Frances (n√©e Burrows) Nelson and John Nelson, a former U.S. Representative who served as the Charg√© d'Affaires to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies under Andrew Jackson and U.S. Attorney General under John Tyler. Her paternal grandfather was Revolutionary War Brig. Gen. and U.S. Rep. Roger Nelson and her maternal grandfather was William Ward Burrows, the second Commandant of the Marine Corps. Together, Isaac and Rosa were the parents of five sons and three daughters, including: * James Nevett Steele (1850‚Äì1916), a minister affiliated with Trinity Church in New York City. He married Helen Hudson Aldrich, a daughter of prominent New York businessman Herman D. Aldrich. * Mary Steele (1852‚Äì1931), who did not marry. * John Nelson Steele (1853‚Äì1933), a lawyer with the firm of Steele, Semmes & Carey who later became general counsel of the Guggenheim Bros.' American Smelting & Refining company. He married Mary Alricks in 1880. * Charles Steele (1858‚Äì1939), a prominent attorney who was a J.P. Morgan & Co. partner for 39 years. He married Ann \\"Nannie\\" Gordon French (1866‚Äì1932), a descendant of Revolutionary War general Hugh Mercer, and the daughter of Seth Barton French, a former Confederate soldier who became a cotton broker and banker after the War. * Rosa Nelson Steele (1861‚Äì1941), who did not marry. * Kate Steele (1862‚Äì1944), who did not marry. * Samuel Tagart Steele (1863‚Äì1942), also a lawyer with Steele, Semmes & Carey, who married Mary Thompson. * Henry Maynadier Steele (1865‚Äì1909), a civil engineer who specialized in railroads. He married Margaret Hollins McKim (1869‚Äì1939) in 1894. Steele died at his home, 14 West Madison Street in Mount Vernon, Baltimore, on April 11, 1891, just shy of his 82nd birthday. After a funeral at Emmanuel Episcopal Church, he was buried at Green Mount Cemetery. Descendants Through his son Charles, he was the grandfather of three granddaughters: Eleanor Herndon Steele (1893‚Äì1977), who married four times, and with her fourth husband established the charitable Steele-Reese Foundation; Nancy Gordon Steele (1894‚Äì1955), who married renowned polo-player Devereux Milburn; and Kathryn Nevitt Steele (1896‚Äì1981), who married Francis Skiddy von Stade Sr., also a star polo player. His great great granddaughter is Frederica Von Stade, the opera singer. His great great grandson is John Steele Gordon, the historian. Honors and legacy In 1872, he was awarded an honorary LL.D. from his alma mater, St. John's College. In 1895, Steele was posthumously described thusly: > Steele was \\"one of the brightest, keenest, analytical legal minds that ever > graced and adorned the bar of Maryland or any State, or shed lustre upon any > court anywhere. As a counsellor, adviser, or practitioner of the law, he > stood without a superior, and when he died he left behind a reputation for > eloquence, soundness in the law, fidelity to every interest intrusted to > him, that has never been surpassed.

Despite the expectation that these \\"Mercer Girls\\" would marry, Ordway remained single and became a successful teacher, school administrator, and suffrage activist. The suffrage activism of Ordway and some of the other \\"Mercer Girls\\" reflected their educational levels, professional status, and the values associated with personal autonomy that promoted their decisions to migrate across the continent to build new lives.  Early Life  Ordway received a good education for a woman of her time, matriculating at the Ipswich Academy in Massachusetts. She taught in Lowell Massachusetts before migrating to Washington when she was in her mid-30s.  Teaching  She taught first in schools on Whidbey Island and in the lumber communities of Port Gamble and Port Madison on the Kitsap Peninsula. She developed a reputation as the best teacher in the territory, according to author Libbie Hawker, and traveled around the area to turn around problem schools. She also launched and taught in Seattle's first dedicated school building.  Suffrage and Public Service  In 1871 Ordway appeared on stage with Susan B. Anthony in Seattle during Anthony's tour of the Northwest promoting the cause of women voting. Ordway became active in the Female Suffrage Association formed after Anthony spoke and served as a delegate to the territorial suffrage convention. Anthony formed the Washington Territory Woman Suffrage Association, a crucial vehicle for suffrage lobbying in the ensuing decades. Thereafter, Ordway returned to teaching in Kitsap County and, in 1881, became the first woman to be elected as a school superintendent in territorial Washington. She served Kitsap County in that position for eight years, solidifying her position as a builder of public schools in Washington territory.

Early childhood education is among the most female-dominated industries in terms of employment. Based on studies, estimates on the percentage of workers in the sector who are men include 1.4%, 2%, 2.4%, and 3%. Reasons for low percentage, challenges and disadvantages There a variety of negative factors related to men in early childhood education that are reasons for the low percentage and/or present challenges and disadvantages to men already working in the field: * The care and education of young children is commonly seen as an extension of women's roles as mothers. Society tends to see women as the adults who stay home and care for the children. This, society generally considers the ECE field to be a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs profession‚Äù, perceiving it as one where women understand it and perform much better than men. * Many men who might otherwise consider entering the field, choose not to for fears of being labeled as gay, or not a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù. * Some people perceive all women to be safe with working directly with young children, whereas any man would be considered suspect for being in the profession, having ulterior motives such as pedophilia or child abuse. * Societally, men are typically the breadwinner of the family. But early childhood education is a low-paying field. This makes the breadwinner model much more difficult for men to follow compared to other professions. Benefits to others > ‚ÄúMen can bring different skills and qualities to the profession which could > help to broaden the curriculum and enhance the quality of the service. > Having a male childcare worker present is good for staff relationships and > brings a healthy mix.‚Äù Research suggests that men ‚Äúdo have different styles > from women in many aspects of their work such as their use of language, > risk-acceptance, physical play and humour, as well as behaviour in staff > meetings, input in policy discussions etc. Men are not better than women, > but they are different and together men and women create a rich culture in > which to raise child‚Äù. Men in early childhood education offer distinct benefits that are either rare, difficult, or impossible to attain in an all-female teacher setting: * Whereas women tend to foster a nurturing, calm, and positive environment, men promote a more active and physical environment. This can be particularly meaningful for boys, as their styles of play, learning, and thinking are more likely to be valued, accepted, and expanded. For girls, it can expose them to new ways of playing, learning, and thinking that they may not have experienced before. * Fathers of children will have someone that they can more closely relate to in their parenting experiences, particularly single fathers because they are raising children alone and thus will likely need to be more autonomous in their parenting life. * Children of single mothers greatly benefit from having a father figure when there is none present in the home. This can happen for reasons such as divorce, separation, abandonment, and incarceration, among others. Additionally, such children have the opportunity experience a positive male role model. * When there are men in their early education settings, children are able to observe and experience positive professional relationships between men and women. At a young age, children absorb much of what is modeled in front of them, so those relationships have a huge lasting impact on them. * Male and female brains process information differently. Thus, male educators offer a new perspective when dealing with situations involving the children. * Early childhood settings that previously had an all-female teaching staff may have had gender issues that no one recognized before. Having a male can challenge those stereotypes in relation to toys and activities. Advantages for male educators Due to the rarity of men in early childhood education, men who do choose to enter the profession can find it easy to obtain employment, and may have more employment options, because of the preference for hiring men. In essence, men tend to have slightly more leverage or pull compared to women with similar qualifications. This is similar to affirmative action. Men in the field may also find rapid promotions to more prestigious and/or lucrative positions compared to their female peers.

B. Hanna (1857‚Äì1926), born Missouri Saunders, was an American suffragist, journalist, publisher and property developer from the state of Washington. She resided in Edmonds for most of her adult life.  Personal life  Missouri Saunders was born February 17, 1857 in Galveston, Texas. Her father was a well-known judge, Levi Saunders. He moved the Saunders family to Arkansas when she was young. She studied at Clarke's Academy in Berryville, Arkansas before marrying J.C. Hanna, an aspiring merchant. In 1882, the Hannas moved with their three young children to Spokane Falls in the Washington Territory to pursue a mercantile business. Hanna was soon widowed, her husband died in a boating accident in Idaho. Shortly after, her 19-year-old son Kirke died from an accidental morphine overdose and her youngest daughter was handicapped from a bicycle accident. In 1904, a widow and single mother, Hanna moved with her two daughters, Florence and Mercie, to Edmonds, Washington. seeking the therapeutic benefits of the salty air.  Career  Hanna had a very active career in journalism, unusual for women during this time, and championed women's right to vote. She was named Washington's \\"mother of journalism\\" by one member of the Snohomish County Press Association for her trailblazing career, particularly with the Edmonds Review-Tribune.  Edmonds Review  She became, in 1904, the first woman newspaper publisher in Washington, when she purchased the Edmonds Review and served as editor and publisher. The newspaper chronicled the early growth and development of Edmonds, then one of the main cities in the northern Puget Sound region. She ran the Review for over five years before selling in 1910 to a rival Edmonds paper, the Tribune, which was launched in 1907 by Will Taylor. The paper then merged into theTribune-Review and served the Edmonds community until the early 1980s. As the first woman news media publisher in Washington, Hanna faced obstacles on the basis of her gender. She was not listed in the Edmonds Chamber of Commerce membership roster, for instance, and was mocked by her competitors. She was a founding member of the Snohomish County Press Association.  Votes for Women and The New Citizen  White women could vote in Washington Territory through a decree in 1867. This right was taken away through subsequent court decisions.Stevenson, Shanna. \\"The Fight for Washington Women's Suffrage: A Brief History.\\" Washington State Historical Society.http://www.washingtonhistory.org/files/library/TheFightforWashingtonWomensSuffrageABriefHistory.pdf Hanna had begun publishing the Votes for Women journal in 1909 championing the suffrage movement. She increased her activity after selling the Review. Votes for Women advocated for women to vote in Washington State and was the official organ of the Equal Suffrage Association, headed by Emma Smith DeVoe. The journal was instrumental in gaining white male support which, on November 10, 1910 led to an amendment of the state;s constitution to extend the right to vote to Washington women. Hanna began publishing a successor journal, The New Citizen, in late 1910. This publication recognized the role of the newly enfranchised women and relayed notes from the state and local meetings of the suffragist association in Washington as well as news of regional, national, and international activities. The journal's policy was to bring \\"the attention of the public to the general question of woman's political enfranchisement and to the special consideration of the amendment granting suffrage to women which is to be voted on in this state in November, 1910.\\" The last issue, in January 1911, after woman suffrage became part of the State Constitution, admonished women to \\"use the ballot that has been given to you.\\" At this point, the publication converted to The New Citizen, recognizing the new role of newly enfranchised women and published with her daughter, Florence Hanna Hamilton; Abigail Scott Duniway served as Oregon editor. Hanna stopped publishing The New Citizen in 1912, due to high publishing costs.  Honors  Upon her death in 1926 she was heralded as the \\"Mother of Journalism\\" in Washington State by The Seattle Times and local Edmonds and Snohomish county newspapers. In 2017, My Edmonds News publisher Teresa Wippel honored Hanna in a heritage competition run by the Edmonds Historical Museum because she was \\"blown away\\" by her accomplishments and invisibility in the history of the city of Edmonds.  Property development  Hanna was a major land developer in Edmonds and developed the Hanna Park neighborhood, which still bears her name.

She is the owner of a music production company Womynly Way Productions, an important contributor to the women's music scene in Toronto during the 1980s. Dworin was introduced to feminism from a women's workshop at the Philadelphia Folk Festival. She moved to Canada in the 1970s, settling in Toronto. Dworin was an important part of the women's festival scene in the United States, sitting on the board of directors of the Association of Women's Music and Culture. She was actively involved in the women's cultural scene in Toronto in the 1980s and 1990s and was involved in the publication of The Other Woman and Broadside: A Feminist Newspaper. She viewed her involvement in music production as a political act, reflecting: \\"[m]aking culture is a way of shaping how people perceive the world and it's a powerful and relatively painless [activity].\\" Music production and concert organizing Dworin founded the music production company Womanly Way Productions in 1980, where she organized concerts in Toronto and southern Ontario featuring women performers. She established an open door policy for her concerts, advertising in both queer and mainstream media. This occasionally led to controversy within the lesbian and feminist communities. In addition to music production, the company and also offered workshops on sound and light editing. In an interview she noted: > ...when I put on a concert, I'm trying to do two things. One is to provide > the meeting place, the sustenance, the emotional support for the lesbian- > feminist community. I know I need that! I wasn't getting enough of it in > Toronto. But the other thing I'm trying to do is outreach - to attract the > broader audience, to make some of the people politically aware. In the 1980s, Dworin's company organized multiple day festival events featuring women. Some notable performers included Holly Near, Meg Christian, Alix Dobkin, Lucie Blue Tremblay, Lillian Allen, Cris Williamson and Heather Bishop. She focused on making events accessible to differently-abled people, including the hearing-impaired, and those who use wheel chairs, as well as providing childcare at all events. Some festivals she produced included: * Spectrum: A Festival of Music, Theatre, Dance, Skillbuilding and Strategizing (1985); * Jointing Hands: A Deaf and Hearing Theatre and Music Festival (1987); *WACCO (Women Across Canada Culturally Organizing) Tour (1987); and * Colourburst: Multicultural Women in the Arts Festival (1987). Womynly Way Productions also put on joint events, including: * Spirit of Turtle Island: Native Women's Festival, co-produced with Dakota-Ojibway Productions (1985) and * Rainbow Women's Festival, co-produced with Multicultural Womyn in Concert (1984). Some records related to Womynly Way Productions were collected by the University of Ottawa as part of the Canadian Women's Movement Archives. Collecting Dworin, along with Kathy Lewis and Lucia Kimber founded the Women's Music Archives in the fall of 1978. The group's aim was \\"to collect and preserve, for herstorical listening and research purposes, all types of materials related to women's music.\\" This material was eventually deposited with the Sophia Smith Collection in 2004.

Life and career  Charmian Johnson was born in Prince Coupe, BC in 1939. She went to Delta High School in Delta, BC then the University of British Columbia to study ceramics from 1967-69. She studied under Glenn Lewis and Mick Henry. She currently lives in Vancouver, BC. Johnson worked as a high school teacher in Creston, BC, as well as an elementary school teacher in West Vancouver, BC. In 1969, Charmian worked as a visiting professor in the Department of Fine Arts at the University of Saskatchewan. Following this, she became a regular guest lecturer at UBC in the Faculty of Education studio program from 1971-1977. Johnson left her position at UBC in 1977 and decided to dedicate herself to ceramics.  Artistic practice  Johnson has been exhibiting her work since 1979.She primarily works with ceramics but has also worked with ink on paper drawings and painting. Having apprenticed with Glenn Lewis and Mick Henry during her graduate studies at UBC she is directly tied to their philosophies linked to Bernard Leach and Japanese Pottery. Johnson went to St.Ives in the late 70s to continue with Leachian theory and document the Leach Pottery collection. She is also influenced by Korean and Chinese ceramics, especially the glazing used in the Ming, Ying and Sung dynasties. She spent some time travelling around the world for artistic research then returned to Canada and began making a series of stoneware gargoyles. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, she changed focus to the production of pots, large bowls, ikebana vases and small boxes.  Exhibitions   Solo  In 1985 \\"An Exhibition of Bowls\\" was shown at The UBC Fine Arts Gallery in Vancouver, BC. In 1987 she had a show at the Terra Cotta Gallery in Vancouver, BC titled \\"The Gargoyle Factory Does Not Often Appear.\\" This exhibition showcased her conceptual exploration of gargoyles. In 1989 her exhibition \\"Flora: Drawings by Charmian Johnson\\" was held at the Vancouver Art Gallery in Vancouver, BC. Johnson later showcased more of her drawings in 2018 in a group exhibition. Her last solo show was in 2002. \\"Temoku: Iron Rich Glazes in Canadian Use.\\" was exhibited at the Canadian Clay and Glass Museum in Waterloo, Ontario.  Group  Jonson's first documented show was \\"Charmian Johnson and Ron David\\" in 2002 at the Pendulum Gallery in Vancouver, BC. In 2003, Johnson continued to show her pottery in the group exhibition \\"Genius Loci\\" at The Clay and Glass Gallery in Waterloo, ON. This exhibition showed a variety of eclectic pieces made of clay, glass or enamel placed in unconventional locations. Johnson's worked played with images of the imagination, and included her gargoyles, which popped out of the gallery's dark corners. Johnson then went on to exhibit in 2004 at The Morris Helen and Belkin Gallery in Vancouver, BC). \\"Thrown\\" showed Johnson's bowls, vases, jars, cups, boxes, plates, saucers, tea pots, and oven dishes in varied colours, shapes and sizes. In total over one hundred of Charmian Johnson's ceramic pieces were featured. Her most recent group exhibition was in 2018. \\"Nature\\", held at Catriona Jeffries Gallery in Vancouver, BC, exhibited her ink on paper drawings of botanicals. Her many drawings were on the perimeter of the gallery. They were intricate, in black and white, and ranging in style from scientific illustration to graphic motif.

Campbell-Staton is an evolutionary biologist and an assistant professor at UCLA. He studies how phenotypes respond to human activity that affects their environment. He also hosts the podcast 'Biology of Superheroes' together with Arien Darby.  Early life and career  Campbell-Staton did his BSc in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Rochester. He then studied for his PhD at Harvard University under Jonathan Losos and Scott V. Edwards. He wrote his dissertation, titled 'Phylogeographic history and temperature-mediated evolution of the green anole, Anolis carolinensis' on the evolution of the green anole lizard. After his PhD he became a National Science Foundation Research Fellow at the University of Illinois Champaign- Urbana, working with Julian Catchen, and the University of Montana where he worked with Zac Cheviron. He started his position as assistant professor at UCLA in July 2018, where he works in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) Department and the Institute for Society and Genetics (ISG).  Research  Campbell-Staton initially started his research in the field of herpetology. He became interested in the effect of changes in the environment, such as climate change, on the evolution of species. His dissertation focused on cold- tolerance in the green anole, for which he studied five different populations in the United States. He studied their cold-adaptation by looking at the righting reflex of the animals, which involves turning the lizards on their back at different temperatures and determining whether they are able to turn themselves back. He found that the northern populations, which live in a colder climate, where more cold-adapted. After his fieldwork in 2013 the areas where his study populations live were hit by a particularly cold winter. He showed that after this winter, the southern populations in Texas were more cold-adapted. He also studies the phenomenon of tusklessness in African elephant populations, specifically the population in the Gorongosa National Park. He studies both the genetic causes of this phenomenon, as well as the consequences for how the elephants interact with the environment. He furthermore tries to answer the question of why the tusklessness is mainly present in the female elephants.  Biology of Superheroes  Campbell-Staton bought his first comic book, Superman vs. Muhammad Ali, in 2013. This led him to think about the biology of the superheroes in these comics, which eventually led to the start of the 'Biology of Superheroes' podcast, which he started in December 2017. His first two episodes focused on Spider-Man, and later episodes included topics such as The Flash and Jurassic Park. Now he also teaches a 'Biology of Superheroes' course at UCLA, where he uses topics from comics and other sources to teach biology.

The performative quality of such work signal his ongoing interest in social interactions both as subject and medium.  Photography  The photography series Fruit Tree (2017) is a collaboration between Ron Tran and Mathew Sawyer. Without a clear purpose in mind or the intention to travel in the most efficient manner, the two artist went on a short road trip exposing themselves to random opportunities that comes in their way. The work consists of performative actions and subtle interventions that were conducted resulting in the form of photo documentation.  Performance  Tran integrates performance in many of his artwork.

Schl√ºter was educated as a Candidate of Law at the University of Copenhagen in 1970. He was a partner in Berning Schl√ºter Hald (1990-1998), Schl√ºter & Hald (1998-1999) and Bech-Bruun Dragsted (1999-2002), until in 2002 he established his own law firm, Johan Schl√ºter Law Firm, which closed in 2015, and was based at H√∏jbro Square. In the 1970s, he became involved as a lawyer for the Danish gramophone record industry, (IFPI Danmark) via Bent Fabricius Bjerre, and gradually gained a central position as an advisor to Danish rights holders to such an extent that he has been termed \\"the king of Danish copyright\\". Among Schl√ºter's work was the establishment of the Antipirate group and the later association RettighedsAlliancen. One of the cases that Schl√ºter had for the Antipirat group came in 2011 to a principled Supreme Court judgment on proof-securing. With Thomas Sehested, Johan Schl√ºter was also behind the software company DtecNet, which was originally established in 2004 under the name JSA Software. In 2010, the company was sold to the American company MarkMonitor In 2010, DtecNet became gazelle winner. In 2012 , Schl√ºter became involved in a French case concerning the administration of the legacy of the French singer Charles Trenet. The French authorities issued an international arrest warrant on Schl√ºter. In 2014, a French court sent him 18 months of unconditional imprisonment in the case, and subsequently Frenchman Georges El Assidi made a claim of 30 million krone against Schl√ºter, first at Copenhagen and later at the Eastern High Court. In the case, the √òstre Landsret decided that El Assidi could freeze Schl√ºter's values until the case was finalized in France. The French case was appealed, and ended with an acquittal of Schl√ºter in the main proceedings. In the summer of 2015, Schl√ºter's law firm was reported to the police by the Producerforeningen, which believed that it had at least DKK 100 million worth of benefits. This was done by an independent audit examination revealed serious irregularities in the administration of the companies CAB, Filmret and release print. The administration of the companies was Schl√ºter and his law firm through the associated company Registrering Danmark ApS. In connection with the case, the law firm, which was reported to the police , dismissed its partner Susanne Fryland and dismissed a third of the employees. On October 2, 2015, finans.dk reported that the law firm was closed and the headquarters escaped, and a few days later, the Maritime and Commercial Court declared the company bankrupt. Schl√ºter himself was declared bankrupt in December 2015. In February 2016, Schl√ºter and his third partner, Lars Halgreen , were also charged in the case. In June 2017, the Public Prosecutor for Special Economic Crime brought charges against Schl√ºter and two other lawyers in Schl√ºter's law firm. The case was then over 200 million krone and the charges included, among other things, blame andmandate fraud of particularly serious nature. On June 11, 2018 , Schl√ºter at the Copenhagen City Court was found guilty of grossly mandatory and guilty crimes and sentenced to a prison sentence of 4 years imprisonment. The penalty was made conditional on the age of the judge and \\"personal relationship\\". In addition, he was condemned to the right to conduct a law firm. Schl√ºter received the Koktvedgaard Prize in 2012. Johan Schl√ºter is married to Elsebeth and has four children. He has lived in an apartment on the Esplanade and has a summer house in Lums√•s.

She works on soft matter physics and is particularly interested in the transport and molecular mechanics of biopolymer networks. Robertson-Anderson is a member of the Council on Undergraduate Research.  Early life and education  Robertson-Anderson grew up in Cincinnati, where she realised that she liked physics at high school. She studied physics at Georgetown University and graduated magna cum laude in 2003. She was supported by a Clare Boothe Luce scholarship to study the diffusion of granular materials. She was made a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Robertson-Anderson moved to the University of California, San Diego for her graduate studies, completing a National Science Foundation supported PhD under the supervision of Douglas Smith on single-molecule studies of DNA. She used video fluorescence microscopy and single molecule tracking to monitor the diffusion coefficients of engineered DNA. Robertson-Anderson joined The Scripps Research Institute as a postdoctoral researcher working with David Millar. She worked on single-molecule microscopy to establish the binding kinetics in HIV-1 regulatory proteins.  Research and career  Robertson- Anderson joined the faculty of University of San Diego in 2009. She leads the Robertson-Anderson biophysics laboratory. She uses single-molecule microscopy and optical tweezers to understand macromolecule dynamics in soft matter. Using optical tweezer microrheology, Robertson-Anderson can measure intermolecular forces with piconewton precision. By using embedded microspheres and Stokes-Einstein relations it is possible to determine the viscoelastic properties of biomaterials. Robertson-Anderson was awarded a United States Department of Defense Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant to study entangled DNA. She has developed optical tweezer technologies that can be used to track single molecules in actin protein networks. Networks of actin have a range of structural and dynamical properties, and respond to stress and strain. She uses fluorescence force-measuring optical tweezers to link molecular deformation (strain) and resistive forces (stress). She has also shown it is possible to use optical tweezers to transport microspheres through composite networks, measuring the forces that polymers use to resist the strain, and fluorescence microscopy to understand macromolecular mobility. She develops analysis algorithms, microfluidics and macromolecular synthesis techniques to determine the dynamics of nucleic acids. Her platform, Spatiotemporal Light-sheet Assisted Multiscale Macromolecular Transport Analysis Probe (SLAMMTAP), can be used to characterise DNA and cytoskeleton environments. In 2015, Robertson-Anderson attended a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Scialog program, where she met Jenny Ross and became interested in cytoskeleton scaffolding proteins. Robertson-Anderson was awarded a W. M. Keck Foundation grant to develop autonomous materials based on cytoskeleton proteins that can use biologically-derived components, such as circadian clock proteins, to perform mechanical work. The circadian oscillator system is taken from cyanobacteria, and turns on and off in the presence of phosphate molecules. The proteins can function on the outside of living cells. The oscillators produce actomyosin, a protein complex which contracts muscle tissue. Robertson-Anderson was made Chair of the Department of Physics and Biophysics at UCSD in 2015. She was the American Physical Society Woman of the Month in February 2017. She appeared on the Ada Lovelace Day podcast discussing her work on biological soft matter and biomaterials. Robertson- Anderson is an advocate for undergraduate teaching and research. She is a member of the council for the Council on Undergraduate Research. She has developing a new advanced laboratory and improved the representation of women in the program at UCSD. She created the Beckman Scholarship Program to recruit talented undergraduate scientists. She has led National Science Foundation proposals to support students from underrepresented backgrounds into science, technology, engineering and maths subjects. Her undergraduate student, Stephanie Gorczyca, won the American Physical Society LeRoy Apker Award award for outstanding undergraduate research.

This memory never left Argote's mind. When she visited her father she saw his motorcycle and realized the connection it had with her. She explains how riding the motorcycle back to where her father left would help her heal the pain from abandonment. She called out to artists who ride or have ridden motorcycles in order to learn how to ride the bike and understand the relationship it has with the rider. They gathered in Griffith Park and set up a system to speak with each other while riding that allowed those nearby to hear the conversation and learn what the riders were thinking about without necessarily riding the bikes themselves. This project helps explain the relationship that riders have with their bikes and how they inhabit each space that they reach. Her project culminates when she is able to bring her father's bike from Mexico to Los Angeles. This will allow her to understand her father's experience and journey and to interpret it through her body.

The poetry  Hacha'a poetry, also known as Tajleebah, from Arabic ÿ™ÿ¨ŸÑŸäÿ®ÿ© which means bringing back, is about bringing back emotional things like memories, a lost love, mending a broken heart, and so on. Hacha'a poetry is sung in the Hacha'a mode, and describes the suffering of love. The audience hand-claps and interjects verbally with \\"hacha'a\\", meaning to lie down, in an encouragement to be finally rid of all the suffering by lying down, whether alone or with the loved one.  The music  Hacha'a has its own mode called the Hacha'a mode of Iraqi music. The most distinctive sound is that of the drum known as Khishba, Zanboor or Kasour, which has narrow tube-shaped body made of wood, with a fish-skin head glued on top. The head is moistened and the drum is knocked very fast with both hands to get a rapid-fire sound characteristic, many beats faster than the main beat of the song. Iraqi traditional or modern musical instruments can be used.  The dance  The Hach'a accompanying dance is an expressive dance that emphasizes complex movements of the hands and neck, with some hip movements This dance is a solo or group dance for women mostly, with sometimes a male drummer who dances circling the women. There are special moves for women with longer hair since they can swing and flail their hair around wildly in the dance. The Hacha'a dance is also known as * the Agraba, from the Arabic ÿπŸÇÿ±ÿ®ÿ© which means scorpion because of the perceived similarities between this dance's moves and how the Iraqi scorpion moves. * the Kawliya dance because of its association with the Iraqi Roma community. The following are some features of the Hach'a dance style: * Hair swinging: The dancer's untied hair is thrown circularly in the air around her and also right and left, violently to the drum rhythms. * Hair sweeping: The dancer kneels closer to the floor and rubs her hair, gently sweeping the floor with it. * Awakening the earth: The dancer repeatedly jumps and strikes the floor with her feet as if struggling to wake up the sleeping, careless ground, a reminiscent of ancient Mesopotamian earth fertility rites. * Shimmies: Rapid shaking motion of the head, shoulders and hips. * Daggers: Sometimes the dancer holds, or pretends to hold, a dagger in each hand and simulates stabbing herself with them by rhythmically pointing them towards her heart and sides. These simulated blows signify the pain of love and separation, as well as the sacrifice of the beloved. * Finger snaps: two-handed finger snaps are commonly used. * Costumes: The typical costume is a much less conservative version of a traditional Iraqi village girl costume, with some decoration.

Blatteis of the New York City Health Department's Bureau of Preventable Diseases, with broad authority to quarantine those infected with polio and institute hygiene measures thought to slow the transmission of the disease. Polio was a poorly understood disease in this era, and official efforts to stem its spread consisted primarily of quarantines, the closure of public places, and the use of chemical disinfectants to cleanse areas where the disease had been present. Special polio clinics were established at various locations in the city for the treatment and quarantine of patients. In addition, many informal remedies or preventative measures were tried by the frightened population, while public activities largely fell silent. Ultimately, the epidemic subsided in the winter months, with the cause remaining a mystery to investigators and the public.

On Saturday, June 17, 1916, an official announcement of the existence of an epidemic polio infection was made in Brooklyn, New York. Over the course of that year, there were over 27,000 cases and more than 6,000 deaths due to polio in the United States, with over 2,000 deaths in New York City alone. According to the figures compiled by the New York City Department of Health, by June 1916 there were 114 verified cases of infantile paralysis in Brooklyn, practically all of them in the old South Brooklyn section. The outbreak appeared to be confined to infants and young children, less than 10% of the cases occurring in children over five years of age. The Department of Health stated that a careful investigation had failed to substantiate the view that the schools had a share in spreading the disease, pointing out that over 90% of the children were under the typical school age; that the cases were not limited or even more prevalent in any one school district, and that they were not at all limited to children in the same classroom.The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal (1916), Vol. 175, p. 29-30. On June 26, 1916, the Department of Health issued a bulletin noting 37 additional cases of infantile paralysis reported to the Department of Health making a total to date of 183 cases in Brooklyn. A study of the situation indicated that the disease was spreading in a southerly direction and was invading the Parkville section, to the east of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. In the week preceding that report, 12 deaths were reported from anterior poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) in the Greater City, eleven occurring in Brooklyn, almost as many as occurred in the entire city during the year 1915, when 13 deaths from this disease were reported for the entire year in the Greater City. The twelfth case was reported to the Department from Staten Island. It was located in an Italian-American district, like most of the Brooklyn cases. On June 28, 1916, another 23 cases were reported, bringing the total in Brooklyn to 206 cases. On July 1, 1916, 53 new cases and 12 deaths were reported in New York City, making a total of 59 deaths since the outbreak of the epidemic. Both illnesses and deaths thereafter continued to increase on a daily basis throughout the month of July, peaking in early August, by which time the total number of cases was in the tens of thousands, and the number of deaths was over one thousand. The disease then began a slow decline for much of the remainder of the year. Responses The 1916 epidemic caused widespread panic and thousands fled the city to nearby mountain resorts; movie theaters were closed, meetings were canceled, public gatherings were almost nonexistent, and children were warned not to drink from water fountains, and told to avoid amusement parks, swimming pools, and beaches. The names and addresses of individuals with confirmed polio cases were published daily in the press, their houses were identified with placards, and their families were quarantined. Cities in neighboring counties and states enacted rules barring New Yorkers from entering those cities, with Hoboken, New Jersey going so far as to have police officers intercept travelers arriving from Brooklyn by ferry and escort them back to Brooklyn.\\"Cities of Nearby States Barring Out New Yorkers\\", Brooklyn Times Union (July 14, 1916), p. 2. Hiram M. Hiller, Jr. was one of the physicians in several cities who realized what they were dealing with, but the nature of the disease remained largely a mystery. In the absence of proven treatments, a number of odd and potentially dangerous polio treatments were suggested. In John Haven Emerson's A Monograph on the Epidemic of Poliomyelitis (Infantile Paralysis) in New York City in 1916 one suggested remedy reads: Because of the relation alleged to exist between polio and the stable fly, a survey was made to determine whether the cases were in the vicinity of stables, and the Sanitary Bureau took special pains to see that the manure in all of the stables in the affected districts was properly disposed of to prevent the breeding of flies. In response to a call issued by Commissioner Emerson, a conference of experts was held at the Health Department on June 28, 1916, to discuss plans for the control of infantile paralysis in Brooklyn. At the conference it was decided to organize a special field force in Brooklyn under Simon R. Blatteis of the Department's Bureau of Preventable Diseases. A special staff of medical inspectors, sanitary inspectors, nurses, and sanitary police, would assist Blatteis, visiting all cases daily and see that strict quarantine was maintained, and that all the premises where a case of infantile paralysis exists were placarded. The Department of Health prepared a special pavilion at its Kingston Avenue Hospital for sufferers from infantile paralysis to be cared for by skilled specialists. The Department organized a special visiting staff of experts, including specialists in children's diseases, orthopedists and neurologists, to assist the regular attending staff. The Health Department insisted that a patient, in order to be allowed to remain at home, should have a separate room, separate toilet, a special person in attendance for nursing purposes, and facilities for the proper disposal of all discharges. Where these facilities could not be provided, the Health Department would hospitalize the patient at no charge. By July 8, 1916, Blatteis had established six clinics in Brooklyn specifically set up to receive polio victims.\\"Fifty-six Epidemic Cases Reported in Borough\\", The Brooklyn Citizen (July 8, 1916), p. 3.

The reason for the song's removal was due to the unlicensed sampling of \\"Rebound\\" by Arty and Mat Zo. It was replaced with \\"Feelin' Myself\\" on the re- release. Sampling controversy The song heavily samples \\"Rebound\\" by Arty and Mat Zo. Arty made the claim via Twitter in April 2013 that Interscope Records had not asked for permission from Anjunabeats before will.i.am sampled \\"Rebound\\". Chris Brown stated in a tweet that he didn't know of the track's original source and claimed that he performed it due to a feature request. A statement was released by Anjunabeats that even though credit was given to Arty in the sleeve notes, doing so is not an appropriate way to obtain permission of clearing a sample, which was done following on from Arty's Twitter claim. Anjunabeats issued this statement in response to when will.i.am was quoted as telling the Associated Press in self-defence: In a later interview for KIIS-FM, will.i.am went on to admit that he accidentally stole \\"Rebound\\" with the sample and was confused whether or not he had the right to use it for \\"Let's Go\\". The situation was elaborated on by will.i.am: \\"Arty is a dope producer so I wrote this song to 'Rebound' this last year. I got in touch with Arty and showed it to him, did a different version to it 'cause I asked him [to] make it newer 'cause I don't just wanna take your song and rap over it. But he said that after a year's time, \\"we preferred writing over and using the [original] rebound. Something happened and the clearance... hopefully we resolved the issue\\". The song was removed on the re-release of #willpower on November 26, 2013 and replaced as the fifth track on the album with \\"Feelin' Myself\\" after will.i.am contacted the owners of \\"Rebound\\" for negotiation. However, the audio was not deleted from will.i.am's Vevo account on YouTube. In May 2013, Above & Beyond played \\"Rebound\\" at the Electric Daisy Carnival to make fun of will.i.am, and Mat Zo went on to do this too in June.

Description  The holotype and only known specimen consists of a largely complete skull that was unfortunately overprepared, removing many of the surficial details; the specimen is reposited at the Texas Memorial Museum. Wilson provided a short description of features that he could observe, remarking on its distinction from the much larger, aquatic temnospondyls found in the Late Triassic and referred the taxon to a new family, the Latiscopidae. He placed this family within the Stereospondyli based on a few aspects of the palate and the absence of rhachitomous temnospondyls in the Dockum Group. He considered it somewhat similar to the Trematosauridae based on the relatively long and narrow skull but remarked that Latiscopus was probably not aquatic based on the laterally facing orbits. Subsequent authors proposed various affinities, including to rhytidosteids, with Almasaurus habbazi, another small temnospondyl from the Late Triassic of disputed phylogenetic affinities, and to trematosaurs. Because of its poor condition, Latiscopus has never been analyzed in a phylogenetic analysis, but Almasaurus, which is sometimes placed within the Latiscopidae, is typically recovered as a trematosaur. Latiscopus was re- examined as part of the description of the morphologically similar Rileymillerus from the Late Triassic of Texas. Bolt & Chatterjee amended many of the statements made by Wilson, frequently noting that claims about the anatomy could not be verified or were erroneous. They concluded that the specimen was too poorly preserved in its current state to be properly comparable to other temnospondyls and designated it as a nomen dubium.

He split from Trevor to team up with Gibb at the end of 2016. In their third season together, Crabb and Gibb won their first World Tour title and entered the top ten of the world rankings. An undersized volleyball player, Crabb has been noted for his speed and knowledge of the sport. He was the 2018 and 2019 AVP most valuable player. Early life and junior years Crabb was born on January 26, 1992, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and hails from a sporting family. His father Chris was a professional indoor volleyball player, while his mother Paula was on the Southern Connecticut State University gymnastics team. His uncle Tony served as an assistant coach for the 1984 Olympic-gold-medal- winning United States men's national volleyball team, and his cousin Lindsey Berg is a two-time Olympic silver medalist with the United States women's national volleyball team. His brother Trevor, three years his senior, played NCAA Division I (D-I) indoor volleyball for the Long Beach State 49ers. Volleyball was a big part of Crabb's childhood and he has \\"been playing since [he] could walk.\\" He grew up playing two-on-two beach volleyball with his father and older brothers. From 2004 to 2010, Crabb played club indoor volleyball in the youth ranks of the Outrigger Canoe Club; his club came in second at the 2010 USA Volleyball Junior National Championships in the 18s Open division. Crabb also played high school indoor volleyball for Punahou School. In his senior year, Punahou completed an undefeated season by winning the state championship, with Crabb named as the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. International Crabb was a member of the United States national under-19 squad that finished tenth at the 2009 U19 World Championship. The following year, he was called up to the under-21 national team for the 2010 Men's Junior NORCECA Volleyball Championship. The United States beat Canada in three straight sets in the finals to win the gold medal, and Crabb was named the Best Spiker of the tournament. Crabb went on to captain the 12-man under-21 national team that competed at the 2011 U21 World Championship in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The United States finished fourth following losses to Argentina in the semifinals and Serbia in the bronze-medal match. By the end of the tournament, Crabb had scored a total of 75 points (23rd out of 85 players), posting a 0.34 kill percentage (17th out of 85 players) and averaging 1.58 digs per set (19th out of 94 players). College Crabb turned down offers from other top D-I indoor volleyball programs to join his brother Trevor at Long Beach State, joining the 49ers in the 2010‚Äì11 season as an outside hitter. Crabb played in 29 matches (23 as a starter) in his freshman year, amassing 296 kills, while averaging 2.6 kills and 1.38 digs per set. He recorded a team-best 303 kills in his sophomore year, averaging 2.75 kills and 1.91 digs per set. In his junior year, Crabb posted the most number of kills in the NCAA at 502, and averaged 4.18 kills per set (fourth in the NCAA) with a .353 hitting percentage (eighth in the NCAA). He led the 49ers to their first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) conference finals in seven years, where they lost to the BYU Cougars. At the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, Crabb was selected to the first team All-American and was voted National Player of the Year by the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA). As a senior, Crabb made the first team All-American once again, finishing his final collegiate season with 499 kills, with an average of 4.8 kills per set (first in the NCAA) and a hitting percentage of .371 (21st in the NCAA). Crabb graduated with a Bachelor's degree in American studies in 2014. Career 2011‚Äì2015: Early years While still in college, Crabb partnered with his brother Trevor to compete as an amateur on the domestic beach volleyball circuits. His first professional result was a 49th place at a tournament in Hermosa Beach, California, in 2011. He made his Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) debut two years later at the 2013 Manhattan Beach Open, where he and Trevor came through the qualifiers and faced the top-seeded Phil Dalhausser and Sean Rosenthal in the first round of the double-elimination main draw. The brothers pushed the 1 seeds to a tiebreaker set, losing with a score of 21‚Äì19, 12‚Äì21, 9‚Äì15, and eventually finished the tournament tied for 25th. Upon graduating from Long Beach State in 2014, Crabb signed with Arago de S√®te to play professional indoor volleyball in the French Pro A league. S√®te ended the 2014‚Äì15 regular season ranked 6th out of the 14 Pro A clubs, with Crabb contributing mostly as a substitute outside hitter. The club advanced to the championship playoffs where they were eliminated by Tours VB in the quarterfinals. In the second leg of the quarterfinals, Crabb scored two points as a substitute in the second set of his team's three-set loss. 2015: Transition to beach In the summer of 2015, Crabb quit indoor to play beach volleyball full-time. He teamed up with Spencer McLachlin for his first three AVP events; the pair did not place higher than 13th. He played with Trevor for the remainder of the AVP season and their best results were two third-place finishes. Seeded 13th at the $100K Manhattan Beach Open in August, the duo upset three of the top-ten seeds on their way to the final four‚Äîincluding a 29‚Äì31, 21‚Äì17, 16‚Äì14 victory over the top-seeded Jake Gibb and Casey Patterson‚Äîbefore falling to the third-seeded Dalhausser and Nick Lucena. They entered the double-elimination $100K Huntington Beach Championships the following month as the No. 7 seeds. Despite a second-round loss to the second- seeded Ryan Doherty and John Mayer, Crabb and Trevor won three consecutive matches in the losers bracket to reach the semifinals where they were defeated once again by Doherty and Mayer. By the end of his first full season on the AVP, Crabb had set a season-best 5.4 digs per set with 313 digs in total. Crabb and Trevor also debuted on the FIVB World Tour at the $75K Xiamen Open in September. They defeated a team from China in the qualifying round to advance to Crabb's first World Tour main draw where they were seeded 29th. Despite losing two of their three group stage matches in the main draw, they progressed to the knockout stage with an upset over Poland's fourth-seeded Micha≈Ç KƒÖdzio≈Ça and Jakub Sza≈Çankiewicz. A subsequent loss to Latvia's No. 1 seeds of Aleksandrs Samoilovs and JƒÅnis ≈†mƒìdi≈Ü≈° in the Round of 16 saw them exit from the competition in ninth place. Crabb won his first international tournament with Trevor the next month at the $8K NORCECA tournament in Saint Lucia. Having only played two international events, Crabb concluded the year ranked No. 136 in the world with Trevor. 2016: Breakthrough 2016 was a breakthrough year for Crabb, highlighted by two more NORCECA titles and three AVP finals appearances. Overall, he and Trevor finished in the top-three of all seven AVP tournaments they entered, notching victories against top domestic teams including Doherty and Mayer, and Gibb and Patterson. Crabb set the season-best 480 digs, over 100 more digs than the next-highest defender. On the World Tour, the pair competed in their first Major series event at the $400K Gstaad Major. They came through the qualifiers to reach the Round of 16 as the No. 25 seeds, including an upset over the tenth-seeded Clemens Doppler and Alexander Horst of Austria, before falling to their fifth-seeded compatriots Gibb and Patterson. Crabb and Trevor did not manage better than ninth at the next two Majors either, and they ended the year with an improved world ranking of No. 47. 2017‚Äì2018: Partnering with Gibb At the end of 2016, Crabb ended his partnership with Trevor to team up with three-time Olympian Jake Gibb. Crabb and Gibb went into the 2017 AVP season as the top seeds, winning two of the six events they competed in. They won their first tournament together at the $87.5K New York City Open in June without dropping a set. The following month, the double-elimination $79K Hermosa Beach Open saw Crabb play against his brother Trevor on the AVP for the first time. Crabb and Gibb defeated Trevor and his new partner Rosenthal in the fourth round of the winners bracket, they then faced Trevor and Rosenthal once more in the finals, beating them in three sets for Crabb's second AVP title. Crabb and Gibb also competed in six events on the World Tour; their best results were three fifth- place finishes. In July, they competed in Crabb's first World Championships as the No. 18 seeds, posting two wins and two losses to tie for 17th. They closed out their first season as teammates ranked 24th in the world. Crabb and Gibb had a slow start to 2018. On the World Tour, they recorded upsets over top- ranked teams including the reigning World Champions Evandro Oliveira and Andr√© Stein, but did not progress beyond the Round of 16 in their first six events. They were further setback when Gibb missed the start of the AVP season with a broken toe. Despite Gibb's injury, the pair won two of the seven AVP events they entered that year. Their first victory came at the $75K Seattle Open in June, in which they upset the No. 1 seeds of Dalhausser and Nick Lucena for the title. They went on to win the season-ending $125K Chicago Championships, defeating Tim Bomgren and Chaim Schalk in the championship match. Crabb was also the runner-up in three AVP events, losing to Dalhausser and Lucena in the final match each time. Their international results also improved mid-season where as the No. 21 seeds at the $300K Gstaad Major, they advanced to Crabb's first final four on the World Tour. In the semifinals, they lost the tiebreaker set to the 15th-seeded Anders Mol and Christian S√∏rum of Norway. In the bronze-medal match, they lost another three-setter, this time to the 12th- seeded Daniele Lupo and Paolo Nicolai of Italy, who they had beaten earlier in the group stage. They closed out 2018 with two more quarterfinals appearances and were ranked No. 11 in the world rankings. 2019‚Äìpresent: First World Tour title In the third year of their partnership, Crabb and Gibb won four of the six AVP events they entered. They started the season as the No. 1 seeds, defeating the teams of Chase Budinger and Casey Patterson, and Jeremy Casebeer and Chaim Schalk in the finals of the $100K Huntington Beach Open and $75K Austin Open respectively. The pair went on to win the $150K Chicago Championships in August as the No. 2 seeds, recording a two-set victory over the top-seeded Dalhausser and Lucena in the final match. Crabb and Gibb ended the 2019 AVP season beating Theo Brunner and John Hyden at the $100K Hawaii Open, rallying from a first set loss to win 18‚Äì21, 22‚Äì20, 17‚Äì15. On the World Tour, the duo began the 2019 season with a fifth-place finish at the $75K Sydney Open in March, and did not place higher than ninth in their next seven tournaments. They entered the World Tour Finals in September as the No. 17 seeds. In the group stage, they upset Germany's 16th-seeded Nils Ehlers and Lars Fl√ºggen, and Italy's top-seeded Lupo and Nicolai to advance to the knockout rounds. They eventually lost to the fifth-seeded Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler of Germany in the semifinals, and then to the second-seeded Mol and S√∏rum of Norway in the bronze-medal match. Crabb and Gibb ended the international season winning their first World Tour title at the $150K Chetumal Open in November. As the No. 3 seeds, they upset the Polish No. 2 seeds of Michal Bryl and Grzegorz Fija≈Çek on their way to the gold-medal match, where they beat the top-seeded Dutch team of Alexander Brouwer and Robert Meeuwsen in three sets. Crabb and Gibb concluded the year ranked eighth in the world. Style of play Crabb is a defender and a right-handed left- side player. At 6 ft 0 in (1.85 m), he is considered an undersized volleyball player. His collegiate coach Alan Knipe said that Crabb made up for his shorter stature with his 40 inch (100 cm) vertical jump, versatility and knowledge of the sport. On the beach, Crabb has been noted for his speed, while his teammate Gibb has praised his court coverage and understanding of beach volleyball. According to Crabb, he \\"take[s] a lot of pride\\" in chasing down balls and making digs. He has also noted that growing up as a smaller player turned out to be an advantage as it allowed him to play in a variety of indoor volleyball positions, which in turn made his game more well-rounded. Volleyball Magazine hailed Crabb as one of the best defenders in the world in 2018. He is known for his calm demeanor on court, which he credits to his father's influence. Of the 74 players who competed in a Major Series main draw on the 2019 World Tour, Crabb ranked 37th for total points scored, averaging 5.37 points per set; and 26th for total kills, averaging 5.31 kills per set. Personal life Crabb's middle name is Kikaha o Ke Kai, which means \\"glide over the ocean\\" in Hawaiian; it was given to him because his mother had participated in a 46-mile canoe race while pregnant with him. Since they were young, Crabb has had a very competitive relationship with his brother Trevor.

When the Moroccan scholar and explorer, Ibn Battutah visited the city in 1327, he reported the mosque as still standing, but it disappeared at a later, unknown date; no trace of it survives today. History and description Baghdad was founded in 762 by the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (). The main part of the original city was the Round City, with the caliphal Palace of the Golden Gate and the adjacent Great Mosque at its centre. Al-Mansur's mosque The Great Mosque was built at the southeastern side of the palace, after the latter had been completed. As a result the mosque was not correctly directed towards Mecca (the qibla), as the mosque's outline had to conform to the existing palace walls. The Great Mosque of al-Mansur was the first mosque to be built in Baghdad. In its original form, the mosque was a quadrangle about on each side, i.e. about one quarter that of the palace. Like much of the Round City, the structure was built of sun-dried bricks set in clay, while its roof was supported by wooden columns topped with wooden capitals. Most of the latter were composed of several pieces, joined together endwise with glue, and clamped with iron bolts; but five or six of them, near the minaret, were formed from a single large tree-trunk each. The palace and mosque complex was apparently completed by the time al-Mansur took up residence in the city in 763. Apart from the palace and two annexes to the northwest, the complex was surrounded by a wide empty space where construction was prohibited. Around this, the palaces of al-Mansur's younger children, quarters for the palace servants, and the offices of the various administrative departments were built. Harun al-Rashid's reconstruction In 807, Harun al-Rashid () tore down the structure and rebuilt it with kiln-fired bricks set in mortar. Work was finished in 809. This structure was later known as \\"The Old Court\\" (a·π£- sa·∏•n al- øatƒ´q). Soon, however, it became apparent that it was not large enough to host the number of worshippers flocking to it during the Friday prayers. As a result, a neighbouring building, the \\"House of the Cotton Seller\\" (DƒÅr al- Qa·π≠·π≠ƒÅn), which previously housed an administrative department, was converted into an auxiliary mosque. As it proved more convenient, it soon came to supplant the Great Mosque, which by 875 was no longer being used for the Friday prayers. Al-Mu'tadid's renovation Caliph al-Mu'tadid () objected to this state of affairs, and in 893 expanded the Great Mosque by tearing down part of the Palace of the Golden Gate. The wall originally separating the two was left standing, but was now pierced by 17 arched gateways: 13 into the courtyard of the mosque, and four on the side aisles. The commander Badr al- Mu'tadidi was made responsible for the new portions of the mosque, which were named Badriyah after him. The remains of the original structure of Harun al- Rashid's time were cleaned and restored, while special care was given to the restoration and decoration of the mihrab, the minbar, and the maqsurah. Ahmad ibn Rustah described the mosque, following al-Mu'tadid's restoration, as a \\"fine structure of kiln-burnt bricks well mortared, which is covered by a roof of teak wood supported on columns of the same, the whole being ornamented with [tiles the colour of] lapislazuli.\\" The mosque's minaret burned down in 915, but was rebuilt. Later history The Great Mosque continued to be the chief Friday mosque of the city throughout the Abbasid period, although in the late 9th century the residential life of the city had moved, along with the caliphal palaces, to East Baghdad across the Tigris. Under the Buyid emirs in particular, the Round City was abandoned and was left virtually deserted. In 1058‚Äì1059, during the revolt of al-Basasiri, the Fatimid caliph was commemorated during the Friday prayers. When Benjamin of Tudela visited the city in 1160, he reports that once a year the Caliph rode in pomp from his palace in East Baghdad to the Great Mosque \\"at the Basra Gate quarter\\", which remained the chief mosque in the city. The mosque was flooded in 1255, and apparently survived the Sack of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258, as it does not appear in the list of destroyed shrines later restored by Hulagu. When Ibn Battutah visited the city in 1327, he reported the mosque as still standing, but it disappeared at a later, unknown date; no trace of it survives today.

Consultado el 6 de febrero de 2019. refers to hostile sentiment toward the nation of Venezuela and/or its people. The phenomenon has intensified in the 2010s, due to the Venezuelan refugee crisis.  By period   Period of independence  Flag of Ecuador between 1845 and 1861 (√âpoca Marcista), used in place of the Bolivarian tricolor that was then associated with the dictatorship of Venezuelan general Juan Jos√© Flores. After the Spanish American wars of independence, Venezuelans came to hold key positions in the administration of the nascent republics. This unleashed the resentment of the local populations, who held revolts to expel the foreigners. In September 1828 in Bogot√°, the Septembrina Conspiracy was carried out; this was an attempt to assassinate the leader Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, who was supported by the Venezuelan military and in opposition to the generals and Nueva-Granadian lawyers led by Francisco de Paula Santander. These events would lead to the dissolution of the Bolivarian projects of Gran Colombia and New Granada (today Colombia and Panama) three years later, with Ecuador and Venezuela achieving total independence. For his part, Bol√≠var also imposed an authoritarian regime in Peru, where Venezuelan troops committed various abuses. The unpopular Bolivarian Constitution was repealed in 1827 and Peru went to war with Gran Colombia the following year, shortly after intervening in Bolivia in support of the rebels who wished to overthrow the regime of the Venezuelan Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. In Ecuador, the Venezuelan Juan Jos√© Flores continued to rule as a dictator until 1845, the year in which the Marcista Revolution or Nationalist Revolution occurred, an uprising that had among its objectives the expulsion foreign troops that still remained in the country.  Petroleum boom  With the advent of the oil boom in the 1970s, the Venezuelan economy experienced unprecedented growth. This caused Venezuelans to be stereotyped as opulent, arrogant or \\"agringados\\", partly due to the xenophobia they committed against the population of border regions and against the increased numbers of migrants who moved to the country.  Chavismo and crisis  When Hugo Ch√°vez came to power relations with several countries deteriorated, to the point that the Colombian government denounced the existence of a project of Venezuelan imperialism over the region. According to various sources, the Venezuelan government was interfering in the governments of Argentina, Bolivia, and several Caribbean islands, as well as outwardly supporting the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The ideological rejection of Chavismo and Madurismo gained a growing xenophobia following the daily departure of thousands of Venezuelans due to the economic crisis that the country has been going through since 2013. According to the UN, by the beginning of 2019 the number of refugees from Venezuela in other countries reached about 3.5 million. Despite the fact that regional governments have welcomed migrants in solidarity, Venezuelans have been accused of influencing higher unemployment and crime rates, and have become victims of harassment, insults and even violence by citizens of different countries.  By country   Bolivia  In March 2019, a group of 14 Venezuelans were arrested by immigration authorities for protesting in front of Cuba's embassy in La Paz. Six of them were expelled from the country, since according to the government: However, the action was condemned by organizations such as Amnesty International, which felt that the expulsion was arbitrary and done as part of systematic persecution against Venezuelan migrants due to the close relationship of the government of Evo Morales with the regime of Nicol√°s Maduro.  Brazil  An attack on a Venezuelan migrant population in thumbIn August 2018, the government of the border state of Roraima requested a temporary closure of the border, claiming that its administration was unable to control the large number of Venezuelans who entered the country daily. Initially, Judge Helder Gir√£o Barreto ordered the suspension of land entry of Venezuelans, but later the measure was revoked by the Supreme Court, which considered that the prohibition was contrary to the Constitution and international pacts signed by Brazil. Days later, a Venezuelan refugee camp was attacked in the municipality of Pacaraima. A mob armed with provincial weapons set fire to tents and other belongings of the immigrants, forcing more than 1,200 back over the border. The events occurred in retaliation for the alleged attack on a Brazilian merchant by four Venezuelans. Then-presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro said the government should not turn its back on popular sentiment in Roraima, and proposed the creation of refugee camps with the help of the UN. Once he became president, Bolsonaro said he would adopt more rigorous criteria for the entry of foreigners to Brazil, but ruled that he would not return Venezuelan immigrants to their country.  Chile  In May 2017, Venezuelan protesters were confronted by a group of Chileans who showed their support for the government of Nicol√°s Maduro in the vicinity of the Venezuelan embassy in Santiago. Some months later, Venezuelans protesting in the same place were beaten and robbed by Chilean communists. In January 2018, a disabled woman attacked an immigrant woman in Santiago with a cane, while calling her a communist and saying she voted for Sebasti√°n Pi√±era. The same month, a driver from Valpara√≠so shouted \\"Venezuelan piece of shit\\" at an immigrant who was working in a gas station, before attacking him with a broom. In January 2019, during a match between the U-20 teams of Chile and Venezuela, Chilean soccer player Nicol√°s D√≠az Huincales called the Venezuelan player Pablo Bonilla \\"starving to death\\". Subsequently, the Chilean player offered public apologies through a letter. A Chilean woman also referred to an immigrant she worked with \\"starving to death\\" in Cartagena later in the month. In February of the same year, following the publication of a video where a group of Chileans and Venezuelans offended the victims of Augusto Pinochet, left-wing citizens launched a virtual campaign calling on people not to help immigrants and asking for expulsion of the venecos and venezorranas, both offensive slurs against Venezuelans specifically. According to statements by the Dominican consul in Arica, the Chilean border police deny entry to any immigrant who is black or Venezuelan and does not carry prepaid documents and tickets detailing where they will stay and when they will return.  Colombia  In January 2017, while delivering houses built by the Ministry of Housing to displaced people in the border town of Tib√∫, then-Vice President Germ√°n Vargas Lleras said: Although Vargas Lleras later said that his use of \\"veneco\\" was only as a demonym, the Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro said it was a xenophobic aggression and demanded an apology. In May 2017, Rodolfo Hern√°ndez, mayor of Bucaramanga, said that from Venezuela it was the beggars, prostitutes and unemployed who had arrived, and that it was not possible to throw them out, but the city was unable to respond to the crisis. In September 2017, there was a confrontation between Colombian and Venezuelan street vendors for the control of the spaces within the TransMilenio system, which left one person dead. Since the end of 2017, threatening pamphlets against Venezuelans began circulating in the border cities of C√∫cuta and Arauca. Among the groups involved in delivering these threats were the ELN, the Clan del Golfo, and the Arauca Social Cleansing Group. In January 2018, a group of young people launched incendiary bombs at 900 Venezuelans who were in a refuge in a sports center in C√∫cuta. In May 2018, an audio clip began circulating in which military threats were made against immigrants who did not leave the municipality of Subachoque within two weeks. In October 2018, a Venezuelan was lynched in Ciudad Bol√≠var, after being connected to the kidnapping of children through fake WhatsApp chains. At least 200 citizens participated in the lynching using stones, sticks and machetes. After this, two Venezuelans were about to be lynched in the same place and two other migrants were beaten in Transmilenio. In January 2019, threatening pamphlets appeared against Venezuelans residing in Ipiales, near the border with Ecuador. The authorities consider that the phenomenon occurred due to the return of a Venezuelan population from Ecuador, where there were attacks against immigrants in the previous weeks. In February 2019, mayor Rodolfo Hern√°ndez said Venezuelans were \\"factories for making poor chinitos\\". Five months later, journalist Claudia Palacios wrote a column in the newspaper El Tiempo urging Venezuelans to stop giving birth. In July 2019, five quartered bodies were found in Bogot√°, three of them belonging to Venezuelan citizens. In August of the same year, threatening pamphlets appeared in Bucaramanga, demanding that the city's merchants replace their Venezuelan workers within 48 hours. With the increase in the number of Venezuelan immigrants seeking housing in Bogot√°, there are reports that in several places it is common to find advertisements saying \\"For rent: no Venezuelans.\\" During the campaign for the 2018 presidential elections, a common accusation among the candidates was that their competition wanted to make Colombia a second Venezuela. In addition, the conservative candidate Alejandro Ord√≥√±ez said that in the face of massive migration of Venezuelans, businessmen should prioritize the right to work of Colombians. Ord√≥√±ez was subsequently appointed Colombian ambassador to the Organization of American States, a position from which he said that Venezuelan migration was part of an agenda to radiate socialism throughout Latin America. According to a survey published by Semana magazine in March 2019, 41% of migrants had suffered some type of rejection or discrimination. However, 81% of respondents said they had not been the victim of any crime because of their nationality, and most of them described Colombians as kind and friendly people.  Cura√ßao  In 2017, 1,203 Venezuelans were deported from Cura√ßao. Many of them were even forced to pay their return ticket. Through a fierce removal strategy, Venezuelans without stability are deported before they can apply for refugee status. Despite the claims of organizations such as Amnesty International. In November 2018, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations of the Netherlands (the country to which the island belongs) stated that the government would not investigate the matter.  Ecuador  In August 2018, the Ecuadorian government issued a decree requiring Venezuelans who would like to enter the country to present valid passports. However, a judge suspended the application of the decree, arguing that it contradicted the international agreements signed by Ecuador. In October of the same year, a march by Venezuelans in Quito was confronted by a group of citizens who threatened to burn immigrants alive, while calling on the government for greater immigration controls. One of the group participants stated: In January 2019, after the brutal murder of an Ecuadorian woman at the hands of a Venezuelan in Ibarra, there were a series of attacks against migrants, including forced evictions and burning of property. A few hours after the murder, President Lenin Moreno had declared: Moreno received harsh criticism for these statements, as some groups felt that his words prompted xenophobia. Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro called Moreno a \\"nazi\\", \\"fascist\\" and a traitor. Days later, Ecuador began to demand that Venezuelans entering the country show their criminal records, while some 250 migrants returned to Venezuela as part of a humanitarian corridor created by the Venezuelan government itself because of increased anti-Venezuelan sentiment after the event.  Hungary  Despite its anti-immigration rhetoric following the European migrant crisis, the government of Viktor Orb√°n has welcomed hundreds of Venezuelan migrants who have proven to have at least one Hungarian ancestor. However, the reception has not been as positive, with several citizens complaining to the police about the presence of black Venezuelans in the surroundings of the spa of Balatonoszod, where immigrants were initially housed.  Iran  During the 2017 presidential elections, the reformist press used the word venezueloi (\\"Venezuelanization\\"), to criticize the government for taking a course similar to that of the Nicol√°s Maduro regime and to warn of the possibility of an economic crisis similar to that of Venezuela.  Panama  In November 2016, the National Front of the Panamanian People called a protest under the slogan \\"no more arepas, no more teque√±os\\" (in reference to two typical dishes of Venezuela). The organizers of the march argued that Venezuelan migrants harmed the country's economy, displacing local workers and increasing crime. The march generated alarm among some groups, but in the end it only gathered a few dozen people. In August 2017, president Juan Carlos Varela announced that a visa would be required for Venezuelans traveling to Panama, citing economic and security reasons: The Venezuelan government considered the measure anti- integrationist and said they would act with reciprocity. Shortly thereafter, advertisements appeared in which Panamanian bars offered discounts to those who beat Venezuelan immigrants.  Peru  Campaign slogan saying \\"We the good Venezuelans in Peru are more\\" It is reported that many Venezuelan criminals have arrived in Peru and continued to commit crimes, which causes the increase in xenophobia. In March 2018, an anti-Venezuelan campaign was spread on social networks, during which banners with the slogan \\"Peru without Venezuelans\\" were seen on several bridges in Lima. In June 2018, a person was injured after clashes between Peruvians and Venezuelans in the Lima district of San Mart√≠n de Porres. In July 2018, marches were called to reject the presence of Venezuelan immigrants in Peru. In August 2018, the Peruvian government introduced a passport requirement from those Venezuelans who intended to enter the country, but the measure was suspended in October, when the courts ruled that this requirement was against with the commitments Peru must follow as part of Mercosur. In the same month, 89 Venezuelans returned to their country sponsored by their own government. Nicol√°s Maduro said that his countrymen had been victims of a hate campaign, and that in Peru they had only found racism, contempt, economic persecution and slavery. In January 2019, a Venezuelan was killed after fights between Venezuelans and Peruvians in the district of Chao (La Libertad). In the same month there were clashes between Venezuelans protesting in front of their country's embassy in Lima and Peruvian citizens who demanded that their government close the borders. According to the International Organization for Migration, 35% of Venezuelans living in Peru have suffered acts of xenophobia. In September 2019, news was given of the discovery of two mutilated bodies whose remains had been distributed in different parts of Lima. After some investigations, the police reported that the bodies belonged to a citizen of Venezuelan origin and a Peruvian, apparently killed due to deals with a foreign criminal organization. In videos obtained from the security cameras of a hotel in San Mart√≠n de Porres, where both victims were killed, it was discovered that those involved in the crime were five Venezuelan nationals, three men and two women, one of whom already had a criminal record for homicide, who are seen moving the remains to a vehicle. This news spurred a wave of hatred and panic towards Venezuelan immigrants in social networks. The border security was also criticized, with the government of Mart√≠n Vizcarra facing condemnation for allowing the entry of the criminals.  Trinidad and Tobago  In April 2018, 82 Venezuelan asylum seekers were deported from Trinidad and Tobago, which violated international laws on the matter. Given the criticism issued by UNHCR, Prime Minister Keith Rowley said he would not allow the UN or any other agency to turn his country into a refugee camp. Venezuelan migrants in Trinidad and Tobago are victims of widespread discrimination, since unlike other countries, no refugee reception plan has been implemented on the islands so it is hard to find legal work without being sent back.  Online  With the hyperinflation in Venezuela and the devalued Venezuelan bol√≠var, many Venezuelans have turned to virtual gold farming in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) like Tibia and RuneScape. In Reddit, a user published a racially abusive guide on how to kill Venezuelans in the ‚Äúplayer- v-player‚Äù places where the gold farming takes place; the guide was followed by intemperate comments. The moderators removed the post and the comments afterwards.

Early life  Margaret Sampson was born February 16, 1912 in Edinburgh Scotland. She was the daughter of Ida Binney and Ralph Sampson, an astronomer. Peggie was raised as a Quaker and began studying cello at the age of eight, first studying with Ruth Waddell. She would later study with Guilhermina Suggia in Portugal. Sampson enrolled at the University of Edinburgh in 1929 where she took classes with Donald Francis Tovey, graduating in 1932 with a Bachelors in Music. During this time she also studied under Diran Alexanian at the Normale de Musique in Paris (she would travel there during the summers of 1930 through 1934) and also privately with Nadia Boulanger. After graduation, Sampson performed in England and Holland while also serving as Tovey's teaching assistant from 1937 to 1944. By the 1940s she was studying under Pablo Casals, Emanuel Fueurermann, and also performed with the Carter Trio. She then moved to the University of Manitoba in Canada to take up a teaching position in 1951. She would remain in this position for almost twenty years.  Teaching career  Sampson was hired by the University of Manitoba to teach music theory, history, and cello. She also gave private lessons and in 1961 was commissioned by university to set up an experimental music programme for gifted children. Several children in this class went on to become professional musicians, including Stephen Cera, Laurie Duncan, Mayda Narvey, and Dace Stauvers. In addition, some of her private students, Gisela Depkat, Kenneth Murphy, and Paul Pulford, and Lynn Rudiak became professional cellists. She would return to the University of Edinburgh in 1960-61 to complete a doctorate in performance and to study new methods of music education for children. In 1970, Sampson took up a post at York University as a professor at the Department of Music. She was to teach theory and set up a programme for viols. She also taught at the University of Victoria in the summers from 1973 through to 1975.  Performance career  Sampson became one of the most prominent cellists and viola da gambists in Canada. Once in Winnipeg, Sampson continued to perform with the Corydon Trio (Lea Foli and Gerald Stanick) and the University Chamber Music Group. In 1963 she founded the Manitoba University Consort with Christine Mather which performed music composed between 1100 and 1800. Both Mather and Sampson were responsible for the collection and transcription of music for the group. It was during this period that Sampson became interested in the gamba and by the end of the 1960s it had replaced the cello as her main instrument. During this time she also commissioned work to expand the modern repertoire for the viola da gamba. As part of the Manitoba University Consort, Sampson performed at Expo '67 as well as touring in Europe and performing at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1966 and 1968. The group also performed at the opening of the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. The group disbanded with Sampson moved to Toronto in 1970. Once in Toronto, Sampson continued to perform with her focus now on early music and the viola da gamba. She was invited to perform three times at the Aldeburgh Festival, in 1972, 1974 and 1976. Sampson and her students also performed under the name of the Hart House Consort of Viols at the University of Toronto in 1977-1978. Sampson formed Quatre en Concert with Christine Harvey, Michael Purves-Smith and Deryck Aird and they performed in Holland and Canada from 1974 to 1976. Some notable performances during her career include: * Bach's \\"Passions\\" * Bernard Naylor's \\"On hearing Mrs. Arabella Hunt singing\\", 1970 * Murray Adaskin's \\"Two pieces\\" in 1972 * David Rosenboom's \\"The seduction of Sapientia\\", 1975 * Rudolf Komorous' \\"At your memory the transparent tears fall like molten lead\\", 1976  Later life  Sampson retired from full-time teaching at York in 1977 but continued to teach at Wilfrid Laurier University until 1984 and was active in the early music scene in Toronto. She lived with her long time companion Juliette del Junco in Toronto and died at the age of 92.  Discography  * Eckhardt-Gramatt√© Duo concertante; Suite No. 6 - Tovey Elegiac Variations.

Cond√© and long-time collaborator and partner Karl Beveridge challenge concepts of ideology, power, and control. In their career, which spans over thirty years, Cond√© and Beveridge have had over fifty solo exhibitions at major museums and art spaces across four continents, including: the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, UK; Museum Folkswang in Germany; the George Meany Centre in Washington; Dazibao Gallery in Montr√©al; Centro Cultural Recoleta in Buenos Aires; the Art Gallery of Edmonton; and the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney.  Background  In 1969, Cond√© and Beveridge, then working as independent conceptual artists, left Toronto for the burgeoning conceptual art world in New York City, where they found their overtly politicized voice. In 1975, they picketed at the Museum of Modern Art, protesting its lack of inclusion of women artists. The couple returned to Toronto in 1977.  Artistic career  Cond√© and Beveridge have worked on social issues including the working conditions of migrant farm labourers, the histories of auto workers, women in the workplace, projects relating to labour education and labour arts, national and global \\"free trade\\" agreements, police brutality and systemic racism, environmental issues, nuclear power, the decline of the fishing industry, struggles against neoconservative government policies, healthcare issues, anti-globalization protests, and the transnational politics of water. The artists use dialogical aesthetics as a way of breaking down the conventional distinctions between artist, artwork, and audience.  Style  Cond√© and Beveridge utilize actors, staged tableaux, montage, thematic slogans, captions, and the construction of emblematic props and non-naturalistic sets to generate an atmosphere of serious visual expression grounded in theoretical and ethical contexts. Their work expresses the fundamental principal that art is a social transaction that becomes a participatory, collaborative process, communicating and articulating commonalities and differences shared by all.

He was responsible for designing twenty-seven ecclesiastical buildings and numerous commercial and state buildings, including the iconic Met √âireann building in Glasnevin, Dublin. McCormick was an accomplished sailor and member of the Irish Cruising Club, for which he served as flag officer. Life McCormick was educated at St Columb's College, Derry but later studied architecture in Liverpool (where he graduated in 1943). On his return to Northern Ireland he began working for the Derry Corporation and later for Ballymena Urban District Council. Whilst living in Derry McCormick contracted tuberculosis and was sent to convalesce in Greencastle, Co Donegal. In 1947, whilst convalescing, together with Frank Corr, McCormick successfully won a competition to design a new church for Ennistymon, County Clare.  Career  In 1948 McCormick and Frank Corr formed an architectural studio called Corr and McCormick. The studio continued to exist until 1968, when McCormick then formed McCormick Tracey Mullarkey. McCormick continued to design churches until his retirement in 1982, after which he completed a number of private commissions, including the house of his close friend and Northern Ireland politician John Hume. During the 1970s, McCormick's architectural studio offices were firebombed, leading to the total destruction of his professional records.  Awards  In 1999 McCormick's St Aengus' Church, Burt, County Donegal was voted Ireland's \\"Building of the 20th century\\" in a readers' poll organised by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and the Sunday Tribune, which featured windows from a stained glass artist he commissioned for 11 of his buildings, Helen Moloney. Additionally McCormick was awarded the RIAI Triennial Gold Medal.  Legacy  McCormick was one of the founding members of the North West Architectural Association. He was also a member of the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society, the Royal Society of Ulster Architects and the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland. He was also a trustee of the Ulster Museum. In 1977, McCormick was awarded an honorary doctorate from Coleraine University. In 1984 he was made a Knight of St Gregory.

In 2017, Cortez was featured in a science fiction-themed exhibit at University of California, Riverside, and in 2018, her work was shown in the Made in L.A. group artist exhibition at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. She holds a Ph.D in Latin American Literature from Arizona State University. She also earned an M.F.A. from the California Institute of the Arts. Cortez currently teaches in the Central American Studies department at California State University, Northridge. According to Cortez's, her work explores \\"simultaneity, life in different temporalities and different versions of modernity, particularly in relation to memory and loss in the aftermath of war and the experience of migration\\". Cortez has been honored with the 2018 Rema Hort Mann Foundation Fellowship for Emerging Artists, the 2017 Artist Community Engagement Grant, and the 2016 California Community Foundation Fellowship for Visual Artists. Beatriz Cortez is represented by Commonwealth and Council, Los Angeles.  Selected Works of Art   Tzolk'in  One of Cortez's most popular works is a sculpture called Tzolk'in. Cortez created two identical sculptures in two separate locations. One was located at the Hammer Museum, part of the Made in L.A. 2018 installation. The other sculpture was by the Los Angeles river as a site specific, independent public art sculpture. The reason for the drastically different locations was to highlight the different realities that exist within the same cities. Both of the sculptures were facing each other, even though they were twenty miles apart, the reason for this is to reference the bond that the two sculptures have to each other which is comparable to the \\"bond that binds two entities of the same kind across space and time.\\" There are technically three different sculptures of Tzolk'in in the world. Cortez recreated a virtual sculpture in order to honor the death of Claudia Gomez Gonzales, who was murdered by an American Customs and Border Protection agent, near the Rio Grande River. Cortez was able to create the virtual Tzolk'in by partnering with Nancy Baker Cahill's app 4th Wall. If the users of the app go to the site on the Rio Grande River and hold their phone up, they will be able to see the virtual sculpture.  Memory Insertion Capsule  Beatriz Cortez‚Äôs Memory Insertion Capsule, made in 2017, explores several concepts ranging from ancient migration to the history of forced sterilization by L.A. eugenists in the early 20th century. Cortez draws her inspiration for many of her sculptures from literature, archives, philosophies, ancient art and indigenous cultures. Memory Insertion Capsule references both local construction techniques along with Indigenous architecture all while taking the form of a spacecraft/capsule. Cortez incorporates steel and futuristic concepts with Indigenous architecture to connect back to her philosophy of understanding ‚Äúmigration as a planetary motion that has existed for millions of years‚Äù. Within the capsule sits a steel helmet that projects images referencing Paul Popenoe who supported the theory of eugenics. The tent above the capsule refers to homelessness and forced migration that is happening to this day both in and outside of Los Angeles. The capsule itself is 12-sided with visible bumps on each of the steel panels mimicking the repujado metalwork of earlier Spanish colonists. All of the welding is done by Cortez herself, thus referencing gender constructs and how ‚Äúmen make things with steel, while women stitch. ‚Ä¶ When I‚Äôm welding, I imagine myself a seamstress‚Äù. Numerous symbols and concepts are presented by this work however, Cortez primarily hopes to change the concept of how we view Indigenous cultures as being a part of the past and instead ‚Äúimagine indigenous people as part of our future‚Äù.  Selected Exhibitions  Cortez has had solo exhibitions at the Craft Contemporary Museum, Los Angeles (2019); Clockshop, Los Angeles (2018); Vincent Price Art Museum, Los Angeles (2016); Monte Vista Projects, Los Angeles (2016); Centro Cultural de Espa√±a de El Salvador (2014); and Museo Municipal Tecle√±o (MUTE), El Salvador (2012).

Cortez has received an Emergency Grant from the Foundation of Contemporary Arts (2019), the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Emerging Artist Grant (2018), the Artist Community Engagement Grant (2017), and the California Community Foundation Fellowship for Visual Artists (2016).  Trinidad / Joy Station (2019)  Trinidad / Joy Station was on view in from January 27 ‚Äì May 12, 2019 at Craft Contemporary in Los Angeles. In this exhibition Cortez imagined a future communal life that combines upon geodesic dome architecture or post-war utopian communities in the United States with the collective living practices of the ancient Maya in what is present-day El Salvador. The installation speaks to notions of speculative thought, nomadism, and Spinozian Joy.  Collections  Cortez's work is featured in the following collections: El Paso Museum of Art (El Paso, Texas), Ford Foundation (New York, NY), Mario Cader-Fench Collection (Miami, Florida), and Museo Comunitario Kaqjay (Patzic√≠a, Guatemala).

The coup was led by Lieutenant (later Major General) Moussa Traor√©, who then became the head of state.  Background  File:Keita, 1966 (cropped).jpg|President Modibo Ke√Øta in 1966 File:Moussa Traor√© (1989) (cropped).jpg|The leader of the putschists, Moussa Traor√©, in 1989. File:Ti√©coro Bagayoko.jpg|Another putschist, Ti√©coro Bagayoko, in the 1970s. President Ke√Øta, father of Malian independence, had ruled a socialist government since 1960, supported by his party, the Sudanese Union ‚Äì African Democratic Rally (US-RDA). However, his politics faced economic difficulties. In 1966, he suspended the constitution and the parliament, replaced by a Comit√© National de D√©fense de la R√©volution with full powers. The population was increasingly dissatisfied by the government. A coup was plotted by Malian junior officers, in particular lieutenants Moussa Traor√©, Ti√©coro Bagayoko, Kissima Doukara, Youssouf Traor√© and Filifing Sissoko, and non-commissioned officers such as adjudant-chef Soungalo Samak√©. The Malian senior officers had little or no control on their subordinates. Unlike many putsches in French former colonies, this one was not supported by foreign actors. The two prominent organizers of pro-Western coups in Africa, Houphou√´t-Boigny, President of Ivory Coast, and Jacques Foccart, adviser for African affairs of Charles de Gaulle, President of France, were surprised by the coup.  The coup  The military tried to arrest President Ke√Øta at Koulikoro Harbor. Pictured is the Tombouctou, sister-ship of Ke√Øta's G√©n√©ral Abdoulaye Soumar√©, docked in Koulikoro. During the night of November 18‚Äì19, at midnight, the putschists gathered the Kati garrison and announced them their intentions. The telephone network was cut off at 2 am and cadres of the US-RDA were arrested before dawn. The soldiers stopped President Ke√Øta's convoy as he was going back to Bamako from Mopti. They wanted him to be arrested at Koulikoro when landing from his riverboat, the G√©n√©ral Abdoulaye Soumar√©, but Ke√Øta was ahead of schedule and his Citro√´n DS was blocked at 10 am at Kayo, a few kilometers from Bamako. Lieutenant Bagayoko asked \\"Monsieur le pr√©sident, voulez-vous vous mettre √† la disposition de l‚Äôarm√©e ? [Mr. President, would you like to make yourself available to the army?]\\" and the officers forced him into a BTR-152 armored personnel carrier. He was brought to the center of the capital by 11:30. They demand him to stop his socialist policy and to replace his collaborators but Modibo Ke√Øta refused, arguing he was democratically elected as a socialist. However, according to Captain Abdoulaye Ouologuem, driver of the presidential car, the mutineers only demanded new elections but the president refused. The military faction then broadcast a radio message announcing \\"the dictatorial regime [...] has fallen\\".  Consequences  Due to the poor economic record of president Ke√Øta, the coup was well received by the population. However, the immediate causes for the coup were overwhelming financial and economic problems, made worse by an especially poor harvest in 1968. Modibo Ke√Øta and other cadres of the previous regime were imprisoned in Kidal and Taoudenni. Modibo Ke√Øta died in captivity in Bamako in 1977. Ten lieutenants (Moussa Traor√©, Baba Diarra, Youssouf Traor√©, Filifing Sissoko, Ti√©coro Bagayoko, Joseph Marat, Mamadou Sanogho, Cissema Toukara, Moussa Kone and Karim Dembele) and four captains (Yoro Diakit√©, Malik Diallo, Charles Cissoko and Mamadou Cissoko) formed the Military Committee for National Liberation. Moussa Traor√© became its Chairman and promised democracy and free elections, that never came. He was proclaimed President in 1969 and ruled the country until he was deposed in the 1991 coup d'√©tat.

He lives and works in Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada.  Early life  Joseph was born in Edmonton, Alberta and relocated to Whitehorse, Yukon when he was 8 with his mother and brother. He studied at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in his twenties before returning to Whitehorse. In his 20s, Tisiga worked as a residential-support and day-program worker for an NGO that assists people living with mental and physical disabilities, and more recently he has worked at the Skookum Jim Friendship Centre, first as a program support worker and later as manager of an emergency youth shelter. This work has informed Tisiga's artistic practice with philosophies of support that are connected to harm-reduction modalities, trauma awareness and non- biased neutrality.  Work  Tisiga's multidisciplinary practice includes performance, photography, sculpture, and installation, but painting and drawing are at the root of all his work. His work examines notions of identity, cultural and social inheritance, the mundane, the metaphysical and the mythological. In 2009 Tisiga developed what he refers to as \\"Indian Brand Corporation\\" (IBC) to explore the conditions of First Nations people and how Indigenous communities are adapting to the modern world. Tisiga was long- listed for the Sobey Art Award in 2011 and in 2009 he was semi-finalist for the RBC Painting Competition.

She was previously deputy editor-in-chief at two prominent French weekly magazines: Marianne from 2011 to 2014 and L'Obs from 2014 to 2016. She joined Le M√©dia in 2017 and became its director in July 2018.  Education  Aude Lancelin studied at lyc√©e Henri-IV and then at La Sorbonne. She received an agr√©gation de philosophie in 1996.  Career  She started her journalistic career in 2000 with Le Nouvel Observateur (also referred to as \\"L'Obs\\") where she wrote as a book critic. She interviewed several philosophers, including Alain Badiou, Jean Baudrillard, Jean-Claude Mich√©a, Peter Sloterdijk, Jacques Ranci√®re and Slavoj Zizek. She worked from 2011 at Marianne as a deputy editor-in-chief, in charge of the magazine‚Äôs \\"Culture\\" and \\"Id√©es\\" pages. In 2014, she returned to L'Obs, following the appointment of Matthieu Croissandeau as editor-in-chief. Her termination from the magazine in May 2016 triggered a controversy.

Life  Haruko Okano was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She is a Sansei, or third-generation, Japanese Canadian. Her Japanese grandfather came to live in Haney, BC, in 1918. Okano was born at a tumultuous time in her parents‚Äô relationship. Okano‚Äôs parents argued over custody of her and she was intermittently placed in foster care. Her mother died when she was nine years old. After her mother‚Äôs death, Okano became a permanent ward of the Children‚Äôs Aid Society and she lived in a series of foster homes, where she experienced psychological and sexual abuse and was removed from all contact with her Japanese cultural heritage. Okano locates the origin of her alienation from her identity as a Japanese Canadian during this period of displacement. Her career as an artist, writer, and community activist has often focused on the recovery and expression of her cultural identity. Okano studied art at Central Technical School in Toronto, where she graduated with honours in 1972. She went on to study print production at Vancouver Community College in 1980. Since 1993, Okano has lived in the China Creek Housing Co-op in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood of Vancouver. In 2013, she spoke out in the media against plans to shut down the Federal Co-operative Housing Program, which subsidizes a portion of rent for thousands of co-op residents in British Columbia like her.  Artistic career  An artist, writer, and activist, Okano works in various media, including painting, sculpture, site-specific installation, performance, mixed media, and text. She often incorporates found materials and natural detritus in her work, such as stones, living spores and fungus, leaves, and branches. She explores environmental and ecological themes, as well as race, sexuality, and gender. A recurrent theme for Okano is that of cultural and linguistic hybridity. Literary critic Eva Darias-Beautell has observed that ‚ÄúOkano‚Äôs disconcerting writing and artwork have invariably revolved around the unresolved condition of cultural hybridity, often betraying the traps as well as the possibilities of the search for modes of expression that fall outside normativity. Her production [‚Ä¶] thematizes and speaks to the theoretical debates that surround the condition of the diasporic subject in Canada.‚Äù Okano is known for her collaborative, community-based practice, in which her role is that of an artistic facilitator for projects realized in the public realm and with stakeholders and participants outside of the typical confines of the art world.  Select works   Mount Pleasant Community Fence, 1994  In 1994, Okano and fellow artists Merle Addison and Pat Beaton from the artist-run grunt gallery initiated a project on East 8th Avenue and Fraser Street in Vancouver‚Äôs Mount Pleasant area, in which members from the community designed and hand-carved four hundred red- cedar pickets to be used for a local fence. John Steil and Aileen Stalker note that through community involvement, the ‚Äúfence in this case is not a barrier, but the demarcation of the garden, the result of many people from culturally different backgrounds working together to beautify and green their neighbourhood, contribute to a sustainable community and lessen the stress of city life.‚Äù  High( ~~bridi~~ ) Tea, 1998‚Äì2001  A collaboration with poet Fred Wah, High( ~~bridi~~ ) Tea was a performance that took place at the Nice Caf√© in Vancouver's Mount Pleasant neighbourhood on November 17, 2000. The work was conceived and developed at Banff Centre for the Arts in 1998 by Wah and Okano. Both artists were in residence at Banff at the same time, working on separate projects about hybridized languages. They learned they shared an interest in issues around contamination, cultural hybridity, and race. Okano and Wah started a two-year collaboration on the piece, which included performance, installation, poetry, and environmental art. For the performance, Okano and Wah acted as serving staff, bringing white bread and tea to twenty-six guests who drank from china teacups and who used paper napkins that were covered in kombucha fungus and printed with text, such as ‚Äúdis-orient‚Äù and ‚Äúdisgust.‚Äù Words such as ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù and ‚Äúapartheid‚Äù had been silkscreened in mould onto the bread. Throughout the performance, Okano and Wah shared recollections of growing up in Canada as cultural and racial hybrids.  San Augustine Suite, 2009  While completing an artist residency in San Augustine, Mexico, Okano walked the same road every day to and from her studio, and collected materials along the route (including seed pods, flowers, and grasses, as well as bits of trash). She combined the scavenged materials into a series of mixed-media sculptures that serve as records of her location and daily perambulations.  Select collections  Okano‚Äôs works are held in a number of private and public collections, including the Canada Council Art Bank, the Japanese Canadian Citizens Association, the Library of Congress, the Province of British Columbia, and the Surrey Art Gallery.

She is best known for site-specific works and installations that investigate political and economic systems, often revealing their intrinsic absurdity or the extent to which we normalize their complex codes and networks.  Background Maria Eichhorn was born in 1962 in Bamberg, Germany. From 1983 to 1990, she lived in Berlin and studied at the Hochschule der Kunste (Berlin University of the Arts) in the class of Karl Horst H√∂dicke. Since the late 1980s, her work has explored the relationship between the symbolic and the real, between the practice of art and direct actions geared towards positive changes in personal life, social relations and the human and natural environments. She has exhibited since the late 1980s, including shows in Amsterdam, Berlin, Bern, Barcelona, Warsaw, Zurich and Tokyo. She has taught at the School of Art and Design in Zurich since 2003.  Artistic practice Maria Eichhorn's artistic practice challenges facile categorization. Her work has spanned a variety of genres and media from wall texts to artist books, staged events to interviews, broad-ranging symposia to public billboards, film and video, as well as institutions and provenance research. Works such as \\"Money at Kunsthalle Bern\\" (2000) and \\"5 weeks, 25 days, 175 hours\\" (2016) explore gallery systems and the structures that enable an exhibition space to function including facilities and working lives of gallery staffs. Eichhorn's ambitious, large-scale projects often take on the mechanics of legal, social and financial processes, making permanent interventions that evolve over time.
