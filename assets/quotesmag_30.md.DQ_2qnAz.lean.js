He wrote the screenplays for two horror films: Barricade (2012) and Darkroom (2013). He has self- published many novels, with two of his novels being finalists for the Bram Stoker Award in 2016, and two being finalists for the Whitney Awards in 2014 and 2017. Writing Collings grew up writing from an early age. His father, Michael R. Collings, taught creative writing professionally and taught Michaelbrent how to write creatively. He attended Pepperdine University, where his father taught. After being rejected by traditional publishers, Collings self-published Run on Amazon in 2010, where it became a bestselling e-book in multiple genres, despite Collings not marketing the book. His subsequent novels were not as successful, but Collings persisted and was able to support his family after publishing over twenty books. He started writing western romance novels under the pen name Angelica Hart in 2017. Collings used a pen name because friends and colleagues advised him that romance from a well-known horror writer who is a man would not be well-received. Collings later openly revealed that he was the author behind Angelica Hart. Collings submitted multiple screenplays to the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting, where four of his screenplays made it to the quarterfinals and semifinals. He had the most screenplays advance to the quarter and semifinals of any writer in the history of the competition. His success in the competition led to his screenplay for Barricade being produced into Barricade (2012). Working with the producers, he changed the original ending to be less dark. He also wrote the screenplay for Darkroom (2013). He gave a workshop on writing horror and comedy at the 2018 St. George Literary Arts Festival. He spoke at the Winter 2019 Rexberg TEDx conference. He was a special guest at Idaho's Fandemonium in Nampa, Idaho in 2012. In an interview with Joanna Penn, Collings discussed how he suffers from major depressive disorder. He noted that not all writers are able to write something every day, but encouraged writers with depression to engage with stories during their depressive episodes to help them think about their writing, which is a process. Reception Critical response to Collings' work has been generally positive, with his genre work receiving \\"Top 10 of the Year,\\" 5-star and \\"A\\" ratings from various genre review magazines and websites. He has been featured in The Big Thrill, and his interview with The Creative Penn was named as one of ‚ÄúThe 29 Best Self-Publishing Podcast Episodes of All Time.‚Äù Ralph Peterson at the San Francisco Book Review gave Twisted four out of five stars, noting that \\"even the resolution does not lessen the creepiness.\\" Publishers Weekly has also given excellent reviews of Collings' work, saying of Darkling Smiles, \\"These tense, unusual stories are as scary as they are satisfying\\" and of Stranger Still, \\"Collings delivers a gripping, visceral horror novel in this standalone sequel.\\" The Longest Con was a finalist for a Whitney Award in 2017, and was named as one of \\"9 Incredible Paranormal Mysteries & Thrillers\\" by Wiki.evid.com The Deep was a finalist for the Bram Stoker Awards in the novel category in 2016; The Ridealong was also a finalist in the Young Adult Novel category the same year; the latter was the first time any indie novel was a finalist in that category. The books were published in 2015. His This Darkness Light was a finalist for a Whitney Award in the speculative fiction category in 2014. Scavenger Hunt was a finalist for the Dragon Award in the Best Horror Novel category in 2020. Personal life Collings is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served a mission in Paraguay from 1993 to 1995. Collings was a construction contract dispute litigator before becoming a writer. One of Michaelbrent's children died, which inspired some of his fiction. He and his wife had four children in 2015.

Gregory. Macroeconomics, third edition, 1997.Varian, Hal R., Microeconomic Analysis, third edition, 1992.Chiang, Alpha C. Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics, third edition, 1984. In contrast, an endogenous variable is a variable whose value is determined by the model. An endogenous change is a change in an endogenous variable in response to an exogenous change that is imposed upon the model. The term endogeneity in econometrics has a related but distinct meaning. An endogenous random variable is correlated with the error term in the econometric model, while an exogenous variable is not. Examples In the simple supply and demand model, a change in consumer tastes is unexplained by the model and imposes an exogenous change in demand that leads to a change in the endogenous equilibrium price and the endogenous equilibrium quantity transacted. Here the exogenous variable is a parameter conveying consumer tastes. Similarly, a change in the consumer's income is exogenously given, outside the model, and appears in the model as an exogenous change in demand. In the LM model of interest rate determination, the supply of and demand for money determine the interest rate contingent on the level of the money supply, so the money supply is an exogenous variable and the interest rate is an endogenous variable. In a model of firm behavior with competitive input markets, the prices of inputs are exogenously given, and the amounts of the inputs to use are endogenous. Sub-models and models An economic variable can be exogenous in some models and endogenous in others. In particular this can happen when one model also serves as a component of a broader model. For example, the IS model of only the goods market derives the market-clearing (and thus endogenous) level of output depending on the exogenously imposed level of interest rates, since interest rates affect the physical investment component of the demand for goods. In contrast, the LM model of only the money market takes income (which identically equals output) as exogenously given and affecting money demand; here equilibrium of money supply and money demand endogenously determines the interest rate. But when the IS model and the LM model are combined to give the IS-LM model, both the interest rate and output are endogenously determined.

Sparekassen Bikuben's former headquarters at No. 6‚Äì8 is listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. The entrance to department store Illum's multi-storey parking facility is also located in the street. History The street seen from K√∏bmagergade Created in 1620, the street takes its name after the Silk Company (Silkecompagniet) which was founded at the initiative of Christian IV in 1618. The company operated a silk manufactory at the corner with Pilestr√¶de. A row of 14 identical houses with a total of 50 apartments was also constructed in the street. They were designed by Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger and used for housing a group of German silk weavers who had been called to Denmark by the king to boot the silk production. The Silk Company was most likely already shut down in 1631. Some of the townhouses and a building in Pilestr√¶de were then converted into a domus misericordi√¶ or central poorhouse. It handed food and money out to the poor once a week and also functioned as an employment agency. It also contained a Hackle Room (heglestue) which was used for preparation of flax that was handed out to the poor. The facility relocated to Almindelig Hospital in 1769. Advertisement for C, Tafdrup & Co.'s tailor shop at No. 6 Troels Marstrand (1815‚Äì1889) |Troels Marstrand took on the family's bakery in Silkegade in 1839. He sold it after a fire in 1856. In the middle of the 19th century, Poul Christian Tafdrup, a master tailor, operated a clothing retailer at No. 6. The family lived on the other side of the street at No. 5. Bikuben's first headquarters from the 1860s The savings bank Sparekassen Bikuben was founded in the street in 1857. It was initially operated out of bank manager Julius Hellmann's apartment at No. 13 but purchased the building at No. 8 in 1860. The architect Hans Conrad Stilling was subsequently charged with adapting the building for its new use as bank headquarters. It was replaced by a new building in the 1880s. Notable buildings No. 6‚Äì8: The Bikuben Building Sparekassen Bikuben's former headquarters (No. 6‚Äì8) is a four-winged complex surrounding a central courtyard. The oldest part of the complex is from 1881 to 1884 and was designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt. The corner building is from 1927 to 1929 and was designed by Gotfred Tvede. The youngest of the four wings is from 1959 and was designed by Poul Kj√¶rgaard. The complex was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1999. Department store Illum's multi-storey parking facility is located at No. 4. It was built in the 1960s.

Chicago 1918 Following various Indigenous uprisings throughout the Territory of Washington and escalating pressure from settlers arriving through the Oregon Trail, the US Army declared in October 1855 that the Walla Walla valley was under martial law and that all the people had to leave. The order was challenged as some Frenchtown M√©tis stayed. Hostilities with the native relatives would soon follow. Without any supervision from the US Army, the Oregon Mounted Volunteers (OMV) engaged in the terrible Battle of Walla Walla that followed. The US Army could not pay them. The \\"Battle of Frenchtown\\" (December 7‚Äì10, 1855) ended up being the longest Indigenous battle in the history of Washington Territory. Frenchtown M√©tis community was shattered as some of the M√©tis families went on scattering around the Pacific Northwest or returning to where they originally came from. Americans filed claims on the land vacated. What was left of the community continued on the best they could \\"close knit‚Äù French-speaking Catholic, under an influx of newcomers and difficult circumstances up to the 80's. The original Saint Rose Cemetery was established in 1853. The original mission cabin was burned during the war of 1855. A log chapel was built on the McBean land claim in 1863 and then moved to a site on the river. In 1876 the river burials were moved to a hill at the Frenchtown site and the Saint Rose of Lima Mission Church was erected on the lower portion of the site, which served the French-Canadian community in the area until about 1900. Nearby Walla Walla was incorporated in 1862 and was for a while the largest community in the territory of Washington. In 1915, Frenchtown was renamed to Lowden. The Frenchtown Historic Foundation was first conceived in 1992 to rehabilitate this important precolonial Pacific Northwest history location. The Frenchtown Foundation acquired the land for the present- day historic site, including the cemetery, in 2005. A formal opening of the site and rededication of the St. Rose of Lima cemetery occurred in 2010. Relocation and restoration of the \\"Prince‚Äôs cabin\\" was completed in 2016. Originally located near the Whitman mission, the cabin is believed to be the oldest standing cabin in the state of Washington. Nowadays, Frenchtown is mainly a historical interpretation site and often designates its vicinity of wineries and family farms where once lived a thriving M√©tis community.

The Crown Estate income is in addition to the civil list and other income from private funds (donations etc.). The Crown Estate aims at ensuring a normal funding of the Romanian royal family and limiting the funding from the Romanian state budget; usually the, civil list, a relatively low amount, cannot ensure a sufficient financing.  History  The Crown Estates were born by the law of June 9, 1884, at the initiative of liberal politician Ion C. BrƒÉtianu. Since the establishment, for a long time (1884‚Äì1913), the position of Administrator of the Crown Estates has been owned by Romanian lawyer and forester Ioan Kalinderu. In 1918, at the request of His Majesty King Ferdinand I of Romania, the Parliament legislated the passage of a part of the land belonging to the Crown Estates in exploitation - and later in the property - of the Romanian peasants (v. 1921 Agrarian Reform). In 1948, after the coup d'√©tat of December 30, 1947, the Crown Estates were nationalized. After 1989, the Romanian Royal Family only claimed in court the restitution of (personal) property belonging to King Mihai I.

Between 1900 and 1901, the Crown Estate had twelve estates throughout Romania totalling 132112 hectares, 85000 hectares of forest and 48000 hectares agricultural land. From an administrative point of view, the Estates had ten districts with their own manager qualified in agricultural and forestry sciences. The agricultural estate was made up of eight estates mostly in Muntenia. The soil was of best quality and the crops were fertilised. To be able to fully use the allocated land, the ponds were drained. On that land orchards have been planted and fodder has been grown. Vineyard represented around 3.19% of the total land and were found mainly on the Sadova and Segarcea Estate sandy land. Agricultural machinery was introduced, farms were established and crops were improved. The last segment was cattle breeding that benefited from the fodder infrastructure. Moldavian cattles were brought that were bred with the Algan breed with aim of improving the traction oxen breed. Next to Peri»ô, on the Cancioc Estate in 1897 a dairy was established that had in 1901 160 cattles. In DubravƒÉ»õ sheep were bred. Likewise to the cattle breeding, the sheep breeds were bred with other foreign breeds. At MƒÉlini and Bicaz there were pig farms as well as bee farms. From agriculture the activities expanded to industry, linen, mill, ceramic and factories have been built. As such, offices, dwellings for workers, stables, workshops and sheepfolds were built. In addition, a stud farm was set up in Durovats where the indigenous breed of horses was intended to be improved.

There were 97.3% forest expolitable and only 2.7% was unproductive. The forests were beech, fir, oak, acacia or elm. Afforestations were made in the Sadova sands, and forest exploitation followed a strict forestry system. The transport of logs harvested to the sawmills or railway station was made on the water, narrow railways, or access roads existing at that time. 60 kilometers of railway and a 1.5 km funicular were built with 6 locomotives that had a power of 240 horses. The sawmills were at Poiana Doamnei, GƒÉine»ôti and Borca at MƒÉlini and at Piatra Corbului and A»õa at Bicaz. Industry wise workshops were built for the manufacture of gates, windows, wooden vessels, furniture, etc. There were also hunting parks, one in MƒÉlini »ôi unul la Bicaz, in Dubrove»õ there was a pheasantry, etc. File:Arbori taiati din padurea de la Bicaz.jpg|Trees cut from the Bicaz forest File:Tren funicular de la Malini.jpg|Funicular train from MƒÉlini File:Frangherie pe Domeniul Dobrovet.jpg|Rope factory at Dobrove»õ Estate File:Plute cu lemne pe Bistrita.jpg|Rafts with logs on Bistri»õa  Legal status, ownership and taxation  The Crown Estates are the property of the Romanian State; only the income from their commercial exploitation (usufruct) is intended to support the activity of the Royal Family. The Crown Estate properties can only be sold by law. By the operating law, the Crown Estate properties do not pay taxes to the central budget, but only to the local budgets (counties and communes). In 1918, at the request of His Majesty King Ferdinand I of Romania, the Parliament legislated the passage of a part of the land belonging to the Crown Estates in exploitation - and later in the property - of the Romanian peasants (v. 1921 Agrarian Reform). After the abdication of King Mihai I of Romania, which took place on December 30, 1947, the Romanian Communists issued an act of nationalization of the Crown Estates. After 1989, the Royal Family of Romania only claimed in court the restitution of (personal) property belonging to King Mihai I.

This unit was distinct from the Wise Legion Artillery which was a battalion formed in the Kanawha Valley in 1861 as part of Brig. Gen. Henry A. Wise's brigade. Cpt. Ephraim G. Alburtis organized the company in Berkeley County, Virginia, in 1859 in response to John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. It was named after then-governor of Virginia, Henry A. Wise. A group of men from this company are seen in a drawing of John Brown's execution as drawn by David Hunter Strother. The battery was mustered into Confederate service on April 19, 1861 when it was entered as \\"Co. B\\" of the 1st Virginia Light Artillery Regiment. It became an independent battery in April of 1862. Many of the men enlisted from Berkeley County, but the battery also included many men from Jefferson, Orange and Frederick counties. It was armed with two 12-pound smoothbore cannon and two 6-pound smoothbore cannon. Lt. John Pelham was the drillmaster and artillery instructor for the unit, which he joined in June 1861. Their first engagement came at the First Battle of Manassas, where they supported Stonewall Jackson's brigade. Col. Alburtis resigned in January 1862 due to ill health. 1st Lt. James Brown was elected captain and the battery became known under his name from January to October 1862. As such, they fought in the Seven Days Battles, the Peninsula campaign, Second Battle of Manassas and Antietam, where they repulsed a Union attack at Burnside Bridge. Wise Special Order #209 effectively ended the unit on Oct. 4, 1862. Capt.

The building was demolished on 2013. Movie still from In the Great Big West Dintenfass tried avoid the investigators of Thomas Alva Edison, always looking for the \\"pirates\\" who escaped the rigid conditions posed by the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), the monopoly of the sector that it imposed, between the other, to use only the technical material (film cameras, film, etc.) that was to be provided exclusively by the trust. To circumvent the MPPC, the independents - including Dintenfass - distributed their films through the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company of Carl Laemmle. On April 30, 1912, Laemmle brought together Pat Powers of Powers Motion Picture Company, Mark Dintenfass of Champion Film Company, William Swanson of Rex Motion Picture Company, David Horsley of Nestor Film Company, and Charles Baumann and Adam Kessel of the New York Motion Picture Company, to merge their companies with Independent Moving Pictures and create Universal Film Manufacturing Company, with Laemmle assuming the role of president. Dintenfass later founded the Vim Comedy Company (1915) In its four years of activity, Champion produced more than two hundred films. It specialized initially in westerns and historical reconstructions of military episodes of the American Civil War and American Revolution. Later, he produced numerous drama films, documentaries and some movies related to famous people, such as the aviators Blanche Scott and Robert G. Fowler. Among those who appeared in Champion films were John G. Adolfi, Irving Cummings, Jeanie Macpherson.

Not a great deal is known now of Vanel, though she was quite famous during her time.HALLETT, FLORENCE, REBEL DANCERS, The New European, 19 July 2018  Early life  Vanel first arrived on the scene in 1921 when she joined the Margaret Morris Club, a school of dance in London. In 1923, Vanel, Morris, and Lo√Øs Hutton began holding summer dance school in the town of Antibes in the French Riviera. Picasso and the Murphys (a wealthy American couple that were the subjects in F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night) attended the groups Riviera performances. In 1924, after a disagreement with Morris, Vanel and Hutton split off from the Margaret Morris Club and formed their own dance school and company in France. Vanel said that she \\"wanted to see dance freed from its conventions, giving greater importance to the dancer itself as an artistic material, seeing in the dancer lines, shapes and movements and a material, worked like stone or clay, but into which humanity has been kneaded\\". Vanel and Hutton were lovers, and their breakup in 1934 and subsequent business split made the news. Her fame already established, she was billed to perform at the Exposition Internationale du Surr√©alisme, her act being one of the draws for the \\"right crowd\\" to come to the show.  Performance at the Exposition Internationale du Surr√©alisme  Vanel's performance at the Exposition explored conventional and Surrealist ideas of hysteria through dance, as well as an existing as a physical form of automatism. Hysteria at the time referred to a gendered condition thought to be caused by a wandering uterus. This condition precipitated into many symptoms of malaise, all thought to be directly correlated to the mental inferiority of women, though today in 2019 it is understood to be a product of PTSD from sexual assault and verbal abuse within a society with no framework for discussing such things. Breton and Aragon served as an orderlies in WW1, and observed how the PTSD of soldiers (termed war hysteria) was not a result of weakness. Hysteria was viewed by many Surrealist artists as a subversion of the status quo. The performance drew great critique from attendees and Vanel's fellow surrealists. Dali said of her performance \\"She jetted from the wings like a tornado in an unbelievable movement that induced a demential delirium within all in attendance. She created a total uproar with her violent entrance, lunging up onto the bed, holding at arm's length a live rooster which cackled in terror. She herself began screaming in hysterical mimodrama as she rolled and contorted herself on the bed. She jumped up and down before throwing herself into the pond surrounded by reeds that we had set up in the middle of the room. (Dali 1973, 233)\\" Unfortunately, her historic part in the first Surrealist exposition did not garner the attention of many scholars.  Post Exposition  Vanel went on to continue her dance school and company after the exposition. A rare quote of hers reads \\"Dance, joyous and powerful expression of the enthusiasm for life, must have the same mission as poetry. It creates forms in time and space. Dance is the vertigo of matter...To recover the truth of being. To simultaneously acquire the sense of the invisible powers which attract us even while repelling us: Is this not a means of overcoming ourselves, of leaving behind marasmus and mediocrity, a method for attaining that magnificence that we have so shamefully abandoned.\\" She went on to become a painter, sculptor, and a lecturer at the Louvre.

Concealed under the young woman portrayed, a study was found for another screen by Visconti entitled Recompensa de S√£o Sebasti√£o (Reward of Saint Sebastian). The equipment that allowed this intriguing discovery was developed by the Brazilian researcher Cristiane Calza, during her doctorate, completed in 2007 at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The system is able to identify the time when a painting was painted, the composition of colors used by the artist, the existence of later touches and even falsifications. Recompensa de S√£o Sebasti√£o, as well as Giovent√π, was awarded an international exhibition, receiving the gold medal at the Universal Exposition at Saint Louis,DezenoveVinte ‚Äì Arte no Brasil do S√©culo XIX e In√≠cio do XX ‚Äì Cronologia de Eliseu Visconti in the United States, in 1904. In X-ray images, the angel crowning laurels the San Sebastian tied to a tree appears even more clearly than the girl of Giovent√π. The painter seems to have changed his mind after the study because, instead of laurels, in the finished picture the angel puts a halo on the saint's head.

Alikiona, originally written in Kiswahili, was translated to English by Joshua Williams. The play tells the story of an affair between a woman, Sadia and her lover, Abdallah. It centers on the discovery of the affair by Sadia's husband, Omari. The play is one act and is typically performed with five actors. Alikiona has many naturalist elements, as is characteristic of much of Hussain's earlier work. However the play also has elements of kichekesho, which is a comic interlude often found in taarab performances. Characters Saida, Abdallah (her lover), Omari (her husband), Mama Pili (her friend), Abudu (a friend of Saida's family). Plot Summary In the one act play Alikiona (Consequences), a woman named Saida is having an affair with a man named Abdallah. In an effort to spend a weekend with her lover, Saida lies to her husband, Omari, and tells him she is going to spend the weekend with her mother whom she has not seen in a few years. After she leaves, a messenger arrives home and tells Omari that Saida's mother has passed away. Omari learns that Saida is not in fact with her mother and thus discovers that she is cheating on him. Once Saida returns from her weekend, Omari informs her of her mother's passing, noting that this knowledge and circumstance is punishment enough for her cheating. Omari then tells Saida to go to her mother so she can be present for the end of the funeral rituals. Reception Scholars have noted that the naturalist elements found in this play are likely due to the colonial influence on Husseins Theatre Arts education at the University of East Africa. This play, along with Wakati Ukuta (Time is a Wall) were written while Hussein was studying Theatre Arts and French at the University of East Africa.

Albert Rivett (17 May 1855 ‚Äì 18 November 1934) was an Australian clergyman and pacifist. History Albert Rivett, sen., was born in Norwich, England, a son of Amy Rivett, n√©e Riches and her husband, bricklayer William Rivett, who died when Albert was quite young and was brought up in a family of Quakers. He studied theology at Harley College, East London, and in August 1879 was sent to Australia aboard Hesperus by the Colonial Missionary Society. He was first put in charge of the Independent (i.e. Congregationalist) church in Brunswick, Victoria, then Port Esperance in Southern Tasmania, returning to Brunswick in 1887. His next postings were to churches in Yarrawonga then Beechworth, Victoria in 1896, followed by Albury, New South Wales, and the Whitefield Congregational Church, Protestant Hall, Castlereagh Street, Sydney, in 1908. In 1891, while at Yarrawonga he began publishing a series of monthly magazines titled The Murray Independent, sub-titled \\"Journal of Applied Christianity\\" dealing with (amongst other, local, issues) free speech, the abolition of war, of Socialist values and the policies of Henry George. When he moved to Sydney the paper became The Federal Independent. In 1915 he resigned from Whitefield and the ministry because of the congregation's antagonism to his views on World War I. Rivett had also opposed the Boer War and was a vocal opponent of Billy Hughes and conscription in 1916‚Äì17. His last campaign was against the Australian Government's support of Fascism and the banning from Australia of the Czechoslovakian journalist Egon Kisch. It was while addressing a crowd of some 5,000 supporters of Kisch at The Domain, Sydney that he collapsed and died.

History  The SB series of bombs were designed to be high-capacity bombs that were intended to create the largest lateral blast effect on detonation. This was in contrast to most other German bombs, which were either armor-piercing, cluster bombs, fragmentation or incendiaries. Since the SB series wasn't designed to pierce armor or to create fragments, the casing of the series was very light, and the ratio of charge to weight was high at 65%, while the majority of general-purpose bombs were up to 50%.  Design  The SB 2500 was constructed of three parts; a threaded cast steel nose plug, a welded sheet steel center section, and a welded sheet steel tail cone with four alloy tail fins. The SB 2500 was filled through the nose and the tail cone was hollow to increase the bombs charge to weight ratio. There were two transverse fuze pockets; the forward pocket housed the anti- break-up fuze and the rear pocket was for a normal impact fuze. The SB 2500 was fitted with an anti-breakup rod which extended from the nose plug to the forward fuse pocket, which on impact crushed the impact fuze and detonated the bomb. A central exploder tube also ran through the center of the bomb from the forward fuze pocket to the tail. The SB 2500 was suspended horizontally by reinforced H-type lugs. The SB 2500 was filled with either Amatol or Trialen 105. Trialen 105 was a mixture of 15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% aluminum powder.

It is a slender, spreading shrub with simple leaves and pink, four-petalled flowers.habit Description Boronia capitata is a slender, spreading shrub that grows to a height of . It has simple, thick, linear to club-shaped leaves long. The flowers are pink and are arranged in clusters on the ends of the branches, each on a pedicel long. The four sepals are broadly elliptic to narrow triangular, and the four petals are broadly elliptic, about long. Taxonomy and naming Boronia capitata was first formally described in 1863 by George Bentham and the description was published in Flora Australiensis from a specimen collected by James Drummond. The specific epithet (capitata) is a Latin word meaning \\"having a head\\". In 1971, Paul G. Wilson described three subspecies: * Boronia capitata subsp. capitata has leaves and sepals that are glabrous or fringed with hairs and flowers from September to October; * Boronia capitata subsp. clavata has thick leaves covered with long, soft hairs, and broadly elliptic sepals fringed with hairs and flowers from April to October; * Boronia capitata subsp. gracilis slender leaves covered with long, soft hairs and narrow egg-shaped sepals with a hairy fringe and flowers from June to November. Distribution and habitat * Subspecies capitata is only currently known from sandplain habitat near Pingelly; * Subspecies clavata grows in heath between Corrigin, Hyden and Kojonup; * Subspecies gracilis grows in winter-wet swamps between Yarloop and Margaret River. Conservation Subspecies clavata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" but subspecies gracilis is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

In general, Protestant theology, as a subset of Christian theology, holds to faith in the Christian Bible, the Holy Trinity, salvation, sanctification, charity, evangelism, and the four last things. Various Protestant denominations differ in their doctrine, with Churches teaching either Wesleyan-Arminian theology, Reformed theology, or Baptist theology. Other evangelical bodies, such as the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, Presbyterian Church in America and the Evangelical Friends Church International may subscribe to what they see as the orthodox theology espoused by their historic tradition, such as Lutheranism, Presbyterianism or Quakerism respectively.  Teaching by denomination  Adventist theology Anabaptist theology Mennonite beliefs were formulated in the Dordrecht Confession of Faith in 1632. Baptist theology Baptists are those Christians who believe in credobaptism--that one should receive the ordinance of baptism after he/she experiences the New Birth. Baptists are categorized into two major categories: General Baptists (also known as Freewill Baptists) believe that Christ's atonement extends to all people, while the Particular Baptists (also known as Reformed Baptists) believe that it extends only to the elect. When the holiness movement came into being, some General Baptists accepted the teaching of a second work of grace and formed denominations that emphasized this belief, such as the Ohio Valley Association of the Christian Baptist Churches of God and the Holiness Baptist Association. The doctrine of Baptist successionism (also known as Landmarkism), which has been influential among many Baptists, \\"argue[s] that their history can be traced across the centuries to New Testament times\\" and \\"claim[s] that Baptists have represented the true church\\" that \\"has been, present in every period of history\\". Baptists who uphold this ecclesiology also do not characterize themselves as being a Protestant Church due to their belief that \\"they did not descend from those churches that broke away in protest from the church of Rome. Rather, they had enjoyed a continuous historical existence from the time of the very first church in the New Testament days.\\"  Keswickian theology  Keswickian theology, which emerged in the Higher Life Movement, teaches a second work of grace that occurs through \\"surrender and faith\\", in which God keeps an individual from sin. Keswickian denominations, such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, differ from the Wesleyan-Holiness movement in that the Christian and Missionary Alliance does not see entire sanctification as cleansing one from original sin, whereas holiness denominations espousing the Wesleyan-Arminian theology affirm this belief. Lutheran theology \\"Private Absolution ought to be retained in the churches, although in confession an enumeration of all sins is not necessary.\\" ‚ÄîAugsburg Confession, Article 11 Evangelical Lutheranism arose out of the Protestant Reformation, heralding the doctrine of justification by faith, which teaches that humans are accounted as being righteous through the merits of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. This gift of faith is received in baptism, which regenerates the soul, according to Lutheran theology. In total, Lutherans affirm three sacraments: baptism, eucharist, as well as confession and absolution. With respect to worship, the predominant rite used by the Lutheran Churches is a Western one based on the Formula missae (\\"Form of the Mass\\") although other Lutheran liturgies are also in use, such as those used in the Byzantine Rite Lutheran Churches, such as the Ukrainian Lutheran Church and Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovenia. The Augsburg Confession, a Lutheran statement of belief contained in the Book of Concord, teaches that \\"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\\". When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, they believe to have \\"showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils\\". Lutherans teach the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist in their doctrine of the sacramental union. Lutherans, especially those with a High Church churchmanship, practice prayer for the dead.Martin Luther's Basic Theological Writings (Fortress Press 2012 ); cf. Elisa Erikson Barrett, What Was Lost: A Christian Journey through Miscarriage (Westminster John Knox Press 2010 ), p. 70 The Blessed Virgin Mary is held in high esteem by Lutherans, who universally teach the dogmas of the Theotokos and the Virgin Birth, with many also holding to the perpetual virginity of Mary and the sinlessness of Mary. Methodist theology new birth and entire sanctification to the public at events such as tent revivals and camp meetings, which they believe is the reason that God raised them up into existence. Methodist theology (also known as Wesleyan-Arminian theology) holds that God was sent to earth in the form of Jesus Christ to redeem all of mankind. Individuals experience justification in the New Birth and then move on to sanctification, the experience in which they are made holy. Good works, for Methodists, play an important role in sanctification, especially a careful keeping of the Ten Commandments, as well as practicing the Works of Piety and the Works of Mercy. Thus, in addition to the herlading the kerygma through evangelism, Methodists have advanced the Social Gospel through the establishment of hospitals, orphanages, soup kitchens, and schools to follow Christ's command to spread the good news and serve all people. Methodists believe that they can have an assurance of faith. With regard to sources on doctrine, Methodist theology teaches prima scriptura in the form of the Wesleyan Quadrilateral, which maintains that Scripture is to be the primary authority for the Church, with reason, personal experience, and Church tradition also being used to develop doctrine insofar as they agree with the Bible. Covenant theology is taught by the Methodist Churches: the covenant of grace was administered through \\"promises, prophecies, sacrifices, and at last by circumcision\\" during the patriarchal ages and through \\"the paschal lamb, the scape goat, [and] the priesthood of Aaron\\" under Mosaic Law. Under the Gospel, the covenant of grace is mediated through the greater sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper. In the Methodist Churches, baptism is a sacrament of initiation into the visible Church. Wesleyan covenant theology further teaches that baptism is a sign and a seal of the covenant of grace: Methodism teaches the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, while allowing the details of how Christ is made manifest in the sacrament of Holy Communion to be a mystery. Methodists give honour to the saints and martyrs by trying to live their example and dedicating churches to them; many Methodists practice prayer for the dead. Moravian theology Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a bishop of the Moravian Church, stated that Holy Communion is the \\"most intimate of all connection with the person of the Saviour.\\" The Moravian Church adheres to a view known as the sacramental presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Pentecostal theology Pentecostals pray in tongues at an Assemblies of God church in Canc√∫n, Mexico. Pentecostals, with their background in the holiness movement of Methodism, have added a third work of grace, a baptism with the Holy Spirit evidenced by glossolalia, to the new birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace). Quaker theology George Fox, the founder of Quakerism (Society of Friends), taught Perfectionism, in which the Christian believer could be made free from sin. The early Quakers, following Fox, taught that as a result of the New Birth through the power of the Holy Spirit, man could be free from actual sinning if he continued to rely on the inward light and \\"focus on the cross of Christ as the center of faith\\". George Fox emphasized \\"personal responsibility for faith and emancipation from sin\\" in his teaching on perfectionism. For the Christian, \\"perfectionism and freedom from sin were possible in this world\\". Reformed theology The Reformed tradition is represented by the Continental Reformed, Congregationalist, Anglican, and Reformed Baptist traditions. They teach the doctrines of predestination and limited atonement. The view of atonement taught by these denominations is known as penal substitution. With respect to salvation, the Reformed are monergist. Though five additional rites are celebrated, the Reformed tradition has two sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper, which are signs and seals of the covenant of grace according to federalism. Reformed Churches teach the real pneumatic presence with respect to the Lord's Supper. The Heidelberg Catechism, in explaining the Law and Gospel, teaches that the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments is binding for Christians and that it instructs Christians how to live in service to God in gratitude for His grace shown in redeeming mankind. John Calvin, the a lead figure in establishing the Reformed tradition, deemed this third use of the Law as its primary use.

Aspen Meadows is a 40-acre conference center and resort located amongst the Rocky Mountains in Aspen, Colorado. It is owned by the Aspen Institute, operated by Dolce Hotels and Resorts, and is the venue for some of the institute's most notable events, such as the annual Aspen Ideas Festival and Socrates Program seminars. It was designed by Herbert Bayer in the Bauhaus style.  History  The Goethe Bicentennial Convocation and Music Festival, organized by Walter Paepcke, was held in Aspen in 1949 in an amphitheater tent designed by Eero Saarinen. The success of the gathering led to the creation of the Aspen Institute. Programming was initially held in rotating locations, but by 1952 the institute's Executive Seminar needed a dedicated, purpose-built space and Paepcke purchased land for the institute from the Aspen Company (another Paepcke organization, which he had previously directed to purchase 100 acres of property in the Aspen Meadows). The first permanent building, the Executive Seminar building, was built in 1953.  Buildings   Walter Issacson Center   Madeleine K. Albright Pavilion   Kresge Building   Koch Seminar Building  David H. Koch Seminar Building When the Executive Seminar first began it didn't have a permanent space to use so its location varied from day to day. By 1952, the varied locations were problematic enough for Walter Paepcke to be convinced that a permanent, purpose-built space was needed. Mortimer J. Adler was consulted as to the ideal needs for the building and Herbert Bayer, in consultation with Fritz Benedict, were charged with designing and supervising the construction of the Executive Seminar Building. It was built at a cost of $52,000 (1953 dollars) and became the first permanent Institute building. The building consists of two large hexagonal shaped seminar rooms and several smaller offices.

History Originally built in 1933 by Japanese during their occupation , the building used to be a copper and gold smelter plant called the Shuinandong Smelter that used to process refined ore from Jinguashi and Jiufen. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the refinery was taken over by the state-run company. In 1973, the copper and gold minerals from the area had been exhausted and subsequently the activity and company were shut down. During World War II between 1942 and 1945, the Japanese Empire sent approximately one thousand prisoners of war (POWs) to the gold mines surrounding the smelting plant. The POWs were from allied nations, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States . The Taiwan POW Memorial Park now stands in memory of the POWs that died in the harsh mining conditions . The site and the surrounding mining infrastructure are listed as potential world heritage sites.

At a length of 2 km and a diameter of 2 meters, it is the world's longest pipe. Popular culture The building has been featured in several music videos.

It roughly lies along the west side of the Cowlitz River, north of Toledo, east of the Interstate 5 in Washington and South of U.S. Route 12. The Lower Cowlitz tribal group traditional territory includes Cowlitz Prairie. Early 19th century visitors noticed an area mainly cleared of trees and assessed its dimensions from 4 to 6 miles long, 1 to 2 miles wide, adding up to nearly 6000 acres. The geographical area holds numerous historical locations in what is now the U.S. state of Washington such as the Simon Plamondon original settler property after being adopted by the Lower Cowlitz people (1826), the Hudson Bay Company Cowlitz Farm (1839), the Saint Francis Xavier Mission (1839), the first Catholic mission in the state and the nearby Cowlitz Landing location where a first convention was held (1851), leading to the creation of a new territory. Cowlitz Prairie is also known as an early Pacific Northwest mixed ancestry settlement, sometimes referred as a French Canadian or a M√©tis settlement.Robert Foxcurran, Michel Bouchard, S√©bastien Malette. Songs Upon The Rivers. Baraka Books. Montreal 2016. p. 46 History Hudson Bay Company (HBC) related Simon Plamondon married the daughter of a Cowlitz tribe leader and built the first cabin in the early 1830s with permission to settle near the tribe. By 1833, Plamondon and Fran√ßois Faignant were successful subsistence farmers soon joined by Joseph Rochbrune and Michel Coutenoir, after also having gained permissions. By 1838, the HBC had permission to set up its Cowlitz Farm facility on 3000 acres, nearly half of the prairie area. By 1841, the Wilkes expedition reported ¬´ a Catholic priest belonging to the Columbia Missionary established among the small community here which consists of half a dozen Canadians who have married Indians & half- breeds‚Äù. About two dozen workmen were attending the farm sheep and cattle, including some local natives. By 1843, sixty-four people and thirteen families form the settlement. Retired Canadian fur traders with Cree, Ojibwe, Nipissing, Abenaki and Iroquois ancestry continued to settle and marry into the local Cowlitz and Chinook tribes. This would evolve into a heterogeneous M√©tis village of log cabins and Indian camps scattered over the remaining acres in the prairie. The HBC had also started to head north of 1846 the border. Twenty early settlers were installed by 1850s, by which time the Cowlitz Farm was ramping down after expiry of the Russian-American Company HBC contract. Following various Indigenous uprisings throughout the Territory of Washington and escalating pressure from settlers arriving through the Oregon Trail, the first territorial Governor ordered in 1855 the Cowlitz and Chinook tribal members to clear out of their homelands. Some refused and found shelter in the settlement. In addition, exclusionary laws limiting land claims made it difficult to secure claims as Americans were also filing claims, displacing squatters allowed in earlier on. Although shattered by much turmoil, the community nonetheless continued on close-knit French-speaking Catholic, under an influx of newcomers attracted by such a community. Well into the 20th century many inhabitants of Cowlitz Prairie and surrounding communities continued to speak the Cowlitz Salishan language and French, supplemented by the Chinook Wawa.

He was re-assigned to Gr√§tz in Silesia, where he died, and Regina was put into the care of her uncle. He entered her into a convent, where she was given singing lessons. She joined the opera company in Hamburg and sang there between 1743 and 1747, where she married the impresario Pietro Mingotti, but parted from him not long afterwards. While still with her husband, Regina relocated to Dresden, where she undertook further studies with the distinguished composer Nicola Porpora and scored great successes at the opera house, arousing the jealousy of that company's reigning prima donna Faustina Bordoni.

She spent 1751‚Äì1753 in Madrid, appearing in operas under the direction of the celebrated castrato Farinelli. Following that, she sang in Paris and made her debut in London, where she became a major star. She composed and published songs there, and quarreled with the manager of the opera house where she appeared, attacking him in pamphlets she published under her own name. Regina had him dismissed, and took over the management of the theatre herself, while continuing to star in the performances. She thus became the first woman to manage an opera company in Britain. Her management of the opera company was very controversial. Tours of Italy followed her time in London, after which she retired first to Munich and then to Neuburg.

History  The second most used category of bombs was the SD series which were high-explosive bombs but with thicker casings which meant their charge to weight ratio was only 30 to 40% of their total weight. At first glance, they were difficult to distinguish from the SC series of bombs, but the two series were color-coded the SC series having yellow tail stripes, while the SD series had red tail stripes. Bombs in this series were the SD 1, SD 1 FRZ, SD 2, SD 10 A, SD 10 FRZ, SD 10 C, SD 15, SD 50, SD 70, SD 250, SD 500, SD 1400, and SD 1700. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The SD series was used primarily in two roles that were determined by the type of fuze and accessories fitted to the bomb. The first was as a fragmentation bomb with instantaneous fuze and when the bombs exploded above ground the case created large fragments which would kill enemy personnel and destroy unarmored vehicles. The second role was as a general- purpose or armor-piercing role. In this role, the bombs were fitted with a time delay fuze which detonated the bomb after it had pierced a target destroying it with a combination of its blast and fragments.  Design  The body of the SD 50 was of one piece cast and machined steel construction. The body had one transverse fuze pocket just forward of the horizontal carrying lug. Around the nose of the bomb there was often a kopfring - a metal ring, triangular in cross section, designed to prevent ground penetration. In addition to the kopfring an anti-ricochet adapter for anti-ship use or a dinort rod could be added to obtain pre-penetration detonation for anti- personnel use. The SD 50 was filled through the base and was fitted with either a Type 1 or Type 2 tail assembly. The Type 1 had a cast alloy adapter with sheet steel fins while the Type 2 was a one-piece assembly made of cast magnesium alloy. It could be vertically or horizontally suspended in a bomb bay or horizontally mounted on a wing or fuselage hardpoint. The SD 50 was painted dark green and the tail cone was striped with red.

Jackson was born in Houston, Texas, raised in Los Angeles, and currently lives and works in New York, NY and Cambridge, MA. Jackson was named a 2019 Whitney Biennial participating artist. Jackson also serves on the faculty for sculpture at Rhode Island School of Design. Her work is included in the collection of MOCA Los Angeles. In 2004, a 20 foot high by 80 foot long mural by Jackson entitled Evolution of a Community was unveiled in the Los Angeles neighborhood of West Adams.  Artistic practice  Jackson's work investigates the relationships between the aesthetic and the political. Jackson references layered content bridging historical actions with shifting artistic structures. Her multimedia practice draws from Josef Albers' research on color relativity, \\"resulting in works with exuberant color, bold geometry, and intricate layerings of material.\\" Jackson first became interested in Albers' work while studying painting and printmaking at Yale University. At the time she noted that the language Albers used to describe color perception phenomenon mirrored the language around racial segregation found in education policy and the transcripts of civil rights court cases fought by Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. This analysis led Jackson to use color theory as an aesthetic strategy to investigate and connect past and present. \\"Color theory and human rights are conceptually interwoven in my paintings,\\" said the artist. \\"I find the language comparisons appropriate metaphors for a critique of racism rather than a critique of categories of race.\\" Incorporating images painted from photographs and other materials chosen for their formal qualities, Jackson's work \\"bridges gaps between geometric experimentation and the systematization of injustice.\\" Jackson is interested in movement and migration, in particular how these activities are curtailed for populations of color. Her project at the 2019 Whitney Biennial compared people of color losing their homes in the 19th century, when Seneca Village was razed to become part of Central Park, with homeowners in Brooklyn recently losing their homes under a controversial policy known as third-party transfer.

Al-Hajjaj considered appointing him lieutenant governor of Khurasan, but was dissuaded by Caliph Abd al-Malik and ultimately selected Qutayba ibn Muslim. Conquest of Oman Unlike the rest of the caliphate, the region of Oman remained outside of direct Umayyad rule. Under Caliph Abd al- Malik (685‚Äì705), the viceroy of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, set about restoring and expanding Umayyad rule across the entire Persian Gulf, including Oman. The region had been autonomously ruled by the Azdite dynasty of the Julandids. Al- Hajjaj's initial attempts were repulsed and a large expeditionary force was dispatched under Mujjaa's brother al-Qasim. The latter was slain and his army routed, prompting al-Hajjaj to appoint Mujjaa in his place. Mujjaa was equipped with a 40,000-strong army consisting of troops from the Mudhar and Azd tribal factions of Basra garrison. Half the army attacked by land, while Mujjaa led the other half by sea. The land army was defeated by Sulayman ibn Abbad ibn Julanda, while Mujjaa engaged Sulaymans brother Said at Samalil. Said and Sulayman withdrew into Jabal al-Amhara where they alluded Mujjaas troops. They later ambushed Mujjaa ships docked off the coast near Muscat and defeated Mujjaa in battle. Al-Hajjaj sent 5,000 reinforcements under Abd al- Rahman ibn Sulayman. The combined pressure of al-Hajjajs generals compelled the Julandid brothers into fleeing for the Zanj coast (Horn of Africa) and Mujjaa and Abd al-Rahman subjected Oman to Umayyad rule.

It is used to treat high blood pressure and edema (swelling). Specifically it is used in those who develop low blood potassium (hypokalemia) when on only hydrochlorothiazide. It is taken by mouth. Side effects may include nausea, trouble sleeping, dizziness, feeling light headed with standing, kidney problems, allergies, and muscle cramps. Other serious side effects may include high blood potassium. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not generally recommended. Use in those with significant kidney problems is not recommended. It decreases blood pressure mainly by hydrochlorothiazide while triamterene decreases the amount of potassium lost. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1965.

Wade was an early American photographer through the late 19th to early 20th centuries. His pioneering photographic techniques of the 1890s led to the concept of the ‚ÄúPing-Pong photo‚Äù which revolutionized the professional photographic studios of the early 1900s.  Career  Wade came up with the original idea for producing Ping-Pong photographs, which he named the \\"little photo\\", while working for Mr. Chas. T. Pomeroy, a photographer from Kansas City, Mo. Wade began publicly selling his small portrait concept to the public on July 17, 1897. It was a huge success. Over the next four years he produced over 500,000 photo's. Wade then moved to Colorado opening a photo studio in Denver. In 1901, Wade moved to Ohio and opened 5 galleries. The main gallery was located in Akron on 207 E. Market St. Of the remaining four, two were located in Columbus, one in Canton, and one in Massilon. In 1904, Wade moved to Youngstown, Ohio and for the next 35 years operated \\"Wade's Studio\\" on W. Federal Street. His exact address on this street varied over time. The Ohio Business Directory includes records of the following locations of Wade's studio from 1908-1927: 17, 101, 103, and 105 W. Federal Street. He was attributed by the Youngstown Vindicator Newspaper in the August 10th, 1905 edition as holding the world's record for taking the most portrait photographs from 1897 to 1905. This was largely attributed to the popularity of his \\"little photo's\\" concept. In addition, the article also stated \\"The first 6 months of this year [1905] in the neighborhooding city of New Castle he made sittings for fifteen thousand dozens photographs, the most phenomenal photographic run ever made in that city.\\" [See \\"Noted Photographer Here\\" image this page].

Alongside Arnold Dyck and Reuben Epp, he is an important contributor to the development of Mennonite Low German literature as well as one of the language's most prominent lexicographers. Early life and education Thiessen was born in Gnadenfeld, near Grunthal. Thiessen graduated from the University of Manitoba and received his PhD at the University of Marburg. Career In addition to Plautdietsch writing, he has also written about Yiddish and has translated numerous works, including Antoine de Saint- Exupery's The Little Prince into Plautdietsch. Thiessen is perhaps most well known for his influential Plautdietsch language dictionary. The 1977 edition of Thiessen's dictionary, published two years before Herman Rempel's dictionary, was the first published Plautdietsch dictionary, a language that had until then been primarily a spoken language. The dictionary has been expanded considerably in editions since then and been utilized by writers, such as Rudy Wiebe wishing to write, not just speak, in Plautdietsch. According to John Consadine, co-editor of Refractions of Germany in Canadian Literature and Culture, Thiessen's dedication to the study of Plautdietsch grew out of his desire to be a creative writer in the small language that was his mother tongue. Thiessen was a professor of German Studies at the University of Winnipeg for many years. Publications * Jack Thiessen: Yiddish in Canada: The death of a language.

Members of the Big Sky Conference, the Wildcats were led by third-year head coach Phil Johnson and played their home games on campus at Swenson Gym in Ogden, Utah. They were in the regular season and in conference play. The conference tournament was five years away, and for the fourth consecutive season, Weber State won the Big Sky title and played in the 25-team NCAA Tournament. In the West regional at nearby Logan, they met Jerry Tarkanian's Long Beach State 49ers in the first round for a second straight year and lost again, this time by eleven points. Following the season, Johnson became an assistant in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls under Dick Motta, whom he had played for in high school in Idaho and coached under at Weber.

All but two of the tracks on the album are covers, with Lage telling Guitar World ‚Äúthe whole idea was to do songs I love‚Äù. Lage also said the songs were chosen because they all packed an ‚Äúemotion punch‚Äù, as well as being shorter-form, and written by American songwriters over the past 50‚Äì60 years (with the exception of one early-1930s popular song). The album was recorded at The Loft, the rehearsal and recording facility of the American band Wilco. Each song was recorded live in the studio in one or two takes, with Lage aiming to ‚Äúcapture the early stages‚Äù. Rather than using his 1954 telecaster, Lage recorded the album with a 1956 Gretsch Duo Jet owned by Wilco front man Jeff Tweedy, through a Gibson BR-6 amplifier. Reception The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek stated \\"Of all the records in Lage's catalog, Love Hurts sounds like it was the most fun to make; in turn, it is a complete delight for listeners\\". On All About Jazz, Chris Mosey said \\"Julian Lage is a tremendously talented acoustic guitarist and by all accounts a polite, mild mannered kind of guy. Though this might not be the whole story. The cover picture of his album is of twenty used matches, which is thought to refer to his worries of becoming burnt-out after being hailed as a child prodigy then burdened with the lofty expectations of his admirers ... what he does best is to revisit and transform melancholy old pop numbers. His arrangement of the title track, an Everly Brothers' hit from 1965, is quite stunning and his playing of it makes you forget the number's lachrymose country origins\\".Mosey, C. All About Jazz Review accessed March 5, 2019 Referring to the way the album included covers of both pop and jazz songs, Suzanne Lorge wrote in Downbeat ‚ÄúOn the surface, these [songs] all might not have much to communicate to each other. But Lage‚Äôs incisive musicality and clean fretwork go a long way to bridging aesthetic divides. His two originals (‚ÄúIn Circles‚Äù and ‚ÄúLullaby‚Äù) are the most inclusive selections on the recording, borrowing from nearly everything else and signaling the guitarist‚Äôs compositional intent: to build musical bridges firmly rooted in place, but standing outside of time and genre.‚Äù Bruce Lindsay, in his review on Jazz Journal, said of the track list, ‚ÄúLage is equally at home with jazz and country/Americana numbers ‚Äì and with the more unusual‚Ä¶All three players are subtle and restrained, playing with a lightness of touch that suits the downbeat mood of the song.‚Äù In a long form interview with Lage for JazzTimes, James Rotondi wrote of the album ‚ÄúEclectic though it may be, the material on Love Hurts reflects Lage‚Äôs interest in finding single vehicles through which to express a total vision.‚Äù Track listing # \\"In Heaven\\" (Peter Ivers, David Lynch) ‚Äì 4:34 # \\"Tomorrow Is the Question\\" (Ornette Coleman) ‚Äì 3:36 # \\"The Windup\\" (Keith Jarrett) ‚Äì 4:03 # \\"Love Hurts\\" (Boudleaux Bryant) ‚Äì 4:45 # \\"In Circles\\" (Julian Lage) ‚Äì 4:30 # \\"Encore (A)\\" (Keith Jarrett) ‚Äì 4:44 # \\"Lullaby\\" (Lage) ‚Äì 3:45 # \\"Trudgin'\\" (Jimmy Giuffre) ‚Äì 3:57 # \\"I'm Getting Sentimental Over You\\" (George Bassman, Ned Washington) ‚Äì 4:06 # \\"Crying\\" (Roy Orbison, Joe Melson) ‚Äì 5:34 Personnel * Julian Lage ‚Äì guitar * Jorge Roeder ‚Äì bass * David King ‚Äì drums References Category:2019 albums Category:Julian Lage albums Category:Mack Avenue Records albums ","title":"Love Hurts (Julian Lage album)"},{"id":"60141229","text":"Daniel Cordaro is an American research scientist and psychologist who specializes in emotion psychology and human wellbeing. As a former faculty member at Yale University, Cordaro is best-known for his research in human emotion and positive psychology. Formerly the director of the Universal Expression Project at the University of California, Berkeley, Cordaro has conducted various worldwide studies on human emotional expression. Cordaro directed the Universal Expression Project at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as the Contentment Lab at Yale University. Currently, he is the director of the Contentment Foundation, a non-profit organization that he had formed with Emilio Diez Barroso from the Contentment Lab at Yale University. Education Cordaro grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He received his M.A. and Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley. He also earned an M.S. in organic chemistry from UC Berkeley. After graduating from UC Berkeley, Cordaro completed his postdoctoral work at Yale University in 2014. Since 2009, Cordaro has studied human emotions and human well-being across several cultures. Career In 2009, Cordaro directed the Universal Expression Project at the University of California, Berkeley. His team completed some of the largest international emotional expression studies and began to decode a universal language of human emotion. It extended the list of universal emotions and provided evidence for amusement, awe, contentment, desire, embarrassment, pain, relief, and sympathy in both facial and vocal expressions. The project has covered over 10 countries around the world, including Bhutan. In 2015, he became a faculty member at Yale University and the Director of Wellbeing at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, where he lead the Contentment Lab and published some of the first original research on contentment.Cordaro, D. T., Brackett, M., Glass, L., & Anderson, C. L. (2016). Contentment: Perceived completeness across cultures and traditions. Review of General Psychology, 20(3), 221. Cordaro co- founded Good Group with Justin Milano in 2015. In 2016, along with Emilio Diez Barroso, he co-founded the Contentment Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides wellbeing assessments, curricula, and practices for children and adults in schools internationally. The Contentment Foundation is based on \\"The Four Pillars of Wellbeing,\\" with the pillars being mindfulness, community, self-curiosity, and contentment. The Contentment Foundation's main service is to bring positive psychology and wellness practices to schools and organizations. In January 2020, the foundation expanded its offerings to include a new ‚ÄúFamily Platform‚Äù that allows families to practice wellbeing at home. Cordaro's research reveals that across many cultures and traditions, contentment is the most prized emotion above all others, including happiness. Cordaro's philosophy for cultivating contentment includes practicing mindfulness, compassion and unconditionally accepting all emotions.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), is a United States federal court case in which the Supreme Court of the United States decided the characteristics of inferior officers of the United States for the purposes of the Appointments Clause.. The case concerned the appointment method of special trial judges of the United States Tax Court. The Court was unanimous in its conclusion that special trial judges were inferior officers under the Appointments Clause, rather than mere employees, because of the characteristics of their office and that their appointment was constitutional. Positions constitute inferior officers when the position (1) is established by law and (2) exercises significant authority (3) involving significant discretion. The division between the majority, led by Justice Harry Blackmun, and the concurrence, led by Justice Antonin Scalia, centered on the status of the Tax Court itself. Under the Appointments Clause, inferior officers may only be appointed by the President, Heads of Departments, or the Courts of Law. The majority determined the Tax Court, which exercises power as an Article I court was a \\"Court of Law\\" for the purpose of the Appointments Clause and was thus constitutional. The concurrence, however, would have held \\"Courts of Law\\" are limited to traditional Article III courts. Instead, the concurrence would have permitted the appointments under the view that the Tax Court is a \\"Head of a Department\\". Facts Under the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the United States Congress established the United States Tax Court as an Article I court and charged it with adjudicating disputes over federal income tax. The judges of the Tax Court were to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve a term of 15 years. By amendments in 1984, Congress authorized the Chief Judge of the Tax Court to appoint and assign special trial judges to hear such cases as the Chief Judge may designate. Thomas Freytag and several other defendants were charged by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with using a tax shelter scheme to avoid paying approximately $1.5 billion in taxes. The defendants petitioned to the Tax Court to review the Commissioner's determination. Their case was assigned by the Chief Judge of the Tax Court to a special trial judge with the consent the defendants. The special trial judge upheld the Commissioner's decision and the Chief Judge subsequently adopted the opinion as that of the Tax Court itself. The defendants appeals the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, arguing the appointment of a special trial judge violated the Appointments Clause found in Article II of the United States Constitution, which provides that inferior officers of the United States may be appointed by the \\"Courts of Law\\". The defendants asserted the Courts of Law referenced in the Appointments Clause includes only Article III judges, such as federal district judges, and not the Article I judges like the Chief Judge of the Tax Court. The Fifth Circuit rejected the defendant's arguments and affirmed the Tax Court's decision, ruling the statute authorized the appointment. Further, the defendants had waived any constitutional challenge to the appointment by consent to the assignment. Opinion of the Court Blackmun Majority 160px Justice Harry Blackmun determined the appointment of the special trial judge did not violate the Appointments Clause. Under the clause, Congress may invest the power to appoint inferior officers of the United States in the President, Heads of Departments, or the Courts of Law. As a preliminary issue, the Court was forced to determine if the special trial judges were \\"inferior officers\\" who are subject to the Clause as the defendants argued or if they were merely \\"lessor functionary\\", that is, employees of the federal government, who are not as the Commissioner argued. On this point, Blackmun agreed with the defendants, noting the special trial judges did far more than aid the regular judges of the Tax Court, instead exercising \\"significant authority\\" under the law. That the decisions of the special trial judge were not final until adopted by the Chief Judge did not reduce their officer status. The office of special trial judge was established by law, with their duties also specified by law. Further, the special trial judges performed more than mere ministerial tasks, instead exercising \\"significant discretion\\" in the performance of their duties. While agreeing with the defendants that the special trial judge was an officer of the United States who must be appointed in conformity with the Clause's requirements, Blackmun rejected the notation that their appointment by the Chief Judge of the Tax Court did not comply with the Clause. Reviewing the historical rationale behind the Appointments Clause, Blackmun noted the Clause's principal purpose was to limit who could exercise the power to appoint federal officers, thereby ensuring those who wielded the power were accountable to the American people. While the Chief Judge was not a head of a department - which the Court had previously limited only to members of the United States Cabinet such as the United States Secretary of State or the United States Secretary of the Treasury ‚Äì the Tax Court he presided over did quality as Court a Law. Blackmun held that the term \\"Courts of Law\\" was not limited to Article III courts but also included Article I courts.

The financial situation of a person, whether or not his work is well coordinated with Karachukha's activities. According to the belief, the work of a person goes well if their Karachukha is awake. To be careful of Karachuka, you need to name it, it can be remembered. Therefore, in many regions of Azerbaijan, Yasin is read for Karachukha and also while cooking, salt is thrown into the dish on behalf of Karachukha. In the name of Karachukha, the dessert is distributed to poor families who come to the door. Moreover, it is a sin to refuse to salvage Garachukha. In the texts, Karachuka is always at home. It is noted that when he was lying on the roof and entering the house he should greet Karachukha. Garachuka's leaving the house is written as the closing of the family's fortune. The name Garachuka is operated in Garabagh, Salyan-Neftchala, Lankaran-Masalli, Mugan regions of Azerbaijan, and this character is known in Sheki-Zagatala region as Nakhsh. From the functional point of view, these characters are similar to each other, but differ from their appearance. So Garachukha is usually described as a human being resembling a man with a black hole on his shoulder. It is likely that the personage is called Garachukha, it comes from here. Lighthouse, guarding the herd, does not allow her to feed the birds, and does not allow the thieves to steal sheep from the flock, preventing the spread of fire when awakened at night, waking up the house yaw, and so on. There is no clear description of the outward signs of the pattern. Garachuka usually exists outside of human beings, and your embroidery is inscribed in some texts inside and outside of others. For example, in the fairy tale about Bakht and Nakhsh's debate, Nakhsh is described inside a man. When embroidered into a person's body, his work goes well, and when he leaves his body, failures begin. The presence of the soul in the human body exists in archaic mythological imaginations. There are six types of shaman beliefs, one of which is a person's fate. According to researchers, Garachukha, Nakhichean mythonyms appeared in the Azerbaijani environment and the archaic name of these characters is preserved among the Turkic peoples of Southern Siberia. Known as Trouble, Milk, Yula, this mythological character is one of the few souls of man. He is like a believer and can walk out of the body. It is the name of this mythological personality in the applause and insolence of the \\"dove\\" or \\"drifting\\", which is typical for Goyche, Borchali and Gazakh regions (A.Asgar). The imaginations about Garachukha are found in different poetic forms. The vast majority of these texts are mythological traditions. Such legends, which are considered to be myths distorted, occur in the recent past, as are the language of the witnesses or the event that has happened to someone they know. In tales, Garachuka acts as a bewitching creature. Many objects, such as \\"Finding a Blessing\\", \\"Conflict of Blessing\\", \\"Lucky Man\\" and \\"False Falcine,\\" are based on the concepts of Garachukha. In addition, beliefs, bayats, and other genres can also be seen in Karachuka's imaginations.

The covers are mostly rusty, rarely touched by pile technique. In addition, both pile and non-woven weave (also known as \\"mysterious\\" tissue technique) are also available. One of these rods is the Chulaian example of the Shirvan group, preserved in the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum and dating back to the late 19th century. Unique with its rich ornament and color harmony, this unique feature draws attention to its uniqueness. The composition consists of intermediate and three edges, and it is decorated with a geometric element, stylized butterfly and bird drawings. On the border there is the sign \\"flow water\\" representing the infinity and protection of the S-shaped hinge motifs. In the center section, the \\"combs\\" element, which is described in consistency, means being protected from scams. Generally, such elements can be found in many carpet products. The element \\"Pƒ±traq\\", which means abundance and blessing, is also considered to be one of the main ornaments hanging on chulpe. Flower elements decorating borders symbolize divine love and longing. Shelles were widely used in special gatherings and banquets to protect the animal (horses, camels, oxen) or to protect the animal in cold weather. At the touch of wool, cotton, and sometimes silk threads, the weaving knives woven themselves and decorated them with various ornaments. The rectangular shape of the wick rope was wounded with fringed skulls. The decoration of the cherries, the artistic design differed from the people's belongings. For example, the use of precious stones was used in the artistic design of the sculpted chunks for rulers and officials. The history of home appliances with the help of pile carpet technology in Azerbaijan goes back to ancient times. According to archaeological materials and written sources, carpets in Azerbaijan were still engaged in Bronze Age (the end of the II millennium BC - early in the 1st millennium). A clay decorated with flower patterns on a horseshoe hinge found in Maku, South Azerbaijan (2 millennium BC) is officially painted on the surface of the golden glass found on Hasanli Hill, near Lake Urmia, and other findings show that carpet art in Azerbaijan has ancient history. Written sources provide detailed information on many carpet products, including chulls, which are woven in Azerbaijan.

Youth  Hahn was the third child of the Rhenish Missionary Johannes Samuel Hahn and Helene Langenbeck. He spent his first six years at the mission Eben-Ezer in the Western Cape, until 1848, when the family moved to Bethanie in Great Namaqualand (now South West Africa. He spoke Khoekhoe, the language of the Nama, like a second mother tongue. In 1849, he was sent to school in Barmen, (Germany), the Rhenish Missionary headquarters. When his father retired in 1852, Hahn lived at the family home there, but never forgot his time in Namaland.  Higher education  Hahn at first planned to return to SWA to work as a surveyor and cartographer, but after his vocational training he decided to return to the subject of the Nama, spending four years at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg studying linguistics with professor August Pott, a pioneering researcher on the comparative grammar of Bantu languages. During his studies, he began contributing linguistic and ethnographic papers to German journals: Die Nama- Hottentotten: ein Beitrag zur s√ºdafrikanischen Ethnographie (\\"The Nama: A Contribution to Southern African Ethnography), Globus XII (Dresden, 1867); Sagen und M√§rchen der Ova-Herero in S√ºdafrika (\\"Proverbs and Folktales of the Ovaherero in Southern Africa\\"), Globus XIII (Dresden, 1868); Ein Raunkampf in der n√∂rdlichen Kap-Kolonie (\\"A Gossip War in Northern Cape Colony\\"), Globus XIV, nos. 7 and 8 (Dresden, 1868); Beitr√§ge zur Kunde von den Hottentotten, Jahresberichte des Vereins f√ºr Erdkunde (\\"Contributions on the Customs of the Khoikhoi, Annual Report of the Dresden Geographical Society\\") (Dresden, 1868/69); Die Buschm√§nner: ein Beitrag zur s√ºdafrikanischen V√∂lkerkunde (\\"The San: A Contribution to Southern African Ethnology\\"), Globus XVIII (Dresden, 1870); Der hottentottische Tsui-//goab und der Indogermanische Zeus, Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft f√ºr Erdkunde (\\"The Khoikhoi Tsui-//goab and the Indo-European Zeus, Journal of the Berlin Geographical Society\\") (Berlin, 1870). He matriculated from Halle in 1870 with his dissertation Die Sprache der Nama; nebst einem Anhang enthaltend Sprachproben aus dem Munde des Volkes (\\"The Language of the Nama: with an Appendix Featuring Sample Dialogue from the Mouths of the People\\") (Leipzig, 1870). He spent many of his vacations at Schloss Poschwitz of the Privy Councillor Hans Conon von der Gabelentz, a colleague of Pott's, who owned an excellent collection of publications on Africa. Hahn understood, besides the Nama and Herero languages, German, English, Dutch, Latin, and Greek. There is evidence that he was corresponding quite early with colleagues such as C.F. Wuras and Wilhelm Bleek. After finishing his doctorate, he stayed briefly in the Cape where he married Marianne Esther de la Roche Smuts, daughter of Cornelius Smuts, M.D.; the marriage produced two sons and a daughter, who died in infancy.  Return to his homeland  In 1871, he returned to SWA, settling among the «ÅHawoben tribe of Nama (known by the colonials as Velskoendraers or Veldschoendragers, translating to \\"wearers of pelt shoes\\") in Keetmanshoop. He tried to make a living trading with them, but failed due to constant inter-tribal warfare. Observing that trade would never develop there without government intervention, he sent a letter to the Cape Colony magistrate in Springbok, Northern Cape on 21 October 1872, statistically outlining the lucrative trade between the Cape Colony and claiming it could be doubled were the Cape colonial authorities to pacify the area. Receiving no response, Hahn moved north to Rehoboth, where he sought more reliable shelter among the mixed-race Baster population. Both found it difficult to submit to the authority of the Baster Council and objected to the annual $25 tariff and the smaller local tax. They refused to pay more than half of it, and insisted that half of the court that settled disputes between Basters and whites should be white. The immediate cause of the controversy was Hahn's written invitation to Transvaal Boer hunter Hendrik van Zyl and his associates in Ghansies to settle east of Rehoboth, in which Hahn told Van Zyl 40‚Äì50 settlers could easily take control of the area and alleged already inviting farmers from the Kamiesberg hills to settle in northern Namaland when he met them on a business trip to Cape Town. When Hahn's actions came to light, Captain Hermanus van Wyk and his fellow members of the Baster Council ordered Hahn and Steyn to leave. The temperamental Hahn immediately appealed in a letter to the chief of the «ÅKhau«Ägoan (called by white settlers the Swartbooi Nama), who once had occupied the Basters' land, asking him to leave as well. Cooler heads prevailed, and no action was taken against Hahn. Meanwhile, his letter had reached Maharero, paramount chief of the Herero, who was up in arms at the prospect of a Boer invasion of Damaraland. He summoned Hahn to Okahandja to explain his actions, but Hahn bluntly refused to and asked Maharero to pay him debt. Maharero and other chiefs then petitioned the Cape government for protection. In response, Special Commissioner William Coates Palgrave was sent to SWA to discuss protectorate possibilities with the chiefs, the famed Palgrave Commission. Palgrave, for his part, was disappointed in Hahn's disrespectful treatment of the natives and opposition to a British protectorate in the Transgariep.  Moving to Cape Colony  Hahn thought it prudent to leave SWA in 1878. He moved to Stellenbosch, where his older brother, Johannes Samuel Hahn, Jr., was headmaster of the Rhenish Missionary School. There, Hahn surveyed the first map of SWA Original map of Namaqualand and Damaraland (Cape Town, 1879). On the recommendation of the renowned German linguist Max M√ºller, Hahn was appointed on 1 February 1881, as the \\"royal philologist\\" and curator of the Sir George Grey Collection in what is now the National Library of South Africa campus in Cape Town, in which capacity he cataloged its contents as An index to the Grey collection in the South African public library (Cape Town, 1884). Despite severe bibliographic flaws and multiple errors, it was used for decades as a basic catalog to supplement Bleek's 1858 one. Several scholarly works he produced during this period derive from his second period in SWA: The graves of Heitsi-eibib: a chapter on the prehistoric Hottentot race, Cape Monthly Magazine, XVI (1878); Tsuni-//Goam, The Supreme Being of the Khoi-Khoi (London, 1881); Early African exploration, up to the end of the 16th century (Cape Town, 1882), and On the science of language and its study with special regard to South Africa (Cape Town, 1882), and his address from 29 April 1882, in Cape Town to the 53rd annual members' conference of the South African Public Library. He contributed heavily to the report of the 1883 Cape Government Commission on Native Laws and Customs, displaying his familiarity with the Nama way of life. Perhaps a better scholar and researcher than librarian, he was dismissed by Charles Aken Fairbridge and other members of the library committee on 30 November 1883. While living in Cape Town, he once again participated in historical events. He gave valuable information on SWA's commercial potential to the young Heinrich Vogelsang, who was securing the first land concessions in SWA for the firm of Adolf L√ºderitz, helping Vogelsang buy the Angra Pequena (now L√ºderitz Bay) by recommending his bona fides to Josef Frederiks II, owner of that area and chief of the «ÉAman Nama based in Bethanie. During his years in Stellenbosch, Hahn was disillusioned with a lack of equipment and funds for his surveying work. The lean years in Stellenbosch yielded his brochure Viticulture in South Africa: a scheme for the development of the Cape wine industry (London, 1888).  Once more in SWA  Throughout 1889, Hahn worked in SWA as an agent for the Kharaskhoma Exploring and Prospecting Syndicate to acquire land and mineral rights to the territory of the Bondelswarts and the Velskoendraers along with the area of Swartmodder (now Keetmanshoop). This gave him the money in Stellenbosch to buy the home of a physician, Dr. Hanf, at the foot of Papegaaiberg on the road to Lynedoch. Despite the help of his son Roderick, his farming venture failed; his wife died in 1895, and he went bankrupt in 1898. After the Second Boer War, he made a meager living working for a mining company until he died of cancer.  Personality and assessment  Many of his problems could be attributed to his high-strung, pretentious character, which annoyed even his own family. His research brought him acclaim abroad and membership in famed scientific societies such as the aforementioned Geographical Societies of Dresden and Berlin and the Anthropological Society of Vienna, but he was not a scholar of substance. His conclusions and theories in Tsuni-//Goam, The Supreme Being of the Khoi-Khoi and On the Science of Language have not held up to scrutiny, especially in the latter, in which he reveals his antipathy toward what he called \\"the Dutch patois in this Colony.\\" On the other hand, his writings on the culture of the Khoikhoi and San are seminal to Westerners' understanding of these peoples, and he was among the first to study San attitudes toward the Boophone disticha, a medicinal herb with local spiritual connotations. Some of his books and writings are in the collection of the Ferdinand Postma Library at the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education. Photos of him can be found in the album collection of the National Library. South African College professor Paul Daniel Hahn was his brother.  Sources  * (af) De Kock, W.J. 1968.

It lives in the Indo-Pacific, where it is endemic to the coastal waters of the southern parts of Australia. Description Girella zebra has a moderately short and deep, compressed, oval body with a relatively thin caudal peduncle. It has a small head with a bulging forehead and small eyes. The mouth is small, not extending to the level of the front of the eye. The maxilla are hidden beneath the preorbital bones. There are two rows of teeth on each jaw; the outer row consists of non-overlapping, flattened, tricuspid teeth, while the adjacent inner row is made up of a wide band of minute teeth similar in shape to the teeth in the outer row. The fish is largely covered in small ctenoid scales and the lateral line is continuous, has 72-80 scales and arches in parallel to the curve of the back. The dorsal fin is continuous and shows almost no difference in height between the spiny and soft-rayed parts. The spiny part has 14 spines, is around a third longer than the soft-rayed part, which as 13-15 soft rays, with the longest spines, which are marginally longer than the longest rays, are in its middle. The anal fin is similar in length and form to the soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin and sits opposite it. The anal fin has three spines and 11 soft rays. The large caudal fin is broadly forked, the pectoral and pelvic fins are small, and the uppermost rays of the pectoral fin are the longest. The adult G. zebra has a pale body with nine or ten dark bars on the flanks, which taper ventrally, with pale yellow fins. The juveniles are darker with more indistinct markings, and may be confused for luderick. This species grows to a maximum total length of . Distribution Girella zebra is found in the Indian and western Pacific Ocean; it is endemic to southern Australia. It can be found from Clarence River in New South Wales south to Tasmania, all along the southern Australian coast and up the western coast of Western Australia north to Port Denison. Habitat and biology Girella zebra is normally found around rocky reefs in shallow coastal waters from in depth. It may also be observed in sheltered offshore waters and in estuaries. The flattened teeth and long narrow gill rakers are used to feed on small prey. It is mainly a herbivore, feeding on seaweeds, but it will also feed on benthic invertebrates such as sea squirts. This is a schooling species. Parasitism Members of the Girella zebra species are hosts to a recently discovered species of parasitic flatworms. Pholeohedra overstreeti was identified and described by dissecting the intestines of the Girella zebra, showing a parasitic relationship.  Taxonomy  There are a total of 18 species currently recognized as belonging to the Girella genus, including Girella cyanea, Girella elevata, Girella fimbriata, and Girella leonina. G. zebra belong to the family Kyphosidae, which consists of a group of marine organisms called sea chubs. Kyphosidae are major macroalgal feeders on coral reefs. Members of this family are widely distributed throughout the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Kyphosidae is home to about 42 species divided into two subfamilies, Kyphosinae and Girellinae. Girella zebra was first formally described as Crenidens zebra by the Scottish naval surgeon, naturalist and Arctic explorer Sir John Richardson in volume 2 of his Ichthyology of the voyage of H. M. S. Erebus & Terror published in 1846. Hybridisation Girella zebra is rare in New South Wales. There, and in eastern Victoria, it hybridises with G. elevata.

The focal point of the \\"M√°scaras vs. Cabellera\\" series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their mask or hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. The main event of the March 2019 M√°scara vs. Cabellera event Dr√°gon Bane and Death Metal put their masks on the line while Cerebro Negro and Oficial AK-47 put their hair on the line. Because Dr√°gon Bane pined Oficial AK-47, AK-47 was forced to have all his hair shaved off as a result of the loss, The show included six additional matches, Production Background In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. By the same token a wrestler betting his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas is seen as highly prestigious, usually a step below the mask match. Storylines The event featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Eventually, unable to tolerate the school, he ran away from home. When he returned, he was enrolled at the Teacher's Seminary instead, and graduated from there in 1910, although he had no intention of becoming a teacher. Instead, from 1911 to 1914, he studied at the Krak√≥w Academy of Fine Arts, where he enrolled as a Ukrainian. While there, he was awarded several medals. During World War I, he was drafted into the Austro- Hungarian Army and was assigned to the press corps of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen.Biography @ the Osip Sorokhtei website. When he was mustered out of service in 1918, he participated in the Ukrainian War of Independence, but became disillusioned, so he returned home. In 1919, he resumed his studies at the Academy with Yulian Pankevych, among others. After graduating, he worked as a drawing teacher; initially at the (1920-1926). After 1925, he was a regular contributor to the satirical magazine Zyz (Squint), published in Lviv. One of his contributions was an unflattering caricature of the school's Director, which resulted in his dismissal. He then went to teach in Sniatyn (1926-1928).

In 1925, he had begun a series of drawings and paintings called Golgotha , which displeased Bishop Hryhoriy Khomyshyn. Despite this, in 1935, he received a commission from the theological seminary and produced a depiction of Christ's descent from the cross. It was considered too unconventional, however and, ironically, ended up being placed in a Jesuit church. Descent from the Cross He died of a heart attack in 1941.

Just as the p-value gives the expected false positive rate obtained by rejecting the null hypothesis for any result with an equal or smaller p-value, the q-value gives the expected pFDR obtained by rejecting the null hypothesis for any result with an equal or smaller q-value.  History  In statistics, testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously using methods appropriate for testing single hypotheses tends to yield many false positives: the so-called multiple comparisons problem. For example, assume that one were to test 1,000 null hypotheses, all of which are true, and (as is conventional in single hypothesis testing) to reject null hypotheses with a significance level of 0.05; due to random chance, one would expect 5% of the results to appear significant (P < 0.05), yielding 50 false positives (rejections of the null hypothesis). Since the 1950s, statisticians had been developing methods for multiple comparisons that reduced the number of false positives, such as controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) using the Bonferroni correction, but these methods also increased the number of false negatives (i.e. reduced the statistical power). In 1995, Yoav Benjamini and Yosef Hochberg proposed controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) as a more statistically powerful alternative to controlling the FWER in multiple hypothesis testing. The pFDR and the q-value were introduced by John D. Storey in 2002 in order to improve upon a limitation of the FDR, namely that the FDR is not defined when there are no positive results.  Definition  Let there be a null hypothesis H_0 and an alternative hypothesis H_1. Perform m hypothesis tests; let the test statistics be i.i.d. random variables T_1, \\\\ldots, T_m such that T_i \\\\mid H_i \\\\sim (1 - H_i) \\\\cdot F_0 + H_i \\\\cdot F_1. That is, if H_0 is true for test i (H_i = 0), then T_i follows the null distribution F_0; while if H_1 is true (H_i = 1), then T_i follows the alternative distribution F_1. Let H_i \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Bernoulli}(\\\\pi_1), that is, for each test, H_1 is true with probability \\\\pi_1 and H_0 is true with probability \\\\pi_0 = 1 - \\\\pi_1. Denote the critical region (the values of T_i for which H_0 is rejected) at significance level \\\\alpha by \\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha. Let an experiment yield a value t for the test statistic. The q-value of t is formally defined as : \\\\inf_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha : t \\\\in \\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}} \\\\operatorname{pFDR}(\\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha) That is, the q-value is the infimum of the pFDR if H_0is rejected for test statistics with values \\\\ge t. Equivalently, the q-value equals : \\\\inf_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha : t \\\\in \\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}}\\\\Pr(H = 0 \\\\mid T \\\\in \\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha) which is the infimum of the probability that H_0 is true given that H_0 is rejected (the false discovery rate).  Relationship to the p-value  The p-value is defined as : \\\\inf_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha : t \\\\in \\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}} \\\\Pr(T \\\\in \\\\Gamma_\\\\alpha \\\\mid H = 0) the infimum of the probability that H_0 is rejected given that H_0 is true (the false positive rate). Comparing the definitions of the p- and q-values, it can be seen that the q-value is the minimum posterior probability that H_0 is true.  Interpretation  The q-value can be interpreted as the false discovery rate (FDR): the proportion of false positives among all positive results. Given a set of test statistics and their associated q-values, rejecting the null hypothesis for all tests whose q-value is less than or equal to some threshold \\\\alpha ensures that the expected value of the false discovery rate is \\\\alpha.  Applications   Biology   Gene expression  Genome-wide analyses of differential gene expression involve simultaneously testing the expression of thousands of genes. Controlling the FWER (usually to 0.05) avoids excessive false positives (i.e. detecting differential expression in a gene that is not differentially expressed) but imposes a strict threshold for the p-value that results in many false negatives (many differentially expressed genes are overlooked). However, controlling the pFDR by selecting genes with significant q-values lowers the number of false negatives (increases the statistical power) while ensuring that the expected value of the proportion of false positives among all positive results is low (e.g. 5%). For example, suppose that among 10,000 genes tested, 1,000 are actually differentially expressed and 9,000 are not: * If we consider every gene with a p-value of less than 0.05 to be differentially expressed, we expect that 450 (5%) of the 9,000 genes that are not differentially expressed will appear to be differentially expressed (450 false positives). * If we control the FWER to 0.05, there is only a 5% probability of obtaining at least one false positive. However, this very strict criterion will reduce the power such that few of the 1,000 genes that are actually differentially expressed will appear to be differentially expressed (many false negatives). * If we control the pFDR to 0.05 by considering all genes with a q-value of less than 0.05 to be differentially expressed, then we expect 5% of the positive results to be false positives (e.g. 900 true positives, 45 false positives, 100 false negatives, 8,955 true negatives). This strategy enables one to obtain relatively low numbers of both false positives and false negatives.  Implementations  Note: the following is an incomplete list.

He remained affiliated in emeritus status with All Souls until his death in September 2017.

Ministerial career  Early in his career, Wolf served as the minister for Unitarian churches in Racine, Wisconsin and Meadville, Pennsylvania. His Meadville church was the Independent Congregational Church ‚Äì Unitarian (now the UU Church of Meadville) from 1954 until 1960. He also served in several positions of the Unitarian Universalist (UU) denomination. In 1960, he was called to serve as Senior Minister of All Souls church in Tulsa. While he served in the latter position, he became a leader of the civil rights movement in Tulsa, and his congregation grew from about 1,000 members in 1960 to about 2,800 by 1968, becoming the largest single UU church in the United States. He also helped stimulate the formation of two more churches in the city: Hope UU Church (in 1969) and Church of the Restoration (in 1988). News on 6. \\"The Rev. Dr. John Burton Wolf Tulsa Unitarian Universalist Minister, Dies at 92.\\" September 20, 2017. Accessed March 5, 2019. Wolf's own church has had to contend with its own tarnished past in race relations. In 1921, the same year as the infamous Tulsa Race Riot, All Souls church was co-founded by Richard Lloyd Jones, editor and publisher of the afternoon newspaper, the Tulsa Tribune. An inflammatory editorial allegedly appeared in the paper reporting an attempted assault of a young white woman by a young black man in the elevator of a downtown building on May 31, 1921. The Tribune article was said to have called for lynching of the man, who had been arrested by the Tulsa County sheriff. When the sheriff refused to turn the prisoner over to an armed mob that night, the frustrated mob members took out their rage on the main residential district of blacks living in Tulsa, burning, looting and killing indiscriminately. White civil and political leaders did nearly nothing to stop the riot until the district was essentially destroyed. Later, the alleged female victim changed her account, the alleged attacker was freed and released for lack of evidence, no one was tried for participating, newspapers of the day disappeared from newsstands (and even libraries) and a veritable \\"cone of silence\\" descended over the event for nearly four decades.McArdle, Elaine & Kenny Wiley. \\"Humiliation and hostility: A riot lives on.\\" UU World. Spring 2017. Accessed March 6, 2019. Wolf recalled later that he was cautioned by a member of his church that he should never talk about the riot from his pulpit when he began to expound on race relations. John Wolf was not a person to back down from such a controversy. He knew that continued silence would never heal the city, which had experienced significant damage ‚Äì even when many of the physical scars had been erased. He demanded action through sermons and actions. By the late 1960s, Wolf had become a spokesman of the city in the eyes of the public and many of his colleagues in the clergy. In 1968, the Tulsa Public School system was floundering on many issues, including integration, and top-heavy management (too many administrators overseeing too few actual teachers). Wolf became fed up and blamed the mess on the board president, Dr. Charles C. Mason. Finally Wolf preached a sermon titled, \\"The Last Days of Dr. Mason.\\" The Tulsa World published excerpts in its edition on the following morning. That night the school board held its regular public meeting, which had the largest number of people that had ever come to the school board meeting up to that time. Dr. Wolf was present and acted as the public spokesperson. Before the meeting ended, Dr. Mason publicly resigned his position.Lavanhar, Marlin. \\"Tulsa, a Divinely Inspired City.\\" In: Joyce, Davis D.

Dr. Wolf retired in 1995 as senior minister of All Souls, though he continued to live in Tulsa and remained affiliated with the church as minister emeritus until his death 22 years later.  Activities outside the church  In addition to his pastoral responsibilities, Dr. Wolf gave generously of his time and energies to groups outside the church. Some of these activities included: *Co-founded the Oklahoma branch of the American Civil Liberties Union; *Served on the National Board of Planned Parenthood; Family According to one obituary, John Wolf was survived by his wife of 65 years, Barbara N.

Early career  Born in Kochi and raised in Tokyo, Okanoue began to make photo collages while studying fashion and drawing at the Bunka Gakuin in Tokyo in the early 1950s. The young Okanoue, initially knew little of art history or the Surrealist movement. In 1952, a classmate from Keisen Girls' High School introduced Okanoue to poet and art critic Shuzo Takiguichi, a leading figure in the Japanese Surrealist movement, who would help introduce her to the wider art world, including the work of European Surrealists, such as German artist Max Ernst, who was an influence on her subsequent work. Over the next six years she would produce over 100 works. She exhibited in two exhibits including, solo shows at the Takemiya Gallery in Tokyo, In the second show at Takemiya, over fifty pieces of Okanoue's monochrome photographs were hung on display. Also exhibited at the \\"Abstract and Illusion\\" exhibition at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo between 1 December 1953 and 20 January 1954, which attracted total of 16,657 audiences appreciating 91 artworks by 91 artists.  Artistic style  In post-war Japan, shortages of goods meant that foreign goods filled the market and fashion and lifestyle magazines such as Vogue, Harpers Bazaar and Life magazine provided the raw materials for Okanoue's collages. Her black and white photo collages mix images of places, objects and people, often fashionable European women, in dynamic and often unsettling compositions whose subjects explored themes of war, femininity and the relations between the sexes.  Early end of professional career, obscurity and rediscovery  Like many women of her generation, marriage meant the end of her career. In 1958, at only 28, she stopped producing collage work when she married painter Fujino Kazutomo, thought she would continue to draw and paint non-professionally. After divorce, Okanoue took her children and ailing mother to K≈çchi and lived away from art activities. Okanoue's early collage work faded into obscurity for 40 years until rediscovered in the 1990s by the curator Ryuichi Kaneko of the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum. In 1996 Meguro Museum of Art included Okanoue's work in the Light Up exhibition and a solo exhibit entitled \\"Toshiko Okanoue's Photo Collages: Droplets of Dreams\\" was presented in Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. South Gallery. A first monograph of her work was published in 2002, entitled \\"Drop of Dreams: Toshiko Okanoue: Works 1950-1956.\\" In 2019, the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum presented a one-artist show of works of Okanoue entitled, \\"TOSHIKO OKANOUE, Photo Collage : The Miracle of Silence\\" as well as an exhibit catalogue of the same name.

It is Book One of The Antasy Series published by Harper Collins Voyager on December 13, 2016. Setting The novel is set on the planet Earth in a distant future following a massive astroid impact that has reduced land mass and extinguished all reptilian, avian and mammalian life. The one exception to mammalian extinction is humans which have adapted by growing smaller and smaller over the eons until they are no taller than a few millimeters. The other survivors are insects and other arthropods which have increased in size in an oxygen rich world. Humankind's survival relies not in battling insects but by intertwining with them to live as their parasites or symbionts. Different tribes and races of humans have yoked different insects to their service, mostly ants, which results in a constant state of warfare due to territorial expansion. Story The main characters are Anand the Roach Boy and his cousin, Pleckoo the Noseless, who are outcastes in the United Queendoms of the Great and Holy Slope, a highly stratified nation that exploits the leaf cutter ants that farm and eat a nourishing fungus. Among the outcastes, Anand is further degraded because his mother is a Britasyte, a member of a traveling roach people. Both Anand and Pleckoo work in the midden or the dung/trash heap of Mound Cajoria which is one of a hundred different human-occupied ant mounds within the Slopeish nation. When Cajoria becomes overpopulated, the priests of the mound conduct a Fission rite in which a third of the population of both ants and humans are selected by lottery to establish a new colony in the unknown north of Dranveria. Both Anand and Pleckoo are selected as pioneers of the new colony but Pleckoo defects to Hulkren, a rising nation in the neglected Dustlands whose warriors have parasitized the powerful and nocturnal ghost ants. Anand continues north to encounter an unknown society which has domesticated the red hunter ant. History of the Novel Carlton was working as a script doctor, ghost writer and screenwriter in Hollywood when he determined to write his \\"passion project\\" following the collapse of another film project. The novel had gestated since the mid 90s when he observed two different kinds of ants battling over a fallen peanut under a chaise lounge in Cozumel, Mexico. The story came to him at the Burning Man Festival of 2002 after an overdose of LSD. That night, Carlton wandered the different camps of the festival before he hiked deep into the desert, and then sat and stared into a blackened sky \\"where the plot unraveled like a streaming Technicolor prophecy.\\" The novel took three years to write. Carlton delivered the first draft of the novel, originally titled The Ghost Ants of Hulkren to the writing/producing team of Michael Colleary and Mike Werb who had hired Carlton to write the novelization of their screen project Face/Off. Werb and Colleary immediately optioned the novel and teamed with film producer Lawrence Bender to develop a screen project. Bender called the novel \\"one of the most engrossing, original and powerful novels I have read in years.\\" The novel had the interest of animator Conrad Vernon and director Michael Bay as a live action project for Sony Pictures, but a deal was never completed and all screen rights have reverted to Carlton. At the urging of his agent, Carlton self-published the novel through Create Space in 2011. The book's success as an indy novel began when it was selected as the group read of Apocalypse Whenever, the largest reading group at Goodreads. The novel was acquired by Festa Verlag for the Deltus imprint and translated into German as Die Geisterameisen von Hulkren. In 2015, the novel was acquired by Harper Collins for the Voyager imprint as Book 1 of The Antasy Series and published in December 2016. Book Two of the Antasy series, The Prophet of the Termite God will be released in April 2019 with a third sequel scheduled for 2021. Critical Reception Prophets of the Ghost Ants was named a Best of 2011 by Kirkus Reviews. Writing for Kirkus, reviewer Perry Crowe called it \\"intensely memorable ‚Ä¶ a gripping read ‚Ä¶ a fascinating, enjoyable sci-fi yarn.\\" Writing for Galaxy's Edge Magazine, author/critic Paul Cook wrote, \\"I had my proverbial socks knocked off ... extraordinary scope of imagination ... it's a great novel ... a classic ... a tour-de-force of the imagination ... a perfect example of very skillful storytelling, something the field could use more of. The novel never flags, every word counts ... It's got all the sense of wonder that's missing in science fiction today. I simply could not put this book down.\\" In his review for Best E-Books, Ken Korczak wrote \\"Readers who dare enter the realm of Prophets of the Ghost Ants should be prepared to be carried off, as if by a giant swarm of locusts, to a world of epic fantasy that rivals Lord of the Rings and is on par with the likes of Dune or Watership Down.\\" Illustrated Version Illustration by Mozchops for the defunct version of the Illustrated Prophets of the Ghost Ants. An illustrated version of Part One of the novel by Carlton and illustrator Mozchops was briefly published as an e-book and dissolved after the novel was acquired by Harper Collins. Carlton has stated he would \\"love to work with Mozchops again,\\" an illustrator whose work Carlton has called \\"the Sistine Chapel of insect art.\\" Category:2016 science fiction novels ","title":"Prophets of the Ghost Ants"},{"id":"60141802","title":"1942 Coppa Italia Final"},{"id":"60141803","text":"Paulina Peled (born 20 April 1950) is an Israeli former professional tennis player.

Analytical Chemistry, volume 19, issue 12, pages 971‚Äì975. Description Hand centrifuge for the Babcock test, with three Babcock bottles inserted in their holders. The Babcock test consists in adding to a standard sample of the milk certain chemicals that cause the fat to separate into a liquid layer, floating at the top of a water-based layer. More water is then added to the mixture, until the fat layer is completely inside the neck, where its volume can be read out from the scale. The Babcock bottle for milk testing was standardized with great detail in 1917 by the American Dairy Science Association (ADSA). The total height should be 150-165 mm, and the neck should be at least 63.5 mm long. The body should have a capacity of at least 45 mL. The graduated scale on the neck should have marks at every 0.02 mL of internal volume, corresponding to 0.1 percent fat in a standard sample of 17.6 mL (18 grams) of milk, from 0 to 8 percent. The top must be flared to at least 10 mm diameter. The bottle usually has a bullet-shaped body for easy cleaning. Its width and shape were chosen to match the manual centrifuges originally used in the Babcock test. The body was 37 mm wide just below the rounded top, and might be cylindrical or slightly tapered inwards going down. The minimum capacity of 45 mL is intended to contain the standard sample of milk, and at least an equal amount of other reagents. Some bottles had a ground glass stopper. Variations Babcock bottles for measuring the fat contents in cream have wider necks to allow for readings of 50% or more (rather than up to 8%).(2019): \\"Kimble Babcok bottle for cream test, sealed\\". Catalog entry, item M3669, Capitol Scientific. Accessed on 2019-03-04. Louis Nafis patented in 1921 a modified Babcock bottle, claimed to be less susceptible to accidental breakage. Instead of the integral long graduated neck, it had a short neck to which a rubber ring was fitted. After processing and centrifuging the milk in the bottom part, two other glass parts would be added. A wider glass tube would be hermetically fitted on the outer edge of that ring, and inside it would be placed a narrow graduated tube, with a flared opening at bottom, resting on the rubber ring without a seal. Warm water would be poured down between the two tubes, seep under the inner tube, and lift the fat into the latter.Louis F. Nafis (1921): \\"Milk-testing vessel\\". US patent US1499188A. However, there seems to be no evidence that this invention has ever been marketed or used. A variant of the Babcock bottle has a glass tube parallel to the neck, that crosses the wall of the body and ends just above its bottom. It allows the addition of water without disturbing the layer of fat as it rises into the graduated neck. In this variant, the flaring is on the auxiliary tube instead of on the neck.

Another variant of this flask is the Paley-Babcock or Paley bottle, which is intended for viscous liquids or solids (like cheese or meat) that would be difficult to introduce through the narrow neck.

She studied under William Merritt Chase and Rapha√´l Collin. Two of her pieces are on permanent display at the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia.  Early life  alt= Susan Watkins was born on June 5, 1857 in Lake County, California to the prominent and wealthy San Francisco family of Susan Ella Owens and James Thomas Watkins. Her father was a California newspaper editor. Her grandfather, Commodore James T. Watkins, was a trans-Pacific ship captain. He was regarded as a hero for saving the passengers and crew of a ship caught in a storm en route from San Francisco to New York. John Greenleaf Whittier wrote a poem about this heroic act titled \\"The Three Bells\\". She had two siblings- a brother, James and a sister, Eleanor Watkins Reeves (the subject of her later work Lady in Yellow, and wife of Joseph Mason Reeves). Watkins attended E. L. Murison School in California and later, Gibbons School in New York City. At age 15 she moved to New York City, where her father began work as an editor for The New York Sun. While in New York from 1890 - 1896 she studied at the Art Students League of New York and was taught by William Merritt Chase. Chase once referred to her as \\"the best woman painter living\\". After Watkins's father died in 1896, she and her mother moved to Paris and her mother encouraged her to pursue her interest in painting. She was likely drawn to France to continue her studies because the French government at the time supported artists in ways that the United States did not. In Paris, Watkins studied under Rapha√´l Collin at the Acad√©mie Julian for ten years, and was recognized as one of his finest students. Collin instructed his students on drawing, anatomy, and studies of the nude model with the ultimate goal of understanding and accurately depicting the human form. The Chrysler Museum of Art has numerous sketches - referred to as acad√©mies - drawn by Watkins during her time at the Acad√©mie, which demonstrate her comprehension of Collin's teachings.

Her earlier works lean towards realism - with dark tones and clear details, while her later works are more colorful and Impressionist in style. Her early, dark-toned paintings are evocative of 17th century Dutch paintings. She was likely influenced by differing art styles while working in the United States and later, in Europe. In 1906, Watkins visited Italy with suitor, Goldsborough Serpell with destinations including Capri, an island near Naples. She painted a series of colorful Impressionist paintings featuring young local boys picking grapes on the island. Possibly her largest painting is \\"Marguerite\\" at approximately 79 x 37 inches (201 x 94 cm), painted in 1906. It is speculated that Marguerite was a maid that worked for Watkins while she lived in France. Along with numerous oil paintings, Watkins also created academic drawings and sketches. A Young Girl was the final portrait painted by Watkins - a portrait of Walter S. Martin's daughter.  Personal life  Susan Watkins, ca. 1914 by William Merritt Chase. Chase painted this large portrait after Watkins's death as a memorial to his former student and friend alt= Watkins became ill while traveling in Europe, and returned to the United States in 1910. She married long-time suitor, Goldsborough Serpell II on January 16, 1912 in Norfolk, Virginia. Because Watkins was financially independent and encouraged by her mother not to marry, she was disinterested in marriage for many years. Despite her independent nature, she did not seem to be a supporter of women's suffrage. She is quoted saying \\"a woman who is really occupied with the real things of life is so busy accomplishing them that she hasn't any thought of such things\\". Her husband, Goldsborough Serpell II was born in Connellsville, Pennsylvania. His father, Goldsborough McDowell Serpell I worked as a civil engineer for the Louisville & Nashville Railroad and the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. Goldsborough Serpell I later founded the Tunis-Serpell Lumber Company and built the Norfolk & North Carolina Railroad to transport lumber. He served in Company B of the First Maryland Cavalry in the Civil War. Goldsborough II was a Norfolk banker, member of the Norfolk Executive Committee Southern Commercial Congress, board chairman of Seaboard Citizens National Bank, and president of the United Owners Realty Corporation in Norfolk. He graduated in 1895 from the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. He is mentioned as an usher in a 1902 volume of Town & Country (magazine). While married, the couple lived on Duke Street in Norfolk, Virginia. A 1910 census shows that her husband lived at 108 Duke Street, Norfolk, Virginia. Serpell House in Norfolk, Virginia at the corner of Hampton Boulevard and Westover Avenue. It was demolished after severe looting and replaced with a medical facility in the 1960s. Susan Watkins Serpell died on June 18, 1913 in Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. She was 38 years old. Her body was transported back to Norfolk, Virginia to be buried. It is not clear what illness afflicted Watkins, but sources speculate it was likely cancer. After her death, her husband lived at the Serpell family home at 902 Westover Avenue. The Serpell family home - called the Serpell House - was a three-story, 40 room residence built in 1907 on the corner of Hampton Boulevard and Westover Avenue. It was the first private residence in Norfolk to have an elevator. Serpell's father, Goldsborough McDowell Serpell I, hired butler William Hendricks, who served the household for over 70 years. Hendricks polished the family silver, served meals, maintained the lavish flower garden, decorated the house for the holidays, and chauffeured the family until his death. Her husband died in 1946 at age 70, and left 62 of her paintings to the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences - what is now the Chrysler Museum of Art. Watkins pieces that are not displayed or stored at the Chrysler Museum are in private collections. It is hypothesized that she would have become famous similar to the likes of Mary Cassatt, Cecilia Beaux, and Georgia O'Keeffe if not for her untimely death at the age of 38. She is seen as a pioneer in the fine art field in the 19th and 20th centuries, when women were not typically welcomed or awarded high praise in the community. She was Episcopalian. Watkins and Serpell are buried next to each other in Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk, plot EXT 16-L8.

It has narrow leaves of up to wide, with single main vein and an entire margin. Flower heads only occur after a fire has destroyed the standing vegetation, mostly in November or between February and June. The flower heads sit individually or with a few on the tip of a purplish stalk, with a few narrow bracts, and consist of a row of pinkish ray florets around many yellow disc florets. It can be found in the southwest of the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Taxonomy  As far as known, this species of fire daisy was first collected by William John Burchell, in 1832, east of Cape Town, and described in 1836 by the Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who named it Mairia burchellii. Otto Kuntze reassiged it, making the combination Zyrphelis burchellii in 1891. In 1990, Ulricke Zinnecker-Wiegand in her dissertation made a clear distinction between the genera Mairia and Zyrphelis, and moved it back burchellii. Later, comparison of homologous DNA showed that Mairia and Zyrphelis are not closely related.  Description  flower headsMairia burchellii is a perennial herbaceous plant of up to high. It has a robust rhizome, that sprouts up to thirty five succulent, dark brown or sepia- coloured roots of up to long and thick. Often, the charred remains of the bases of old leaves are present. The bright lime green to reddish brown leaves have a leathery consistency and are all set in a rosette. Their number varies strongly over time from none or few to up to thirty during flowering. The firm, upright leaf blades are line-shaped, narrowly ellipse-shaped or very narrowly inverted egg-shaped, long and wide, with a pointy tip and at the base gradually narrowing to a very long leaf stalk. Both surfaces of the leaf blade are hairless, except for the inner side of the leaf stalk that is set with silvery woolly hairs. The leaves have entire, flat margins or these are rarely rolled downwards, with single main vein and sometimes with two indistinct marginal veins. From each plant, between one and seven inflorescence stalks emerge, that each carry between one and eight flower heads each on a relatively long flower head stalk, together long. The inflorescence stalks are mostly branched near the base, and both the common and individual stalks are dark red-brown to dark purplish, strongly ribbed, with some silvery woolly hairs, mostly with glandular hairs, and carrying many, dark purple, very narrowly ovate bracts. The lower bracts are up to 2 cm (1 in) long, but decrease in size higher up, almost clutch the stem, and are sensely set with sivery woolly hairs in the axils and glandular hairy elsewhere.  Flower heads  The involucre is broadly bell-shaped or more like a spinning top, high and in diameter. It consists thirty to thirty four purplish bracts, with a pointy or tapering tip, that are arranged in three or four overlapping whorls, the surfaces with glands and further variably woolly or hairless, fringed by a row of long hairs. The outermost bracts are narrowly oval, long and 1‚Äì1 mm (0.04‚Äì0.06 in) wide. The innermost bracts are narrowly inverted egg-shaped to narrowly ellipse-shaped, long and 1‚Äì2 mm (0.06‚Äì0.08 in) wide, with a papery margin and a fringe of long hairs. The involucre envelops the base of fourteen to sixteen bright violet, pink, mauve or white ray florets of about long, with a tube that sometimes carries some glandular hairs, and a mostly line-shaped strap, with four to six veins and ending in three teeth. The style of the ray florets is long and the two branches in which it splits near the tip are often purplish, elliptic in shape, often uneven or with several 1‚Äì2 mm long with a blunt tip. The ray florets contain staminodes that do not produce pollen. The ray florets encircle many yellow disc florets with a corolla of long, not or scarcely longer than pappus, the tube nearer the base hairless or with some scattered glandular hairs, the five lobes at the top mostly recurved and loosely hairy. The disc florets contain both ovaries topped by a forked style and five fertile anthers that form a tube around the style shaft. These anthers are long, and have narrowly triangular appendages at their tip. The style of the tube florets is 5‚Äì6 mm (0.22 in) long and extend beyond the mouth of the floret. The style branches are dark red or purplish in colour, elliptic in shape, long, sometimes unevenly malformed or there are even three branches. The appendages at the tip of each style branche are deltoid in shape, about wide and long. The corollas of both ray and disc florets are surrounded by a row of hairs called pappus. The eventually dark brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are cylindrical to spindle-shaped, about 7 mm long and wide, with four to seven prominent, narrow, cream-coloured ribs. The cypselae are covered with many shiny yellowish glands. These are also covered in long, silvery silky or dull yellow or brownish twin hairs of about long, which have distinctly unequally long, pointy branches. The pappus is arranged in two whorls. The outer whorl consists of a few delicate, smallish, dirty white or straw-coloured, free, barbed bristles of up to long. The colour of the inner pappus is the same, although sometimes with a pale purple wash. It consists of barbed, feathery bristles of 6‚Äì8 mm (frac|1|4}} in) long, that form a ring at the very base.  Differences with other Mairia species  M. burchellii is recognised by the rigid, erect, often dark red or brownish, linear or narrowly elliptic or very narrowly obovate leaves. During flowering time, (January) February to May (June), no or at most two leaves are present, as the leaves from the previous growing season are burnt down and only the spiky petiole-like bases are persistent. In M. burchellii, as in M. coriacea, flowering is induced by fire. Plants collected before or long after flowering, usually have many leaves (up to 30), leaves are only present from June onwards. Plants of M. burchellii without leaves resemble M. coriacea plants without leaves and it is almost impossible to separate the two taxa in this condition. M. burchellii can be distinguished from M. coriacea by the linear or narrowly elliptic or very narrowly obovate leaves with a single main vein and entire margins; in M. coriacea, the leaves are mostly obovate, sometimes elliptic to broadly elliptic with 3 to 5 main veins and entire or apically few, broad dentate margins. Although M. coriacea mostly has solitary or 2-headed synflorescences while M. burchellii usually has corymbosely arranged capitula, solitary capitula are also sometimes found in M. burchellii.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Mairia burchellii can be found in the wild only in the southwest of the Western Cape province of South Africa, from Ceres and the Piketberg in the north to the southern tip of the Cape Peninsula in the west, through the Hottentots Holland Mountains, east to Bredasdorp on the Angulhas plains. It grows in fynbos vegetation, on stony and sandy plateaus and mountain slopes.  Conservation  The continued survival of Mairia burchellii is considered to be of least concern, because it has a stable population that is widespread in mountainous areas and where it is not threatened.

He is an assistant coach of the Australian women's national basketball team (the Opals). Biography Paul Goriss moved to Townsville when he was ten years old, and began playing basketball there. When he was seventeen he was asked to coach his younger brother Ben's under-14 side. He wound up coaching his brother' teams for several years, right up to the under-23s. He won two state titles with the Townsville under-18s. In 2000, he moved to Canberra to become a men's basketball scholarship Coach at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). He returned to Townsville at the end of the year to coach the Townsville Heat, but came back to the AIS in 2003 as assistant coach of the men‚Äôs basketball program. Goriss was an assistant coach of the Australian men's national under-19 basketball team (the Emus) that competed at the 2011 and 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Championships, and of South East Queensland Stars in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) during the latter part of the 2015/16 season. He was head coach of the Australian women's national under-19 basketball team (the Gems) at the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Championship for Women in Russia, where they won bronze. In March 2016, Goriss was appointed head coach of the University of Canberra Capitals in succession to Carrie Graf. The team required some rebuilding in the wake of the retirement of Graf and veteran players Jess Bibby and Lauren Jackson. Goriss assembled a team that looked impressive and championship material on paper, but solid performances from the Capitals' captain Natalie Hurst, Abbey Wehrung and Kate Gaze, the Capitals' court performance oscillated between disappointing and dismal. After an opening round win that saw them briefly on top of the WNBL ladder, the Capitals went on a thirteen-game losing streak, missing the finals for the seventh year in a row, and finishing sixth. On 2 May 2017, Goriss was appointed an assistant coach of the Australian women's national basketball team (the Opals), working under the Opals' head coach Sandy Brondello, and alongside the Sydney University Flames' coach Cheryl Chambers, who was also named as an assistant coach. In the Opals' run up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, their immediate challenge was the 2017 FIBA Women's Asia Cup in Bangalore, India, in July 2017, where Australia needed a fourth-place finish in order to qualify for the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup; they finished second, losing to Japan in the final. At the 2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup in Tenerife, Spain, the Opals won silver, this time losing out to the United States in the final on 30 September 2018. An intense recruiting effort saw the Capitals sign Kelly Wilson, Kelsey Griffin, Kristy Wallace, Opals Marianna Tolo and Leilani Mitchell, and Canadian player Kia Nurse. Goriss retained Carly Wilson as an assistant coach, and she was joined on the coaching bench by Phil Brown and Bec Goddard. The team looked impressive on paper, but were carrying a host of ailments, and Goriss was the first to remind people that basketball games are played on hardwood and not paper. Despite this, the Capitals won six of the first eight games without Tolo, and gradually became stronger as Tolo, Griffin and Mitchell recovered. Goriss was intensely protective of his players, and was fined $2,500 for comments he made that were critical of the referees and officials after rough conduct by Perth Lynx player left Kelsey Griffin bleeding profusely from a head wound. The 2018/19 WNBL season ended with the Capitals winning nine games in a row, and finishing on top of the ladder. This became eleven after the Capitals notched up back-to-back semifinal wins against the Perth Lynx. Some 4,120 fans packed Canberra's AIS Arena to watch the Capitals defeat the Adelaide Lightning in the first game of the best-of-three Grand Final series, and then 4,817 for the third game after a controversial one-point loss to Adelaide to watch the Capitals post a 20-point win and claim an eighth premiership. On 4 March 2019, Goriss's contract with the Capitals was extended for another two years. His retention was considered crucial to the Capitals re-signing players like Tolo, Griffin and Keely Froling. His popularity with the players is partly explained by his philosophy of putting the goals of the athletes first. \\"Whether you get recognised or not\\", he told an interview, \\"just do the right thing by the players, work on being a better coach and the players achieving their goals, not 'what next on my bucket list?'\\" Notes Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Australian men's basketball coaches Category:Canberra Capitals ","title":"Paul Goriss"},{"id":"60142079","text":"Ehrenhalt is a surname.

It is located in a former convent (Convento da Gra√ßa) on the southern edge of the city centre. In addition to an extensive archaeological section dating back to late- Palaeolithic times, the museum contains works of art from local churches as well as an exhibition relating to the Lines of Torres Vedras, defensive lines constructed under the orders of the British Duke of Wellington to defend against French invasion during the Peninsular war. History The Municipal Museum of Torres Vedras was founded in 1929. It was initially installed in rooms attached to the church of St. Peter (S. Pedro), identifying itself as a ‚ÄúMuseum of History, Archaeology and Prehistory‚Äù. In 1944 the museum and the city library were transferred to the headquarters of the Brotherhood of Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia. Leonel Trindade (1903-92), a leading archaeologist in the region and former deputy director, became the director in 1969. The library moved out in 1970, allowing the museum‚Äôs exhibition space to be significantly expanded and Trindade curated eight rooms covering: archaeology; the Napoleonic Wars; the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥ridia; early Portuguese culture; ceramic tiles; contemporary painting; the municipality of Torres Vedras; and epigraphy. In 1989, it was decided to transfer the exhibitions to the Gra√ßa Convent, and the permanent exhibition was inaugurated in 1992, giving particular attention to the archaeological findings from the Castro of Zambujal, situated a few kilometres from Torres Vedras. In 2007, the municipality named the museum after Leonel Trindade. Archaeological display at the Leonel Trindade museum Collections The collections cover palaeontology, archaeology, architecture and sculpture (16th and 17th centuries), and religious paintings from the 15th to 17th centuries, as well a section dedicated to the Peninsular War and the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras (1809-10), so-called because the town was the first where the construction of the forts was started. Much of the archaeological collection comes from items collected by Trindade, who, among other places, discovered the Chalcolithic, fortified settlement of Zambujal (3rd millennium BC). Over the years, the museum has been increasing its collection, with special emphasis on archaeology, drawing in particular on the Neolithic sites in the Torres Vedras area, such as the Castro of Zambujal and the Tholos do Barro. It has one of the largest Portuguese collections of medieval burial headstones. The late Palaeolithic period is represented by stone tools that were found mainly in the sand dunes at Santa Cruz and Cambelas in the Torres Vedras municipality. A major Mesolithic site in Portugal is also located in the municipality, in the dunes at Ponta da Vigia. Numerous Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites have provided items for the museum‚Äôs collection, particularly domed tombs. Vessels of the Bell Beaker culture from around 2800 BC are also well represented. Noteworthy are items from the Mesolithic necropolis of Cabe√ßo da Arruda, located south of Santar√©m in Portugal, as well as various Phoenician items from the Iron Age from around 700 BC, giving rise to the belief that an Iron Age settlement existed in Torres Vedras that had trade contacts with the Phoenicians. In the Roman section, in addition to remains of ceramics, mosaics, jewellery and metal objects from Roman villas in the area, there are also a number of inscribed stones. From the early Middle Ages comes the museum‚Äôs collection of tombstones. \\"New Land\\" pistol on display at Leonel Trindade Museum In 1809 and 1810 a total of 152 forts, redoubts and other defences were developed as part of three defensive lines between the Atlantic Ocean and the River Tagus that were designed by the Duke of Wellington to protect the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, from possible invasion by French troops during the Peninsular War. These came to be known as the Lines of Torres Vedras. In Torres Vedras, itself, the castle was adapted for the purpose and several new forts constructed, including the Fort of S√£o Vicente and the Fort of Olheiros. The museum‚Äôs exhibition describes the way in which the Lines were planned and has items from the time including guns and military costumes.

Sumi-e translates to ‚Äúink wash painting,‚Äù which is a type of East Asian brush painting technique that uses black ink. The oldest example of sumizuri-e printing was discovered in the One Million Pagodas. Sumizuri-e Print by Nishikawa Sukenobu These Pagodas were religious works commissioned by the Empress Sh≈çtoku to be distributed to Japan's ten major temples. The miniature wooden pagodas were made to honor the Buddhist deities and thank them for holding back the Emi Rebellion of 764. Inside of these relics, each pagoda contains a darani, or Buddhist invocation, that was printed on small scrolls. Historians believe this is the oldest example of sumizuri-e printmaking, but due to their religious importance, it is antagonistic to remove and study all of the sutra scrolls. X-ray photos are used to observe these pagodas from a distance and allow researchers to recreate the sutras. The technology is employed to detect the age and wear of the scrolls. Printed scroll from the One Million Pagodas As the printmaking movement developed, artists began painting the sumizuri-e prints by hand to color in the images.

This explains why later he added the words van Hoochstraten (from Hoogstraten) to his family name Hillen. His parents owned some properties in his hometown.Uitgaven der Maatschappij der Antwerpsche bibliophilen, Volumes 12-13, Vereeniging der Antwerpsche bibliophilen, J.-E.

In 1508 Hillen was registered as a citizen of Antwerp. He moved the location of his printing press a number of times but he remained within the well-known 'print district' of Antwerp. In 1518 he bought a house on the Cammerstraat which bore the name \\"In den Rape\\" (In the Turnip). Here he ran his printing business until 1546. After the death of his son Jan who also worked in his workshop, he handed over his printing business in 1546 to his son-in-law Joannes (Jan) Steels who was married to his daughter Margareta.

This included imperial ordinances, anthologies of local laws and customs, almanacs, textbooks, etc. He also printed many of the humanistic writings by local writers such as Erasmus, Adrianus Barlandus and Latomus. He further produced books for the English market. The art of printing developed rather late in England. As a result, foreign book printers, including those from Antwerp, played an important role in supplying the English market. Hillen published for the English market Johann Eck's anti-Lutheran publication Enchi ridion locorum communium aduersus Lutheranos (printed for the English printer Henry Pepwell) and an edition of the Sarum Hymns and Sequences.E.

Michiel Hillen van Hoochstraten did not base his version on the Gr√ºninger edition but on an earlier German text that is no longer extant. In the past, the Hillen edition was dated to 1512 or 1519, but recent scholarship places it in the period between 1525 and 1546.Hendrik D. L. Vervliet, The earliest Dutch edition of Till Eulenspiegel A problem of dating in: Quaerendo, 1 Jan 1973, Volume 3: Issue 1 The Hillen edition is still considered to be the earliest Dutch language publication of the story.Anonym, Ulenspieghel, Michiel van Hoochstraten, Antwerpen, Facsimile at the Royal Library of Denmark The Hillen edition is illustrated by woodcuts which are not executed in a polished style but are very direct and picturesque. The frontispiece shows Eulenspiegel's father riding a mule while his son is perched on its buttocks and is anxiously holding on to his father's sides. On the mule's head stands an upright hand mirror with an owl sitting on it. This is a reference to the hero Eulenspiegel's name, which translates literally to Owl mirror. The only extant copy of Hillen's Eulenspiegel is in the Royal Library of Denmark in Copenhagen. This copy has some pages missing.Tyl Uilenspiegel. Antwerp, Michiel van Hoochstraten, z.j. (c.1512), M. Nijhoff, The Hague, 1898 Frontispiece of Dutch language version of the New Testament, 1530 Michiel Hillen van Hoochstraten printed in 1527 a Dutch translation of the New Testament. It was an adapted version of the Erasmus translation that was published in 1524 by Cornelis Lettersnijder in Delft. Van Hoochstraten aligned his version of the New Testament more closely with that of the Latin Vulgate. In a reprint from 1530 he continued this trend and made further adjustments. He probably intended to establish an ecclesiastically approved text reflecting the prevalent view in the study of scripture in his day. He reprinted this version of the New Testament in 1531 while a year later he published a reprint of the text of his 1527 edition. None of these editions were placed on the Index of forbidden books, a list of publications deemed heretical, or contrary to morality by the Sacred Congregation of the Index (a former Dicastery of the Roman Curia). This meant that the Catholic Church did not probit Catholics to read them. Michiel Hillen also printed a number of 'heretical' works. Although he published a number of these works under his own name, to avoid problems with the censors he also published others without mentioning a printer, or using a pseudonym or a false address. Overall he remained a cautious businessman when compared to some of his fellow printers. While some titles from his print catalogue were placed on the Index of forbidden books, it appears he never ran foul of the authorities. It is possible that thanks to his large output, his works escaped the attention of the authorities. Many of Hillen's publications are illustrated with woodcuts. These were either original works cut by Dirck Vellert and Jan Swart van Groningen, taken from incunables, or copied after works by Hans Holbein the Younger and French engravers.

Founded in 1835, it is now named Helmholtz-Gymnasium after Hermann von Helmholtz, but from 1927 until 1945 it was known as the Philipp Lenard Schule after Philipp Lenard. As of 2018, it had 891 pupils. In addition to its academic curriculum, it is designated by the German Olympic Sports Confederation as an \\"Eliteschule des Sports\\" (Elite Sports School). History The school was founded on 23 November 1835 as a \\"B√ºrgersch√∂herehul\\" (Higher Civic School), a new type of school designed to meet the needs of the merchant class by providing a broad- based education. It was housed in a building that had been constructed by the Jesuits in 1705 on Kettengasse in the old part of Heidelberg. Its first headmaster was Daniel Louis (1798‚Äì1848), a doctor of theology. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, more courses and year-levels were added until it reached Oberrealschule and then Gymnasium status in 1927. Girls were admitted to the school from 1905. The school had no official name until 1937 when it was named Philipp Lenard Schule after the German physicist and Nobel Prize winner Philipp Lenard. The following year, under Nazi government education reforms, it was converted to an all-boys school. The school was closed during most of World War II. Many of its teachers and older pupils were serving in the army, and the school building itself was requisitioned by the German military. When the school reopened in September 1945, Philipp Lenard's name was removed. Lenard had been a prominent anti-Semite and an active proponent of Nazi ideology. The school's name was changed to Helmholtz- Gymnasium in honour of another German physicist, Hermann von Helmholtz, and it once again became co-educational. During the post-war years, the school experienced increasing problems of over-crowding resulting in it having to operate on split sites and provide classes in shifts. The City of Heidelberg earmarked funds for a new school building in 1960. Construction began in 1965, and the new building opened on Rohrbacher Stra√üe in 1969. As of 2018, 891 pupils were enrolled in the school. Curriculum The school teaches the standard Gymnasium curriculum with specialties in languages and sports. English, French, Spanish and Latin are taught as well as Turkish to students for whom it is their first language. Designated by the German Ministry of culture as a \\"Partnerschule f√ºr Europa\\" (Partner School for Europe), the school also provides bilingual English-German education in biology, geography, history and social studies for students who have been judged particularly gifted in languages. Since 2003 Helmholtz-Gymnasium has been designated by the German Olympic Sports Confederation as an (Elite Sports School). The Eliteschule des Sports program is a network of schools which receive extra funding to combine training in competitive sports with education and housing. The program is designed to enable talented young athletes to train at a high level without sacrificing their education. The school's competitive sports program focuses on basketball, volleyball, rugby, hockey, gymnastics, swimming and athletics. It has a boarding facility for talented student athletes who come from outside Heidelberg, usually 25 to 30 each year.

History  Elizabeth Olten, aged nine, lived four houses down from Bustamante. On October 21, 2009, Bustamante convinced her younger sister to bring Olten to the forest by their homes to play. Upon Olten's arrival, Bustamante strangled young Olten, slit her throat and stabbed her in the chest. Bustamante then buried Olten's body in a grave that she had dug 5 days before in the woods behind her house, and covered the grave with leaves.  Perpetrator  Alyssa Dailene Bustamante's grandparents took legal custody of her and her three younger siblings in 2002, since her mother Michelle had addiction issues and father Caesar was serving time in prison.

In 1766 he attended a class on copper engraving at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, but it was only on his appointment as court botanical artist that his work became well known. The large number of preliminary studies indicates that he made these on site in the gardens. Moving the plant specimens to the studio would probably have been too time- consuming. Schmutzer worked on paper of different quality and size with graphite pencil, watercolours and ink. The leaves are provided with notes such as the scientific name of the plants, location and date. In the studio he transferred the preparatory work to paper or parchment. When it seemed aesthetically necessary to him, he changed and varied individual representations. On the death of Matthias Schmutzer in 1824 the painter Johann Jebmayer continued work on the Florilegium from October 1824 to about 1847. For an annual salary of 500 guilders, he captured not only the exotic, but also the most beautiful domestic plants from the imperial gardens. The result was a total of 528 large-format watercolours, \\"Florilegium B\\", which are kept in the archives of the Austrian National Library. http://www.bildarchivaustria.at/Pages/Ausstellung/Kapitel.aspx?AusstellungID=19246060&KapitelID;=19246073 Johann Jebmayer was born in Vienna in 1770, the son of a coachman.

Today the order of family names in the Philippines follows the reverse order. (b. September 5, 1918, d. March 5, 1988), was a Filipino diplomat. In a career spanning four decades (1946-1985) he made important contributions to Philippine diplomacy and the Philippine foreign service. First, he served with distinction (as reflected in awards received from the Philippine Government and host countries) as Philippine Ambassador in the Americas, Asia and Europe. Second, he represented the Philippines in major international organizations, notably as Philippine Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York in the early 1980s (his last posting as a diplomat) and earlier as Permanent Representative to UNESCO while posted in Paris. Third, he implemented the opening of Philippine diplomatic relations with socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe. He was the first Filipino diplomat accredited as nonresident Ambassador to three of these countries, and subsequently became the first Philippine Ambassador to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Fourth, he had a lasting impact on the practice of Philippine diplomacy. One reason was his commitment to service, reflected in his steadfast response to extreme or difficult circumstances, such as the attack on his residence in Saigon during the 1968 Tet Offensive. After his death the media was filled with \\"eulogies celebrating his life and work, his principles and patriotism\\".De Borja (2014), p. 317. Another reason was his widely acknowledged expertise in the practice of diplomacy. For example, his book, A Guide to Protocol (published in 1949 and 1959) was the main reference for Filipino diplomats seeking to build the Philippine foreign service in the period after WWII. This book has continued to guide Philippine diplomatic practice decades after its publication.  Personal life  Luis Moreno Salcedo was born on September 5, 1918 in Sara Iloilo to Timoteo Moreno Brodeth and Trinidad Salcedo. He spent his childhood in Concepcion, Iloilo and moved to Manila at age 10. In 1940 he graduated with a Bachelors of Law (LLB) degree, magna cum laude at the Royal and Pontifical University of Santo Tomas, Manila. Shortly afterwards he served in the Philippine Army and then practiced law in a private law firm.  Early career as a diplomat  Upon passing the Philippine Foreign Service entrance examination in 1946 he joined the then Office of Foreign Relations, which subsequently became the Department of Foreign Affairs. He became part of a group of new recruits sent to the US State Department for training shortly after independence in 1946 to improve the capacity of the Philippines to apply diplomatic principles and practices. Many members of this group were subsequently appointed to key positions in the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs and their careers are the subject of a book, which describes Moreno Salcedo as the apotheosis of an outstanding graduate of this group.De Borja (2014), p. 316. In the case of Moreno Salcedo, upon his return to the Philippines he became Deputy Chief and then Chief of Protocol from 1948 to 1954. He then served in various positions outside the Philippines. He was Diplomatic Secretary of Legation and Consul of the Philippines, Mexico City, 1954‚Äì56, Diplomatic Secretary of Embassy and Consul of the Philippines, Washington DC 1956-57; Minister Counselor, Embassy of the Philippines to the Holy See, Rome, 1957‚Äì58; Counselor on Political and Cultural Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Manila, 1958‚Äì59; and Minister- Counselor, Embassy of the Philippines, Buenos Aires, 1960-62. An important accomplishment during this period was the publication of his book on diplomatic protocolMoreno Salcedo (1949 rev. 1959). which was the key resource for Philippine diplomats and was also used as a reference by some diplomats in other countries.De Borja (2014 ), p. 297. It is still in use to this day, for example as the guide for the presentation of credentials to the President of the Philippines.See for example, excerpts from Moreno Salcedo (1949 rev 1959) in Malacanang Palace, undated. Briefer: The Presentation of Credentials to the President by the Ambassadors to the Philippines.  Career as AmbassadorEntries in this section and the box are based on Foreign Service Institute (2014), Moreno Salcedo Luis (undated) and occasionally various Philippine Embassy websites. Moreno Salcedo served as the second Philippine Ambassador to Argentina from 1962 to 1964, consolidating Philippine representation in that country. He was named Philippine Ambassador to South Vietnam from 1965 to 1968. This was a difficult setting for diplomacy, due to the Vietnam war, and Moreno Salcedo and his wife narrowly survived an attack on the Philippine Ambassador‚Äôs residence in Saigon during the Tet Offensive of 1968.The attack on Moreno Salcedo's residence is described by Hermelinda Ycasiano Moreno Salcedo in De Borja (2014), p. 305 From 1968 to 1977 he served as Philippine Ambassador to France, and concurrently as Philippine Permanent Representative to UNESCO. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, while still posted in France, he also implemented the establishment of Philippine relations with Eastern European countries, having been named nonresident Philippine Ambassador to Romania and Yugoslavia in 1972 and to Hungary in 1975. In 1977 he became the first Philippine Ambassador to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Moscow. Moreno Salcedo‚Äôs last assignment as a Filipino diplomat was as Philippine Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York in 1982. He retired in 1985, after which he spent some time as Chairman of the Academic Council and Dean of the College of Foreign Service at Lyceum of the Philippines University.  Honors and awards  Luis Moreno Salcedo received a number of awards. They are (1) The Grand Cross of the Order of Sikatuna (Rank Datu, Philippines). This medal was conferred on February 26, 1987 under the administration of President Corazon Aquino. According to the Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines, the Order of Sikatuna is ‚Äúan order of diplomatic merit conferred upon individuals who have rendered meritorious services to the Republic of the Philippines‚Äù and ‚Äúone of the three senior honors of the Republic.‚Äù (2) Knight‚Äôs Cross of the Order of the Knights of Malta. (3) Placa de Gran Cruz de la Orden Civil de Alfonso X el Sabio (Spain). This award was given by the Spanish Government in 1975 when Moreno Salcedo was Philippine Ambassador to France and Philippine Representative to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). According to Wikipedia, the Gran Cruz is given only to Spanish or foreign persons who have made an extraordinary contribution to the development of education, science and culture, teaching or research, as long as the exceptional level of merit of this contribution is evident. Moreno Salcedo was cited specifically for his knowledge and studies in Spanish history, literature and culture as well as his efforts to promote more fruitful cooperation between the Philippines and Spain in UNESCO.See ‚ÄúSpanish gov‚Äôt decorates RP ambassador‚Äù, Bulletin Today, Feb. 18, 1976 and ‚ÄúSpanish Grand Cross‚Äù, Philippine Daily Express, February 17, 1976. (4) Gran Cruz de la Orden del Libertador San Martin. Awarded by the Republic of Argentina exclusively to foreign civilian or military officials who in the exercise of their functions, merit a high level of honor and recognition by the Nation (5) Grand Officer of the National Order of Vietnam. This was considered the highest honor that could be conferred upon an individual by the government of the Republic of (South) Vietnam, based on works, deeds, bravery, virtues or outstanding knowledge.

It was designed to provide safe cloud-flying experience and also raised the Hungarian height gained record several times. About fifty were built and operated between 1941 and 1951. Design and development The National Aviation foundation's glider training programme progressed with three well defined steps, each using one of Ern√∂ Rubik's designs: the R-07 at the primary stage, followed by the secondary R-08 Pilis and the tertiary, relatively high performance R-12 Kev√©ly. The foundation specified two particular properties for the latter, robustness and the ability to fly safely in cloud. The Kev√©ly's high wing, mounted on top of the fuselage, had a rectangular-plan inner panel covering half the span and trapezoidal outer panels out to rounded tips. The leading edges of these outer panels were only slightly swept, with most of the taper on their trailing edges. They also carried considerable washout, deceasing the likelihood of tip stalling though reducing high-speed performance. The wing was built around a single spar with plywood skin ahead of it, forming a torsion-resistant D-box. Aft of the spar the wing was fabric covered. On each side a single bracing strut ran from the lower fuselage to the spar at about 25% span. Generous G√∂ppingen-type air brakes were mounted between the ends of the bracing struts and the start of the tapered panels. Ailerons ran from the tips with constant chord apart from a short stretch when they entered the inner panels. The glider had a plywood-skinned semi-monocoque fuselage. The pilot sat ahead of the leading edge in a cockpit enclosed by a curved, multi-framed canopy which smoothly followed the fuselage lines. Large, sliding windows gave good side views and the instrument panel was equipped for cloud flying. Landings were made on a semi-recessed monowheel, equipped with brakes, just aft of the base of the bracing struts and assisted by skids under the forward fuselage and the tail. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where the tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and strut-braced. Tailplane and elevators together were trapezoidal out the rounded tips. The fin was small but carried a large, roughly quadrantal balanced rudder, hinged far enough aft to clear the elevators. The fixed surfaces were ply-covered and control surfaces fabric-covered. Operational history The Kev√©ly proved popular with aeroclubs, some of whom built their own and others purchased from Aero Ever, who built twenty-five, or from the Aircraft Factory of Transylvania who built eight. The dangers for a novice in cloud, despite the instrumentation, were of flying too fast or of entering a spin. The Kev√©ly's airbrakes could be opened in cloud to slow it down and though it could enter a spin this was slow in both speed and rate of rotation. Centralization of the controls quickly returned the aircraft to normal flight without large loss of altitude. At least three Hungarian height gain records were set by the Kev√©ly, the best at by P√°l Vojnits. It also made long cross country flights, the longest over .

The 2019 El Protector was thetenth annual event produced under that name. The focal point of the show was the El Protector tag team tournament where eight teams composed of a \\"rookie\\" and a \\"vet\\" team up to compete for as a way to showcase the \\"rookie\\" of the team. The tournament was won by novato Death Metal and veteran Heddi Karaoui, who defeated Neza Kid and Cerebro Negro in the finals. As a result the team earned a future match for the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship, held by Los Oficiales (Oficial 911 and Oficial AK-47) at the time of the show. Beyond the eight El Protector matches the show featured three additional matches. Production Background Lucha Libre has a tradition for a tournament where a rookie, or novato, would be teamed up with an experienced veteran wrestler for a tag team tournament in the hopes of giving the Novato a chance to show case their talent and move up the ranks. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre has held a Torneo Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative Tournament\\") almost every year since 1994, but the concept predates the creation of the Gran Alternativa. The Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) started their own annual rookie/veteran tournament in 2010. The first two tournaments were called Torneo Relampago de Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas de la Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"Projecting a new promise lightning tournament\\") but would be renamed the El Protector tournament in 2012. The El Protector shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2019 El Protector show was the tenth time that IWRG promoted a show around the rookie/veteran tournament, with the name changing to El Protector in 2012 and onwards. Storylines The event featured various professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History Frederick A. Kennedy, Jr. was born in 1811 in Brighton, England, and emigrated to the United States in 1817 along with his family. The family moved around New York State and Pennsylvania, eventually settling near Lodi, New York in 1821. In about 1830 or 1831, Frederick Jr. moved to Tecumseh, Michigan, where he married Caroline Hewett. The Kennedys moved to Hanover Township, Michigan in 1837, part of the early wave of European settlers who arrived in the area. The couple purchased property, eventually amassing 370 acres. After arriving, the Kennedys constructed a small house located just east of the present site. The construction date of the present house is unknown, although tax records suggest that a portion of it was built in the 1846-47 period, and a larger portion added in the 1855-56 period. Frederick A. Kennedy, Jr., served four terms as Hanover Township supervisor, and in 1846 was elected to the state legislature. However, in 1871 the Kennedys moved to Jackson, and in 1883 they sold the Hanover farm to their son, Van Buren Kennedy and his wife Adelia M. Kennedy. In 1936, the property was purchased by Hiram A. and Helen Tallmadge; Helen Tallmadge sold it to Dr. and Mrs. John Hand in 1980. Description The Frederick A. and Caroline Hewett Kennedy, Jr., Farm is an eighty-acre farm, containing open field and pasture as well as wooded sections. On the property are a brick, Upright and Wing-style Greek Revival house and a timber-frame basement barn. The house consists of a two-story upright section and one- story wing with a single-story ell in the rear. The house sits on a fieldstone foundation, and the walls are made of hard-baked brick in the front, upright- and-wing section of softer brick in the rear ell, perhaps indicating different construction dates. The windows are six-over-six units in square-head openings with splayed brickwork caps The wing is fronted with a recessed porch containing the front entrance; the porch is supported by two fluted Tuscan columns with similar half-columns flanking the opening. Frieze windows under the eaves of the upright contain decorative cast-iron grilles. The nineteenth-century gable-roof barn is located well to the rear of the house. It is constructed of rubble fieldstone walls on two sides and vertical boarding on the other two. A superstructure is completely clad in vertical board-and-batten siding.

He is an evolutionary ecologist and geneticist, known for his research on host‚Äìpathogen interaction and coevolution, mainly using the model system Daphnia and its parasites. Education and academic positions Ebert obtained a diploma in Zoology and Ecology in 1988 from the Technical University of Munich, Germany. During his undergraduate studies he spend a year at the University of South Alabama, Alabama. He did a PhD in Evolutionary Biology in 1991 in the group of Stephen C. Stearns, at the University of Basel, Switzerland. In 1991 Ebert spent six months at the Vavilov Institute of General Genetics in Moscow, Russia. This was followed by a junior research fellowship at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. In 1992 Ebert joined the research group of William (Bill) Hamilton at the University of Oxford, where he started to work on host - parasite interactions. He did a further postdoc in the NERC Centre for Population Biology (CPB) at Silwood Park with John Lawton, before he became Assistant professor at the University of Basel, Switzerland. In 2001 he became Full Professor at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, but moved back to the University of Basel in 2004. Research Ebert is mostly known for his work on host - parasite coevolution. During his postdoc at Oxford University he developed the Daphnia - parasite system, as a new model for experimental studies. In particular Daphnia magna has become a model system to understand the genetics, evolution and ecology of host-parasite interaction..... In natural habitats Daphnia are frequently infected with diverse microparasites, and a number of these parasites can be used as models in the laboratory and the field (see section Parasitism at Daphnia magna) using observational, experimental and genomic approaches. Work from his research group resulted in a number of important findings. * Parasites are mostly more virulent in the host population where they evolved, than in other, new populations, which shows, that contrary to the former believe, parasites do not evolve avirulence while adapting to their hosts.Ebert D (1994). Virulence and local adaptation of a horizontally transmitted parasite. Science 265: 1084-1086 * The Monoculture effects occur also when the host population is not spatially structured, putting emphasize on the absence of a genetic structure of the host population.Altermatt F, Ebert D (2008).

Their initial style was rooted in hardcore punk, as manifest on their debut album Monologue (2008). After collaborating on a stage play, the band began a process of artistic reinvention which culminated in the release of Har Nevo in 2012. They experimented with atmosphere, introducing unconventional percussion patterns and new instruments such as the Indian harmonium and the bouzouki. On their third album People, When You See the Smoke, Do Not Think It Is Fields They're Burning (2015), the Black Heart Rebellion affirmed their new direction. Their latest project is a 2018 alternative soundtrack to the film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. During their transformative period, the band joined Church of Ra, a collaborative artist collective started by Amenra. They emphasize the integration of multiple forms, including music, performance, visual art, and ritual. Since 2008, Goethals, Bryon, and Tomas Lootens run their own record label Smoke & Dust, which has also spawned the 019 music venue/arts centre in Ghent.  History  The band formed within the hardcore scene in 2004, when the members were around 17‚Äì18 years old. Drummer Tim Bryon had just dropped out of music academy, feeling \\"the urge to play heavier music\\". The Black Heart Rebellion toured throughout Europe and as far as Malaysia and Japan, where their debut album Monologue was released in 2009. Around this time, they collaborated with Belgian-German theatre company In Vitro, creating a live soundtrack to the play Medea. The project led them to question their creative direction, marking the start of a \\"difficult\\" period of personal and stylistic transformation that spanned four years and almost saw the band break up. They came through with a new approach and joined Amenra's Church of Ra collective. In March 2012, they entered the studio of Koen Gisen, recording their second album Har Nevo. Gisen had previously worked on indie rock and singer-songwriter records and this was his \\"heaviest\\" project yet, which \\"drove both parties out of their comfort zones\\". After Har Nevo's release, the band received some emails from disappointed fans of their older work, to which Bryon generally responded: \\"Give [the album] some time. Leave it and then listen to it again.\\" The Black Heart Rebellion began performing live again, appearing at the Belgian festivals Dour, Pukkelpop, and Boomtown in August 2013. For the production of their third album, they returned to Gisen's studio. People, When You See the Smoke, Do Not Think It Is Fields They're Burning was released through 9000 Records on 23 October 2015. The title is taken from a death poem by the Zen monk Baika, who on his deathbed \\"was picturing how passersby could misinterpret the signs (smoke) of his cremation.\\" In 2018, the band created an alternative soundtrack to the 2014 vampire film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, performing it live with the film screening in the background. The soundtrack was released in April 2018 through their own label Smoke & Dust. While the film is in Persian, Uyttenhove's vocals on the record use a non-existent language.  Style and influences  Alan Lomax's 1941 recording Midnight Special and Other Southern Prison Songs influenced the band's use of percussion. The band's initial style around the release of Monologue was described as screamo or post-metal, weaving desolate melodies into violent crescendos. Afterwards, the Black Heart Rebellion revised their direction radically. In 2015, Benjamin Bland of Drowned in Sound wrote that Har Nevo was \\"the sound of a band apparently stuck between two occasionally contradictory paths. There were attempts to capture the intensity of visceral hardcore, combined with leanings towards ritualistic post-punk. On new album People, when you see the smoke, do not think it is the fields they are burning the latter tendency has very much won out. ...even at the record's most up-tempo, the vocals of Pieter Uyttenhove remain clean\\". He described the album as \\"slow-burning music that looks to envelop and intoxicate its listeners through a diet of drones, pulsating riffs and unusual percussion sounds ... [with] shades of neofolk and a vaguely black metal-esque atmosphere.\\" Around the same time, Noisey wrote that the band \\"treads the dusty ground between doom, post-rock, tribal beats, ritual percussion, and ambient\\", while Nic Smith of SLUG summarized them as a marriage of Amenra and Swans. In 2016, Bryon dismissed the labels \\"neofolk\\" and \\"dark post-rock\\", saying that people should not be \\"breaking their heads over ... finding the right tag for TBHR.\\" In 2013, Bryon and Uyttenhove agreed that although they have largely abandoned punk rock musically, they still identify with its independent ethos. Their aim is to create a unique atmosphere manifest in all aspects of the band's music as well as live performance (including stage lighting) and visual art. When asked about the impact of theatre on their style in 2015, Uyttenhove stated: \\"For me a good song exists out of two parts: the main part is, always, a story that's being told, or a feeling or emotion that's being evoked. The other part is the way in which story, feeling or emotion is brought, I mean with what instruments, melodies, rhythms etc. [Our work with In Vitro taught] us a lot about that and made us question how that 'storytelling' can take place, which factors can help delivering the story in the best way possible.\\" Speaking about the evolution of his approach, Bryon said in 2016: \\"I took a step back from the conventional drum patterns in underground heavy music and searched for inspiration where percussion really created an atmosphere, rather than just decibels... There may be little traces of it in what I actually play, but bands like Dawanggang, Karantamba and several of the recordings of Alan Lomax (like the prison songs and the album Saraca: [Funerary Music of Carriacou]) really fascinate me. Blending these influences with heavier guitars and vocals brought us to [our current] zone.\\" He also expressed admiration for the work of Nick Cave, Tom Waits, and Hugues C. Pernath as well as Neurosis and Six Organs of Admittance. In 2018, Koen Lauwers of HUMO compared aspects of the band's live performance to Sonic Youth, Sunn O))), Pan Sonic, and the Velvet Underground.

The present building was completed in 2015 and is the third church to serve the town; it stands between its predecessors, a small hall opened in 1922 and a larger church of 1955, on a site which had belonged to a Catholic family since the 19th century. The Hailsham area was historically supportive of Protestant Nonconformist beliefs and had few Catholics, and for many years worshippers had to attend Mass in basic premises: rooms in private houses and, from 1917, a subdivided loft in the stables of a brewery. Numbers grew rapidly after the first permanent church opened, and after six decades of being served from Our Lady of Ransom Church, Eastbourne, Hailsham became an independent parish in 1957. The town's rapid postwar growth and an increasing Catholic population prompted the construction of the larger new church. When created in 1957, Hailsham's parish covered an extensive, mostly rural area of East Sussex, and it was extended again in the early 21st century when nearby Polegate was included. The parish is now formally known as \\"Hailsham and Polegate\\" and is served by St Wilfrid's Church‚Äîat which there are two Sunday Masses each week‚Äîand St George's Church at Polegate. Both are part of the Eastbourne Deanery within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. Masses were also celebrated up to once a week at a chapel at Hellingly Hospital, a large psychiatric hospital within the parish, for about 50 years until the late 1980s. History The market town of Hailsham, north of Eastbourne, existed at the time of the Domesday survey of 1086 and has been a centre of agriculture and industry for centuries. Growth encouraged by the opening of a railway line brought more people to the town, and by the start of the 20th century Anglicans, Strict Baptists, Methodists and the Free Church had their own places of worship. No provision was made for Roman Catholic worship, though: the town was covered by the vast parish of Our Lady of Ransom Church in Eastbourne (the largest in the Archdiocese of Southwark at the time). In 1895 its priest appealed to the Vicar-General of the Archdiocese with a request to celebrate Mass in various towns and villages in the parish; he compiled a list showing distances from Eastbourne and the number of known Catholics in each place. Hailsham was said to have three, which was a \\"notably small\\" proportion given that it was by far the largest of the listed settlements. About from Hailsham was the village of Upper Dicker, a stronghold of Protestant Nonconformism (the 400-capacity Zoar Strict Baptist Chapel had opened in 1838). One resident was a Catholic convert, though, and she wrote to Bishop of Southwark Peter Amigo in 1915 asking for part of her house (Elm Cottage) to be used as a public oratory for herself and local Catholics. Permission was granted, and Fr Paul Lynch of Our Lady of Ransom Church said Mass for her and three other people on 15 July 1915. This became a regular arrangement, and within months nurses from Hellingly Hospital were also attending. The small chapel was furnished with spare benches from St Peter and St Paul's Anglican church at Hellingly. Mass was celebrated in an upper room at Lynn's Brewery in Battle Road (pictured in 2010 when owned by Apaseal). The first permanent church was designed by Fr. Alexis Hauber and opened in 1922. Mgr Arthur Cocks, who took over from Fr Lynch in 1917, decided that Hailsham would be a more effective Mass centre than the remote hamlet of Upper Dicker. Early efforts to establish a permanent base there faced difficulties: there was little money, Our Lady of Ransom Church could not afford to lend any, there was anti-Catholic feeling in the town, and no premises could be found. Meanwhile, the Catholic resident of Upper Dicker moved to Hailsham and arranged for a visiting priest to celebrate Mass at her new home. Then from 28 July 1917, Mgr Cocks was able to rent part of a brewery and conduct services there. The property on Battle Road (a yellow- and red-brick building of 1887 which still survives) had stables at the rear, and the hay-loft was partitioned to form a rudimentary chapel, accessed by a timber staircase. Masses were held monthly, and congregations soon reached double figures. Also in 1917, the Archdiocese discovered that land at South Road near Hailsham railway station was owned by a Catholic family. Mgr Cocks bought the site for ¬£564.3s.4d inclusive of legal fees on 23 December 1920 with the aim of keeping it free for a permanent church. The Archdiocese, into whose name the land was legally transferred, lent ¬£500 and Our Lady of Ransom Church in Eastbourne paid the balance. Bishop Peter Amigo stated that the loan was on the basis that a permanent structure‚Äîeither a proper church or a hall which could be superseded by a church later‚Äîwould be built, which prevented Mgr Cocks buying a wooden World War I Army hut which had come up for sale for ¬£371 in Dover. The loan from the Archdiocese was paid back in May 1925. Work on a small () permanent hall started quickly to the design of Fr. Alexis Hauber, an assistant priest at Eastbourne. Construction cost ¬£701.10s.3d., and the building opened for worship on 12 August 1922. Another assistant priest from Eastbourne, Fr Alexander Trew, was put in charge. The building was registered for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 on 5 September 1923. It was a brick structure (later painted) with a low-pitched tiled roof. Mass attendance rose from 29 in the early months at the hall to 70 by 1926, which included Catholics from the nearby town of Polegate (whose own church, St George's, opened in 1938) and villages such as Chiddingly, Hellingly and Herstmonceux. Money was already coming in to allow a larger church to be built: weekly collections were being put towards a building fund, a Catholic from Eastbourne left over ¬£670 in her will in December 1932, and by November 1934 ¬£1,500 was available. When it became clear that no work would start before World War II broke out, some was invested in War Bonds to earn interest. Writing in 1940 in respect of the previous year, during which thousands of wartime evacuees moved to Eastbourne, Fr John Corballis of Our Lady of Ransom Church reported that \\"the little church in Hailsham has been so inadequate that a public hall has had to be taken for Sunday Masses\\". A Nissen hut was also erected in the grounds of the church to provide more capacity on Sundays. Long-planned work on building a larger church had been delayed by the war and the expenditure on St George's Church at Polegate, and it was not until 1952 that architect Henry Bingham Towner of nearby Uckfield was commissioned for the job. He submitted a sketch in February of that year, and the Ministry of Works gave its approval for the work at the end of the year. Bingham Towner was recommended to Canon Corballis by Geoffrey Webb, one of the architects of St George's Church. The foundation stone was laid on 6 June 1954 by Bishop Cyril Cowderoy and the new church was formally opened on 22 May 1955, the Feast of the Ascension, when the Bishop returned to celebrate the inaugural Mass and bless the building. Bingham Towner's design was not adopted in full: what was intended to be a cruciform church was built as a long, narrow nave, small sanctuary, attached sacristy and side porch. It was built by Richard Thorpe Bros. of Southborough, Kent. Joseph Cribb carved the foundation stone and statues of Our Lady and the Sacred Heart, and the \\"rather imposing entrance doors\\" were taken from a demolished mansion at nearby Battle. The temporary Nissen hut was demolished in the summer of 1955. Canon Corballis was seriously ill when the new church opened but managed to attend the opening ceremony; he died in December 1955. Henry Bingham Towner designed the new St Wilfrid's Church in 1955. It was replaced by the present church in 2015. St Wilfrid's Church was cut off from the parish of Our Lady of Ransom, Eastbourne and became the centre of an independent parish from the end of October 1957, initially with the name \\"Hailsham with Hellingly\\". Hellingly Hospital was within the parish; it had been served from Hailsham since the 1930s, when a monthly and (from 1937 or 1938) a weekly Mass was held at the chapel there. From the late 1960s part of St Luke's Anglican chapel was used for Masses and reservation of the Blessed Sacrament. Weekly Mass was celebrated there by the priest of St Wilfrid's until 1988. Meanwhile, various improvements were made to the fabric and fittings of St Wilfrid's over the next decades. A new presbytery was built (again to the design of Henry Bingham Towner) south of the church in 1959, which allowed the priest to move out of a nearby cottage. In 1964 a bequest by a parishioner allowed the church and its fittings to be redecorated. Shortly after this the parish priest died, and new Stations of the Cross carved from Bath stone by Joseph Cribb were donated to the church in his memory. In 1966 more extensive structural work was carried out: the original entrance porch was rebuilt as a baptistery, a new font was provided (again to the design of Joseph Cribb‚Äîone of his last works before his death) and a new porch was erected, again to the design of Henry Bingham Towner. In 1970 a new Portland stone altar was carved by a local craftsman and presented to the church to commemorate the canonisation that year of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, and a stained glass window commemorating Margaret Clitherow‚Äîone of the Martyrs‚Äîwas designed by Kenneth Dunton of Edenbridge, Kent. Also installed around this time was another carving by Joseph Cribb, featuring George slaying the Dragon, which was bought from Cribb's studio and adapted to form a war memorial. George Elliott of Herstmonceux, who provided the altar, also designed an alcove with a \\"graceful parabolic arch\\" for the reservation of the Blessed Sacrament. The church held up to 130 people, making it the smallest of the eight designed by Henry Bingham Towner in the diocese. In the early 21st century it was decided to build another new church on the South Road site and convert Bingham Towner's building into a church hall. Innerdale Hudson Architects of Eastbourne (scheme architect Simon Franks) were commissioned to design the building, and the building contractors were P.D. Harris (Henfield) Ltd of Henfield. The Diocese of Arundel and Brighton approved the scheme in late 2013 and sought planning permission from Wealden District Council in December of that year. The application was approved in May 2014. Construction was underway in winter 2014‚Äì15. The church hall (the original 1922 church) was used by the builders to store materials, so at that time a portable building was erected in the grounds to serve as a temporary church hall. By April 2015 the steel frame of the new church was in place, and all exterior construction work finished later that year. The first Mass at the new St Wilfrid's Church was celebrated on 31 October 2015 (the Vigil Mass for All Saints' Day) after a two-week period when all parish Masses were held at St George's Church in Polegate. Many fittings were moved from the old church, including the Stations of the Cross, altar and font. Bishop Richard Moth, the Bishop of Arundel and Brighton Diocese, consecrated the church on 21 April 2016. It was completed on schedule and under budget; part of the cost was met by parish fundraising events and bequests, which had raised ¬£260,000. Architecture Bingham Towner's 1954‚Äì55 church, a \\"pleasant little building\\" of yellowish-buff brick, with a steep shingled roof and designed in the Vernacular style, was small and unpretentious: Nikolaus Pevsner described it as \\"modest indeed\\", even after its porch and sacristy were added in 1966. The \\"fine oak porch\\" gave some more emphasis to what was \\"just a simple rectangular box\\". The mullioned leaded light windows gave an unecclesiastical appearance reminiscent of a Tudor Revival house. The new church was designed to be wider than its predecessor, which meant the pitch of the roof (originally planned to be as steep) had to be flattened to avoid affecting nearby houses. The church has an aisled layout with side aisles marked by lower ceilings and large windows, and curves outwards in the middle to provide more capacity. The roof projects beyond the entrance, forming a cantilevered section with large overhanging eaves. The church is built of brick with an extensively glazed fa√ßade facing the street. Administration and services The church is licensed for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and has the registration number 65019. It was registered for the solemnisation of marriages on 24 March 1953. St Wilfrid's Church is part of the Hailsham and Polegate parish, along with St George's Church in Polegate (opened in 1938 and now served from St Wilfrid's). The parish is one of four (covering eight churches) which make up the Deanery of Eastbourne. In turn, this is one of 13 deaneries in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. As of 2019 the parish of Hailsham and Polegate is served by one priest who celebrates Mass at 6.00pm on Saturdays (Vigil Mass) and 10.30am on Sundays at St Wilfrid's, as well as offering the Sacrament of Penance weekly. One Mass and a monthly Sacrament of Penance are also held at St George's Church. In 2005‚Äì06, the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton analysed the attendance, capacity and parish structure of all of its churches. It reported that one priest served the parish of Hailsham and Polegate, two Sunday Masses were celebrated at St Wilfrid's Church, and the attendance across both was 153 worshippers. The seating capacity was given as 130, although the planning application submitted for the new church in 2013 stated that \\"up to 100 people [could] be accommodated\\" in the old church. The new church was required to have a capacity of at least 160. As originally constituted in 1957, the parish was bounded by the villages of Horam, Vines Cross, Warbleton, Punnett's Town, Three Cups Corner, Rushlake Green, Bodle Street Green and Windmill Hill; then the boundary passed north of Wartling, across the Rickney Levels (near Pevensey) and north of Hankham and Polegate; it then continued towards Ripe, Golden Cross, Whitesmith, Chiddingly and back to Horam. Other villages within this area include Hellingly, Herstmonceux, Lower Dicker and Upper Dicker. The northern section between Horam, Three Cups Corner and Rushlake Green was much closer to Heathfield but was originally an outlying part of the vast parish of Our Lady of Ransom Church, Eastbourne, so became part of Hailsham parish. The anachronism was corrected in 1971 when Heathfield's boundaries were realigned to incorporate this section.

The station features playlists, interviews and live performances, and the website features newsletters and videos. Lazlo explains he created BlowUpRadio because \\"people actually care about hearing local bands,\\" as a response to mainstream Jersey Rock Radio stations \\"playing an occasional Bruce Springsteen or Bon Jovi song.\\" The Aquarian Weekly says \\"he concentrates all his efforts on local artists that are doing their absolute best to gain recognition in a field where recognition is fleeting.\\" Starting in 2006, BlowUpRadio started a benefit program called Banding Together, a benefit show to help those who suffer from spondylitis, with proceeds going to the Spondylitis Association of America. The show is held over several days as a virtual festival, and mostly features acoustic live over-the-air sets from Lazlo's apartment, and occasionally recorded sets from bands performing at venues. Some prominent artist performances include Richard Barone, the Accelerators, Lost in Society and Val Emmich. The tenth anniversary of BlowUpRadio was held at Buddies in Sayreville, New Jersey, with performances by Cropduster, Tea & Whiskey and Mike Ferraro and the Young Republicans.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.  History  Early Detroit had a prominent Jewish community, out of which the first Jewish congregation in Michigan, the Temple Beth El, was founded in 1850. Jewish communities gradually moved west, into Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor, and Jackson. The very first Jews in Jackson were Jacob Hirsch and Jacob Levy, who arrived in 1842. Others followed, building up a small community. In 1859, the first burial in what is now the Temple Beth Israel Cemetery took place, of Rosa Hirsch, wife of Jacob Hirsch. It was not until 1860 that the deed was recorded, recognizing ownership of the land, and not until 1861 that the Hebrew Association was formed, for the purpose of maintaining and improving the land. Jackson's Beth Israel congregation was officially formed in 1862, the second Reform congregation in Michigan. In 1937 ownership and control of the cemetery was transferred to the Temple. In the 21st century, the cemetery remains in uses, the oldest such Jewish cemetery in Michigan. Description The Temple Beth Israel Cemetery is an approximately one-acre plot, now located in an area of mixed commercial and early twentieth-century residential development. A black-painted iron milled post fence runs along the street edge of the cemetery, with chain-link and wooden privacy fences surrounding the other sides. At one corner is a vehicle entrance, marked by a black-painted iron milled post swinging gate between two rock-faced stone pillars. A pedestrian entrance is located on one side of the property. The interior is flat and grass-covered, with a single central formal walkway. As of 2009, the cemetery contained 274 burials, arranged in rows and divided into family plots. Most of the graves are marked with headstones, nearly all of marble or granite. Markers are typically modest, with little ornamentation. The oldest burials are located in the northwest corner of the cemetery along West Avenue, with the graves becoming newer farther away. A caretaker's residence is located within at the boundary of the cemetery, fronting the street. It is a two-story vernacular stucco-covered building with a gambrel roof, with an addition at the rear. The original section sits on a rock-faced concrete block foundation. Horizontal and diagonal boards on the exterior mimic half- timbering. The front of the house has a half-hip-roofed porch spanning the first floor, covering one double-hung window and one door; a single double- hung window is on the second floor. Other elevations contain a variety of window forms, including double-hung and fixed lights. The cemetery also contains two small, modern, utility sheds near the house.

Good use of guitars too, especially bass guitars. The album is likely to create a flutter\\".

Critical reception Sify rated the film as \\"Waste of time\\" and said, \\"The trouble with the film is that there is no story to tell, it is just a few incidents strung together by a non happening script [..] The film lacks a true Tamil touch and offers little in terms of surprise or twists. The music is bad and the second half is repetitive and too long with a predictable climax, and all is well with the jolly good guys and girls\\". S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu wrote, \\"Since the line-up of actors in this R Studio's film consists mostly of newcomers, director Arshad Khan should have spent more time working on the script\\" and criticised the 'wafer-thin' plot and weak screenplay. Another critic stated, \\"Had Arshad Khan infused more pace and cut down the crude dialogues in the name of humour, 'Sa Boo Three' would have a game that everyone would want to play their hands with\\". Box office The film took a below average opening at the Chennai box office, beginning in the fifth position the first week and finishing in the sixth position the second week.

It was formed in February 2018 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, by nine groups. In September the alliance acceded to a revised peace deal with the government that also included the main rebel faction, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition, but some of the member groups disagreed with the decision and split from the alliance. The pro-deal SSOA has experienced continued tension between its members, as well as with the government.  Formation  The original nine groups consisted of: * the Federal Democratic Party/South Sudan Armed Forces (FDP/SSAF), led by Gabriel Changson Chang * the National Salvation Front (NAS), led by Thomas Cirilo Swaka * the National Democratic Movement (NDM), led by Lam Akol * the People's Democratic Movement (PDM), led by Hakim Dario Moi * the South Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SSLM/A), led by Bapiny Montuil Wegjang * the South Sudan National Movement for Change (SSNMC), led by Bangasi Joseph Bakosoro * the South Sudan Patriotic Movement/Army (SSPM/A), led by Costello Garang Ring * the South Sudan United Movement/Army (SSUM/A), led by Peter Gadet Yak * the United Democratic Republican Alliance (UDRA), led by Gatweth K. Thich The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-Former Detainees faction (SPLM-FD), led by Pagan Amum, was also listed as a member in the SSOA's charter, but subsequent media reports suggested that it was not included in the coalition. South Sudan United Front/Army, led by Paul Malong Awan, declared its intention to join the SSOA in April, but this does not seem to have occurred. In its foundational statement, the SSOA promised to \\"accelerate efforts to restore just and durable peace, democracy and to preserve human rights and the fundamental democratic rights of our people.\\" The group condemned the \\"ethnic chauvinism, despotic oppression, and institutionalized corruption\\" plaguing the country and called for the institution of federalism. It criticized previous peace agreements for focusing too much on satisfying warring factions and not enough on long-lasting conflict resolution; it also blamed the collapse of these agreements largely on the government.  History  In 2017, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) began sponsoring an attempt to revise and resurrect the failed 2015 peace deal. This was followed by the formation of several new political groups and militias hoping to claim a place at the negotiating table. From June to August 2018, Sudanese-sponsored talks resulted in President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar signing several interim agreements meant to lead up to a conclusive deal. The SPLM-FD and the SSOA also participated in these talks, but were said to be marginalized.  First split  As negotiations were drawing to a close, parts of the SSOA expressed continued dissatisfaction with the terms. Cirilo, leader of the NAS, demanded the full introduction of federalism and accused Sudan and Uganda of being more concerned with preserving their material interests in South Sudan than achieving lasting peace. His supporters further alleged that Machar was only concerned with the interests of his own Nuer people. On September 12, the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) was signed by the government, Riek Machar's SPLM-IO, Pagan Amum's SPLM-FD, and the SSOA faction led by Changson. SSOA groups that accepted the deal included: * Changson's FDP/SSAF * Akol's NDM * Bakosoro's SSNMC * Garang's SSPM/A * Montuil's SSLM/A The logo of the SSNDA, which split from the SSOA in August/September 2018. * Gadet's SSUM/A * a breakaway faction of the PDM led by Josephine Lagu (which later renamed to the People's Democratic Movement for Peace) * a breakaway faction of the NAS led by Khalid Butros Bora SSOA groups that rejected the deal included: * Cirilo's NAS * Dario's PDM * Thich's UDRA * a breakaway faction of the NDM led by Emmanuel Aban (which later renamed to the National Democratic Movement-PF) * a breakaway faction of the SSNMC led by Vakindi L. Unvu Four of these breakaway groups later renamed themselves the South Sudan National Democratic Alliance. Dario's PDM expressed disagreements with the others over their vision for a future government and went its own way..  SSNDA and SSOMA  The SSNDA, led by Cirilo and dominated by his NAS, was reported to be the largest rebel group outside of Machar's SPLM-IO in early 2019. On August 30, it merged with the Real Sudan People's Liberation Movement (formed by Amum after he quit the SPLM-FD) and Malong's SSUF/A to form the South Sudan Opposition Movements Alliance. This group entered into negotiations with the government, facilitated by the Community of Sant'Egidio, and signed a peace deal on January 14, 2020.  Second split, reunion, and third split  On November 30, 2018, the SSOA held leadership elections. Peter Gadet of the SSUM/A won. Incumbent leader Changson dismissed the elections, saying that Gadet was unfit to lead because he had been \\"indicted by the international community\\", referring to a 2014 European Union sanction against Gadet after the 2014 Bentiu massacre. Lam Akol of the NDM sided with Gadet and later accused the South Sudanese government of provoking a split to weaken the remaining opposition. Another member of the NDM accused Changson of buying support from the other party leaders with money sent from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development that was meant to be shared equally among the parties. Media reported that the dispute may revolve around who will secure the vice presidential position allotted to the SSOA in the peace deal; Changson denied these rumors. The SSOA groups that supported Changson's leadership included: * Changson's FDP/SSAF * Butros's NAS * Lagu's PDM-P * Bakosoro's SSNMC * Garang's SSPM/A * Montuil's SSLM/A The SSOA groups that supported Gadet's leadership included: * Gadet's SSUM/A * Akol's NDM * a breakaway faction of the FDP/SSAF led by Thomas Peter Okac * a breakaway faction of the NAS led by Henry Oyay * a breakaway faction of the PDM-P led by Anas Richard Zanga * a breakaway faction of the SSNMC led by Thomas Ali Bilal * a breakaway faction of the SSLM/A led by Jacob Nyier Gatkuoth Gadet died on April 15, 2019. Reportedly, many of his subordinates in the SSUM had by then defected back to the Kiir government.. Also by this time, the FDP/SSAF faction led by Thomas Okac had left to join a new alliance formed by Hakim Dario's PDM. Later that month, the spokesman for Akol's NDM (part of the faction led by Gadet until his death) joined many opposition leaders in calling for an extension of the \\"pre-transitional\\" period of the R-ARCSS, saying key parts of the agreement (such as the unification of the army and the finalizing of state boundaries) have yet to be implemented. In July, the two SSOA factions reconciled. Each of the eight member parties would hold the position of chairman for six months, starting with Denay Jock Chagor (having assumed leadership of Gadet's SSUM/A) and followed by Changson of the FDP-SSAF. However, the other six member parties promptly rejected Chagor and appointed Josephine Lagu of the PDM-P as interim leader. Lagu's position was confirmed in an election in September, which was boycotted by Changson's FDP/SSAF and Chagor's SSUM/A. By 2020, however, Changson and Chagor had apparently reconciled themselves with the new leadership and rejoined the SSOA.  Current membership  As of April 2020, there were eight member groups within the SSOA: * National Salvation Front (NAS), led by Khalid Butros Bora * National Democratic Movement (NDM), led by Lam Akol * People's Democratic Movement for Peace (PDM-P), led by Josephine Lagu * South Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SSLM/A), led by Bapiny Montuil Wegjang * South Sudan National Movement for Change (SSNMC), led by Bangasi Joseph Bakosoro * South Sudan Patriotic Movement/Army (SSPM/A), led by Costello Garang Ring * Federal Democratic Party/South Sudan Armed Forces (FDP/SSAF), led by Gabriel Changson Chang * South Sudan United Movement/Army (SSUM/A), led by Denay Jock Chagor  References  Category:Political parties established in 2018 Category:Political parties in South Sudan Category:Factions of the South Sudanese Civil War Category:Rebel groups in South Sudan ","title":"South Sudan Opposition Alliance"},{"id":"60144329","text":"Xinjing Township () is a township in Tongwei County, Gansu province, China. , it has 13 villages under its administration.

The phyllodes are asymmetrically ovate to rhomboidal. It blooms between April and July producing flower-spikes that occur singly or in pairs. The spikes are and wide packed with golden coloured flowers. After flowering linear, straight seed pods form that resemble a string of beads. The chartaceous, pubescent pods dry to a brown colour and are in length. The brown seeds found within the pods are arranged longitudinally and have a length of . Acacia arafurica is distinguished from A. sublanata by its thicker and larger phyllodes, its longer peduncles, and its inflorescences arranged in the form of a spike (spicate). Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanists Mary Tindale and Phillip Kodela in 1992 as part of the work New species of Acacia (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) from tropical Australia as published in the journal Telpoea. It was reclassified as Racosperma arafuricum by Leslie Pedley in 2003 and transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. Distribution and habitat It is found from the northern part of Arnhem Land to the Cobourg Peninsula in the Northern Territory, growing in sand in swampy areas on coastal river flats or near streams in the gorge country, or sometimes in open forest.

Based on the 1959 play by Tennessee Williams, it focuses on the relationship between a drifter and a faded movie star. The film was adapted by Gavin Lambert and directed by Nicolas Roeg. Plot After failing to make it in the movies, drifter Chance Wayne decides to leave to return to his hometown. Fading film star Alexandra Del Lago is in her third marriage, this time to a prince, and is now called \\"Princess\\". Horrified by her own closeups in her latest film, she flees with Chance, using alcohol and drugs to anesthetize the pain of growing older. Back in his hometown, Chance seeks to resume his love affair with Heavenly Finley, the daughter of the local political boss. Cast * Elizabeth Taylor as Princess Kosmonopolis * Mark Harmon as Chance Wayne * Valerie Perrine as Miss Lucy * Kevin Geer as Tom Junior * Seymour Cassel as Hatcher * Ronnie Claire Edwards as Aunt Nonnie * Cheryl Paris as Heavenly Finley * Rip Torn as Boss Finley * Charles Lucia as Dr. George Scudder * Theodore Wilson as Fly * Megan Blake as Violet * John Fleck as Mission Man * Billy Ray Sharkey as Scotty * Ruta Lee as Sally Powers * Hal England as Minister * Nurit Koppel as Edna * Martha Milliken as Virginia * Michael Shaner as Driver * Angela Teek as Singer * Tery Lockett as Hotel Waiter * Michael Wilding Jr. * Tom Nolan * Avon Hill Production Stephen Farber of The New York Times wrote, \\"In doing his adaptation, Mr. Lambert made some radical simplifications, reducing the Boss Finley story to a bare minimum.\\" Sweet Bird of Youth, \\"like many other Williams plays, was rewritten several times by the playwright, and Mr. Lambert consulted the different versions that still exist,\\" Farber wrote. The castration in the play, which was removed from the 1962 film adaptation, is included in the 1989 TV movie adaptation. \\"In some ways,\\" Farber wrote, \\"the television film is bolder than the 1962 movie version of the play, which starred Geraldine Page and Paul Newman in the roles they had also created on Broadway. Because of censorship at the time, Richard Brooks, the writer-director, could not suggest the castration and was forced instead to end the film with Chance brutally beaten. ... Like the stage version, the TV film will not actually show the castration, but there will be a few clear references to the intention of emasculating Chance.\\" Filming took place in Upland, California. On May 11 and 12, 1989, vintage convertibles with Florida license plates drove through downtown Upland as cameras rolled. The interior of the Sea Cove bar was used as was the former Atwood's Department Store. A political rally was shot at the gazebo. This was Liz Taylor's fourth role in a Tennessee Williams adaptation. Rip Torn, who had already played Chance Wayne in the original 1959 Broadway production and Thomas J. Finley, Jr. in the 1962 film adaptation, was cast as a third character, Boss Finley, for the 1989 TV movie adaptation. His scenes were filmed separately from scenes with Elizabeth Taylor and Mark Harmon, so he didn't get to see much of them. This differs from the play, in which the Princess and Boss are involved in one scene together. \\"On stage, when we did it, the Princess comes on during the political rally downstairs when the Boss is doing his thing,\\" said Torn. \\"She drives by in her convertible.\\" Broadcast The film was broadcast on NBC on Sunday, October 1, 1989. Reception In his review for The New York Times on Sept. 29, 1989, John J. O'Connor wrote, \\"Apparently gaining weight again, Miss Taylor wears loose- fitting clothes and is often displayed in extremely dim lighting, which tends to shove Mr. Harmon further into the shadows. This is not the meeting of equals. This is a star turn. And it's a shame. The play and these performers are better than that. Still we get Tennessee Williams, one of the major playwrights of this century. And on commercial television these days, that's something to be grateful for.\\" Alan Carter of People gave the film a C+, calling it a \\"sometimes slow-moving retelling of the classic Williams play and 1962 movie.\\" In summary, he wrote, \\"Idiosyncratic film director Nicolas (The Man Who Fell to Earth) Roeg gives us endless close-ups of his two stars' dazzling blue eyes‚Äîbut the production doesn't add up to anything memorable.\\" Joseph Walker of Deseret News wrote that the film, \\"with its seaminess and overt sexuality, is not the kind of Sunday night viewing everyone will enjoy. But those who are looking for some sophisticated drama that is well-played artistically and technically will find much to their liking here.\\" Brenda Murphy noted that, while Richard Brooks's adaptation focused on Chance Wayne, \\"Nicolas Roeg's centering of the Princess creates a darker film about the inevitable loss of youth and the despairing or resilient responses to it that are possible.\\" References External links    Category:1989 drama films Category:1989 television films Category:1989 films Category:American drama films Category:American television films Category:American films Category:American films based on plays Category:Films based on works by Tennessee Williams Category:Films directed by Nicolas Roeg Category:Films set in Florida Category:Films shot in California Category:Southern Gothic films ","title":"Sweet Bird of Youth (1989 film)"},{"id":"60144586","text":"RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RBMS3 gene.

It now houses the Lee Conklin Reed Organ & History Museum. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. History The first schoolhouse in Hanover was a log building constructed in 1839. In 1850 it was replaced with a new brick one- room schoolhouse. In 1874, a new multi-room \\"high school\\" was constructed in Hanover, providing spaces for grades one through twelve. In the summer of 1910, this school was destroyed by fire. The school board quickly raised funds to replace it, and hired O. J. Reniger of Marshall, Michigan as the general contractor. Construction on a new school, located at the site of the older building, began later in 1910, and was completed in mid-1911. IN 1934, a new gymnasium was added to the building. Materials for the new gym were taken, in part, from older buildings in the are, including a former church that had been used as a school gymnasium in the past. A new farm shop building was built near the high school in 1938; however, the building proved inadequate and was replaced in 1948 by the structure currently known as the Herrick Building. Beginning in the 1940s, the Hanover School District began merging with other local, smaller school districts; notably, the nearby Horton Schools merged with Hanover to form the Hanover-Horton School District. The result was an influx of students into the Hanover school. In response, the district built a new elementary school in Hanover in the mid-1950s. Elementary-aged children were moved from the \\"high school\\" to the new school. In 1959, a new Hanover- Horton High School was opened in Horton, and ninth through twelfth grade students were moved to the new school, leaving only grades seven and eight in the old Hanover High School. In late 1962, these students also moved to the new school. The gymnasium remained in use for a few years, and in 1963 the school board attempted to sell the old school. However, they were unsuccessful, and the buildings remained vacant until 1977. In that year, the board began leasing the building to the Hanover-Horton Area Historical Society to house the Lee Conklin Reed Organ & History Museum, a collection of organs and melodeons donated to the society by Lee Conklin. In 1995, the board sold the building to the society. Description The Old Hanover High School Complex includes the High School Building with a gymnasium addition, and the nearby Herrick Building. The school buildings are located atop a hill facing the village. The High School building proper is two-story, Georgian Revival style dark red-and-brown brick structure, and is an example of what is known as the \\"rectangular plan\\" school structure. It has a steeply pitched hip roof and a raised basement level, resulting in three floors of interior space. The front facade is symmetrical, five bays wide, with a projecting three-bay center entry pavilion. The pavilion contains a double-door entry with semi- circular arched transom window, Tuscan order pilasters, a tri-part window on the second floor, and a pediment above. Brick quoins are placed on the corners of the pavilion and the main building. Above the second-story windows are a frieze and cornice embellished with modillion blocks, which continue onto the other sides. The sides of the building are six bays wide. Across the back end of the school is a later addition containing a gymnasium. The addition is a rectangular gable-roofed structure, wider than the main school. It is constructed with pilasters and wood from a former church, and is clad with cream-and-orange brick taken from a tile kiln in Jackson. The Herrick Building is a single-story rectangular building with a side gable roof. It sits on a concrete pad, and the exterior is a combination of brick veneer, vinyl siding, and masonry block.

It had the responsibility of the expedition of letters and orders from the king. Later it also gained the responsibility of copying and archiving the king's regulations. From the Reformation to the introduction of absolute monarchy After the Reformation the Chancellery was renamed Danish Chancellery () to distinguish it from the German Chancellery (). The Danish Chancellery was responsible for all correspondence in Danish and the civil administration of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The German Chancellery had similar responsibility for the German and Latin correspondence and the civil administration of duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Before, 1770, when it was separated into its own ministry, the German Chancellery was also responsible for foreign policy towards all but the Nordic countries.

In September 1804, Jane met Pishey Thompson, also of Boston, at a ball. 6 Nov 1807, Jane married him.  Years in America  Jane left England in 1818 for America. Pishey Thompson moved to the United States in 1819. It was suggested, in 1864, that the Jane traveled to the United States before her husband did, on the advice of a physician who believed the climate would be more salubrious than the fennish climate of Lincolnshire, and that the climate benefited her so greatly that Pishey decided to move to the United States for her. The couple primarily resided in Washington, DC. In 1823, Jane's husband had an affair with Mary Wright, the daughter of a Unitarian reverend, who had apparently followed the Thompsons from Lincolnshire to the US; and on 23 April 1824, the two had an illegitimate son named John Wright. Pishey's biographer Isabel Bailey suggests that, despite this situation, \\"an affectionate relationship, without rancour, subsisted between all concerned,\\" though she does not specify whether Jane was among those concerned. In her diary, on Jan 27, 1840, she writes, ‚ÄúSeventeen years have elapsed since the death of _____‚Äù. It has been suggested that she may have lost a child in 1823, largely based on her poem ‚ÄúOn the Funeral of an Infant,‚Äù which is dated 1826. It is worth noting, she would have been around 37 in 1823. The diary entry may refer to the death of her mother on Jan 28, 1823. Jane‚Äôs views on abolition are unknown. (Her husband was part of the American Colonization Society.)  Later life and death  The couple returned to England in 1846. Jane died 15 July 1851. She had no children. Despite his affair, her husband was apparently quite attached to her, and kept her wedding ring until his death, when he chose to be buried with it on his finger. She is buried, beside her husband, \\"in the burial-ground of the Gravel-Pit Chapel, belonging to the Unitarian denomination, at Hackney.\\"  Writing  Jane was described as \\"a lady of great force and originality of character and mind, possessing not only literary tastes, but literary capacity.\\" Her major publication was a book of poetry entitled Solitary Musings. This was, apparently, originally printing for private circulation in Washington, DC, where the couple resided. These poems often have biographical threads. They discuss her relationship with her sister Susan and her father, and the loneliness of being so far from her family. She was also believed to have contributed a chapter to Change for American Notes, a 19th-century response to Charles Dickens' work American Notes.  Legacy  Jane left behind her written work, as well as several diaries. These records present her unique account of life in 19th-century United States. As Pishey had befriended George Flowers, a brewer in Stratford- upon-Avon, several of her diaries, as well as letters she received from her husband during the early years of her marriage, are held at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

Construction took place from 1527 to 1590, and a few years later the palace was sold to the wealthy noblemen, Ottavio and Giulio di Bartolomeo Sozzifanti. The palace once had an elevated walkway linking to the church of San Biagio, allowing the members to attend mass without entering the street.

Old Textile Hall was a former building in Greenville, South Carolina, which from 1917 to 1962, hosted the Southern Textile Exposition, a trade fair for textile machinery. The building also functioned as a municipal auditorium for Greenville until 1958. Old Textile Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 but demolished in 1992. By the early 20th century, American textile production had clearly moved into the Carolina Piedmont from its earlier center in New England. In 1900, a New York Times correspondent noted that prosperity in Greenville was \\"evident on all sides\\" and that mill owners there made huge profits.E.D.G., \\"South Carolina's Mills,\\" New York Times, February 4, 1900, 8. By the second decade of the century, South Carolina was ranked second only to Massachusetts in textile production; and Greenville, located between Charlotte and Atlanta, was central to the industry. In 1914, the Southern Textile Association approved the bid of Greenville mill owners to host the first textile machinery trade fair in the South.Ray Belcher, Greenville County, Carolina: From Cotton Fields to Textile Center of the World (Charleston: History Press, 2006), 63-65. The first show, in 1915, was held in borrowed warehouses; but the trade fair was so successful that Greenville's Southern Textile Exposition, Inc. soon raised donations for the building of a permanent exhibition hall, which was effectively completed for the second exposition in 1917.Yancey S. Gilkerson, \\"Textile Hall's First Sixty Years,\\" Proceedings and Papers of the Greenville County Historical Society, 5 (1980), 77-78. A trade magazine commented that \\"The kickers kicked. The knockers knocked. The ravens croaked that the show would fail. But the Greenville boys worked steadily on, until today they have completed a building that is a fitting monument to their industry.\\" In 1923, the board of directors reorganized as an eleemosynary corporation. The five- story building, approximately 101 by 235 feet, was designed by J. E. Sirrine and Company in Renaissance Revival style and was built by Fiske-Carter Construction Company on West Washington Street, near its intersection with Academy Street, in the western part of Greenville's central business district. The building had load bearing brick perimeter walls that incorporated \\"horizontal reinforced concrete and granolithic bond beams.\\" Its auditorium, on the second level, included a stage and a balcony; and the tongue-and-groove maple floors were designed to accommodate operating textile machinery. From 1917 until 1962, the Southern Textile Exposition held trade shows, usually biennially‚Äîfor most of those years under the direction of W. G. \\"Bill\\" Sirrine, a prosperous Greenville lawyer and landowner.Greenville News, August 13, 2020. The 4,000-seat Textile Hall was also used for other kinds of trade shows and for dances, concerts, movies, pageants, conventions, religious revivals, high school graduations, and basketball games, including the annual Southern Piedmont Textile Basketball Tournament.Judith Bainbridge, \\"The rise and fall of Greenville's Textile Hall,\\" Greenville News, April 17, 2017.

By 1962 Textile Hall had built or leased nine annexes, but even the additional space now proved inadequate for the Textile Exposition, and a new building was built adjoining the Greenville Downtown Airport.Gilkerson, 80. From 1962 until 1978, the old building was used only for storage. Feeble efforts were made to repurpose the building as a concert venue, and during this period, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Eventually the Greenville fire marshal condemned the building, and it was purchased and demolished by neighboring St. Mary's Catholic Church in 1992.Justin McGuire and Howard Buskirk, \\"Old Textile Hall faces church's wrecking ball,\\" Greenville Piedmont, September 6, 1991; Sharon Todd, \\"History and Dreams...Old Textile Hall may be going back to work,\\" Greenville Magazine, May‚ÄìJune 1981, 18.

History  The second most used category of bombs was the SD series which were high-explosive bombs but with thicker casings which meant their charge to weight ratio was only 30 to 40% of their total weight. At first glance, they were difficult to distinguish from the SC series of bombs, but the two series were color-coded the SC series having yellow tail stripes, while the SD series had red tail stripes. Bombs in this series were the SD 1, SD 1 FRZ, SD 2, SD 10 A, SD 10 FRZ, SD 10 C, SD 15, SD 50, SD 70, SD 250, SD 500, SD 1400, and SD 1700. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The SD series was used primarily in two roles that were determined by the type of fuze and accessories fitted to the bomb. The first was as a fragmentation bomb with instantaneous fuze and when the bombs exploded above ground the case created large fragments which would kill enemy personnel and destroy unarmored vehicles. The second role was as a general- purpose or armor-piercing role. In this role, the bombs were fitted with a time delay fuze which detonated the bomb after it had pierced a target destroying it with a combination of its blast and fragments.  Design  The body of the SD 70 was of one piece cast and machined steel construction. The body had one transverse fuze pocket just forward of the horizontal carrying lug. Around the nose of the bomb, there was often a kopfring - a metal ring, triangular in cross-section, designed to prevent ground penetration. In addition to the kopfring a dinort rod could be added to obtain pre-penetration detonation for anti-personnel use. The SD 70 was filled through the base and was fitted with a welded sheet steel tail cone with ribbed tail fins. The SD 70 could also be fitted with a parachute and a time fuze for an air-burst anti-personnel role. To accomplish this the tail unit was removed and a sheet metal cylinder long and in diameter was attached to the base of bomb. This cylinder contained a red lattice parachute square with four double shroud lines which attached to the base of the bomb. The SD 70 could be vertically or horizontally suspended in a bomb bay or horizontally mounted on a wing or fuselage hardpoint. The SD 70 was painted gray and the tail cone was striped with red.

His highest rank has been maegashira 14. After an amateur sumo career at the Kyushu Institute of Information Sciences, he turned professional in November 2008, reaching sekitori status in January 2013 upon promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division. He has been ranked in the top makuuchi division on five occasions. He was demoted to the makushita division in 2015, but won promotion back to j≈´ry≈ç in November 2015 and the top division in September 2019. He has one j≈´ry≈ç division championship. He wrestles for Tamanoi stable. Career He came to Japan at the age of 15, and attended Meitoku Gijuku High School, known for its strong sumo club. He joined the Kyushu Institute of Information Sciences but left in his third year when an opening became available at Tamanoi stable after the retirement of the Brazilian Takaazuma (sumo rules restrict foreigners to one per stable). The Japan Sumo Association had recently had issues with foreign wrestlers such as Hakurozan and Roho who had been dismissed from sumo after a cannabis scandal but Azumary≈´'s six years in Japan convinced the stable that he had the necessary experience of Japanese culture to be a success. Although he was accepted by the stable in November 2008, he was not able to make his debut on the dohyo until the following tournament in January 2009, because of Sumo Association rules requiring foreigners to have satisfied all their visa requirements and attend sumo education classes. He moved through the lower divisions quickly, but found the makushita division more difficult. Finally in November 2012 a 6‚Äì1 record at the top of makushita saw him promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division. He said upon his promotion that he hoped to emulate his hero Kai≈ç. In just his second tournament in the division he lost a play-off for the y≈´sh≈ç or championship to fellow Mongolian Kyokush≈´h≈ç after both finished with 12‚Äì3 records, and this performance earned him promotion to the top makuuchi division for the first time. A 6‚Äì9 record saw him demoted straight back to j≈´ry≈ç, but he returned to the top division after a 10‚Äì5 record in January 2014 at j≈´ry≈ç 3. In his second makuuchi tournament in March 2014 he was ranked at maegashira 14 (his highest rank to date) and stood at five wins and four losses after nine days, but finished with another 6‚Äì9 record. The retirement of Koto≈çsh≈´ after that tournament opened up an extra slot in makuuchi, but Sadanoumi, with 8‚Äì7 at j≈´ry≈ç 4, was given the extra rank of maegashira 17 over Azumary≈´ who again was demoted. He won promotion back to makuuchi for the July 2014 tournament, but injured his knee on the 14th day and had to withdraw, losing his scheduled 15th day bout by default. This was the first bout he had missed in his career. His 7‚Äì8 record was enough to keep him in makuuchi but his injury kept him out of the following tournament in September 2014, resulting in a fall to j≈´ry≈ç. Although he returned in November 2014 two more losing records saw him demoted to the unsalaried makushita division for the March 2015 tournament. In September 2015 he took part in an eight-way play-off for the makushita championship, and although he was defeated by Chiyosh≈çma in the semi-final stage his 6‚Äì1 record was good enough for a return to j≈´ry≈ç. He has remained in j≈´ry≈ç since then, and although he was consistent enough to avoid demotion he did not like winning promotion back to the top division until 2019, when a majority of wins at j≈´ry≈ç 1 saw him return to makuuchi after 30 tournaments away. This is the second longest gap between top division appearances after Satoyama's 37 tournaments. He managed only a 6‚Äì9 record in his makuuchi return and was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç, but an 11‚Äì4 record from the top rank of J≈´ry≈ç 1 East ensured his immediate return to the top division. He also won the j≈´ry≈ç division championship after a four-way playoff with Ikioi, Kaisei and Kiribayama, his first y≈´sh≈ç in any division. Fighting style Azumary≈´ prefers a migi yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip on his opponent's mawashi. His favourite kimarite or techniques are yori-kiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw).

Background  Irish Life and Permanent plc initiated two separate sets of proceedings against each of the appellants (Dunne and Dunphy) in the Circuit Court seeking orders of possession of mortgaged properties. The Circuit Court cases were decided without the Circuit Court hearing oral evidence and both decisions were appealed to the High Court. In separate High Court proceedings, Hogan J stated both cases for the opinion of the Supreme Court pursuant to s38(3) of the Courts of Justice Act 1936.Irish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [1.2], [2016] 1 IR 92 [4]. Section 38 of the Courts of Justice Act 1936 provides that an appeal lies to the High Court from every judgment or order of the Circuit Court in a civil matter, other than ‚Äújudgments and orders in respect of which other provision in relation to appeals is made‚Äù by the Courts of Justice Act 1936. S38(3) of the Courts of Justice Act 1936 goes on to provide that a judge ‚Äúhearing an appeal under this section‚Äù may refer any question of law arising during a hearing to the Supreme Court by way of case stated. In both cases, Hogan J queried whether the High Court had jurisdiction to state a case for consideration of the Supreme Court pursuant to s38(3) of the Courts of Justice Act 1936 in the course of an appeal from the Circuit Court where no oral evidence was given before the court.I rish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [2.4] and [3.7], [2016] 1 IR 92 [11] and [20]. In the Dunne case, Hogan J also queried whether the non-compliance by a lender with the Code would affect, as a matter of law, the lender's entitlement to obtain an order for possession and, if so, whether the court must refuse to make such an order in the event of any breach of the Code.Irish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [2.4], [2016] 1 IR 92 [11]. The Code requires lenders to follow a process with borrowers in (or in danger of falling into) arrears in order to try to address the mortgage arrears problems. As part of this process, the Code imposes a moratorium (that is, a temporary suspension) preventing lenders from bringing repossession proceedings until a certain period of time has elapsed. In the Dunphy case, Hogan J also queried whether the respondents had a vested right to possession in the property pursuant to s62(7) of the Registration of Title Act 1964 (and whether this right vested prior to 1 December 2009 when s62(7) of the Registration of Title Act 1964 was repealed) and in any event, whether the Supreme Court could grant possession to a mortgagee pursuant to a contractual agreement independent of statute.Irish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [3.7], [2016] 1 IR 92 [20].  Holding of the Supreme Court   Jurisdiction to state a case to the Supreme Court  Clarke J delivered the only written judgment for the Supreme Court (with which the other judges agreed). The Supreme Court held that notwithstanding the fact that a literal interpretation of s38(3) of the Courts of Justice Act 1936 suggested otherwise, it was proper to interpret the Courts of Justice Act 1936 as conferring a jurisdiction on a High Court judge to state a case to the Supreme Court in an appeal where no oral evidence was heard in the Circuit Court. Relying on s5 of the Interpretation Act 2005, Clarke J concluded that the Supreme Court could interpret legislation in a manner that is different from that which would derive from its literal construction where there could be no conceivable basis on which the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament) might have chosen to legislate in the manner that the literal construction would require and where the intention of the Oireachtas was clear from the relevant legislation taken as a whole.I rish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [4.17], [2016] 1 IR 92 [44].  Failing to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears  The Supreme Court also concluded that a court hearing an application for possession of mortgaged property by a lender should be satisfied that there was compliance by the lender with the moratorium on the commencement of repossession proceedings set out in the Code. The court must decline to make an order where there has been a failure to comply with this moratorium.Irish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [5.19], [2016] 1 IR 92 [64]. However, a failure by a lender to comply with other provisions of the Code would not, as a matter of law, affect that lender's entitlement to obtain an order for possession. While the Supreme Court concluded that it was a matter for the lender to establish compliance with the moratorium period imposed by the Code, Clarke J did note that an affirmation in an affidavit to the effect that the repossession proceedings were commenced outside of the moratorium period ought to be sufficient to establish compliance with the Code unless proven otherwise.Irish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [5.26], [2016] 1 IR 92 [71].  Possession pursuant to the Registration of Title Act 1964  Finally, the Supreme Court noted that where a court is asked to make an order for possession pursuant to s62(7) of the Registration of Title Act 1964, it must ask whether, as a matter of law, it can properly be said that the principal monies secured by the charge on registered land had become due.Irish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [6.6], [2016] 1 IR 92 [80]. To determine whether these monies had become due, the court must first refer to the terms of the contract between the lender and the borrower that address when the entire principal sum falls due. Where the principal monies owning has fallen due, a conditional agreement by a lender not to proceed to exercise the lender's entitlement to seek possession would have no effect on the pre- existing entitlement of the lender to the entire principal sum due in circumstances where the conditions specified in the agreement had clearly not been met.Irish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne [2015 IESC 46] [6.18], [2016] 1 IR 92 [92]. The Supreme Court concluded that with respect to the questions posed by Hogan J in the Dunphy case, the entire principal sum was due on 1 December 2009 and was vested as of that date.

It has been serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Young Magazine the 3rd since October 2015, and collected into eight tank≈çbon volumes as of April 2020. The manga has been licensed in North America by Kodansha Comics. An anime television series adaptation by Pine Jam aired from April to June 2020. Plot The story centers on Shuichi Kagaya, a high school student with an unusual secret. He has the ability to transform into a monster resembling a giant dog mascot costume with a zipper down his back and a large cartoonish smile. After rescuing a strange girl, Claire Aoki, from a warehouse fire, they join each other to search for Claire's older sister, who is assumed to be responsible for the death of their parents. Characters ; : :The teen male protagonist with the ability to transform into a dog-like mascot costume, complete with an oversized functioning revolver on his belt and a zipper up his spine which, when opened, allows others to climb inside his empty body, increasing the physical and mental abilities of both. When transformed Shuichi gains the physical abilities of a human at peak levels of fitness, strength and endurance, and when paired with a partner inside him his abilities become superhuman. He retains some of his abilities in his human form such as a sense of smell even keener than a dogs. His human appearance is downright average with the exception of a noticeable scar around his neck following an almost fatal fight against Claire's sister, Elena. ; : :The teen female protagonist. After witnessing her older sister, Elena, transform into a monster and murder their parents she fell into depression and attempted suicide when no one believed her. After Shuichi saved her from a suicide attempt she became obsessed with finding her sister and discovering the truth behind the creation of monsters. At first she was abusive towards Shuichi, viewing him as a tool and nothing more, but over time grew to care about him to the point she swore to kill herself should Shuichi die first so they can stay together always. Behind her cheerful, and often perverted, personality, Claire possesses a determination that allows her to kill without hesitation or remorse and close herself off from her emotions to an extent that Shuichi finds terrifying. Being a regular human, Claire is physically weak, but when she's inside Shuichi she gains full control of his body movements as well as receiving a massive boost to her physical capabilities, pushing them into superhuman levels. ; : :The older sister of Claire. After gaining the ability to transform into a large, ghost like monster she murdered her own parents, seemingly for the hypocritical manner in which they raised her and Claire with strict rules despite themselves being terrible people. She loves Claire dearly and may be the only person she is unwilling to harm. Emotionally unstable and psychotic even before becoming a monster she has, according to Shuichi after he scented her clothing, committed a staggering number of murders. Elena is revealed to have a crush on Shuichi and was the one who turned him into a monster so she could climb inside him and truly \\"become one\\" with him. The idea that anyone else might be inside him sends her into such a rage she was willing to tear Shuichi's head off to get to the person inside him, only stopping after realising it was Claire, and Shuichi only surviving due to some unknown ability of his monster form to keep him alive despite experiencing a normally fatal injury. ; : :A member of a highly advanced alien species with the ability to grant seemingly any wish in return for finding a golden coin which contains one of his fellow aliens. Should anyone locate 100 coins he has even offered to grant that person enough power to do almost anything, even destroy a planet should they wish, seemingly with no regard for how such a power may be abused. ; : :One of Shuichi's human friends. She is constantly cheerful, enough so that Shuichi once felt better about his terrible monster life just by having a normal conversation with her. It is suggested she has a crush on Shuichi as she was the only one to notice how depressed he was while everyone else just thought he looked cooler than he had before. ; : :One of Shuichi's human friends who once saved him from bullies. ; : :The first Gatherer encountered by Claire and Shuichi. Having found a coin she asked the Alien for increased speed so she could excel at sports but came to hate her new abilities after it transformed her arms and legs into monster limbs. Desperate to return to her normal human body she attempted to kill Claire and Shuichi for their coin only to die herself when Claire mercilessly shot her in the spine. ; : :A university student and the first monster to become allies with Claire and Shuichi. Having found a coin he asked the Alien to make him stronger than anyone else. Already a martial artist Sanbe created his own martial art style to utilise the strength of his monster body, but finding humans no longer challenged him he has decided to challenge himself against as many monsters as he can. After losing a fight to Claire and Shuichi's teamwork he decided Shuichi was a \\"real man\\" and swore to be their ally in finding more coins, even though he himself has no interest in the coins anymore as strength was his only desire. ; : :A young girl and member of Koyanagi's Gatherer group. An animal lover she asked the Alien for the ability to understand animals. In her monster form she remains mostly human, except for the fox ears that sprout on the side of her head, giving her the ability to hear how an animal is feeling. Preferring to keep her ears hidden she usually is seen wearing a motorcycle crash helmet covering her entire head and face. ; : :A young man and member of Koyanagi's Gatherer group. A notorious coward he is easily controlled and manipulated by others, especially those he is scared of. He is in love with Chihiro but is too afraid to tell her. His monster ability lets him transform his head into a surveillance camera which he uses to follow and record Chihiro. Any recording he makes he is also able to upload to computers or wirelessly to the internet. ; : :A very powerful Gatherer and a member of Elena's group. He despises being told what to do and enjoys killing people who try, except for Elena who is the only person he is willing to listen to. Rather than transform into a monster Subaru is able to summon and control two large monsters, a male on his left side and a female on his right that he calls his Parents. These parents are immensely strong and do all Subaru's fighting for him while Subaru is kept safe between the palms of the hands the Parents have instead of feet.

Monica Golding, more commonly known simply as State v. Golding, is a Connecticut Supreme Court case decided Dec 19, 1989. The case is precedential and resulted in the common law Golding-Evans review standard being established in Connecticut jurisprudence.  Parties and nature of trial court proceedings  Like most cases heard by the Connecticut Supreme Court, their venue of origin is the lower or trial court, in Connecticut called the Superior Court, then the Connecticut Appellate Court in Hartford, Connecticut, before possibly being certified for review by the Supreme Court of the State. The suspect, charged by the State with four courts burglary in the second degree, connivance to submit robbery in the second degree, general help misrepresentation and conspiracy to aid extortion. At the end of the state's case the preliminary court dismissed the two counts of conspiracy. The respondent was from that point indicted by a jury for burglary in the second degree and of general help extortion. The Superior Court condemned the respondent to simultaneous suspended sentences on the two counts, set her on post trial supervision on the two counts and requested states of probation that the litigant make compensation of the entirety of $877.90 and perform two hundred hours of community service. The defendant appealed the judgement and sentence to the Connecticut State Court of Appeals on the following grounds: Firstly, her rights not to be placed in jeopardy twice under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution were undermined and breached by trying her for violation of two separate statutes which constitute a single offense. Second, Public Acts 1984, No. 84-471, one of the statutes under which she was charged, was unconstitutionally vague. Thirdly, the court failed to give proper jury instructions regarding general assistance fraud, as the given instructions did not include essential elements of the crime. Fourthly, defendant claimed she was deprived of her right to a unanimous jury verdict. Finally, defendant claimed her Due Process Clause rights were violated by being ordered to pay restitution moneys as a condition of her probation. The essential argument being, one's freedom should not be at stake in the case they cannot afford to pay restitution. Nevertheless, after hearing oral argument, deliberating upon the briefs submitted, the Court of Appeals of the State of Connecticut upheld the lower court's decision.  Final appeal at the Connecticut Supreme Court  The defendant requested certification to have hear case heard in the Connecticut Supreme Court. The court agreed to hear the case, limiting the issues to whether the Appellate Court had erred when it refused to reverse the defendant's conviction of general assistance fraud because of the lack of jury instruction by the trial court concerning the amount involved in the fraud and whether the Appellate Court had erred by refusing to review the defendant's claim that under the federal and state constitutions the amount involved in the fraud was an essential element of the offense and was therefore required to be charged by the trial court. The defendant was seeking review by the Supreme Court of Connecticut under previous case: State v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Oral argument began in May of 1989. The Connecticut Supreme Court reversed the Appellate Court's decision.  Published opinion  Following is a slightly redacted final opinion of the Supreme Court of Connecticut with long fields of citing cases removed and replaced with '...': \\"We now reverse the Appellate Court on the merits and in this opinion adhere to Evans.\\"  I  Prior to July 1, 1984, the maximum penalty for general assistance fraud was a fine of $1000, imprisonment for one year, or both. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) 17-282. The penalty in the statute bore no relation to the amount fraudulently obtained. Effective July 1, 1984, however, the statute was amended by No. 84-471 of the 1984 Public Acts, to subject a person convicted of general assistance fraud to the penalties for larceny under General Statutes 53a-122 through 53a-125b. Those statutes grade the degree of the crime and the consequent severity of the penalties according to the amount obtained as a result of the defendant's illegal conduct. Those grades range from larceny in the first degree, a class B felony carrying a maximum possible penalty of twenty years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine, to larceny in the sixth degree, a class C misdemeanor carrying a maximum possible penalty of three months imprisonment and a fine of $250. Although No. 84-471 of the 1984 Public Acts was not effective until July 1, 1984, and some of the defendant's fraudulent conduct occurred prior to that date, apparently the trial court and certainly the parties and the Appellate Court treated the defendant's sentence as having been imposed under the amended statute. See State v. Allen, 12 Conn. App. 403, 406, 530 A.2d 670, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 809, 532 A.2d 76 (1987). The trial court in its charge, however, failed to inform the jury that it must find proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the amount the defendant obtained by fraud. See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). The trial court further did not request the jury to make a specific finding as to that amount. Under the circumstances revealed by the evidence, however, the jury could have determined that the defendant obtained varied amounts depending upon the conduct of the defendant the jury found proven to have been fraudulent. The first question to be addressed, therefore, is whether the amount obtained by the defendant is an essential element of the crime of general assistance fraud. The Appellate Court applied its Thurman test for Evans review and under the second prerequisite of that test found that the amount obtained by fraud was not an essential element of the crime. It, therefore, concluded that the trial court's failure to charge the jury concerning it was not constitutional error reviewable under Evans. See State v. Thurman, 10 Conn. App. 302, 306-307, 523 A.2d 891, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 805, 528 A.2d 1152 (1987). The overwhelming weight of authority is that the value of property stolen or obtained by fraud is an essential element of the crime when the value is used to differentiate between a felony and a misdemeanor or to determine the severity of the offense and the consequent punishment for a convicted offender. ... We conclude therefore that under the present statutory scheme embodied in 17-282 for determining the degree of the offense and the severity of the permissible punishment the amount obtained by general assistance fraud is an essential element of that crime. Because the amount the defendant obtained by fraud is an essential element of the crime under the applicable statutory scheme, the trial court was obligated to instruct the jury concerning it. ... Failure to do so was constitutional error; State v. Williamson, supra; and requires reversal because the jury reached its decision without any instruction on, or consideration of, an essential element of the crime charged.  II  Further, the Appellate Court erred by refusing to review the defendant's claim since she proffered a constitutional claim and the record was clearly adequate to review that claim. State v. Hill, 201 Conn. 505, 512-13, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986); State v. Kurvin, supra, 558. We have for many years held that claims not raised in the trial court \\"can and will be considered\\" on appeal in two \\"exceptional circumstances.\\" State v. Evans, supra, 70. One of those circumstances \\"may arise where the record adequately supports a claim that a litigant has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial.\\" (Emphasis added.) Id. The other exceptional circumstance is \\"where a new constitutional right not readily foreseeable has arisen between the time of trial and appeal.\\" State v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). That circumstance is not at issue in this case. The state urges us to revise the Evans standard of review for errors not preserved at trial because the words used by the standard though easily said lend themselves to inconsistent application. We have reviewed our own cases and those of the Appellate Court, and we agree with the state that they demonstrate disparate approaches to the Evans criteria. Upon reflection, we have decided neither to adopt a pure plain error standard for alleged constitutional violations, nor to attempt to reconcile past Evans decisions. Instead, we articulate guidelines designed to facilitate a less burdensome, more uniform application of the present Evans standard in future cases involving alleged constitutional violations that are raised for the first time on appeal. Relying on the methodology of State v. Whistnant, 179 Conn. 576, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), we hold that a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant's claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant's claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances. A review of our cases reveals that the words \\"adequately supports\\" in State v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), may be translated to read \\"is adequate to review.\\" See, e.g., State v. Mercer, 208 Conn. 52, 57, 544 A.2d 611 (1988); State v. Torrence, 196 Conn. 430, 435, 493 A.2d 865 (1985). The defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error. If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant's claim. ... An adequate factual record is especially crucial when dealing with a claim that was not preserved at trial, since consideration is being sought for review of a claim for which we lack a trial court ruling. The defendant also bears the responsibility of demonstrating that his claim is indeed a violation of a fundamental constitutional right. Patently nonconstitutional claims that are unpreserved at trial do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear a constitutional label. ... Finally, if we are persuaded that the merits of the defendant's claim should be addressed, we will review it and arrive at a conclusion as to whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and whether it clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial. State v. Torrence, 196 Conn. 430, 435, 493 A.2d 865 (1985); State v. Evans, supra, 71-73. In the present case, for example, it was clear constitutional error for the trial court to fail to instruct the jury concerning an essential element of the crime with which the defendant was charged, and the defendant was therefore clearly deprived of a fair trial. In many cases of an alleged constitutional violation, however, the state is able to demonstrate the harmlessness of such alleged violation beyond a reasonable doubt. ... Under such circumstances, it would be a waste of judicial resources, and a pedantic exercise, to delve deeply into the constitutional merits of a claim that can appropriately be resolved in accordance with the relevant harmless error analysis. For example, in a case where, on the whole record, there is overwhelming evidence of guilt and a constitutional claim is raised under Evans concerning the admission of inconsequential tangible evidence that was allegedly illegally seized, there is no reason that we cannot assume the constitutional violation and first address the fair trial issue and, if the alleged violation is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, not engage in all in- depth discussion of the substantive constitutional claim. Such an approach would be in keeping with the spirit of what the United States Supreme Court said in United States v. Hasting, supra, 509: \\"Since [Chapman v. California, supra,] the Court has consistently made clear that it is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore errors that are harmless, including most constitutional violations, see, e.g., [Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223, 230-32, 93 S.Ct. 1565, 36 L.Ed.2d 208 (1973)]; Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, [ 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284] (1969); Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U.S. 371, [92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1] (1972). The goal . . . is 'to conserve judicial resources by enabling appellate courts to cleanse the judicial process of prejudicial error without becoming mired in harmless error.'\\"  Golding-Evans review  Judicial review standards are often established under common law because of stare decisis. The Golding-Evans review was established by this case. The review states: Unpreserved claims of constitutional error may be reviewed when they allege the violation of a fundamental right. State v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); State v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). The issue often depends on whether the asserted error has been deemed by the appellate courts to be of constitutional magnitude. Note, that evidentiary errors are not constitutional errors [see, e.g., State v. Toccaline, 258 Conn. 542, 550, 783 A.2d 450 (2001); State v. Dearing, 133 Conn.App. 332, 343-45, 34 A.3d 1031, cert. denied, 304 Conn. 913, 40 A.3d 319 (2012); State v.

Excerta parasitologica en memoria del Dr.Eduardo Caballero y Cabellero., 4, 69-78. Description Pseudaxine indicana has the general morphology of all species of Pseudaxine, with an elongate body tapering anteriorly and broad posteriorly, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is fan-shaped and asymmetrical, inclined to the body but separated from it by a notch, and bears 19 clamps, arranged in a single row. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. The extreme of the haptor carries an elongated proboscis-like process called \\"the terminal lapet\\", bearing in the middle of its length a pair of hooks. There are also two oval buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal mouth, an oval pharynx, an oesophagus and a posterior intestine that bifurcates in two lateral branches provided with many lateral branches ramifying especially on the outer side, the branches are not contiguous posteriorly and extend to near the posterior end of the haptor. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium, armed with 24 hooks, a single vagina, an elongate cylindrical ovary and 40 small follicular testespost-ovarian, lying irregularly in the inter- crural field anteriorly in two rows and posteriorly in three rows in posterior half of body proper. Few testes extend into the haptor. Eggs with long filaments at both ends. Etymology The species name refers to India, the type-locality of the species. Hosts and localities Acanthopagrus berda is the type host of Pseudaxine indicana The type-host is the black sea-bream Acanthopagrus berda) (Sparidae). The type-locality is off India.

He was a member of the Vi·ªát C·ªông and first joined Vietnamese resistance movements in 1951 when he was 12. Le Quan Cong was primarily fighting in the Mekong Delta from 1960 to 1975. After South Vietnam's president Ngo Dinh Diem incarcerated tens of thousands of citizens and executed hundreds in an anticommunist campaign, Le Quan Cong was one of the Viet Cong who took up arms against Diem's government. Cong stated that he and other villagers used machetes early in the fighting when they did not have access to guns. Cong was present at the hamlet of Ap Bac, near the village of Tan Thoi, when it was attacked in 1963, in what became known as the Battle of Ap Bac. Along with other Viet Cong, Cong had prepared trenches and bunkers so that the guerillas could take cover from American and South Vietnamese fire. Cong and fellow soldiers were able to destroy a series of American helicopters sent as reinforcements to the village. Cong stated that the Viet Cong viewed the battle as a major victory and inspired other Viet Cong guerillas across Vietnam. Cong became a Viet Cong platoon commander, and survived the Tet Offensive assault on Saigon. Interviewed by filmmaker Ken Burns for the TV series The Vietnam War, Cong said that three of his brothers and a sister were all killed by American or South Vietnamese forces during the war. Cong said that civilians were much more likely to be killed by American forces in helicopters than Viet Cong, since civilians ran at the sight of helicopters and were therefore easily seen and gunned down. By contrast he stated that Viet Cong forces were more likely to maintain their positions in these contexts.

History  The second most used category of bombs was the SD series which were high-explosive bombs but with thicker casings which meant their charge to weight ratio was only 30 to 40% of their total weight. At first glance, they were difficult to distinguish from the SC series of bombs, but the two series were color-coded the SC series having yellow tail stripes, while the SD series had red tail stripes. Bombs in this series were the SD 1, SD 1 FRZ, SD 2, SD 10 A, SD 10 FRZ, SD 10 C, SD 15, SD 50, SD 70, SD 250, SD 500, SD 1400, and SD 1700. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The SD series was used primarily in two roles that were determined by the type of fuze and accessories fitted to the bomb. The first was as a fragmentation bomb with instantaneous fuze and when the bombs exploded above ground the case created large fragments which would kill enemy personnel and destroy unarmored vehicles. The second role was as a general- purpose or armor-piercing role. In this role, the bombs were fitted with a time delay fuze which detonated the bomb after it had pierced a target destroying it with a combination of its blast and fragments.  Design  The body of the SD 250 was of three-piece welded construction with a nose piece, center section, and tail sections. The tail cone was of sheet steel construction with four braced tail fins. The SD 250 had a transverse fuze pocket in the nose section, a dummy fuze pocket near the tail, and there was a central exploder tube which ran through 2/3 of the Amatol or TNT filling. The SD 250 was filled through the base and was fitted with a welded sheet steel tail cone with ribbed tail fins. A dinort rod could be added to obtain pre- penetration detonation for anti-personnel use. The SD 250 could also be fitted with a Hohlladung shaped charge that could be added to the nose of the bomb to increase its armor piercing capabilities. This attachment weighed and was detonated by its own nose fuze. To prevent damage to the bomb a cap made from cement and sawdust separated the explosive charge from the nose of the bomb. When fitted with this attachment the bomb used a delay fuze to explode the bomb after it had penetrated the target. The SD 250 could be vertically or horizontally suspended in a bomb bay or horizontally mounted on a wing or fuselage hardpoint. The SD 250 was painted dark green, sky blue, or aluminum. The tail cone was striped with red and blue. See also * List of weapons of military aircraft of Germany during World War II  Gallery  File:DinortRods.jpg|Dinort rods.

He was 5-foot-9 as a freshman but grew to 6-5 by the end of his sophomore year. Davis played on the junior varsity basketball until his junior year and did not see significant playing time until his senior season, when he averaged 9.1 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. After receiving interest from only one Division I basketball program, Davis opted to complete a fifth year at the New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire. College career Davis played four seasons for the Anteaters and was the team's starting power forward for his final three. As a freshman, Davis set the school record for blocks in a season with 55. He was named the Big West Conference Defensive Player of the Year as a sophomore and broke his previous school record and led the conference with 88 blocked shots. As a senior, Davis was named first team All-Big West and led the team with 12.9 points and 7.1 rebounds per game.

He is founder and president of the international asset management firm Elevated Returns, which controls the Aspen St. Regis Resort in Aspen, Colorado and other commercial properties in the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. He is also the founder and owner of Chefs Club, a restaurant group that features a rotating residency of chefs from around the world at its three locations in Aspen and New York City. De Baets is a pioneer in blockchain-based real estate investing. Through his firm Elevated Returns, he facilitated the first major commercial real estate transaction using blockchain technology to sell ownership stakes in the Aspen St. Regis Resort. He was also formerly part-owner of OptAsia Capital, a Bangkok-based investment firm founded in 2008, until he divested in 2018.  Background  De Baets was born and raised in Belgium. He holds a bachelor's degree in business management and a master's degree in management sciences, finance and marketing from the Solvay Business School of Management at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles. He began his career in Europe as an auditor with the European Community and spent many years as an investment banker based in Bangkok, Thailand.  Business   Elevated Returns  De Baets is the founder and president of Elevated Returns, a hospitality-centric asset management company based in New York City. The firm's portfolio of Class A real estate investment assets, which include properties in the United States, Southeast Asia and Europe, are collectively valued at more than US$1 billion. The firm is a pioneer in digitizing traditional financial assets using blockchain-based technology. In 2018, Elevated Returns launched the first major digital tokenization of a commercial real estate asset with the St. Regis Aspen Resort. In February 2019, Elevated Returns announced plans to digitize its entire portfolio of real estate assets using the blockchain technology Tezos. The digital offerings will be made available to accredited investors on the Securitize platform.  Aspen St. Regis Resort  De Baets is a majority controller of the Aspen St. Regis Resort in Aspen, Colorado, through the single-asset trust Aspen Digital Inc., which operates as a subsidiary of Elevated Returns. He purchased the property through Elevated Returns in 2010. The resort is located at the base of Aspen Mountain. In 2018, it was announced that Aspen St. Regis would serve as the backing asset for a digital tokenization offering allowing accredited investors to take minority ownership stakes in the property through a blockchain-based technology. The offering was the first major digital tokenization of a commercial real estate asset. To facilitate the digital tokenization of the Aspen St. Regis Resort, De Baets established Aspen Digital Token, also known as AspenCoin, in 2018. This venture used the blockchain technology Ethereum to sell 18 million digital securitized tokens representing ownership stakes in the Aspen St. Regis Resort. Each of the 18 million tokens were valued at $1, together representing an 18.9 percent ownership stake in the Aspen St. Regis. Elevated Returns maintained control of the other 81.9 percent. The sale of the tokens was administered on the digital asset platform Templum Markets. Aspen Digital Token later migrated to the Securitize platform and was to start trading in October 2019 in multiple exchanges. The tokens effectively operate as shares in the property. De Baets has stated that the tokenization strategy allows for \\"the democratization of the investing process\\" by removing middlemen. Because it is based on blockchain technology, computers are able to independently verify ledgers and other transaction records associated with the sale of the tokens, which removes layers of intermediaries that would otherwise be paid in a transaction. The blockchain-based offering has also been heralded as a blueprint for future real estate transactions, as it holds the potential to reduce financial reliance on authoritative institutions like banks, courts or governments to referee transactions and property ownership. The Aspen St. Regis was the subject of a controversy regarding its cancellation policy. It received extensive publicity when it imposed a $2,000 charge on a points reservation for a guest whose arrival was delayed because of weather. Stories posted by travel bloggers with millions of followers reported that the Aspen St. Regis had not disclosed these fees at the time the reservation was made.  Chefs Club  In 2012, De Baets launched the restaurant group Chefs Club inside the St. Regis Resort in Aspen, Colo. Chefs Club launched a second location in New York City in 2014, followed by a fast-casual location called Chefs Club Counter in 2017. The group has been called an innovator in the industry. At first, Chefs Club featured full nightly menus from a rotating cast of nearly 200 prominent chefs from around the world. In 2017, the restaurant group transitioned from its nightly menu and visiting chef format to a residency program, in which a different chef assumes complete creative control of the space and menu at one of its three locations for months at a time. The restaurant has been called \\"a showcase for culinary stars\\" and has been named to Time Magazine's list of 100 Best Restaurants. Visiting chefs have included Zaiyu Hasegawa, Alain Ducasse, Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park, Alvin Cailin of Eggslut, Matthew Lightner of Atera, Jonathon Sawyer of the Greenhouse Tavern and Noodlecat, Bao La of Le Gar√ßon Saigon, Kevin Willmann of Farmhaus, Jenn Louis of Lincoln and Sunshine Tavern, Mathieu Pacaud of L'Ambroisie, Cyril Lignac of Le Quinzi√®me, JJ Johnson of Minton's, Jeremiah Langhorne of The Dabney, Sota Atsumi of Clown Bar, Georges Mendes, Emeril Lagasse, Marcus Samuelsson, Jacques P√©pin, Matthew Accarrino, and many more. De Baets has stated his desire to turn the Chefs Club concept into a global enterprise. A fourth location has opened in Taipei, Taiwan.  Personal life  De Baets is married to hospitality executive Sabrina Huls. They live in New York City and have four children. De Baets speaks French, English, Dutch and Thai.

She is best known for her work with Emma Goldman and Samuel Gompers. Lang advocated for many political prisoners who had been charged under Wartime Emergency Laws. She was also a Zionist who helped raise money for settlements for Jewish refugees. Lang wrote about her life in an autobiography, Tomorrow is Beautiful (1948).  Biography  Lang was born on March 30, 1884 in Kiev, Russia and grew up in Korostyshev. Lang's paternal grandfather was a rabbi in Kiev and was known as Reb Chiam the Hospitable. Lang's father went to America ahead of the family. The family moved to the United States when Lang was nine and they lived for a short time in the Lower East Side of New York City before settling in Chicago. She began to work in a cigar factory, where she was a good enough worker to make $20 a week. She also helped take care of her four younger siblings after work. Lang learned English at night school. She was also invited to start attending an anarchist study group. Lang also attended programs at Hull House and Jane Addams was a big influence on her life. Addams even asked her to work as an assistant dance instructor for Hull House. When she was 16, she married Bob Robins and the couple set up their marriage as a \\"limited contract that either party could renew or break.\\" The couple moved to New York City, partly because Lang's family strongly disapproved of the marriage. She and her husband met Emma Goldman in 1905 and both were involved in helping create the Free Speech League. The couple would also follow Goldman to California, where they lived in an anarchist commune. They also opened a vegetarian restaurant. Lang and her husband briefly separated, still viewing their marriage as a limited contract. The separation was considered \\"scandalous\\" and there was gossip printed about them in the newspapers in San Francisco. They stayed married for twenty years after their short separation. Lang also designed and used an \\"auto-house\\" which combined a portable printing press with a house trailer. Lang and her husband would travel the United States using the auto-house and complete printing jobs wherever they stopped. Lang, who was \\"mechanically inclined,\\" drove the vehicle, which they called the Adventurer. In 1916, Lang was involved in working on Tom Mooney's case to support his innocence. She was very involved in his defense case and used her connections with the Chicago labor movement to build political clout to secure Mooney's freedom. Lang and others created a labor defense committee to petition New York's Governor Charles Seymour Whitman in order to stop the extradition of Alexander Berkman. It was believed that Berkman would not get a fair trial if he was extradited to San Francisco. In the end, the efforts of Lang and more than 200 labor leaders who helped petition Governor Whitman ensured that Berkman was not extradited. Goldman later asked Lang and another friend, Eleanor Fitzgerald, to organize a campaign for general amnesty for those who were convicted under Wartime Emergency Laws. Goldman herself was about to be imprisoned for a violation of the Selective Service Act of 1917. Together, Lang and Fitzgerald founded the League for Amnesty for Political Prisoners. Lang would eventually start working for amnesty for political prisoners through the American Federation of Labor (AFL). In 1919, Lang approached Samuel Gompers to encourage him to support amnesty. During their work, she and Gompers became friends. The first time the national convention of the AFL tried to pass an amnesty resolution, it failed. Lang asked a socialist lawyer, Morris Hillquit, to help her create a new resolution. By 1920, the AFL, through Lang's efforts, endorsed an amnesty resolution for political prisoners. The AFL's endorsement was a \\"major lift\\" for the amnesty movement. Lang differentiated her amnesty campaigns from other contemporary ones, by calling hers \\"constructive\\" as opposed to the others, which she considered \\"radical.\\" She also believed that other campaigns for amnesty existed more to raise money than to provide actual aid. Lang ensured that her campaigns were funded by unions, not individual laborers. Lang worked as a mediator between the labor unions and Washington, D.C. officials. Her position at AFL was executive secretary of the amnesty committee. In 1921, Lang focused her energy on amnesty for Eugene Debs. Lang and her husband began to have differences over her work for AFL and split up in the mid-1920s. On behalf of the AFL, Lang investigated working conditions for laborers in the South. She was also involved in helping during the 1927 Mine Workers Strike. Lang married Harry Lang, who was editor of the Jewish Daily Forward. The couple visited Europe, the Soviet Union and the Middle East all between 1928 and 1937. Lang became interested in Zionism and became the head of a group which raised funds to establish Kfar Blum, a kibbutz where German and Austrian refugees could safely emigrate. Lang and her husband settled for a while in Croton, New York in the mid-1940s, where Lang worked on her autobiography. They moved to Los Angeles later on and eventually lived in Beverly Hills. Lang died at Mt. Sinai hospital on January 25, 1962.  Tomorrow is Beautiful  Lang's autobiography, Tomorrow is Beautiful (1948), tells her life story and also describes a history of the Jewish labor movement in the United States in early half of the twentieth century.

Her work is exhibited in South Africa, Europe and the United States, and part of local and international collections, including Museum of Modern Art or the Newark Museum and is referenced in numerous academic papers, theses journal and book publications. Work Marasela's work explores the experiences of black South African women across a range of media, including photography, video, prints, and mixed-medium installations involving textiles and embroidery. In her work, she translates memories of struggle and urbanization through the use of material culture and narratives, such as the use of the colour red which refers to cultural memories around the time of the \\"Red Dust\\" which refers to a period of drought in the early 1930s in South Africa. Her performances interweave these elements and multi-media works, making visible the dimension of the everyday through objects and clothes. She is known for her six-year performance work Ijermani Lam which \\"materialises the condition of waiting\\" by wearing the same red dress every day from the 1st of October 2013 to the 1st of October 2019. The original dresses were part of the group the exhibition \\"Made Visible. Contemporary South African Fashion and Identity\\" at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (February‚ÄìMay 2019). Her work taps into cultural memories using printing archival materials such as newspapers and photographs on colonial textiles. It tells stories of black women in South Africa, such as Sarah Baartman or her mother Theodorah Mpofukazi Marasela through series such as Covering Sarah Baartman (2011), Sarah, Senzeni and Theodorah come to Joburg (2011), Theodorah, (2005), Waiting for Gebane (2017), Izithombe Zendawo Esizithandayo (2017) and builds an \\"intimate archive\\", giving voice to experiences of Black women.  Early career  Senzeni Marasela went to St Dominic's School for Girls in Boksburg where she matriculated in 1994. Her mother's collection of doilies and Victorian lace works which were handed down in her family over generations influenced her artistic practice. During a one- day trip in 1992 to the University of the Witwatersrand she decided to enroll there. She developed her multimedia and performative practice at the Wits School of Arts where she graduated in 1998.  Career  Marasela's work is regularly shown since the Martienssen Prize Exhibition in 1997. She was taken up by the Goodman Gallery after being part of the group exhibition Not Quite a Christmas Exhibition. She had a first solo exhibition at the Iziko South African National Gallery's Fresh exhibition series in 2000 which was part of a residency programme. In 2003, she started a long-term performance entitled Theodorah comes to Johannesburg in which is based on stories her mother told about her 11-hour travel from Mvenyane to Johannesburg.(ref) In 2011 Marasela decided to work as a full-time artist and was part of the Johannesburg Pavilion at 56th Venice Biennale in 2015.

Early life and education  Mate Kole was born in January 1910 to Nene Sir Emmanuel Mate Kole who ruled the Manya Krobo Traditional Area between 1892 and 1939.Daniel Miles McFarland, Historical Dictionary of Ghana, Scarecrow Press, 1995, p. 120.Roger Gocking, The History of Ghana, Greenwood Press, 2005, p. 54. He attended Basel Mission/Presbyterian primary and middle schools. He then went to Achimota College near Accra for his secondary education. From there, he went to the United Kingdom and enrolled in the Police College, passing out at a record rank of Corporal, three years before his enthronement as chief in 1936. After his education, he enlisted in the Gold Coast Police Force and quickly rose through the ranks to attain the position of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP).  Chieftaincy and socioeconomic initiatives  Mate Kole was enstooled Konor of Manya Krobo on 22 June 1939 at the age of twenty-nine to succeed his late father who had just passed away. Mate Kole was then a police officer stationed at Mampong Akwapim. As chief, Mate Kole played a leading role in the socioeconomic development of the Manya Krobo Traditional Area. As chieftain, he was instrumental in the establishment of Manya Krobo Secondary School (MAKROSEC) as replacement of the Presbyterian Boys‚Äô Secondary School (PRESEC) which had been relocated in 1968 from Odumase-Krobo to its current Legon campus at Accra. As a member of the Government's Central Advisory Committee on Education, he operationalized its recommendations which led to the establishment of fifteen Akro State Schools in several villages in Kroboland. He was aided by R. P Djabanor. The Akro State Schools later became the Asesewa Senior High School in the Upper Manya Krobo District and the Akro Senior High School in Odumase Lower Manya Krobo Municipality. The other schools in the Akro State system were absorbed into the public system as government-assisted institutions. As a progressive chief, he also championed girl-child education in 1950s and 1960s when there were huge disparities in female enrollment in schools due to cultural factors. He also established a state scholarship scheme for students from the Manya Krobo district. As an advocate of formal education and communal self-help, he organised the administrative state machinery and established the stool treasury which became the revenue collection system for Manya Krobo. Within three years, it was recorded revenues had increased threefold. With increased revenue, the traditional state set up and ran its own transport services. More than twenty- five wells were dug at multiple locations in the town. This foresight helped town avert a crisis during an acute water shortage in 1947. Manya Krobo became a notable agricultural centre during Mate Kole's reign. He spearheaded the construction of bridges and feeder roads to link surrounding farming, production and principal market centres such as Abuachau, Akateng, Akotue, Asesewa, Ehiamekyene, Osonson, Sekesua, Sisiamang, Sutapong. His efforts led to an appreciable increase in revenue from market tolls, farm size, tonnage of food crops assembled at the market centres. He enlisted the Army Field Engineers of the Gold Coast to construct bridges across the Akrum River at Abuachau and Mlegedu. The project, which cost ¬£9,500, was paid from the Manya Krobo state treasury. In conjunction with the Office of the District Commissioner at Akuse, James Moxon, Mate Kole organised an Agricultural Show at Laasi, Odumase-Krobo in 1947. The expo was the biggest provincial show in that period and was attended by the Governor of the Gold Coast, Sir Alan Burns together with merchants, manufacturers, indigenous and foreign farmers. In 1976, Nene Azzu Mate Kole II visited Gerlingen in Germany, the hometown of Johannes Zimmermann (1825 ‚Äì1876), a philologist, linguist and Basel Missionary who translated the Bible into the Ga language and published a grammar book. Zimmerman had lived in Odumase Krobo during his sojourn in colonial Ghana in the mid-nineteenth century.  Role in national development  He was appointed a member of the government's Central Advisory Committee on Education (1946‚Äì1951) and released stool lands for the establishment of the Mount Mary Training College and the University of Ghana's Agricultural Research Station at Kpong. From 1947 to 1954, he served on the Legislative Council which later evolved into the National Assembly under the provisions in the Electoral College which gave representation to the Provincial Council of Chiefs. In 1948, he was part of the Gold Coast delegation to Lancaster House in London which made a case to the British government for self-government. Other national committee he served on include: Blackhall Committee on Native Courts; the West African Institute of Science and Industry (1942‚Äì1945); University College of Ghana Council (1958‚Äì1960); the Wartime Economic Committee of the Gold Coast and management board member of the West African Cocoa Research Institute. He was the President of the Eastern Provincial Council of Chiefs (1947); Deputy Chairman of the Chieftaincy Secretariat (1966); Chairman of the National Advisory Committee (1968). He had three stints as the chairman of the board of Governors of his alma mater, Achimota School. Additionally, he was a key member in all the constitution drafting and approving bodies between 1949 and 1973. He was a member of the Coussey Committee on Constitutional Reforms. In 1969, he was the Deputy Speaker of the Blay Constituent Assembly which discussed and drafted the National Constitution of the Second Republic. In this role, he lobbied for the establishment of the National House of Chiefs as the mouth piece for traditional rulers in Ghana. He was involved with the ideation, planning and execution of the Volta River Project which led to the building of the Akosombo Dam. Mate Kole was the first paramount chief appointed to first Board of Trustees of the Volta River Authority under the chairmanship of Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, serving on the board for ten years. Years earlier in 1954, he played a role in the building of the Kpong Water Works that provided water treatment plants for the residents of Manya Krobo. Mate Kole was instrumental in the establishment of the Ghana Cocoa Board. Specifically, he chaired the Joint Provincial Council of Chiefs Committee that looked at problems facing the Gold Coast cocoa industry, culminating in the publication of Mate Kole Report, the passage of the Cocoa Marketing Board Ordinance in 1947 and finally the establishment of the current Cocoa Marketing Board.  Personal life  Nene Azzu Mate Kole II was a member of the District Grand Lodge of Ghana under the United Grand Lodge of England.  Honours and awards  In recognition of his contributions to the development of his hometown, Manya Krobo and the country, Mate Kole was accorded with several honours including the King's Medal for Chiefs (KMC) in 1942; Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1948; the Order of the Volta (OV) in 1969; Doctor of Law (LLD honoris causa), University of Ghana in 1975. In 1989, during the golden jubilee anniversary of his enthronement, the Manya Krobo state honoured him with highest traditional title of the land, \\"Oklemekuku\\", meaning \\"a great leader and an ancient fellow,\\" in appreciation of his contributions to the socioeconomic development of Manya Krobo in areas relating to education, agriculture, water and sanitation, road works and transport.  Death and legacy  Nene Azzu Mate Kole II died on 15 March 1990 of natural causes, not long after the golden jubilee celebrations of his enthronement as chieftain of Manya Krobo (1939‚Äì1989). In accordance with his native traditions, his funeral ceremony was held in 1992, which was attended by several Ghanaian dignitaries. On the silver jubilee of his death, a lecture on girl-child education was held in his memory at the Odumase Presbyterian Church at Odumase-Krobo. The lecture, chaired by the reigning monarch, Nene Sakite II, Konor of Manya Krobo was on the topic, \\"Oklemekuku Azzu Mate Kole: A great king and a statesman‚Äù.

History  The award was established in 1975. Recipients must be at least fifty-five years old and there may not be any more than nine living recipients alive at a given time. Nominations come from a member of the city commission, which are then presented to the city manager. Whenever a recipient of the award dies, flags in the city are flown at half-staff.  Recipients  In February 2018, Carl Halbirt became the twentieth and most recent recipient of the award. Halbirt spent twenty-seven years as the St. Augustine's city archaeologist. With the city he conducted more than 800 archaeological digs as part of St. Augustine's Archaeological Preservation Ordinance.ARCHAEOLOGY ORDINANCE Halbirt helped to give archaeology in the city more publicity. He was recognized by the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation and the Florida Anthropological Society for distinguished work. In 2015, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation made Halbirt a Preservation America Steward. In 2013, Dr. Robert B. Hayling became the first African American recipient of the Order of La Florida. Dr. Hayling had also received the city's other prestigious award, the de Avil√©s Award. Dr. Hayling was a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force and then opened up an integrated dentistry practice in St. Augustine in 1960. He was head of the St. Augustine chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference for almost a year and advised the local NAACP youth council. On the eve of the city's 400th anniversary celebrations, Dr. Hayling and Dr. Martin Luther King were among those who fought for civil rights in St. Augustine.

In 1869 Harris was the only women with her husband's regiment, near Peshawar (modern Pakistan), during a cholera outbreak. The regiment was split in two in order to control the infection. Three months later about one-third of the soldiers in Harris's half of the regiment had died of cholera. Harris describes nursing the sick, a confrontation with local tribesmen, and the organization of extensive morale- boosting activities. At the time, a Victoria Cross could be awarded for bravery behind the lines. However, women were not eligible. The officers of the regiment awarded her a gold replica VC with the permission of the Queen; its inscription read: > Presented to Mrs Webber Harris by the officers of the 104th Bengal > Fusiliers, for her indomitable pluck, during the cholera epidemic of 1869. The award was presented by General Sir Sam Browne, then the commander of the Peshawar garrison. No formal citation was given with the award, as is customary for a VC.  Later life  Harris died in 1917 in London and her ashes were interred at St Mark, Ampfield, Hampshire. In 1920 a Royal Warrant allowed for women serving in the Armed Forces to be formally awarded the VC. However, as of February 2019, no woman has been awarded an official VC other than Harris.

During the postwar decade, as the division of Germany seemed to have become permanent, millions of people fled from East Germany to West Germany. More unusually, Herbert Cr√ºger was one of those who, having ended up in \\"the west\\", crossed the internal frontier in the other direction, probably, at least in part, because his communist politics made it hard for him to obtain suitable employment in the west. In the east, he became a university lecturer and author. In 1958, he fell foul of a political purge and spent some years in the vast Bautzen penitentiary. He was released in 1961 but had to wait till 1990 for his formal rehabilitation. Biography Herbert Cr√ºger was born in Berlin-Rixdorf. His father worked as a book printer, but died on September 1914 after an intestinal operation. His mother, widowed with three boys aged three, six and seven, always blamed the sloppiness of the nurses for her husband's relatively early death. The outbreak of war a couple of months earlier was already placing increased pressure on medical services. Herbert was the three-year-old boy. The boys' mother came from a peasant family that before the mass urbanization of the late nineteenth century had been settled for many generations in Sadenbeck (Prignitz). By the time the war ended Herbert Cr√ºger was seven. It was around this time that a doctor pronounced him anemic, after which he was fed every day with a fresh raw egg garnished with sugar. Food was desperately short supply at this time, but the family already kept several hens in their Berlin apartment, which was less remarkable at that time than it would become subsequently. He attended school locally. Because of their financial situation, there were no school fees to pay; but his brothers had left school as soon as allowed in order to contribute to the family's budget. Herbert was impatient to do the same. When he left school he was still too young to join the navy, so he joined the merchant navy as a ship's boy (\\"Schiffsjunge\\") after his Uncle Adolf and Aunt Anna had helped him convince his mother to let him go. But in October 1927 he turned up at the home of two cousins in Hamburg, clutching a small suitcase containing a couple of shirts and underwear. Uncle Friedrich, his Hamburg relative, knew a \\"Heuerbaas\\" (maritime jobs agent), a small man with a beard who spoke no German but only the Hamburg dialect. Back on dry land, between 1928 and 1931 Cr√ºger undertook, and completed, a commercial apprenticeship with \\"Deutsche Fiat Automobil Verkauf s-A.-G.\\", a major car dealership. The period was one of widespread economic depression, however, and for Cr√ºger the apprenticeship was followed by unemployment. By 1931 he was a member of the Hitler Youth. Cr√ºger was an admirer of Otto Strasser, a senior National Socialist Party member long regarded as the leading figure on the party's anti-capitalist social-revolutionary left-wing. Although it is hard to avoid the suspicion that Herbert Cr√ºger's own autobiography, published in 1997 with the benefit of more than half a century of hindsight, may have been a little selective in its recall of the long-running struggle between the Strasser faction and the hate-driven Hitlerite faction of the Berlin-Neuk√∂lln Hitler Youth group, it is beyond dispute that shortly after Otto Strasser's forced resignation from the National Socialist Party, and after failing to create a breakaway Strasserite faction of it, Herbert Cr√ºger, resigned with like-minded friends from the Hitler Youth group. In 1932 he joined the Young Communists. Almost immediately, he joined the Rote Jungfront, which was the youth section of what amounted to the paramilitary wing of the Communist Party. During 1932/33 he worked as a \\"technical\\" (i.e. military) leader with the Red Front Fighters (\\"Roter Frontk√§mpferbund\\" / \\"Rote Jungfront\\") for the organisation's Berlin-Neuk√∂lln sub-district. For a couple of months during the summer in 1933 he left Berlin to stay on a farm and work with the Landvolkbewegung (loosely \\"National Peasants' and Farmers' movement\\") in East Prussia. At the start of that year the National Socialists had taken power and almost immediately transformed Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Non-Nazi political activism was banned. The Landvolkbewegung had many of the characteristics of a political party and Cr√ºger's involvement with it was illegal. Although the Sturmabteilung (SA) is largely remembered as a paramilitary branch of the National Socialist Party it was, especially before 1934 strongly influenced by communist ideology. Not all the young people who had been enthusiastic backers of Otto Strasser had left the movement when Strasser was expelled from the National Socialist Party. This gave rise to the use of the term \\"Beefsteak Nazis\\" (brown - Nazi - on the outside but red - Communist - in the inside). Contemporary estimates varied widely, but it is likely that during the early 1930s at least 20% of the SA membership comprised these so-called \\"Beefsteak Nazis\\". That provides context for the reference in sources to Cr√ºger having worked inside the SA for the \\"M-Apparat\\", a shadowy organisation which operated as an intelligence service on behalf of the (after 1933 illegal) Communist Party. Elsewhere there are indications that his role was involved more with proselytising than with intelligence gathering. Always an incorrigible networker, he inveigled his way into National Socialist student groups to urge a critical assessment of the party leadership \\"which in its practical politics [had since taking power] ... backed off from much of what it had hitherto been promising\\". He was able to distribute to his SA comrades political leaflets, prepared for him, which in his words \\"picked up on the current opinion in the SA .... and demanded to know who the real enemies were, the Communist workers or the big capitalists\\". At the beginning of August 1934, as he met a comrade by the entrance of a function they were attending at the \\"Haus Vaterland\\", a large restaurant in the Potsdamer Platz, the two of them were surrounded by four men and detained. It was immediately obvious that they had been arrested by the Gestapo and that it would not be possible to escape. The men suggested going for a discussion to a caf√© on the corner where it would be quieter, but once they had all started walking they continued on to the Gestapo main office in what was then known as Prince Abrecht Street (\\"Prinz-Albrecht-Stra√üe\\"). The small one-person cells in which each of them were placed had barely enough space for the flatbed and bucket with which they were furnished. Cr√ºger had in his back trouser pocket between eight and ten thin paper sheets of \\"illegal material\\". The bucket was empty and clean so that if he tore up the papers and threw them in it, they would undoubtedly be retrieved and examined. He had only just finished eating his papers when he heard a key in the door and a guard appeared, indicating with a nod that Cr√ºger should follow him to a larger cell where a couple of SS officers were waiting to question him., In the end, Herbert Cr√ºger was held in investigatory detention between August 1934 and July 1935. However, there is no mentioned of his having faced any sort of formal trial. In November 1935, he was able to flee to Czechoslovakia where he based himself in Prague and, starting in 1936, resumed his activities for the \\"M-Apparat\\" (Communist Party intelligence service). It was in Prague, still in 1935, that he joined the Communist Party of Germany. By 1937, he was in Barcelona, working for the intelligence services of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. He returned to Prague in 1938, but moved on again in September, presumably in connection with the incremental German occupation. By the time he arrived in Z√ºrich he had acquired a Czechoslovak identity and was using the name \\"Josef Nov√°k\\". The real Josef Nov√°k had been killed while fighting in the Spanish Civil War, identified, in the passport, as a painter. Using his Czechoslovak identity, he now embarked on the study of Art History and Archeology in Z√ºrich where he was permitted to attend lectures as a \\"guest student\\" (\\"Gasth√∂rer\\"). Both his chosen subjects were, he believed, consistent with at least one version of Josef Nov√°k's stated occupation as a \\"painter\\", and both were safely non-political. Z√ºrich had become home to many German political exiles, especially from the worlds of arts and entertainment, and his exile there enabled Cr√ºger to re-establish several former friendships and to cultivate some new ones. In March 1939 he moved out of the little guest house where he had been staying and teamed up with the actress Mathilde Danegger whom he had seen on stage when she was appearing with the Cabaret Cornichon. (A mutual friend working at the cabaret ticket office had engineered an introduction between the two after asking Cr√ºger which of the girls appearing on the stage he found most attractive.) Cr√ºger and Danegger subsequently married, probably during the mid-1940s. Through Danegger he met a number of other exiled German stage performers. Active in her support for the German Communist Party, she was well connected with various individuals who would become members of the arts and cultural establishment in the German Democratic Republic after 1949. During the early summer of 1940, rumours began to circulate that the German army was about to invade France. It seemed unlikely that the invasion would take place across the Franco-German border which was well defended, but in Switzerland there was a belief that the Germans might seek to invade either through Belgium to the north or through Switzerland to the south. A precautionary general mobilisation of the Swiss army took place in September 1939 and during the early months of 1940 many Z√ºrchers moved south and east towards Ticino and Graub√ºnden, believing the higher mountains would offer greater safety than the relatively flat central belt of the country. The German invasion of France, when it came in May/June 1940, used the northern route, but the Swiss government remained intensely nervous, and during 1940s Cr√ºger and Danegger made plans to try and emigrate to Mexico, where they had contacts or to the United States of America. But then the message came through from the party leadership that members of the German Communist Party exiled in Switzerland should stay in Switzerland. This put an end to their plans to escape across the Atlantic. During the Summer of 1940, the Swiss authorities prepared a number of labour camps: the plan was to intern all able-bodied foreign residents and set them to work in the national interest. In September 1940 Cr√ºger was sent to the Felsberger Labour Camp near Chur, in Graub√ºnden. In Felsberg he became part of a labour gang of between 120 and 150 people set to build a supposedly strategic road. Most of the gang were Jews who had escaped from Nazi Germany or Austria. A handful of the labourers had fled Germany because they were communists. Keen to regain his freedom, Cr√ºger believed he should plead the need to continue with his university studies at Z√ºrich. Characteristically, he turned to a contact. He had never been a diligent participant at the Archeology classes held by Prof. Otto Waser at the university but nevertheless sensed that Waser might be willing and able to help. He was right. Although Waser barely knew him, the professor addressed a powerful letter to the relevant government department insisting that Cr√ºger must be released as a matter of the greatest urgency in order that he might progress his studies. Waser's motivation was primarily that he was a decent man, deeply opposed to the government policy of sending away foreigners to labour camps. Waser was also a senior and respected academic figure. Switzerland was still a relatively democratic country: Waser's letter could not be simply swept under the table. Faced with the resulting political pressures the police department agreed that Cr√ºger could be released from the camp ahead of the next term, although up till then he was required to remain in detention. Nevertheless, freedom was not uninterrupted: during the years till 1945 he had to endure a further four periods in a succession of Swiss labour camps, each time for a duration of approximately three months. From 1942 Cr√ºger was able to be open about his membership of the Communist Party of Germany and 1943 he took on responsibility for publishing a Swiss version of the journal of the Moscow backed Movement for a Free Germany (\\"Bewegung Freies Deutschland\\"). During 1944 and 1945 he actively built up support for the Free Germany movement in Swiss labour camps, and held a position as Swiss Secretary for the movement till it was dissolved at the end of 1945. By that time war had ended, formally in May 1945, leaving the western two thirds of Germany divided into four military occupation zones. In January 1946 Herbert Cr√ºger returned to Germany, settling not in his former home city of Berlin, but in the US occupation zone, further to the west. Between 1946 and 1948 he served as a senior official (Regierungsrat) with responsibilities covering youth welfare in the Ministry for Labour and welfare in the newly relaunched regional state of Hesse. His position became anomalous after regional elections were held in December 1946 in which the Communist Party performed badly and following which they accordingly withdrew from the collaborative arrangements with the regional SPD which had till that point been in place. It was more than a year later before the party instructed Cr√ºger to resign from his government post, which he did on 31 January 1948. Between 1948 and 1950, Cr√ºger served as the second secretary of the regional Communist Party for W√ºrttemberg. In December 1950 he was excluded from the party, however. Sources suggest that this may have been in connection with his adherence to Strasserism twenty years earlier. It is also possible that party bosses objected to Cr√ºger's friendship with Erich Wollenberg who had managed to escape from Moscow in 1938 despite being summarily identified by the Soviet party authorities as a Trotskyite and enemy of the people. The shifting of tectonic political plates, whereby the Soviet occupation zone had been relaunched as the German Democratic Republic in October 1949, five months after the French, British and American occupation zones had been pushed together and relaunched as the German Federal Republic may also have played their part in as much as they confirmed that the division of Germany into two states allied to two militarily competing power blocks. When Herbert Cr√ºger fell from grace at the end of 1950 the party condemned him as a \\"Westemigrant\\": his decision not to settle in the Soviet occupation zone back in 1946 now counted against him. In March 1951, Cr√ºger relocated to East Germany. This was in response to the orders from the regional party authorities. He made the move despite the warnings from his friend Erich Wollenberg that within the East German political establishment he was likely to be viewed with some suspicion both on account of the time he had spent in the west and on account of his sometimes free-spirited outbursts. His wife, who during this period was appearing as a theatre actress on stages both in the west and in the east, was also permanently resident in East Germany by 1953, the border between the two halves of Germany had become progressively less porous. Between 1951 and 1953, Cr√ºger was based at Rostock undertaking an Aspirantur (post-graduate studies) in Archeology. Between 1953 and 1958, he taught social-sciences at Berlin University, initially at the faculty of veterinary medicine and subsequently in the philosophical faculty's section for dialectical and historical materialism. He was responsible for a cohort of approximately 120 students who attended his lectures and seminars associated with the course. He later wrote that he encouraged a living understanding of Marxism as a theory in need of further development, and discouraged a tendency to see Stalinism as the definitive version of it. Joseph Stalin's death on 5 March 1953 did not lead to an outburst of liberalism east of the \\"Iron Curtain\\", but in some of the quieter recesses of people's homes and in the universities there seems to have been some relaxation of the taboo on questioning aspects of Stalin's record. Three months later the East German uprising was little reported in the west and rapidly (and brutally) suppressed on the ground, but it deeply shook the confidence of the East German ruling establishment. The authorities immediately let it be known that the uprising had been a counter-revolutionary outburst, but its timing, directly after an increase of the number of hours in the standard working week, and in the context of entrenched postwar austerity, persuaded Cr√ºger that sufficient explanation for the mass action by the workers on the city streets, most notably in Berlin, did not need the support of some underlying tortuous political conspiracy theory. In July 1953, reports came through of the arrest of the longstanding Soviet Interior Minister Lavrentiy Beria which had taken place the previous month in Moscow. Even the East German mass-circulation daily newspaper, Neues Deutschland carried as a headline the term \\"schaedliche Personenkult\\" (\\"shameful personality cult\\") in connection with reports of changes at the top of the party hierarchy in Moscow, although in the article that followed the newspaper stopped short of identifying the personality by name. Cr√ºger did not think that in his own social-sciences teaching he could simply leave out an analysis of the Neues Deutschland article in particular and the role of Stalin more generally. The authorities were evidently content that Cr√ºger's teaching in the aftermath of the 1953 uprising should remain \\"under the radar\\", but his response to First Secretary Khruschev's very long \\"secret speech\\", delivered to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the final week of February 1956, which gave details of \\"Stain's crimes\\" and was informally disseminated across East Germany during 1956 and 1957, eventually triggered a political nemesis. While the East German government initially sought to downplay the entire matter, Cr√ºger was one of those who sought to engage in sometimes heated discussions about the issues raised in political meetings organized by and on behalf of the party at the university and cultural institutions with which he was involved. He urged that political discussions at the university should not be suppressed, with a particular focus on Heinrich Saar, the newly appointed director of the university institute at which he worked, who was known to have been an anti- Nazi activist and a victim of political persecution during the Hitler years. He urged an overcoming of the dogmatic resistance of the party against attempts to broaden democratic practices within it. Discussions never reached the stage of concrete irrevocable proposals, however. was also outspoken in his criticism of the re-arrest of his academic colleague Bernhard Steinberger in November 1956 and the official strategy of savage press defamation to which Steinberger was then subjected by the government. On 5 December 1956, Cr√ºger even addressed a letter to the Party Central Committee in which he argued Steinberger's case and insisted on his innocence. The latter was marked for the personal attention of the national leader (and first-party secretary), Walter Ulbricht. Steinberger was one of those who had been arrested along with Wolfgang Harich who had been promoting the advantages of socialism with a human face. In the eyes of the authorities Cr√ºger's determined attempts to defend Steinberger confirmed his role as one of those intellectuals who represented a threat to the government. At the party's Third Universities Conference, which took place between 28 February and 2 March 1958, under the slogan \\"Clarity through conflict. On the successful battles against unMarxist opinions\\", Cr√ºger and his former institute director, Heinrich Saar, were the focus of a sustained political attack. Later during March 1958 Cr√ºger himself became the last victim of a series of arrests and show trials against \\"reformist intellectuals\\".Cr√ºger, Herbert: Verschwiegene Zeiten. Vom geheimen Apparat der KPD ins Gef√§ngnis der Staatssicherheit. LinksDruck Verlag, Berlin 1990. He was arrested by officials from the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) and held in investigatory custody at the Stasi detention centre in Berlin-Hohensch√∂nhausen till December of that year. In December 1958 he faced a secret trial. Found guilty of \\"High Treason\\" (\\"schwere Staatsverrat\\") he was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. His official status as a victim of National Socialist persecution was revoked. Following conviction he was transferred to the Bautzen penitentiary. Walter Janka, Wolfgang Harich and other members of what was by now being identified as \\"the [Harich] group\\" were already being held at the facility. Meanwhile, President Pieck had died in the late summer of 1960 and Walter Ulbricht had become, in effect, head of state as well as being head of the government. By now the government nervousness that had surged after 1953 was beginning to abate. Early in 1960 Mathilde Danegger, still making frequent appearances on East German cinema and television screens and still regarded by the authorities as relatively \\"reliable\\", sent a letter to Ulbricht, pleading for mercy (ein \\"Gnadengesuch\\") on behalf of her husband. The letter was positively received. The eight-year sentence was reduced to five years. Then, having regard to the fact that two thirds of the five-year sentence had already been served, at Easter 1961 Cr√ºger was released on probation. The next year his official status as a victim of National Socialist persecution was reinstated. There was at this stage no question of returning to his former position at Berlin University. Instead, following his release, Herbert Cr√ºger was employed as a research assistant at the (East) German Academy of Sciences. Cr√ºger also worked at the Institute for Economic History as a researcher for J√ºrgen Kuczynski, an economist of such intellectual and political eminence that, remarkably, the authorities never presumed to cast aspersions on his sometimes off-beat conclusions on the East German reality of Soviet-style Marxism. Possibly because, as a longstanding member of the Communist Party of Germany, he thought it unnecessary when he immigrated in 1951, Herbert Cr√ºger had at this point still never joined East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). He did so in 1966. During the changes that assumed a new momentum in 1989 and then, in 1990, led to reunification, Herbert Cr√ºger was formally rehabilitated on 2 May 1989 through a court of Cassation decision which reversed the court decision that had led to his imprisonment in 1958/59, and which also gave legal effect to his political rehabilitation. Fittingly, just over two weeks later East Germany held its first free and fair parliamentary election. As the old SED (party) struggled to reinvent itself for a democratic future, he also lost very little time in joining its successor organisation, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). By now well past normal retirement age and based just outside Berlin he also became a member of the executive of the local K√∂nigs Wusterhausen branch of the \\"Interessenverband ehemaliger Teilnehmer am antifaschistischen Widerstand, Verfolgter des Naziregimes und Hinterbliebener, kurz Interessenverband der Verfolgten des Naziregimes\\" (IVVdN), a relaunched version of the old East German Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (\\"Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes\\" / VVN).

Background Bouteldja, the daughter of Algerian immigrants who arrived in France in the 1960s, is a founding member and spokesperson of ', a political movement which represents children of immigrants and promotes decolonial politics. Overview The chapters that make up the first half of the book deal with questions of solidarity and invite self-reflection on the part of the reader. The first chapter deals with Israel by considering Jean-Paul Sartre's views on Israel and Palestinian self-determination, and the role of Israel in debates on the French left. Its title, \\"Shoot Sartre!\\", refers to a slogan used by French nationalists during the Algerian War. The second and third chapters then discuss Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in Europe with reference to the intersection of race and religion. The fourth chapter, addressed to European Jews, asks when and how the possibility of solidarity between Jews and Arabs was foreclosed and how this phenomenon relates to intra-Jewish racism in Israel. The final three chapters address women and people of colour in Europe and argue that solidarity between people of various genders, races, religions and sexualities is necessary to overcome white supremacy and patriarchy. Bouteldja is critical of both white feminism and a variant of indigenous feminism that fails to trace the connections between masculine violence and western patriarchy. Bouteldja also criticises the doctrine of la√Øcit√© (secularism), which she sees as colluding with state racism. The anthropologist Paul Silverstein has argued that Bouteldja's argument > boils down to a simple proposition, an offer which whites (les Blancs) > cannot refuse if they wish to retain some level of bourgeois privilege and > stave off the inevitable decolonial revolution: You give us love, we'll give > you peace. Such a love is not reciprocal; it is one-sided. It requires that > whites fully accept French men and women of colour and their struggles for > freedom and equality as part and parcel of the (trans)national, decolonized > \\"greater We\\" (le grand Nous). Such a love, she specifies, is not about the > \\"heart\\" as a sentimental or spiritual figure, Islamic or otherwise. It is a > love of political transformation. Critical reception and interpretation French critics Whites, Jews, and Us was denounced by French critics as anti-Semitic, misogynistic and homophobic. Ariane P√©rez criticised Bouteldja's approach to issues of family, virility, race and religion, which she compared to those of the anti-Semitic journalist and writer √âdouard Drumont. Roland Simon accused Bouteldja of \\"tactical homophobia, latent antisemitism, sympathizing with pro-Saddam [Hussein] elements during the Gulf War, scrapping women's struggles ('for the moment'), etc.\\" Malika Amaouche, Yasmine Kateb, and L√©a Nicolas-Teboul similarly rejected Bouteldja's conflation of Jewish people with the State of Israel. The philosopher describes Whites, Jews, and Us as at times \\"powerfully political and poetic\\", and praises Bouteldja's use of the concept of race as \\"not only irreproachable but indeed salutary\\", but criticises the book on several points. First, Segr√© accuses Bouteldja of effecting a \\"Copernican revolution\\" in which Israel's right to exist is \\"the central question of politics\\" and one's position on Israel is prioritised above all else, to the extent that it determines one's place \\"on one side or the other of the firing squad.\\" Segr√© argues that for Bouteldja \\"the question of 'the existence of Israel' is of a symbolic universalism disproportionate to empirical reality, at least if we admit that, in the history of imperialism from 1492 to today, Zionism ‚Äì reprehensible or not ‚Äì is a mere detail.\\" Segr√© criticises Bouteldja's lack of interest in developments in Middle Eastern and North African politics that do not relate to Israel, from the Iran‚ÄìIraq War to the Syrian Civil War, and asks \\"In the heart of the whole world's 'natives' ... does the Israel question possess this extraordinary importance ‚Äì or just in the heart of the author?\\" Segr√© also characterises Bouteldja's argument about feminism as \\"tenacious ‚Äì and tenuous\\" and rejects her conclusion that feminist views amongst colonised people and people of colour are only the effects of colonial subjugation. Thomas Gu√©nol√©, a member of the left-wing party La France Insoumise, accused Bouteldja of racism and anti-Semitism. An open letter signed by Ilan Papp√©, Adi Ophir, Sylv√®re Lotringer, Ronit Lentin, Sarah Schulman, Ariella Azoulay and 14 others described Gu√©nol√©'s accusations as \\"outrageous\\" and argued that he failed to understand either racism or anti- Semitism or to acknowledge Bouteldja's conception of \\"revolutionary love\\". Ben Ratskoff described the response to Whites, Jews, and Us as a \\"veritable lynching\\" and compared it to the censorship of the literary magazine Tropiques by the Vichy government in 1943. In a letter signed by Christine Delphy, Annie Ernaux, Catherine Samary, Isabelle Stengers and 16 others, published in Le Monde in June 2017, the authors accused Bouteldja's critics of character assassination and of having failed to read Whites, Jews, and Us beyond the title \\"or at most a few misrepresented citations.\\" The authors continue: > The hatred that Houria Bouteldja arouses is commensurate with her courage. > The courage to shake up our worthy consciences when we prefer to forget what > we gain from being whites, here in the West. The courage to evoke racialised > women's day-to-day fight and decolonial feminists' struggle. A resolute and > indefinite refusal to fall into the essentialism of the \\"indigenous man,\\" > which so opportunely masks the violence everywhere done to women throughout > our societies. The authors conclude that Bouteldja's call for \\"revolutionary love\\" indicates that she does not prioritise questions of race over \\"the social question\\", and constitutes \\"a resounding appeal to break out of our exclusivisms, to abandon our separations and our barriers.\\" The Italian historian Enzo Traverso argues that accusations of anti-Semitism are based on taking passages from Whites, Jews, and Us out of context, and described the book as \\"a very personal, intimate work, a deftly written text that is also very political: it is a provocation, in the best sense of the word.\\" Traverso concurs with Bouteldja's argument that questions of race are still relevant in 21st-century France, and locates the roots of her argument in the lack of social change experienced since the 1983 March for Equality and Against Racism. Traverso criticises Bouteldja, however, for homogenising her central racial categories: he argues that her treatment of Islam as \\"a monolithic bloc\\" ignores the Arab Spring and Islamic terrorism, and so recalls Samuel P. Huntington's \\"clash of civilisations\\" thesis, while her understanding of white people as a \\"homogenous category\\" ignores the history of various definitions of whiteness in the United States and beyond, especially as they pertain to the status of Italian people. Anglophone responses Ratskoff, writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books, describes the book as \\"a passionate and poetic manifesto\\" characterised by \\"a bracing optimism, making a magnificent appeal for a metropolitan decolonial movement as a political force for liberation.\\" In Ratskoff's reading, \\"Bouteldja's vision is ... remarkably inclusive\\", implying the possibility of decolonial solidarity with Jewish Zionists and the white working class. Ratskoff nonetheless questions the absence of indigenous lesbians and indigenous queerness from Bouteldja's analysis, and suggests that her argument about the intersection of gender and racism risks reanimating \\"the patriarchal politics of midcentury civil rights movements that subordinated the double oppression faced by black women to the concerns of the black male leadership.\\" Anya Topolski describes Whites, Jews, and Us as \\"painfully confronting, for whites, feminists and Jews, and refreshingly frank.\\" Sarah Marusek characterises Bouteldja's style as \\"intimately self- reflexive, somewhere between an autoethnography and a diary\\", but asks whether her \\"poetic, honest, and self-reflexive\\" writing can appeal to readers beyond those who already agree with the book's argument. Marusek praises Bouteldja's \\"positioning of love both beyond and entrenched within the injustice of today‚Äôs world\\" and her rejection of essentialism, and concludes that the argument \\"that revolutionary love is fundamental to the decolonial project is both bold and inspired.\\" Writing in the New Humanist, Keith Kahn-Harris describes Whites, Jews, and Us as \\"A sometimes thrilling polemic,\\" but also identified \\"a frightening absolutism\\" in its treatment of Jewish people and its depiction of \\"A world in which there is only one power in the world, white western power, and where the barrier between power and powerlessness is absolute until it is breached by revolution.\\" In his introduction to Segr√©'s review, Ross Wolfe describes Whites, Jews, and Us as \\"a poetic, almost literary text, more manifesto than treatise\\". The Immanent Frame In 2018 The Immanent Frame published a forum on Whites, Jews, and Us. In his introductory essay, Jared Sexton argues that in examining the function (rather than simply evaluating the status) of the rights afforded in liberal democracies, Bouteldja's work is aligned with that of the Peruvian sociologist An√≠bal Quijano and other theorists of the \\"coloniality of power\\". In Sexton's reading, > Bouteldja is interested in returning a sense of verticality to analyses of > power, not only between the top and the bottom, the haves and the have-nots, > but also among those excluded, by differences of degree and of kind, from > the commanding heights, a stratigraphy of being and value. Sexton rejects criticisms of Bouteldja made by other indigenous feminists, according to which she is an apologist for gender violence amongst communities of colour, and argues that she instead \\"refuses to accuse [these phenomena] just as much as she refuses to excuse [them].\\" In his essay on Bouteldja's prose, Yassir Morsi argues that the form of Whites, Jews, and Us \\"is inseparable from its content\\" and praised Bouteldja's \\"raw and honest voice\\". Morsi suggests that readers \\"get caught in the rhythm of her writing even if we are not always certain of what she means.\\" He describes the book as an example of autoethnography in its incorporation of Bouteldja's personal experience and circumvention of \\"disembodied discussions of what Islam is or is not\\", and concludes that Whites, Jews, and Us is a \\"powerful, touching, dignified work\\". Santiago Slabodsky's contribution to the Immanent Frame forum foregrounds Bouteldja's discussion of the Bandung Conference. In 2018 Bouteldja and others organised a conference entitled \\"Bandung of the North\\", which sought to strengthen resistance to \\"the patterns of racial, sexual, economical, and epistemological domination developed during colonial times in colonial locations that transcended their contexts by being reproduced globally up to the present day\\"; Slabodsky suggests that Whites, Jews, and Us \\"offers us a glimpse of the Bandung of the North potentialities.\\" Slabodsky discusses the function of the book in academic contexts and finds that it \\"transcends the limits of academic inquiry\\", but this does not mean \\"that academics have the luxury of ignoring Bouteldja\\", who \\"offers tools to broaden the networks of resistance disrupting not only the criminality of the West, but also the complicities of her/our own communities\\". Jo√´lle Marelli interprets the response to Whites, Jews, and Us (in which it was perceived \\"as anti-white, anti-Semitic, sexist, and homophobic\\") as in keeping with a broader French rejection of communautarisme (communitarianism) as signalling \\"political immaturity\\". Marelli reads Bouteldja alongside debates on these themes in the work of Hannah Arendt, James Baldwin and Gershom Scholem, and concludes that the invocation of \\"revolutionary love\\" found in Whites, Jews, and Us as well as in works by Baldwin and C. L. R. James constitutes (in Jacques Ranci√®re's terminology) \\"the horizon of a new political subjectivation.\\" In an expanded version of the same piece in b2o: an online journal, Marelli addressed the controversy surrounding the book in greater depth, and described criticisms of the book as \\"mired in the felt need to attend to prejudices entertained and nourished by mainstream media against what the Indig√®nes de la R√©publique ... stand for.\\" Marelli continues: \\"Any attempt to show that equality doesn‚Äôt exist in France causes malicious backlash. Any endeavour to think about race, religion, and gender in terms that vary from the prescribed institutional frameworks ... is an opportunity for abuse.\\" Marelli argues that revolutionary love \\"is not the demand for love, nor is it 'Christian love', nor loving one's neighbor nor one's enemy.\\" Instead, \\"It is a disidentifying transformation, a political subjectification that operates at the moment where equality is affirmed.\\" Concluding, Marelli identifies as \\"the book's most precious lesson\\" the insight > that every member of a pariah group must not only choose between being a > rebel and being 'responsible for his/her own oppression', but must also find > the means to escape from the affective negativity engendered by his/her > condition. To that end there are only two possible paths: revolutionary > violence or revolutionary love. Nazia Kazi notes that Bouteldja speaks from a liminal position, \\"between black and white, global north and south, innocence and guilt.\\" Kazi reads Whites, Jews, and Us as a challenge to dominant conceptions of white supremacy, which Kazi argues Bouteldja understands as a relational concept rather than an objective one: \\"Whiteness and blackness only exist in their relation to one another and to processes of capitalist exploitation and imperialist violence.\\" Kazi argues that the controversy around the book occurred \\"because it was unapologetic, marked with none of the lilting softness demanded of us when we speak about race, marked with no quarter for white fragility nor concern for whom it might offend.\\" Concluding, Kazi interprets Bouteldja's concept of \\"revolutionary love\\" \\"as an invitation to whites to practice the solidarity of Jean Genet and, I would add, of John Brown and the Young Patriots.\\" Joshua Dubler reads Whites, Jews, and Us in terms of its categories of \\"we\\" and \\"you\\", or self and other, neither of which \\"is unitary or discrete.\\" The porosity of these categories, in Dubler's reading, is a political necessity and is constitutive of \\"revolutionary love\\". Dubler praises Bouteldja's \\"joyful spirit\\" and the \\"mischievous fashion\\" in which the book's argument is articulated, and argues that \\"Whites, Jews, and Us shows the reader an exceedingly good time.\\" Dubler proclaims his allegiance to Bouteldja's \\"we\\", but questions her two \\"yous\\" (\\"whites\\" and \\"Jews\\"), who, he argues, are both included via a demand for solidarity, and excluded. Dubler argues that in the American context, \\"The hailing of white people as white people\\" has lost its political resonance, as > To heed the call is to establish one's bona fides as the exception to the > rule. Those who embrace these objectifications find absolution in their > confession, and thereby exempt themselves from the charge. The relevant > white people are always to be found elsewhere. To put it crudely: for years > now, my social media feeds have been full of white people railing against > \\"white people.\\" Dubler asks whether Bouteldja's representation of Jewish people as obsequious \\"internal others\\" who have accepted Zionism despite it cutting against Jewish tradition unduly ignores the perspectives of non-Zionist Jews. \\"Instead of surrendering Judaism to Holocaust covetousness, Zionism, and [Anti-Defamation League]-style paranoia,\\" Dubler suggests, \\"if Bouteldja truly wants Jews to go in for revolutionary love, she would be better served by signal boosting the righteous and crazy alternative.\\" In his essay in The Immanent Frame Gil Anidjar writes: > Bouteldja ... makes a scene, wakes us up, and writes a book that ought to > affect us like a disaster, like the disasters she recalls and announces. > Bouteldja performs a remarkable gesture.... Bouteldja speaks to us like one > of those books we need, one of these books that wake us up with a blow to > the head. Anidjar argues that \\"Bouteldja undoubtedly initiates a dialogue, a different kind of dialogue, with no condescension, no unilateral, pseudo-parental pedagogy from on high\\" and suggests that the reader is obliged to formulate a response to Bouteldja's argument or to the \\"trajectory\\" out of which it emerges. Su'ad Abdul Khabeer compares Bouteldja's discussion of France to the treatment of the United States in the work of the literary critic Hortense Spillers and argues that \\"both theorists challenge the casting of colonized people as peripheral or ancillary to the modern nation-state, and to modernity as a whole.\\" Abdul Khabeer praises Bouteldja's treatment of issues specific to the African diaspora and identifies her as one of a number of thinkers who reject secularism and the idea that secularism is neutral or innocent.

Aisha finds out she is pregnant. She sees Mazhar with another girl in the mall, and Mazhar who was aware of Faizi's feelings towards her, tells on her. Aisha is forced to swear on the Quran that she does not love Faizi, but she does not as this would make her God angry. Haris kicks her out and is heart broken.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=218384 on 2019-03-05(Carangidae), collected off India. Description Pseudaxine kurra has the general morphology of all species of Pseudaxine, with an elongate body tapering towards both ends, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor triangular, asymmetrical, without extensions from body organs, disposed slightly oblique to the long axis of the body and bears 15-28 clamps, arranged in a single row. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. The extreme of the haptor carries an elongated proboscis-like process called \\"the terminal lapet\\", bearing two pair of symmetrical hooks. There are also two spherical or oval buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior, terminal funnel shaped and muscular mouth, a large and oval pharynx, a broad oesophagus and a posterior intestine that bifurcates in two lateral branches with numerous short outer and few short intercrural branches, posteriorly terminating independently behind the last testis, the right branche slightly over-reach the left. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium, a muscular and conical penis, with a basal bulb and a distal corona of 10-12 recurved hooks, a single unarmed dorsal vagina, an inverted 'U' shaped ovary, and 9-14 irregularly oval or somewhat rectangular testes post-ovarian, and extend to the base of the haptor in the intercrural space. Eggs spindle shaped, with filaments at both ends. Etymology The specific epithet kurra is derived from the generic name of the type-host Caranx kurra. Hosts and localities The yellowtail scad Atule mate is the type host of Pseudaxine kurra The type-host is the yellowtail scad Atule mate (Carangidae). The type-locality is off India.

She is the author of The List: A Week-by-Week Reckoning of Trump‚Äôs First Year (2018) and organizer of the We the People March. Early life and education Siskind was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts, to Jewish parents, Bernard Siskind and Selma Lipsky Siskind, and is the youngest of five siblings. She attended Marblehead High School, graduating in 1984. She received a BA in Economics from Cornell University in 1987, and an MBA in Finance and International Business from the NYU Stern School of Business in 1992. Career Early career As a Wall Street executive, Siskind was a pioneer and expert in the distressed debt trading market. She became the first female Managing Director at Wasserstein Perella & Co. in 1996, at the age of 31, and later ran trading departments at Morgan Stanley and Imperial Capital, where she was also a partner. Siskind worked 20 years on Wall Street before retiring in 2006. The New Agenda and political activism Siskind was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton during the 2008 United States presidential election cycle, having previously supported Clinton's re-election bid to the United States Senate, and having taken her daughter to meet Clinton at an event in 2006. Siskind has drawn criticism from liberals for voting for John McCain over Barack Obama. In August 2008, Siskind co-founded The New Agenda in her living room with 30 Hillary Clinton supporters who alleged sexism and misogyny were at play during the 2008 election. The New Agenda is a non-profit organization \\"dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls by bringing about systemic change in the media, at the workplace, at school and at home\\". she is president of the organization. It focuses on issues that affect the success of women, including pay discrimination, sexual assault and sexual harassment. Siskind was reported to be one of the earliest supporters of the Me Too movement, sparked by a tweet from Alyssa Milano on October 15, 2017, for which Siskind tweeted her own support within the first hundred minutes. In October 2018, in the days following the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Siskind posted on Facebook that she was organizing an anti-hate vigil in her Westchester County community. After a local newspaper ran a story about it, Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and his family, who lived in the nearby community of Larchmont, New York, appeared at the Siskind's door without invitation or forewarning; she called the police. *Weill, Kelly (13 November 2018) \\"Gavin McInnes Whines His Fellow Rich Neighbors Don‚Äôt Like Him\\" The Daily Beast *Rom, Gabriel (29 October 2018) \\"Amy Siskind warns that far-right leader Gavin McInnes lives here\\" The Journal News *Campbell, Andy (4 January 2019) \\"Proud Boys Founder Gavin McInnes Can Get Back To Antifa After He Battles His Neighbors\\" HuffPost *Doughtery, Owen (4 January 2019) \\"Proud Boys founder asked neighbors to take down anti-hate signs: report\\" The Hill *Sommer, Will (4 January 2019) \\"Gavin McInnes Writes Letters to Neighbors to Take Down Anti-Hate Signs\\" The Daily Beast *Campbell, Andy (8 January 2019)\\"Gavin McInnes‚Äô Wife Threatens Neighbors Over ‚ÄòHate Has No Home Here‚Äô Signs\\" HuffPost The List In November 2016, Siskind started keeping a weekly list of not-normal events of the Trump administration, and posting the lists on social media. Siskind indicated that she did not intend to merely recite normal political disputes, but to catalogue \\"things that are uncharacteristic of our democracy\\". In September 2017, she was named in Politico's 2017 \\"Politico 50\\". In March 2018 she compiled the first year of weekly lists and published them as The List: A Week-by-Week Reckoning of Trump's First Year. In June 2018, Siskind started The Weekly List podcast to accompany the lists; writing in Forbes in July 2018, Jo Piazza listed this as one of the \\"Podcasts Created by Women You Need to Be Listening To Right Now\\". In July 2017, the United States Library of Congress began archiving her weekly reports. Siskind acknowledged in an interview the following year that a downside of taking such a highly public stance is that \\"I can tweet things that are inarticulate and be attacked for months and get death threats\\". In 2018, The List: A Week-by-Week Reckoning of Trump's First Year was called one of the best books of 2018 by Carlos Lozada of The Washington Post. Her podcast was also recognized by Marie Claire in 2019. Siskind also organized the 2019 We the People March, a national march advertised as an event to remind elected officials that they work for the American people. The march took place on September 21, 2019 in Washington D.C. with others in various cities across the United States. Personal life Siskind lives in Westchester County, New York with her two children. She is openly lesbian.

Migapulle Arachchi, the son of Periye Pillai Arachchi, with the aid of the Portuguese, raised a revolt against Cankili II and drove him to Kayts in August-September 1618. Cankili II sought help from Raghunatha Nayak, the king of Thanjavur Nayak. Raghunatha Nayak sent a troop of 5000 men under the command of Varunakulattan who put down the uprising.

For example, in a 2014 exhibition at Recess Art, Mutiti drew for inspiration from the space of an African hair braiding salon, as it might be found in New York City or Harare. Mutiti recreated aesthetic markers such as \\"walls painted in acid green or bright orange, magazine cut outs of celebrities, hair product models, flyers and posters from evangelical churches... [and] the ubiquitous small black television set on top of a cabinet playing Nollywood movies.\\" Mutiti's interests extend from the aesthetics of hair salons to the forms of community and exchange that take place in them.

His years-long and ultimately unsuccessful search for his son led him to become a human rights defender. He committed suicide in 1992. In 1963 Conte was elected vice president. He wrote many articles, perhaps most importantly one in which he developed the theory of global parallelism, which he cowrote with Emilio Mignone, and presented at the Colloquium of Paris. Recognition The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights held a ceremony to commemorate the events that took place at the former ESMA, with Horacio Verbitsky (journalist and president of CELS); Estela de Carlotto (president of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo), Marta V√°zquez (member of Mothers L√≠nea Fundadora), Graciela Lois (supporter of Relatives of Disappeared and Detained for Political Reasons), and Aldo Etchegoyen (co-president of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights).

A mixed commercial and residential area, it lies on the north bank of the Arkansas River in the northwestern part of the city. History McLean House (2015) In 1908, former Wichita mayor and prominent banker Ben McLean purchased northwest of the city for farming. Upon his death in 1929, the farm was parceled out among his heirs, including his son Drew and daughter-in-law Elizabeth Mabry- McLean. Wichita annexed the farm in 1950, and Elizabeth platted her and her husband‚Äôs portion for development as a residential neighborhood. A graduate of the National Academy of Design, she oversaw the landscaping, street layout, and housing design of the development. The neighborhood was named Benjamin Hills in honor of her son, Ben McLean II, who had been killed in action at the Battle of the Bulge. In 1956, Elizabeth donated the land for McLean Elementary School and had the McLean House, a pink marble ranch-style house she designed with Wichita architect Glenn E. Benedick, built in Benjamin Hills on North McLean Boulevard. Elizabeth continued to oversee development of the neighborhood following her husband‚Äôs death in 1965 and lived in the McLean House until her death in 2000. Geography Benjamin Hills is located at (37.729722, -97.370556) at an elevation of .

Indies Trader and is known as \\"surfing's most iconic boat captain\\".  Early life  Martin Daly was born on the northern beaches of Sydney, but moved to Queensland at age 11 where surfing isn't possible. By age 16, he left home and lived in New Zealand. By 1981, he left to South East Asia doing marine diving jobs. In 1981, he worked with friends Jeff Chitty and Ross Hannon, and they began working with a salvage diver and boat captain, Dave Barnett, on his boat The Rader.  Surf Exploration   One Palm Point Discovery  In April 1983, Martin and his friends Jeff Chitty, Ross Hannon, Robert Wilson, and Wylie convinced Dave Barnett to explore some potential surf breaks aboard The Rader, and found waves at Painatan, in Sunda, Indonesia. Martin paddled out alone and, and caught the first known wave at the surf break. They called it One Palm Point, because there was one palm tree in front of the line where surfers would take off.  The M.V. Indies Trader  In 1990, with Dave Barnett's boat, The Rader, falling into disrepair, and trouble with local authorities off of disputes of treasure the crew found, Martin borrowed money from everyone he could, and purchased The Rader from Dave Barnett. Renaming a boat is known as bad-luck to sailors, so he kept the original Rader name, by adding Indies T-Rader. He painted it blue to disguise it, and was the now registered as the M.V. Indies Trader.  Lance's Right  In 1991, Lance Knight hired a local man in a canoe to explore the Mentawai Island chain, and found a surf break. After a couple weeks of surfing it alone, Martin Daly and the Indies Trader stumbled upon Lance, and Martin named the break \\"Lance's Right\\" after him. One of the crew had betamax video footage of this encounter, was not shown publicly until 2009.  The Quiksilver Crossing  Supported by the United Nations, Quiksilver organized a seven-year trip around the world, discovering new surf breaks, as well as checking on the coral health around the globe. The Crossing has been heralded as one of the most groundbreaking moments in surf history. The voyage took them to 56 countries and 26 states and four territories, they discovered more than 115 new surf breaks, as well as going over 160,000 nautical miles, the equivalent of circumnavigating the world 8 times.

History  The second most used category of bombs was the SD series which were high-explosive bombs but with thicker casings which meant their charge to weight ratio was only 30 to 40% of their total weight. At first glance, they were difficult to distinguish from the SC series of bombs, but the two series were color-coded the SC series having yellow tail stripes, while the SD series had red tail stripes. Bombs in this series were the SD 1, SD 1 FRZ, SD 2, SD 10 A, SD 10 FRZ, SD 10 C, SD 15, SD 50, SD 70, SD 250, SD 500, SD 1400, and SD 1700. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The SD series was used primarily in two roles that were determined by the type of fuze and accessories fitted to the bomb. The first was as a fragmentation bomb with instantaneous fuze and when the bombs exploded above ground the case created large fragments which would kill enemy personnel and destroy unarmored vehicles. The second role was as a general- purpose or armor-piercing role. In this role, the bombs were fitted with a time delay fuze which detonated the bomb after it had pierced a target destroying it with a combination of its blast and fragments.  Design  The body was of one-piece forged steel construction which was filled through the base and was fitted with a magnesium alloy 4 finned tail with a cylindrical strut. Around the nose of the bomb was a kopfring - a metal ring, triangular in cross section, designed to prevent ground penetration or to stop forward momentum when hitting water. A single transverse fuze was located in the middle of the body and two central exploder tubes ran the length of the bomb through the Amatol or TNT filling. The SD 1700 was horizontally suspended by an H-Type suspension lug in a bomb bay or fuselage hardpoint. The bombs were either painted black or sky blue with red stripes on the tail.
